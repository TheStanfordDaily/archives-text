# How Effective Will C15 Be?
## 
### PATRICK McMAHON 
The ASSU Legislature ap
pointed a diverse group of six
students to the Committee of 15
(Cl 5) last Thursday evening,
which may impair the Commit
tee's effectiveness in meeting
student demands.
C-15, a student-faculty-admin
istration negotiating body, has
dealt in the past with open
house hours, liquor regulations,
and judicial reorganization. It is
the highest level arbitrating
body in the University and
makes recommendations to the
President, the Academic Senate,
and the ASSU Legislature
(LASSU).
The issues taken up by the
Committee in the past have been

demands for progressive change,
consistently propounded by left
ist students and student groups
on campus.
Success Due To Students
The success of Cl 5 in reach
ing equitable solutions is due in
great measure to the students
on the Committee who also be
lieve in and push for these re
forms.
As negotiators, liberal and
leftist students in the past toge
ther with sympathetic faculty
members and administrators
managed to keep University pol
icy tolerable to campus activists,
preventing more militant con
frontation.
The present makeup, deter
mined by LASSU Thursday, in
dicates the students on Cl 5 will
not be representative of the stu
dents who are demanding radi
cal changes in the University.
One Leftist
Only one member has actively
associated himself with such
radical demands: Michael Wein
stein, last year's LASSU speak
er and a leader in the spring sit
in.
In contrast is Eckhard Schultz,
graduate student in electrical
engineering. He was militantly
opposed to last spring's sit-in
and a prime mover in recent
anti-coercion voting.
The almost total absence of
active liberal-leftist students
may result in an erosion of con

fidence in the Committee as an
arbitrating body by militant stu
dents, who may view C-15 as
having little support for them
from which to negotiate.
More Students
The change in makeup of stu
dents on the Committee comes
at a time when Cl 5 student rep
resentation is increased. In the
past, there were five administra
tors, faculty, and students on the
committee. Recently, Cl 5 mem
bership was redistributed to
have six faculty, six students,
and three administrators.
The issue of judicial reform
which has been controversial for
several years will be an impor
tant concern for Cl 5 again this
year because of the student vote
to accept last year's agreement
only until March 1, 1969.
Students on the Committee
last spring could not gain agree
ment with the other members of
Cl 5, and three of them abstained
on the final vote.
The lack of a stronger voice
for students in the new compro
mise may mean the student
body will reject the Cl 5 propo
sal and return campus judicial
procedures to chaos. The broad
spectrum of viewpoints among
the students leaves a stronger
student compromise in doubt.
As one student said, "How
can you compromise after this
bogus compromise?"
