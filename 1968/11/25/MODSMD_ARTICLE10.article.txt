# Merry-Go-Round
## President's Analysis 
### Drew Pearson 
Several of my editors have
been complaining that I should
have written the account of Mr.
Nixon's psychotherapeutic treat
ments in the column before the
election, not given it after the
election at the National Press
Club.
Under the circumstances, I
owe them and my readers an ex
planation. It is true as some
have pointed out that if this had
been published before the elec
tion the outcome might have
been different. The problem of
news confirmation and its timing
is exactly what I was trying to
illustrate at the Press Club
luncheon.
I told of the report that kept
cropping up during the cam
paign that Mr. Nixon when Vice
President had undergone psychi
atric treatments, and that finally
I had obtained the name of his
doctor, Arnold Hutschnecker of
New York, and had called him
on Oct. 29.
I told the doctor I understood
he had been giving Mr. Nixon
psychiatric treatments and had
been concerned as to whether
his former patient was the right
man to have his finger on the
nuclear trigger.
Doctor Confirms
Dr. Hutschnecker confirmed
that he had treated Mr. Nixon
and asked me to call back at
4 p.m.
I immediately asked Jack An
derson, my associate, to tele
phone Nixrn's communications
director, Herbert Klein, tell him
that we had information that

Nixon had received psychiatric
treatments from Dr. Hut
schnecker and ask for comment.
Klein flatly denied that Nixon
had ever consulted a psychi
atrist.
At 4 p.m. I telephoned Dr.
Hutscchnecker a second time.
This time he stated that he had
treated Mr. Nixon for a brief
period when he was Vice Presi
dent but only for problems in
volving internal medicine.
In view of Dr. Hutschnecker's
statement, I killed the story I
had written on Mr. Nixon.
Subsequently, toward the very
end of the campaign, further in
formation came to my attention.
Nixon Nerves
We learned from one of Dr.
Hutschnecker's friends that he
had definitely been concerned
about Nixon's reaction under
pressure; second, that he had re
ceived a call from Mr. Nixon in
1960 requesting him to come to
Washington for consultation.
According to the dates given me
by Hutschn'-cker, this was long
after he claimed to have stopped
treating Nixon. In addition, I
was told by Dr. Hutschnecker's
receptionist that she had handled
a call from Nixon as late as
1961.
Some of this information, I
admit, was learned during the
closing days of the campaign,
and I could have published it at
the last minute. But, as I ex
plained at the Press Club lunch
eon, I decided it was unfair to
use it so late. It was one of those
difficult decisions a newspaper
man has to make.

However, now that the hectic
rush of the campaign is over, I
continue to be convinced that a
President or candidate for Pres
ident should make all the facts
public regarding his health,
mental or otherwise, just as
Dwight D. Eisenhower did after
his heart attack; and secondly
that thete shou'd be no cover
ing up of the facts or blatant
denials such as issued by Ron
Ziegler, Nixon's press secretary.
Credibility Gap
This second issue involves the
credibility gap.
Mr. Nixon campaigned for
president partly on the issue of
the credibility gap, claiming that
the American people has been
deceived and misinformed by the
Johnson Administration. The is
sue is important. The American
people are entitled to know the
truth. But is Mr. Nixon now go
ing to turn around and deceive
the American people himself?
Mr. Ziegler says not. Yet he
stated that what I said about
Nixon's psychotheraputic treat
ments was "totally untrue, most
of his columns are."
Examine Facts
Let's examine the facts, there
fore to see who is telling the
truth.
First we have private state
ments of several patients of Dr.
Arnold Hutschnecker of 829
Park Ave., New York, that they
were undergoing psychotherapy
at the same time Nixon was and
that Dr. Hutschnecker told them
Vice President Nixon was re
ceiving similar treatments.
One patient, a commercial
photographer, of 242 E. 60th St.,
New York, has authorized me to
quote him as saying: "I was a
patient of Dr. Hutschnecker for
four and a half years, during
much of which time Vice Presi
dent Nixon was also a patient.
"It was common knowledge
that Mr. Nixon was receiving
psychotheraputic treatments and
the doctor expressed some con
cern that such a man should
occupy the important post of
vice president."
Harriet Van Horne writing
sympathetically about Nixon,
but critically about the credi
bility gap, also states:
"The story devised by the Nix
on staff said that Mr. Nixon had
consulted Dr. Hutschnecker in
the years before the doctor had
switched from internal medicine
to psychiatry. The dates cited
were 1952 and 1956."
Miss Van Horne, who points
out that visiting a psychiatrist is
nothing phenomenal, calls the
Nixon staff "Stoneheads" and
describes "their tortured cover
story" as "stupid and clumsy,"
two points with which I agree.
It is obvious that Mr. Nixon
has not been as frank as Presi
dent Eisenhower was after he
suffered his heart attack in 1955.
It would also appear that Mr.
Nixon is getting off to a bad
start regarding the credibility
gap which he has criticised in
the past.
