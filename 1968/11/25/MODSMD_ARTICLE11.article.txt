# BIG GAME DYING
## 
### 
Big Game has come and gone, another year's maudlin tribute
to a Stanford that will never be again.
Hackneyed slogans and worn-out traditions have refused to
die, providing Stanford alumni with exactly the same experience
year after year. "Beat Cal," "Oskie Bites," irrational dislike for
our friends across the Bay, the bonfire, The Axe, the band, the
pom-pon sex symbols in short skirts . . . it's all part of the mys
tique that draws alumni hearts and dollars back to their uni
versity.
But for us, students in 1968, Big Game and all it stood for is
dead. Surely, there are still students who do the playing, cheer
ing, and singing. There are students who sell buttons, revere The
Axe, dislike Berkeleyites, and find Big Game the highlight of
their year at Stanford.
However, the rest of us — even the majority of us — find the
anachronisms of an age gone by to be a pitiable sight. Witness
the lower attendance and distinct lack of excitement at Friday's
bonfire rally, the smaller bonfire that stems from plain lack of
interest among freshmen, and the lack of enthusiasm on the part
of Saturday's crowd for the "spirit" of the event — as distin
guished from the game itself.
It should be clear to Axe Command Cardinals' Board that an
evolution of Big Game is essential if it is to survive as the atti
tudes of students change.
