# STUDENT TRUSTEE
## 
### 
Vanderbilt University has decided to elect a recent graduate
to its Board of Trustees. This year, the Board will pick a mem
ber of the senior class, who will serve on the body for four years.
What is possibly the most important effect of the change was
spelled out by the school's chancellor, Alexander Heard, who
said, "The move will bring the trustees close to the contemporary
life of the campus."
Here at Stanford, students have criticized the Trustees igno
rance and lack of understanding of student viewpoints.
The Trustees did make an effort to tune in to students when

they visited dorms earlier this quarter. But when they are mak
ing policy decisions, the only voices they hear are those of fellow
Board members. Student opinion is usually heard only as a faint
echo, if at all.
We are encouraged by the Trustees' meeting last Thursday
at which student members of the University's budget committee
discussed the University's money problems with two committees
of the Board of Trustees.
But something in the spirit of Vanderbilt's innovation is needed
here. It need not be a recent graduate. An undergrad or graduate
student serving for a shorter term might do as well or better.
We strongly urge the Board to consider such a moveâ€”for the
Trustee's sake, and for the sake of the University.
