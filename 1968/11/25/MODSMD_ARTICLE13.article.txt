# COERCION
## 
### 
The position paper written recently by Profs. Stephen Kline
and Edwin Good sets up an outline for reaction to crises in the
University. They ask that a consensus be reached between the
three constituencies of the University, that coercive tactics be
foresworn as a method of achieving change, and that inflama
tory language also be given up by members of the community
trying to work out problems.
It seems to us that the professors are telling potential disrup
tors of the University to be nice. We wonder if any of them are
listening.
Though the guidelines set up by Kline and Good are not meant
to be inflexible, unalterable rules for posterity, the very concept
of guidelines for future and yet unforeseen challenges to the
status quo is unreasonable. The different circumstances of recent
Stanford crises should make it fairly clear that no set of guide
lines can be used in all situations.
Consensus-seeking is not in itself good or bad, in our view.
Sometimes, as in the crisis following Martin King's death, quick
action is much more important than broad consultation. At other
times, the reverse might be true.
The University should do more than seek to avoid disruption.
An effort must be made to hold on to human values. This effort
can be as easily stifled by tedious consultations as by precipitous
or violent action.
