### PAUL RUPERT 
I have been wanting to write
the following article for a long
time. Matters of personal feel
ings, old debts, political expedi
ency and a number of other
things have kept me from it,
but I guess vacation is almost
here and who knows when I'll be
busted and won't have to worry
about such things.
I went to hear Big Black yes
terday afternoon with some
friends. Those who didn't take
Johnie Scott's advice and go,
really blew it. Most conspicuous
in their absence as has been the
case at every event I have been
to this quarter, were the faculty.
With a very few exceptions,
those who are commissioned to
instruct us in the various forms
of the truth seldom show up at
a student-initiated function. The
reasons, I am sure, are num
erous. I am willing to bet that
they are almost as good as the
reasons most students would
throw out: busy schedule, a
paper to write, people to see.
I suppose I see only a very
small, politically homogeneous
group of people, although I try
to see as many people as I can.
But everyone I have seen this
quarter whether old friend or
new acquaintance, student or
faculty member, has been in a
tremendous state of confusion.
Many are freshmen and soph
omores, who still hope they will
figure out what to do at Stan
ford. Others are near gradua
tion, wondering if they can find
out at graduate school. Some
of the faculty people lament the
fact that they don't have more
time to read, because their
courses are beginning to sound
a bit lame.
I can't help but think that the
problem with trying to learn at
the university is that most of the
people there have nothing to
say. That is not to say that they
aren't experts of one sort or

another, that they won't train
you in academic apprenticeship,
that they can't socialize you or
cogently present the dominant
ideology.
It is to say that if those things
don't interest you, if you are in
terested in finding out how to
make out in it while changing it,
then you are pi'obably in the
wrong place.
Which is not to say that uni
versities can't be centers of criti
cal thought, can't have faculties
whose lives are as admirable as
their words, whose commitment
to humanity drives them outside
the university to forceful action.
It is merely to say that most
American universities don't.
Stanford included.
It may be by accident, al
though I doubt it. Certain kinds
of action in the public forum are
just too much for the school to
take; others are just socially
unacceptable. Work loads are
such that teachers can't do all
the things they would like. The
faculty are offered $30-70,000
homes which hardly help them
keep in constant contact with the
so-called 'real world'. And the
list goes on and on.
I suspect we could read the
minds of some faculty people
now: "If you don't like it, why
don't you get out." A trustee

told me that once. I asked him
if he'd split my jail time with me
when I refused induction.
I explained that I was trapped
in his university, or one remark
ably like it. And I suspect that
most of the people reading this
column are trapped here. And
those who can leave have no
place to go. For where do you
find the answers if not here?
I guess what you do is stay
here, in most cases, try to
change it a bit, try to re-order
its priorities. You hold meetings,
stage rallies, run your own sem
inars and do what you canâ€”all
while trying to keep your schol
arship or just making it or hold
ing your grades for graduate
school.

But when at each function, at
each effort to shed some light on
the problems of poverty, racism,
war, there is little response from
the faculty, you expect it. But
it also makes you sick.
And increasingly you find
yourself unable to listen to much
more of what they have to say.
You wonder what they're doing
and what they think they are
doing. And then a goodly num
ber come out against coercion,
and you try not to get angry.
It's no easy proposition, keep
ing your head together in the
university. No wonder so many
people quietly drop out. And the
rest just get bored, and tired,
and go on.
