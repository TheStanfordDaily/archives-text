# It's No Joke

Thanksgiving Day is the one
national holiday when the
thoughts of the American citi
zenry should be focused upon
justice for the original Ameri
cans. Indeed we will see pictures
of that first Thanksgiving din
ner - with the pilgrims wearing
knickers and the Indians wear
ing hardly anything. And pious
platitudes will be mouthed about
being thankful for the abund
ance of the land and the Divine
guidance which enabled the first
immigrants to survive the rig
ors of a harsh winter.
But the current needs of the
Indian will slip by unnoticed,
even on Thanksgiving Day which
is a holiday stolen from him. The
original Thanksgiving Day was
a time of peace, brotherhood and
understanding. It was a time of
sitting at the table together and
sharing the gifts of nature. It
was the prelude to the shocking
later history when the white man
would violently seize the Indian's
land and occupy a territory
which rightfully belonged to the
Indian.
This violent history continues
until the present moment. Vio
lence to the human dignity of

the Indian is exemplified by
American's continued violation
of treaties, as well as the prac
tice of corralling the mass of
the Indian population on reser
vations where disease, inferior
housing and education, unem
ployment and suicide are the
order of the day.
It is nothing short of amazing
that the Indian has remained pa
tiently nonviolent since his de
feat at the hands of the white
man's violence. Since the first
civil disorders in the black ghet
tos of America, the cry has been
raised that the government
should not reward violence.
Perhaps the government would
not be in the current predica
ment of being forced to reward
violence if it would take the ini
tiative of rewarding nonviolence.
But the tragic history of Ameri
ca is that she only understands
violence.
It was the violence of the
Thanksgiving dinner table which
made me a vegetarian. One
Thanksgiving Day, as I was
.just about to carve the turkey,
I had a strange thought. It oc
curred to me that there might
be some beings on a planet who
are as intelligent when compared

with us as we are compared to
turkeys.
I even had visions of these be
ings from another planet going
to the butcher shop with their
meat list. It was a shocking
thought to visualize an order,
"Give me a half-dozen Oriental
knees, two Caucasian feet and
twelve fresh black lips."
As I began to reflect about
the subject of killing, I realized
there is no justification for kill
ing animals for food. The day
I decide that I must have a piece
of steak to nourish my body, I
will also give the cow the same
right to nourish herself on hu
man beings.
America's first really legiti
mate Thanksgiving Day will
come when there is a national
recognition that life holds a spe
cial priority in the natural order
America might not suddenly be
come a vegetarian nation, bill
there would certainly be a gen
eral revulsion to burning babies
in Vietnam, to continuing to cje
humanize the life potential pf
Indian, black and Puerto Rican
children, to the barbarous prac
tice of capital punishment and
to giving property a higher vaQ-i
ation than human life.
