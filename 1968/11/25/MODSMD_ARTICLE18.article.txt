# Graduate Student Association:
## 'Grads Get Least Attention' 
### BARRY ASKINAS 
Editor's Note: Barry Askinas
is Chairman of the ASSU Grad
uate Student Association.
For too long graduate educa
cation has received the least at
tention from the university in its
attempts at reform.
The AAUP has submitted a
program for university govern
ance which if implemented
would truly bring students and
faculty into the decision making
process at all levels. SES has
designed a curricula for under
graduate education, which if put
into effect would make Stanford
one of the most exciting places
in this country for undergrad
uates. The Dean of Students Of
fice has already begun to imple
ment an undergraduate resi
dence program which has turned
unfriendly dormitories into
warm and relaxing places where
education continues rather than
suffocates. Even the archaic
Food Service is finally being in
vestigated by a University Com
mittee.
Yet while the professional
schools at Stanford are models
for professional education in
America, much of the more tra
ditional graduate areas at Stan
ford continue to flounder in
boredom and irrelevance.
The Graduate Student Associ
ation has presented to the uni
versity a program for action
which we feel would improve the
quality of graduate education
and graduate student life at
Stanford. It might be an exag
geration to call graduate educa
tion in America a total failure,
yet, while Stanford's profession
al schools are setting an ex
ample of innovation and rele
vance for the rest of the country
to follow, in the more traditional
areas of graduate education,
Stanford is retreating from the
edge of greatness at a rapid rate.
We have called upon the uni
versity to take steps to accomp
lish the following goals:
1. Make inex|>eiisive and ade
quate housing available to ail
graduate students.
Stanford houses 68% of its
undergraduates but only 22%
of its graduate students. With
a vacancy rate in Santa Clara
County of .4% (1 unit in 250),
the need for more housing has
reached crisis proportions. A
recent editorial in the Palo Alto
Times criticized Stanford for in
creasing admissions without
having begun construction for
housing more students.
2. Build a Graduate Student
Center.
. Faculty have their club; un
dergraduates their union; for
eign students their center.
Where can graduates meet one
another?
Steps could be taken now to
open a Coffee House in the base
ment of one of the Escondido
Village high-rise apartments. In
addition, a swimming pool could
be constructed in Escondido Vil
lage, open to all graduate stu
dents and their guests.

3. Conduct a thorough investi
gation of Graduate Education at
Stanford.
Graduate education in the
United States is a very ineffici
ent process, if not a disaster,
especially in the traditional aca
demic disciplines. The drop-out
rate for students who begin
study for a Ph.D. at Stanford is
about two-thirds. This compares
with a drop-out rate of about
four-fifths in the United States
as a whole. Stanford might take
a self-congratulatory attitude
and continue to waste millions
of dollars (It costs $120,000 to
$180,000 to produce a Ph.D.
here) or take steps now to see
what is right and wrong about
graduate education and set an
example for the rest of Ameri
ca's educational institutions in
medical education.
We would hope for an admini
stration-financed study on the
scale of SES (the Study of Ed
ucation at Stanford), conducted
under the auspices of the Grad
uate Student Association and the
Academic Senate. In its brief
examination (And, it was brief!),
SES concentrated on undergrad
uate problems. When they chose
to look at graduate education,
they systematically contacted
only departmental chairmen.
Nonetheless, SES did suggest
some interesting changes which
should now be investigated and
perhaps implemented. For ex
ample, the February 26th letter
to departmental chairmen reads,
"It seems inconsistent for Stan
ford to devote large amounts of
time and energy to the recruit
ment of undergraduate students,
but almost none to the recruit
ment of graduates."
4. Develop programs to com
municate to students even be
fore they apply, what graduate
work is all about
So much unnecessary frustra
tion and confusion arises out of
ignorance and there is little
room in today's programs to
allow new graduate students to
make mistakes or to change
their minds.
The Graduate Student Associ
ation has arranged for an Orien
tation Program for new grad
uate students beginning with
1969-70 to be administered
through the I-Center, which now
runs a very successful program
for foreign students, 80% of
whom are graduate students,
and financed by the administra
tion (See attached tentative bud
get in the Appendix). While
some departments have designed
programs for their new students
in the past, others have done
nothing. We want to remedy
that. A committee of students,
faculty, and administrators will
begin meeting next quarter to
plan a detailed orientation pro
gram.
The Bowman Alumni House
and the Dean of the Graduate
Division have put forth a plan
to make use of alumni from
Stanford graduate schools to see
prospective applicants before

they apply and/or after they are
accepted to Stanford. This pre
orientation program will not be
inexpensive, but in the long run
should save much human and
financial waste.
The Graduate Student Associ
ation suggests the development
of a De-Processing Program for
students who leave without com
pleting a degree. We would learn
a great deal about what is wrong
with graduate education; make
some people feel better about
Stanford; and perhaps change
some students' attitudes toward
leaving.
5. More University Staff Con
cerned About Graduate Students
There are countless university
personnel concerned with under
graduate student life and educa
tion. There are very few con
cerned with graduate student
life, especially in the Humanities
and Sciences. Something is
wrong with the notion that a
college senior may need some at
tention from time to time, but
three months after graduation,
when he becomes a graduate
student, he is now mature
enough and wise enough to sink
or swim in an environment
which is quite different from his
undergraduate experience. (On
the surface the deceptive simil
arities to undergraduate educa
tion often lead the new graduate
student into trouble. It is exactly
this type of problem that can be
examined in our proposed Orien
tation Program.)
We see an immediate need for
a Dean of Graduate Students in
the School of Humanities and
Sciences. This person could
study admissions policy for
Ph.D. programs, help design
orientation, pre-orientation, and
de-processing programs, and
help recruit minority students
for graduate education. In addi
tion, the Dean or others on his
staff, could counsel graduate
students when they encounter
problems which cannot or have
not been handled at a depart
mental level.
Second, we see a need for a
co-ordinator or graduate stu
dent organizations. This individ
ual would serve both as an exec
utive secretary for key graduate
student organizations and as a
resource person to help design
and implement programs to
bring graduate students from
different departments and
schools together for both intel
lectual and social purposes.
6. Make use of graduate stu
dents as Teaching Fellows.
Stanford would appoint ad
vanced graduate students as
regular faculty members. This
would increase the ratio of fac
ulty to students, and give sel
ected graduate students an op
portunity to have a superior
teaching experience before en
tering their professions. For ex
ample, graduate students are
well qualified to teach advanced
undergraduate seminars in their
thesis or exam areas.

7. Procedures should be estab
lished for intedepartmental
graduate programs and degrees.
Areas worthy of investigation
often fall apross departmental
lines. We seem to be in the midst
of an era when departments
draw rigid lines which their stu
dents are not supposed to cross.
We are faced with the irony of
the Stanford Medical School be
ing a pace-setter and innovator,
while the Humanities and Sci
ences contain some of the stiffest
and dullest programs. We espe
cially see the need for an inter
departmental program in Urban
Studies.
8. Urge the formation and sup
port of graduate student orga
nizations in each department
and professional school.
9. We further urge each de
partment and school to accept
students as members on all de
partmental and professional
school committees.
10. Urge the administration to
systematically consult graduate
students whenever studies of or
changes in graduate education
are suggested.
In the past, such consultations
have been spotty and highly per
sonalized if at all.
11. We urge the university to
establish a bureaucratic (YES!)
grievance for prob
lems which fall to be resolved
depart mentally.
Undergraduates have the Dean
of Students Office to go to bat
for them. We have no one. The
problem is further complicated
by the fact that a graduate stu
dent is: a) a student, b) an ap
prentice professional, c) often an
employee in his department. The
department is the sole evaluator
of his performance, has almost
total control over his finances,
and faculty tend to rally around
faculty when there is a disagree
ment with a student, even when
the student is right.
12. We urge the university to
foster the recruitment of minor
ity students to do graduate work
at Stanford.
In some cases, this might
mean a relaxation of academic
standards for admission. Some
departments and schools are
alreaeady moving in this direc
tion. The administration should
encourage others to follow their
example.
We trust that the implementa
tion of these suggestions would
make Stanford a far more ex
citing and stimulating university
for graduate education and for
undergraduate education as well.
