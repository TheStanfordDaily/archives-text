# Indians Humiliate Bears 20-0
## 
### GARY CAVALLI 
The Axe returned home Satur
day afternoon.
With the style and precision
of a finely-honed machine, Stan
ford thoroughly and methodi
cally cut down the California
ilears Saturday afternoon in the
Tfst Big Game.
The score was 20-0, but it
wasn't that close.
The Indians dominated the
game in all departments, moving
through the vaunted Cal defense
like it was butter and throwing
up a surprisingly strong defense
which limited the sputtering Cal
offense to a meager 126 yards. It
was the Tribe's seventh victory
in the last eight editions of the
traditional Cal-Stanford clash.
Team Victory
It was a team victory for Stan
ford — the offensive line provid
ing great protection for brilliant
quarterback Jim Plunkett, the
defensive 1i n e pressuring Cal
quarterback Randy Humphries
and holding the Bears to a paltry
bl yards rushing, the running
backs picking up important yard
age, Plunkett and his outstand
ing receiving corps riddling the
Bear secondary, and the defen
sive backs completely shutting
off the Cal passing game.

Stanford's offense was u dou
ble-edged sword to the outclassed
Cal defenders. With fullback
Greg Broughton enjoying his
finest game ol the year despite
a painful charley horse, and
Plunkett running well on the op
tion play, the Tribe was able to
establish a strong running game
— something which the Bear*
could not afford to let happen.
The Indian passing game was
unstoppable. Rather, Gene Wash
ington was unstoppable. Despite
double-coverage on nearly every
play, Washington caught seven
passes for 90 yards, setting a
new Pacific-8 receiving record
with 71 season receptions.
Plunkett had one of his finest
games of the campaign, rifling
17 completions in 31 attempts for
241 yards, arid picking up an
additional 34 on the option.
Midway through the initial
period Plunkett hit tight end Bob
Moore with a three-yard toss for
the touchdown. It was the same
play which had worked for six
points against the Air Force.
Dandy Draw
Broughton's savage, 28-yard
gallop to the midfield stripe on a
beautifully executed draw play
got the Indians moving again
late in the first quarter. The play
was telephoned down to the field
by coach Dick Vermeil from his
perch high up in the press box.
Plunkett hif Washington and
Marquess for 11 yards each, and
tailback Bubba Brown fought for
11 more on two carries to the
Cal 17.
Washington took it In from
there on the flanker reverse, a
play which has worked so well
throughout the season. Two
great blocks — one by George
Crooks—cleared the entire right
side, and Gene raced in to cap
the 89-yard drive. Bill Shoemak
er's second PAT made it 14 0.
A 69-yard Stanford drive went
for naught minutes later when
Shoemaker's 35-yard field goal
attempt was wide to the right.
But the senior placekicker
atoned for this by kicking a 20
yarder after Don Parish inter

cepted Humphries' pass at the
Cal 18.
Right before the hail; Cal got
a big break when Gary Fowler's
punt touched a Stanford play
er's foot and the Bears recovered
on the Tribe 17.
Pass Ktish Kills Cal
But a fierce Indian pass rush
killed the threat. A screen pass
gained one on first down, but
on the next play Stu Kellner
dropped Humphries for a 14-yard
loss after the Cal quarterback
fumbled the ball trying to elude
Parish (voted "Lineman of the
Game").
Parish and company swarmed
in on Humphries again to drop
him for an eight-yard loss on
third down, and on the following
play he lofted a blooper ball
downfield which Dennis Moore
intercepted for Stanford.

The same drama was repeated
early in the third quarter when
the Bears mounted their only
sustained drive of the game. A
17-yard keeper by Humphries, a
13-yard pass to Stewart, and an
interference call gave Cal a first
down at the Tribe S But Stan
ford held again.
Two running plays gained
three yards, then Kellner smoth
ered Humphries for a six-yard
loss back to the 11. Trailing 17-0,
the Bears had to go for it.
Humphries' pass to Stewart in
the end zone was a little behind
the giant split end, but Stewart
still managed to get both hands
on the ball before juggling it.
As he tried to regain control of
the pigskin before it hit the
ground. Tribe defender Dick Oli
ver Jarred Stewart with a vicious
tackle, and the ball fell harm-

lessly to the turf.

LINEMAN OF THE GAME — Stanford's Don Parish (90) nails Cal fullback John MoG: file iv i,t
three yard gain In the third quarter of Saturday's Biff Game. McGafHe, who didn't carry iE;■ h>
the first half, may have wished he never saw the pigskin after Parish stopped him on tlii' pl;r 'I
talented junior linebacker made 12 tackles and intercepted a pass en route to "Lineman of the
honors.
The Axe returned home Satur
day afternoon.
With the style and precision
of a finely-honed machine, Stan
ford thoroughly and methodi
cally cut down the California
ilears Saturday afternoon in the
Tfst Big Game.
The score was 20-0, but it
wasn't that close.
The Indians dominated the
game in all departments, moving
through the vaunted Cal defense
like it was butter and throwing
up a surprisingly strong defense
which limited the sputtering Cal
offense to a meager 126 yards. It
was the Tribe's seventh victory
in the last eight editions of the
traditional Cal-Stanford clash.
Team Victory
It was a team victory for Stan
ford — the offensive line provid
ing great protection for brilliant
quarterback Jim Plunkett, the
defensive 1i n e pressuring Cal
quarterback Randy Humphries
and holding the Bears to a paltry
bl yards rushing, the running
backs picking up important yard
age, Plunkett and his outstand
ing receiving corps riddling the
Bear secondary, and the defen
sive backs completely shutting
off the Cal passing game.

Stanford's offense was u dou
ble-edged sword to the outclassed
Cal defenders. With fullback
Greg Broughton enjoying his
finest game ol the year despite
a painful charley horse, and
Plunkett running well on the op
tion play, the Tribe was able to
establish a strong running game
— something which the Bear*
could not afford to let happen.
The Indian passing game was
unstoppable. Rather, Gene Wash
ington was unstoppable. Despite
double-coverage on nearly every
play, Washington caught seven
passes for 90 yards, setting a
new Pacific-8 receiving record
with 71 season receptions.
Plunkett had one of his finest
games of the campaign, rifling
17 completions in 31 attempts for
241 yards, arid picking up an
additional 34 on the option.
Midway through the initial
period Plunkett hit tight end Bob
Moore with a three-yard toss for
the touchdown. It was the same
play which had worked for six
points against the Air Force.
Dandy Draw
Broughton's savage, 28-yard
gallop to the midfield stripe on a
beautifully executed draw play
got the Indians moving again
late in the first quarter. The play
was telephoned down to the field
by coach Dick Vermeil from his
perch high up in the press box.
Plunkett hif Washington and
Marquess for 11 yards each, and
tailback Bubba Brown fought for
11 more on two carries to the
Cal 17.
Washington took it In from
there on the flanker reverse, a
play which has worked so well
throughout the season. Two
great blocks — one by George
Crooks—cleared the entire right
side, and Gene raced in to cap
the 89-yard drive. Bill Shoemak
er's second PAT made it 14 0.
A 69-yard Stanford drive went
for naught minutes later when
Shoemaker's 35-yard field goal
attempt was wide to the right.
But the senior placekicker
atoned for this by kicking a 20
yarder after Don Parish inter

cepted Humphries' pass at the
Cal 18.
Right before the hail; Cal got
a big break when Gary Fowler's
punt touched a Stanford play
er's foot and the Bears recovered
on the Tribe 17.
Pass Ktish Kills Cal
But a fierce Indian pass rush
killed the threat. A screen pass
gained one on first down, but
on the next play Stu Kellner
dropped Humphries for a 14-yard
loss after the Cal quarterback
fumbled the ball trying to elude
Parish (voted "Lineman of the
Game").
Parish and company swarmed
in on Humphries again to drop
him for an eight-yard loss on
third down, and on the following
play he lofted a blooper ball
downfield which Dennis Moore
intercepted for Stanford.

The same drama was repeated
early in the third quarter when
the Bears mounted their only
sustained drive of the game. A
17-yard keeper by Humphries, a
13-yard pass to Stewart, and an
interference call gave Cal a first
down at the Tribe S But Stan
ford held again.
Two running plays gained
three yards, then Kellner smoth
ered Humphries for a six-yard
loss back to the 11. Trailing 17-0,
the Bears had to go for it.
Humphries' pass to Stewart in
the end zone was a little behind
the giant split end, but Stewart
still managed to get both hands
on the ball before juggling it.
As he tried to regain control of
the pigskin before it hit the
ground. Tribe defender Dick Oli

tackle, and the ball fell harm-

LINEMAN OF THE GAME — Stanford's Don Parish (90) nails Cal fullback John MoG: file iv i,t
three yard gain In the third quarter of Saturday's Biff Game. McGafHe, who didn't carry iE;■ h>
the first half, may have wished he never saw the pigskin after Parish stopped him on tlii' pl;r 'I
talented junior linebacker made 12 tackles and intercepted a pass en route to "Lineman of the
honors.
The Axe returned home Satur
day afternoon.
With the style and precision
of a finely-honed machine, Stan
ford thoroughly and methodi
cally cut down the California
ilears Saturday afternoon in the
Tfst Big Game.
The score was 20-0, but it
wasn't that close.
The Indians dominated the
game in all departments, moving
through the vaunted Cal defense
like it was butter and throwing
up a surprisingly strong defense
which limited the sputtering Cal
offense to a meager 126 yards. It
was the Tribe's seventh victory
in the last eight editions of the
traditional Cal-Stanford clash.
Team Victory
It was a team victory for Stan
ford — the offensive line provid
ing great protection for brilliant
quarterback Jim Plunkett, the
defensive 1i n e pressuring Cal
quarterback Randy Humphries
and holding the Bears to a paltry
bl yards rushing, the running
backs picking up important yard
age, Plunkett and his outstand
ing receiving corps riddling the
Bear secondary, and the defen
sive backs completely shutting
off the Cal passing game.

Stanford's offense was u dou
ble-edged sword to the outclassed
Cal defenders. With fullback
Greg Broughton enjoying his
finest game ol the year despite
a painful charley horse, and
Plunkett running well on the op
tion play, the Tribe was able to
establish a strong running game
— something which the Bear*
could not afford to let happen.
The Indian passing game was
unstoppable. Rather, Gene Wash
ington was unstoppable. Despite
double-coverage on nearly every
play, Washington caught seven
passes for 90 yards, setting a
new Pacific-8 receiving record
with 71 season receptions.
Plunkett had one of his finest
games of the campaign, rifling
17 completions in 31 attempts for
241 yards, arid picking up an
additional 34 on the option.
Midway through the initial
period Plunkett hit tight end Bob
Moore with a three-yard toss for
the touchdown. It was the same
play which had worked for six
points against the Air Force.
Dandy Draw
Broughton's savage, 28-yard
gallop to the midfield stripe on a
beautifully executed draw play
got the Indians moving again
late in the first quarter. The play
was telephoned down to the field
by coach Dick Vermeil from his
perch high up in the press box.
Plunkett hif Washington and
Marquess for 11 yards each, and
tailback Bubba Brown fought for
11 more on two carries to the
Cal 17.
Washington took it In from
there on the flanker reverse, a
play which has worked so well
throughout the season. Two
great blocks — one by George
Crooks—cleared the entire right
side, and Gene raced in to cap
the 89-yard drive. Bill Shoemak
er's second PAT made it 14 0.
A 69-yard Stanford drive went
for naught minutes later when
Shoemaker's 35-yard field goal
attempt was wide to the right.
But the senior placekicker
atoned for this by kicking a 20
yarder after Don Parish inter

cepted Humphries' pass at the
Cal 18.
Right before the hail; Cal got
a big break when Gary Fowler's
punt touched a Stanford play
er's foot and the Bears recovered
on the Tribe 17.
Pass Ktish Kills Cal
But a fierce Indian pass rush
killed the threat. A screen pass
gained one on first down, but
on the next play Stu Kellner
dropped Humphries for a 14-yard
loss after the Cal quarterback
fumbled the ball trying to elude
Parish (voted "Lineman of the
Game").

late in the first quarter. The play
was telephoned down to the field
by coach Dick Vermeil from his
perch high up in the press box.
Plunkett hif Washington and
Marquess for 11 yards each, and
tailback Bubba Brown fought for
11 more on two carries to the
Cal 17.
Washington took it In from
there on the flanker reverse, a
play which has worked so well
throughout the season. Two
great blocks — one by George
Crooks—cleared the entire right
side, and Gene raced in to cap
the 89-yard drive. Bill Shoemak
er's second PAT made it 14 0.
A 69-yard Stanford drive went
for naught minutes later when
Shoemaker's 35-yard field goal
attempt was wide to the right.
But the senior placekicker
atoned for this by kicking a 20
yarder after Don Parish inter

cepted Humphries' pass at the
Cal 18.
Right before the hail; Cal got
a big break when Gary Fowler's
punt touched a Stanford play
er's foot and the Bears recovered
on the Tribe 17.
Pass Ktish Kills Cal
But a fierce Indian pass rush
killed the threat. A screen pass
gained one on first down, but
on the next play Stu Kellner
dropped Humphries for a 14-yard
loss after the Cal quarterback
fumbled the ball trying to elude
Parish (voted "Lineman of the
Game").
Parish and company swarmed
in on Humphries again to drop
him for an eight-yard loss on
third down, and on the following
play he lofted a blooper ball
downfield which Dennis Moore
intercepted for Stanford.

The same drama was repeated
early in the third quarter when
the Bears mounted their only
sustained drive of the game. A
17-yard keeper by Humphries, a
13-yard pass to Stewart, and an
interference call gave Cal a first
down at the Tribe S But Stan
ford held again.
Two running plays gained
three yards, then Kellner smoth
ered Humphries for a six-yard
loss back to the 11. Trailing 17-0,
the Bears had to go for it.
Humphries' pass to Stewart in
the end zone was a little behind
the giant split end, but Stewart
still managed to get both hands
on the ball before juggling it.
As he tried to regain control of
the pigskin before it hit the
ground. Tribe defender Dick Oli
ver Jarred Stewart with a vicious
tackle, and the ball fell harm-

lessly to the turf.
