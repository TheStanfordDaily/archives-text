## De Gaulle Asks New Austerity 
### 
PARIS (AP) — President
Charles De Gaulle, blaming most
of France's troubles on last
spring's student and worker
strikes and riots, called on his
countrymen Sunday night to
buckle down under austerity
conditions to save the French
franc.
He earlier refused to allow
devaluation of the franc.
In a radio address to the na
tion, De Gaulle said France's
1969 budget deficit, originally
estimated at 11.5 billion francs
— $2.3 billion — was being cut
back to 6.5 billion francs — $1.3
billion — as part of his plan to
shore up the currency.
De Gaulle had a cabled pledge
from President Johnson Sunday
that the United States would
cooperate with him in his effort
to avert devaluation. The French
president promptly replied that
Johnson's "friendly message is
partcularly valuable to me."
Although De Gaulle's decision
startled the financial world, U.S.
Secretary of the Treasury Henry
H. Fowler said he was not sur
prised at the action. Fowler said
"I heartily approve, and, indeed,
applaud" De Gaulle's decision
and expressed the opinion it
would not have any adverse ef
fect on the dollar.
But De Gaulle's crash pro
gram to set France back on its
feet seemed bound to cause some
the European Common Market.
British financial experts gen
erally agreed that De Gaulle's re
fusal to devaluate the French
franc has aggravated the inter
national monetary crisis.
One influential commentator
said the French leader even
seems ready to bring the world
financial structure crashing
down in ruins.

20 of our board members to be
present to determine the proper
solution to that college's prob

WASHINGTON (AP)—Secre
tary of Defense Clark M. Clif

Vice President Nguyen Cao Ky
might head at least portions of
future Paris peace talks.
Clifford said he is optimistic
that the South Vietnamese will
join in the talks "and I would
suspect that they could take up
the lead on some matters. There
are other matters in which we
might take the lead."
He specifically mentioned dis
cussion of troop withdrawals,
both American and North Viet

Americans want peace, he is

1969 budget deficit, originally
estimated at 11.5 billion francs
— $2.3 billion — was being cut
back to 6.5 billion francs — $1.3

shore up the currency.
De Gaulle had a cabled pledge

ROME (AP) — Alessandro

Pertini's stunning appoint

Giuseppe Saragat in an attempt

Pertini, however, was given
small chance of succeeding in

forming a new government amid
the internal confusion of Italy's

PARIS (AP) — President
Charles De Gaulle, blaming most
of France's troubles on last
spring's student and worker
strikes and riots, called on his
countrymen Sunday night to
buckle down under austerity
conditions to save the French
franc.
He earlier refused to allow
devaluation of the franc.
In a radio address to the na
tion, De Gaulle said France's
1969 budget deficit, originally
estimated at 11.5 billion francs
— $2.3 billion — was being cut
back to 6.5 billion francs — $1.3
billion — as part of his plan to
shore up the currency.
De Gaulle had a cabled pledge
from President Johnson Sunday
that the United States would
cooperate with him in his effort
to avert devaluation. The French
president promptly replied that
Johnson's "friendly message is
partcularly valuable to me."
Although De Gaulle's decision
startled the financial world, U.S.
Secretary of the Treasury Henry
H. Fowler said he was not sur
prised at the action. Fowler said
"I heartily approve, and, indeed,
applaud" De Gaulle's decision
and expressed the opinion it
would not have any adverse ef
fect on the dollar.
But De Gaulle's crash pro
gram to set France back on its
feet seemed bound to cause some
the European Common Market.
British financial experts gen
erally agreed that De Gaulle's re
fusal to devaluate the French
franc has aggravated the inter
national monetary crisis.
One influential commentator
said the French leader even
seems ready to bring the world
financial structure crashing
down in ruins.
