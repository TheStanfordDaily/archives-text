# Tribe's Most Satisfying Win
## 
### 
Stanford won much more than
just a football game Saturday
afternoon. In a season marked
by bitter disappointment and
frustration, the Indians came up
with their most impressive per
formance in humiliating Cal
20-0.
The contrast between the two
teams was startling. The Bears
appeared dull, lifeless, and out
of their class. The Indians
looked like a team with a mis
sion.
And Stanford, did, indeed,
have a lot to prove Saturday to
75,000 spectators in Berkeley's
Memorial Stadium.
A disastrous mid-season slump
led some skeptics to demand the
dismissal of head coach John
Ralston, and three successive
flat performances dropped Stan
ford from the nation's top 20
ranked teams. With their tre

mendous effort in the Big Game,
the Indians hoped to dispel any
doubts as to Ralston's compe
tance and re-establish them
selves as one of the nation's
finest teams. To many, they did
both.
Locker Room Bedlam
The atmosphere in the Tribe
locker room was one of unre
strained joy.
"It really feels great," an
elated Marquess grinned. Mark
admitted he was a little sur
prised the Indians moved so well
against the Bear defense. "I was
surprised they were that easy,"
the good-natured Marquess said.
"Their defense looked tired—
they weren't very quick. You
really have to hand it to our de
fense, though, for shutting them
off right before the half."
Asked if the team wanted this
one for Ralston, the senior split

end grinned again and replied,
"Yes, sir. We wanted to show
how we're capable of playing.
We feel Ralston couldn't have
done a better job preparing us
all year," Mark continued. "He's
the reason I came here—he's the
reason most of us came here.
I hope he stays—we all hope he
stays."
Sophomore tight end Bob
Moore agreed. "Everybody had
it in his mind to win this one
for Coach Ralston," the tired
but happy Moore affirmed. "We
think Ralston's the greatest per
son around. I know that's one
of the reasons we were so ready.
We want him back—we want
him back bad."
All-American flanker Gene
Washington, who was voted
"Back of the Game" after break
ing the Pacific-8 receiving rec
ord, disdained talk about his
record-setting effort and chose
to discuss the importance of the
win.
"I was pleased with the ree
urd, but it was a much greater
thrill to beat Cal," the senior
from Long Beach commented. "I
feel more strongly about the
game than about my own indi
vidual accomplishments. The ob
ject is to win," Gene said, add
ing that Saturday's triumph was
"without a doubt" his most sat
isfying victory.
"I've felt all year our offense
could move against anybody,"
Washington continued. "Today
we got the first downs when
we needed them, and kept the
momentum going."
Gene Credits (3oachen
Gene was quick to credit the
Stanford coaching sta/f with the
successful game plan, and with
making him a better ballplayer.

"All year the coaching
has done a good job prepariii"
us," the modest Washington re
vealed. "I've never worked wit ;
a finer coach or finer per
than Coach Ralston. I .vorkc<l
a lot with Coach Waters
ford receivers coach) this sea
son, and I must give him lot
of credit for making mo an im
proved player."
Stanford backs Bubba Brown
and Jim Plunkett both felt 't
was Stanford's best game of tl
year.
"We played a real good grim''.;
today," Brown said. " r '\\ o<
fensive line worked M ' r " 'j
charm. Everyone jelled to/? -
ther."
"It feels pretty great," a proud
Plunkett beamed. "I had terri*
protection. The offensive 1 i 1
played a tremendous gr
Their defense was suppose
intimidate us, but we intimidat<
them from the beginning."
One senior who wanted
make his last game a merrm
able one was fullback Gre.'
Broughton, who overcame a
charley horse to rush for 59
yards and pick up another 44 on
a screen pass.
"I was pretty keyed through
out the contest," Broughton
smiled. "It was my last game ft>;
Stanford—maybe my last grm
period, and I'd like to hav<
something to remember."
"Our defense improved stead
ily throughout the year," Ral
ston said, "and it was the d<
fcn.se which determined the 'ri<>
meritum today. Stopping thern
just before the half and again
in the third quarter proved «i»
eisive. Bob Bittner sure came up
with some great plavs in t*he
tirst half."
