# Talk, Study With Germans
## 
### DAVE NOLAND 
Once inside the walls of an
overseas campus, it doesn't real
ly matter whether you're in Beu
telsbach or Palo Alto. The peo
ple you eat, sleep, talk, study and
get drunk with are invariably
English • speaking, New York
Times • reading, Levi • wearing,
spray deodorant • using products
of American Way of Life — in
short, disgustingly like yourself.
What to do? Those with a
modicum of ability in German
might consider the Department's
Hamburg Program. The spring
summer program involves a se
mester of individual study at
the University of Hamburg, in
tensive group instructon in Ger
man from a Stanford prof, or
ganized group lectures, theater
excursions, and field trips. And
lots of free time to do your thing
with German students, of which
there are about 20,000 in the im
mediate vicinity.
All liberal arts majors who

have taken a reasonable numbei
of German courses are eligible
to participate. Applications are
now being accepted for this
spring and summer.
Stanford places all its students
in studentenwohnheims •dormi
tories), most of which are co-ed,
ultra-modern, and far superior to
anything on the Farm.
The dorm environment pro
vides many opportunities for al
most any kind of interaction you
can think of with German stu
dents. In addition, most dorms
have programs of outside speak
ers, sports, parties, tutorial pro
grams and beer machines.
Extracurricular activities are
to be found everywhere.
A couple of guys from last
year's group played on the Uni
versity's varsity basketball team.
Others from last year's group
spent their free time singing in
the University choir, sailing on
the Alster (a huge lake in down
town Hamburg), learning to fly

gliders at a dollar a flight, get
ting engaged to Germans, and
other enjoyable and informative
activities.
The opportunities for com
pletely submerging oneself into
the German Way of Life are lim
ited only by personal interest
and initiative.
