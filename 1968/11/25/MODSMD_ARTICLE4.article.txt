# $4000 From LASSU
## Speech Appropriation Fails 
### LANG ATWOOD 
An attempt by the Speech As
sociation to obtain a $4000 sup
plementary appropriation from
the Student Legislature (LASSU)
has apparently failed.
According to LASSU Speaker
Yale Braunstein, the Speech As
sociation's request did not pass
as earlier reported, but failed to
receive the necessary two-thirds
margin by a vote of 50 to 26.
At last Thursday's meeting of
LASSU the Speech Association,
sponsors of the debate team, in
troduced a supplementary appro
priations bill asking for $4000.

By a majority vote the bill
was put on the agenda for con
sideration. Before it could bo
taken up, however, legislator
Tim Logan, KZSU station man
ager, asked that any further
voting be done by roll call. This
motion needed the support of
one-fifth of LASSU, which it re
ceived.
Increased Participation
Speech Association President
Ken Philpot introduced the bill
and explained that increased
membership and participation
had resulted in the expenditure
of the $3000 budgeted, which was
$4000 less than the amount asked
for and approved by the finance
committee last Spring.
Philpot further stated that the
Speech Association wanted to be
come financially independent of
LASSU so that it wouldn't be
subject to budget cuts and fluc
tuations.
He stated that the $4000 would
be partially used to set up an
endowment fund to finance the
Speech Association in the fu
ture.
Philpot also defended the emer
gency nature of the appropria
tion saying that without the ad
ditional funds the speech pro
gram would be in effect termi
nated.
Before a vote could be taken,
LASSU Speaker Yale Braunstein
announced that numerous chal
lenges had been made as to the
voting rights of many people
present. He questioned each per
son present and four people who
had been voting were found not
to be members.
Three LASSU representatives
from the Business School have

charged in a letter to The Daily
that "the Speech Association
packed the meeting by bringing
in proxy delegates". Officials of
the Speech Association were not
available for comment regarding
this charge.
Speaker Casts Vote
A vote was finally taken and
the result was 50 to 25, a two
thirds majority, before Braun
stein cast a nay vote making it
50 to 26 over the objections of
many legislators who claimed he
had no vote.
Sunday afternoon, Braunstein
released the following state
ment:
"There has been some confu
sion over the results of the
LASSU debate and vote on the
Speech Association supplemen
tal appropriation.
"First it should be realized
that the requirement of a two
thirds majority is a rule of the
Associated Students and can not
be changed by the Legislature
for any one bill. This ruling is
supported by David Swift, the
Student Financial Manager.
"Secondly it was reported that
the bill passed 50 to 25. This is
not quite true. The Speaker an
nounced that the bill failed to
get two-thirds because he sup
ported the nays. Several mem
bers objected to the Speaker
casting his vote. However, sec
tion 40 of Robert's Rules of Or
der states: 'Thus in a case where
a two-thirds vote is necessary,
and his vote thrown with the
minority would prevent the
adoption of the question, he can
cast his vote!
"Therefore, Bill 68-9-10, the

Speech Association Supplement
al Appropriation, failed to get
the approval of the legislature."
$3000 Budget
The Speech Association re
ceived $3000 in the regular ASSU
budget, and according to the By
laws are ot entitled to additional
funds execpt in the case of an
"extraodinary emergency." In
the '66-'67 ASSU budget they
received $3,500; in '67-'6B, $6,650.
In addition, the Speech Associa
tion also receives funds directly
from the University.
In the '66-'67 University bud
get they received $9,225.14; in
'67-'6B, $18,210.23, this year's fig
ure is not available.
In January, 1967, the Speech
Association requested an addi
tional $2500 after being bud
geted $3500 for the year. The re
quest was sent to the finance
committee for study but came
back with no recommendation.
The rules committee then ruled
the motion out of order, citing
the section referred to earlier in
this article about "extraordin
ary emergencies", but was over
ruled by the legislature. The
Speech Association received the
additional funds.
Earlier this year, however, the
International Association asked
for $200 from the contingency
fund, set up to finance groups
with no budget and special
events. They received a majority
but not two-thirds of the vote
and didn't receive the money.
If it had passed, the Speech
Association's $4000 request
would have left only $497.50 in
LASSU's contingency fund for
the rest of the '68-'69 year.
