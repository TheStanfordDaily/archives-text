# Black Studies Major Starts Winter Quarter
## 
### CRAIG WILSON 
With the San Francisco State
College campus currently em
broiled in crisis over the crea
tion of a Black Studies Depart
ment, Stanford has announced
the institution of a new under
graduate Program in African
and Afro-American Studies to
begin winter quarter.
The program will come in the
form of an interdepartmental
major that will enable students
to combine training in a tradi
tional academic discipline with
work in African and Afro-
American studies.
This year the pilot program
will be open to sophomores and
juniors. Students enrolled in the
program will have an affiliation
with one department and will
take fifty units of credit in Afri
can and Afro-American studies.
Twenty five of these units will
be in "core" courses in this area,
and twenty-five units in "sec
ondary" courses. Normally the
bulk of a student's core courses
will be taken in the department
with which he is affiliated.
Planned Last Spring
The plan for the major was
developed last spring by a sub
committee of the Committee on
African Studies, chaired by Pro
fessor G. Wesley Johnson and
including Professors David Ab
ernethy (political science) and

James Gibbs and Joseph Green
berg (anthropology).
The program as outlined by
this committee received the ap
proval of the Committee on Un
dergraduate Instruction which
participated in its formulation.
The program was later approved
by the Academic Council.
According to anthropology
Prof. Gibbs the University has
"tended to be strong in African
studies in the past but weak in
the area of A fro-American stud
ies. The bulk of undergrads" he
says, "are interested in this
area."
"We think it will be effective
and we are quite pleased with
it."
Unique Program
Gibbs says that in spite of the
fact that several such programs
exist across the country the pro
gram was not modeled after
any one. "We did what we
thought would be best to meet
the needs."
"Ideally the program would
have been set up after another
year to insure better course de
sign, undertake course seminars,
and recruit faculty members.
But we decided to compromise
the ideal plan and build for a
larger program.
"As of now we will be limited
to 15 majors for the pilot pro
gram this year."
Black Studies Elsewhere
Stanford is by no means the
first school to install a major
program of Afro-American stud
ies in the Bay Area.
Oakland's Merritt College was
the first to install a full pro
gram. Already the school has
graduated its first Afro-Ameri
can study majors, qualified by a
recent State Board of Education
ruling to teach black studies in
public schools after a temporary
credential.
San Francisco City College
could graduate its first black
studies majors next January.
Few With Degrees
Merritt, San Francisco City
and Los Angeles City—all jun
ior colleges are believed to be

the only higher educational in
stitutions in California now
awarding such degrees.
This fall, The University of
California began five black stud
ies courses in as many depart
ments on the Berkeley campus
attracting only 150 of the 27,500
students.
But Dr. Andrew Billingsley,
assistant chancellor for academ
ic affairs, is striving to set up
an autonomous Department of
Afro-American studies by next
fall.
Special Colloquium
The Stanford program will
provide each student with an ad
visor who is both a member of
the faculty in the department
with which the student is affili
ated and a scholar in the area
of African or Afro-American
studies. In the winter and
spring quarters majors will par
ticipate in a special colloquium
to be taught by a member of
the Stanford faculty and visit
ing scholars.
In the senior year each stu
dent in the program will write
a research paper or carry out
a comparable project in consul
tation with his advisor.
Besides Gibbs, other faculty
members who will participate in
the program will include repre
sentatives, from such areas as
anthropology, education, En
glish, the Food Research Insti
tute, history, the Hoover Insti
tution, political science and so
ciology.
Students who wish to be con
sidered for enrollment in the
program should write a letter of
application to Professor Gibbs
Chairman, Committee on Under
graduate Program in African
and Afro-American Studies,
Building 110. The letter should
include a "Statement of Pur
pose" indicating why the student
wishes to enroll in the program
as well as a transcript. It should
also include any relevant previ
ous experience and names of
faculty members who may be
contacted for references. Appli
cations are due Monday, Dec. 9.

The Stanford program will
provide each student with an ad
visor who is both a member of
the faculty in the department
with which the student is affili
ated and a scholar in the area
of African or Afro-American
studies. In the winter and
spring quarters majors will par
ticipate in a special colloquium
to be taught by a member of
the Stanford faculty and visit
ing scholars.
In the senior year each stu
dent in the program will write
a research paper or carry out
a comparable project in consul
tation with his advisor.
Besides Gibbs, other faculty
members who will participate in
the program will include repre
sentatives, from such areas as
anthropology, education, En
glish, the Food Research Insti
tute, history, the Hoover Insti
tution, political science and so
ciology.
Students who wish to be con
sidered for enrollment in the
program should write a letter of
application to Professor Gibbs
Chairman, Committee on Under
graduate Program in African
and Afro-American Studies,
Building 110. The letter should
include a "Statement of Pur
pose" indicating why the student
wishes to enroll in the program
as well as a transcript. It should
also include any relevant previ
ous experience and names of
faculty members who may be
contacted for references. Appli
cations are due Monday, Dec. 9.
With the San Francisco State
College campus currently em
broiled in crisis over the crea
tion of a Black Studies Depart
ment, Stanford has announced
the institution of a new under
graduate Program in African
and Afro-American Studies to
begin winter quarter.
The program will come in the
form of an interdepartmental
major that will enable students
to combine training in a tradi
tional academic discipline with
work in African and Afro-
American studies.
This year the pilot program
will be open to sophomores and
juniors. Students enrolled in the
program will have an affiliation
with one department and will
take fifty units of credit in Afri
can and Afro-American studies.
Twenty five of these units will
be in "core" courses in this area,
and twenty-five units in "sec
ondary" courses. Normally the
bulk of a student's core courses
will be taken in the department
with which he is affiliated.
Planned Last Spring
The plan for the major was
developed last spring by a sub
committee of the Committee on
African Studies, chaired by Pro
fessor G. Wesley Johnson and
including Professors David Ab
ernethy (political science) and

James Gibbs and Joseph Green
berg (anthropology).
The program as outlined by
this committee received the ap
proval of the Committee on Un
dergraduate Instruction which
participated in its formulation.
The program was later approved
by the Academic Council.
According to anthropology
Prof. Gibbs the University has
"tended to be strong in African
studies in the past but weak in
the area of A fro-American stud
ies. The bulk of undergrads" he
says, "are interested in this
area."
"We think it will be effective
and we are quite pleased with
it."
Unique Program
Gibbs says that in spite of the
fact that several such programs
exist across the country the pro
gram was not modeled after
any one. "We did what we
thought would be best to meet
the needs."
"Ideally the program would
have been set up after another
year to insure better course de
sign, undertake course seminars,
and recruit faculty members.
But we decided to compromise
the ideal plan and build for a
larger program.
"As of now we will be limited
to 15 majors for the pilot pro
gram this year."
Black Studies Elsewhere
Stanford is by no means the
first school to install a major
program of Afro-American stud
ies in the Bay Area.
Oakland's Merritt College was
the first to install a full pro
gram. Already the school has
graduated its first Afro-Ameri
can study majors, qualified by a
recent State Board of Education
ruling to teach black studies in
public schools after a temporary
credential.
San Francisco City College
could graduate its first black
studies majors next January.
Few With Degrees
Merritt, San Francisco City
and Los Angeles City—all jun
ior colleges are believed to be

the only higher educational in
stitutions in California now
awarding such degrees.
This fall, The University of
California began five black stud
ies courses in as many depart
ments on the Berkeley campus
attracting only 150 of the 27,500
students.
But Dr. Andrew Billingsley,
assistant chancellor for academ
ic affairs, is striving to set up
an autonomous Department of
Afro-American studies by next
fall.

sign, undertake course seminars,
and recruit faculty members.
But we decided to compromise
the ideal plan and build for a
larger program.
"As of now we will be limited
to 15 majors for the pilot pro
gram this year."
Black Studies Elsewhere
Stanford is by no means the
first school to install a major
program of Afro-American stud
ies in the Bay Area.
Oakland's Merritt College was
the first to install a full pro
gram. Already the school has
graduated its first Afro-Ameri
can study majors, qualified by a
recent State Board of Education
ruling to teach black studies in
public schools after a temporary
credential.
San Francisco City College
could graduate its first black
studies majors next January.
Few With Degrees
Merritt, San Francisco City
and Los Angeles City—all jun
ior colleges are believed to be

the only higher educational in
stitutions in California now
awarding such degrees.
This fall, The University of
California began five black stud
ies courses in as many depart
ments on the Berkeley campus
attracting only 150 of the 27,500
students.
But Dr. Andrew Billingsley,
assistant chancellor for academ
ic affairs, is striving to set up
an autonomous Department of
Afro-American studies by next
fall.
Special Colloquium
The Stanford program will
provide each student with an ad
visor who is both a member of
the faculty in the department
with which the student is affili
ated and a scholar in the area
of African or Afro-American
studies. In the winter and
spring quarters majors will par
ticipate in a special colloquium
to be taught by a member of
the Stanford faculty and visit
ing scholars.
In the senior year each stu
dent in the program will write
a research paper or carry out
a comparable project in consul
tation with his advisor.
Besides Gibbs, other faculty
members who will participate in
the program will include repre
sentatives, from such areas as
anthropology, education, En
glish, the Food Research Insti
tute, history, the Hoover Insti
tution, political science and so
ciology.
Students who wish to be con
sidered for enrollment in the
program should write a letter of
application to Professor Gibbs
Chairman, Committee on Under
graduate Program in African
and Afro-American Studies,
Building 110. The letter should
include a "Statement of Pur
pose" indicating why the student
wishes to enroll in the program
as well as a transcript. It should
also include any relevant previ
ous experience and names of
faculty members who may be
contacted for references. Appli
cations are due Monday, Dec. 9.
With the San Francisco State
College campus currently em
broiled in crisis over the crea
tion of a Black Studies Depart
ment, Stanford has announced
the institution of a new under
graduate Program in African
and Afro-American Studies to
begin winter quarter.
The program will come in the
form of an interdepartmental
major that will enable students
to combine training in a tradi
tional academic discipline with
work in African and Afro-
American studies.
This year the pilot program
will be open to sophomores and
juniors. Students enrolled in the
program will have an affiliation
with one department and will
take fifty units of credit in Afri
can and Afro-American studies.
Twenty five of these units will
be in "core" courses in this area,
and twenty-five units in "sec
ondary" courses. Normally the
bulk of a student's core courses
will be taken in the department
with which he is affiliated.
Planned Last Spring
The plan for the major was
developed last spring by a sub
committee of the Committee on
African Studies, chaired by Pro
fessor G. Wesley Johnson and
including Professors David Ab
ernethy (political science) and

James Gibbs and Joseph Green
berg (anthropology).
The program as outlined by
this committee received the ap
proval of the Committee on Un
dergraduate Instruction which
participated in its formulation.
The program was later approved
by the Academic Council.
According to anthropology
Prof. Gibbs the University has
"tended to be strong in African
studies in the past but weak in
the area of A fro-American stud
ies. The bulk of undergrads" he
says, "are interested in this
area."
"We think it will be effective
and we are quite pleased with
it."
Unique Program
Gibbs says that in spite of the
fact that several such programs
exist across the country the pro
gram was not modeled after
any one. "We did what we
thought would be best to meet
the needs."
"Ideally the program would
have been set up after another
year to insure better course de
sign, undertake course seminars,
and recruit faculty members.
But we decided to compromise
the ideal plan and build for a
larger program.
"As of now we will be limited
to 15 majors for the pilot pro
gram this year."
