# Speaks Today
## Ex-LBJ Aide Here

The economic system of the United States "works to distribute
resources to the people, no matter how badly," former Presidential
assistant S. Douglass Cater said yesterday in an interview with
The Daily.
Cater will be speaking in Dinkelspiel Auditorium at 4 this after
noon. He recently resigned from President Johnson's staff to work
for Hubert Humphrey's campaign.
He was Special Assistant to the President for Health, Education
and Welfare programs.
The title of Cater's talk is "Some Preliminary Second Thoughts
on the Presidency."
The New Left, according to Cater, is "highly irresponsible" in its
desire to destroy the current system. They "have made no effort to
devise an alternative." Accomplishment of the New Left's program,
said Cater, would "make Biafra look like Paradise Island. Marcuse
might survive, but what about the people?"
In yesterday afternoon's interview, Cater discussed some of the
problems facing universities and students in America today.
Campus "demonstrations with a clear motivation are understand
able, but demonstrations with some ill-defined motivation like 'tear
ing down the power structure' are inexcusable," he said. Being a
student activist is "part of the learning process". Cater himself was
one of the founders of the National Student Association in 1947.
Penny-Ante Organization
Recalling the recent controversy over Central Intelligence Agency
ties with the association, Cater said, "we were a penny-ante organi
zation then, it would never have occurred to us to ask the CIA for
funds." At the same time, he noted that most national student or
ganizations "on both sides of the Iron Curtain" are funded by the
national government.
"Most of the shock over the disclosure was in the United States.
There was no real shock overseas." What is preferable for NSA,
according to Cater, is "some kind of public subsidy, but nothing
covert."
In the final months of his tenure as a Presidential assistant, Cater
said, he and the Johnson administration "became concerned over
reprisal-type legislation" introduced in Congress. He seemed to be
referring to amendments that place limits of federal aid to insti
tutions that fail to discipline demonstrators.
He also said that the concern in Congress over demonstrations
could be seen "in the enthusiasm for funding higher education."
There is a trend, he said, for greater amounts of money being chan
neled into vocational education and relatively less into higher edu
cation.
"Vocational education (bills) have swept through in a breeze,"
while higher education has had a harder time, according to Cater.
Biggest Unsolved Problem
Touching on what he called "the biggest unsolved problem in the
country," Cater said "Black capitalism will not solve it all. It does
help create goals for entrepreneurs."
"The White House has been concerned with two drives to make
opportunity equal, first getting the basic legislation and, second,
reallocating resources so more goes to the disadvantaged."
The trend toward black separatism is a consequence, according
to Cater, of the realization by black loaders that integration is not
"a be-all and end-all." "The emphasis on black pride is very healthy,
but we can't create a separate America within America." American
society is based on the notion, according to Cater, that "everyone
can decide whether to mix."
Neighborhood control over schools, said Cater, should be greater
than it is now, but "it is not an either/or proposition." He cited the
New York school crisis as a situation where an either/or propostion
developed.
Cater is in California "renewing old acquaintances" and prepar
ing for his new position as visiting scholar at the Brookngs Insttu
tion in Washington where he will study the "politics of educaton."
He recently received grants from the Ford and Carnegie Founda
tions for the study.
Formerly a writer and editor, Cater will talk with the Professional
Journalism Fellows while here. He is also slated to dine at the
new fraternity cluster tonight.
