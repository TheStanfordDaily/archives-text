Editor, THE DAILY:
On Thursday night, $4,000 of
your funds were taken from
LASSU by the Speech Associa
tion. This is in addition to $3,000
that was allocated to the Speech
Association at the end of last
year, and leaves only $497 avail
able in contingency for any oth
er functions or associations this
academic year.
At the previous budget meet
ing, considerable time was spent
discussing the Speech Associa

tion request for $7,000, and the
general mood of the meeting
was that this was an excessive
amount of money, considering
the relatively few members of
the University who use the
funds to fly to debates, etc. It
was also felt that considerable
economies could be made by the
Speech Association.
The Speech Association re
ceived their money because they
packed the meeting by bringing
in proxy delegates. This decision
then was clearly not made by a
group representative of the stu
dent body, and the blame must
also be put on those LASSU
reps too apathetic to turn up at
meetings, and those bodies that
fail to elect representatives, and
on new members who didn't
really understand what was go
ing on. We might also blame
those who voted against the new
Constitution recently.
There is now no money to fi
nance any other activities such
is conferences, or projects such
is East Palo Alto tutorial pro
grams. The Business School rep-
found the tactics of
*he Speech Association more
despicable in their efficiency
■han any previous attempts by
minority interest groups.

Editor, THE DAILY:
I suppose it is a tribute to the
efficiency of leftist agitation on
this campus that Mr. Cowan is
unable to sec a reference to
Hewlett-Packard without foam
ing at the mouth about the mili
tary-industrial complex.
However, if he reads my ar
ticle carefully he will see that
on this occasion I was talking
about something else: the costs
and profits of technical educa
tion as a factor of production. I
would like to amplify the argu
ment.
Stanford, like all the major
research universities, is pri
marily a producer of technical
knowledge in the form of tech
nically trained people and aca
demic research. Most of the cost
of this process (in fact most of
the cost of research in general)
is born publicly, by the state,
even in private universities.
The profits of education as a
factor of production go to the
users of the technology, the
technical corporations. The gal
loping profits of the aerospace
and electronics industries in the
last decade have been generated
by a largely state-financed tech
nology. I used Hewlett-Packard
to illustrate this, in preference

to, say, the computer companies
around Stanford, for two rea
sons:
11) It is one of the most prof
itable corporations in one of the
fields that is most heavily .state
subsidised. (About 05 per cent
ol research in the electrical
electronic industries is govern
ment financed.)
(21 It has a particularly close
relationship with Stanford (It
was founded by Stanford gradu
ates, now Trustees. It is on Stan
ford land, etc.)
If Mr. Cowan thinks the gen
erosity of Messrs. Hewlett and
Packard and the other owners
ol technical corporations has
paid back the cost of the tech
nology I can assure him that he
is wrong. Furthermore, their
control over a large part of the
profits that this University
earns means that what the uni
versity does remove, in the
form of tax-deductible grants,

tends to be tiod to particular
uses. That is why this Univer
sity has a superabundance of
new buildings and no monov for
TA's.
I should like to say one more
thing. It is very unpleasant to
be called a fanatic and a para
noid by somebody whose re
sponse to my article was so evi
dently clouded by his own emo
tions.
