# SDS At Stanford
## 'You Say You Want A Revolution' Analysis 
### PHILIP TAUBMAN (First of two articles) 
In the Branner Hall dining
room tables have been pushed
toward the wall and chairs scat
tered in the vague outline of a
semi-circle. Dinner ended an
hour ago. Now about 100 stu
dents are discussing, arguing
and planning. Their topic: revo
lution, not in 1776, 1848, or 1917.
Revolution in 1968.
Students for a Democratic So
ciety (SDS) is meeting.
The students in SDS dream
about a revolution which will
someday sweep the world to
ward "democratic socialism" and
a more humanistic society. In
Branner they are not dreaming.
They are talking about today
and tomorrow at Stanford, at
Lytton Plaza, in Oakland, in
Vietnam. They are talking tac
tics and philosophy for action
and education at Stanford.
Chapter Growing
Across the nation at Columbia,
Wisconsin and Berkeley or Har
vard, Princeton and Yale, other
chapters of SDS are meeting
and growing. Last spring there
were at most 20 members of
SDS at Stanford. Today there
are more than 150.
With growth have come prob
lems, internal and external. Rad
icals at Stanford join SDS but
do not agree on goals or tactics.
Liberals, moderates, and con

servatives in the Universitj
simply do not agree with any
thing like SDS.
SDS exists in a community at
Stanford that often fears and
distrusts the shapp and practice
of a radical movement. SDS
must constantly respond and re
late to these feelings, continually

altering immediate tactics and
broad strategic outlines to best
take advantage of the Stanford
environment.
In the fundamental area of a
guiding philosophy, there is
little disagreement among the
members of SDS. Once beyond
the distant goals, however, mem
bers have diverse feelings about
how SDS should operate.
"Democratic Socialism"
"Democratic 'socialism" is the
key phrase in SDS jargon about
long range goals. Among twenty
members of SDS interviewed by
The Daily, there was almost
complete agreement that "demo
cratic socialism" would help
solve the ills of the world.
Definitions of "democratic so
cialism" vary slightly from
member to member. Mark Paul,

a junior who joined SDS this
fall, says,"I think it's a some
what fuzzy vision. We're not
talking about English or Swed
ish socialism or socialism in the
Soviet Union. The essential con
cept is participatory democracy.
Decision haking should be made
on a community level, not as a
centralized function of govern
ment."
David Pugh, also a junior,
comments, "The American sys
tem is a representative democ
racy—the people are repre
sented—but the cards are
stacked. I think we need a social
democracy. Who owns the media
today? Who owns the factories?
SDS seeks a very decentralized
socialist economic system."
Deep Alienation
The desire for changing eco
nomic, political and social sys
tems springs from a deep sense
of alienation among the mem
bers of SDS. They say they have
seen too much war, too much
police brutaility, too much star
vation, too much injustice, and
too little response in the Ameri
can system. They are concerned,
as some say, "about the common
man, the worker, who is at the
bottom of the ladder."
It does not appear to be an
accident that young people
sharing these attitudes have
found the university a common

gathering place. It seems, in
fact, that universities are parti
ally responsible for increasing
the sensitivities and alienation
of students.
The great majority of SDS
members evolved to an SDS
point of view while at Stanford.
In some sense, Stanford has
created SDS. Myron Filene, a
junior in philosophy, describes
the reasons, "At a university,
people get away from home for
the first time. They get away
from their past and see where
they stand in relation to the
world, the whole world, not just
their own little world.' '
"I've Gotten An Overview"
He continues, "At Stanford I
stepped outside my life and have
seen things in a new way. I've
gotten an overview. If you can
get outside the framework of
where you're at, then you can
begin to feel, not just under
stand."
Nancy Oswald is a junior ma
joring in political science.
Though not a member of SDS,
she sympathizes with its goals.
She too points to her coming to
Stanford as the key influence in
radicalizing her views. She says,
"I've seen that everything I was
taught as right and valid is not
the unquenstionable truth, in
cluding what I was taught about
how to change society. Stanford
opens your eyes."
If being at Stanford helps rad
icalize a student, it also gives
him an immediate target for
spreading his newly discovered
radicalism. For the typical SDS
member, Stanford offers two
fronts, people and institutions.
Once a radical yourself, SDS
members feel, it is incumbent
upon you to radicalize people in
the surrounding environment, if
not the environment itself.
Pugh, for example, thinks, "SDS
directs its demands toward uni
versities because we are in uni
versities and because places
such as Stanford are the hub
of many imperialistic ventures.
"It's too early to know
whether we can radicalize upper
middle class students. We will
try, and Stanford, as a ruling
class school, is the logical place
to begin."
Pugh feels that SDS should
direct its strongest efforts at
students. Others in SDS feel the
institutions at Stanford should
be the key goal. Though propon

ents of either goal say the goals
are not mutually exclusive, this
issue has been a divisive one
during fall meetings of SDS.
Students First
The question seems to be tem
porarily resolved in favor of try
ing to radicalize students. The
issue however does not appear
to have been eternally silenced.
The problem of choosing goals
is an example o finternal dnd ex
ternal SDS politics.
SDS began the year in search
of a set of demands which would
mobilize support for their im
mediate implementation, and,
concurrently, would appeal to a
large segment of the campus,
thus increasing interest: and pos
sible membership in SDS.
Healthy Demands Wanted
Furthermore, SDS wanted de
mands which would be healthy
to the internal state of SDS.
Members hoped that demands
could be formed which would
provide a focal point for SDS
activities and would bring to
gether members of SDS in a
tighter community.
Demands were eventually
formed around Stanford's in
volvement in Southeast Asia,
with special emphasis on the
policies of the Stanford Re
search Institute. The final pro
duct was tacked on the door of
the Stanford Trustees and SDS
moved into immediate action
seeking a confrontation with the
policies of SRI.
Many weeks later, most mem
bers of SDS feel the demands
were largely a failure on all ac
counts. The appeals for change
were not immediately imple
mented, they did not attract
either fast mobilization or long
term interest in the student
body, and finally, they created
disagreement and problems in
SDS.
"A Total Bust"
Several members of SDS call
the experience "a total bust."
The evident reasons for failure,
they say, were the overly gen
eral and off-campus nature of
the demands.
Internally, the failure left SDS
members questioning the basic
nature of SDS. Only a minority
of SDS members had taken ac
tive interest in the demands and
it soon became clear to people
that SDS was itself in need of
some community feeling.
Antagonism toward Mondny
evening meetings increased with
calls for fewer large meetings
and more small gatherings in
which SDS members could get to
know each other. These small
meetings are now a frequent
occurrence.
Some Members Unhappy
Such a change in emphasis,
however, leaves some members
unhappy. They feel SDS needs
the reinforcement of a confron
tation to increase the confidence
of members in the powers of
radicalism. While small meet
ings proceed, then, some mem
bers are looking for "a hot
issue." These members seem to

feel the arrival of President Pit
zer on Dec. 1 will "invigorate"
campus polities. No specific of
fensive, however, has been de
vised.
In the external arena, SDS has
turned the greater part of its
attention toward educating stu
dents rather than radicalizing
them via the shock method of
confrontation politics. Discus
sions are planned in residences
led by SDS members, and, at
present SDS is showing a large

repertory of films which reveal
the non mass-media side of Viet
nam, the convention demonstra
tion last fall at the Pentagon.
