## Recurring Crises In World Currencies 
### THOMAS C. DAWSON II 
International monetary crises
will continue to plague us "like
earthquakes every few months,"
according to Lorie Tarshis, ex
ecutive head of Stanford's eco
nomics department.
- The latest crisis, involving in
part the relative values of the
German mark and French franc,
arose last week with the heavy
sale of French francs and the
related movement of funds into
marks. The dumping of francs
came out of both speculation and
worry over the health of the

French economy. The economy's
growth has been throttled over
the last several months.
French President De Gaulle
has blamed the student riots and
strike of last spring for the
present crisis, but Prof. Tarshis
discounts this. "The strikes
raised the price level and accel
erated the balance-of-payments
problem, but the problem still
existed," Tarshis believes.
Most observers had expected
De Gaulle to devalue the franc
in an effort to cure the balance
of-payments problems. Accord

ing to theory, devaluation en
courages exports and discour
ages imports by making the
country's currency cheaper rela
tive to other countries' curren
cies.
Imports are thereby made
more expensive and foreigners
have additional incentive to buy
export goods. Other things being
equal, this has the effect of eas
ing the balance-of-payments de
ficit.
Rarely Equal
The trouble is that "other
things" are rarely equal, and de
valuations are often accompa
nied by rises in the domestic
price level which cancel (or near
ly cancel) the beneficial effects
of a devaluation.
De Gaulle has attempted to
cure France's problems by im
posing strict controls on prices,
wages and foreign currency ex
change. He has also announced
a large cutback in government
spending. These are measures
which are often imposed along
with devaluation in an effort to
hold the price level down.
The French leader, however,
has ruled out the possibility of
unilateral devaluation. Some ob
servers, including Prof. Tarshis,
attribute much of this reluctance
to De Gaulle's pride. A unilateral
devaluation would appear to
many, including De Gaulle, to be
a sign of weakness. "He doesn't
want to be pinned with the onus
of being the only one devaluing,"
says Tarshis.
Most observers are unsure
whether De Gaulle's attempt to
stave off devaluation will meet
with success.
End Result
Tarshis believes the franc will
not be devalued in the near fu
ture but that more monetary cri
ses will arise in coming months.
The end result may well be
something De Gaulle has been
hoping for, a widespread deval
uation of currencies, making
France bear less of the burden
of blame for devaluation.
West Germany, another coun
try closely involved in the latest
crisis, is in the unusual position
of having too much foreign ex
change. The "normal" position in
recent years has been for coun
tries to have foreign currency
shortages, which could be cured,
in theory, by devaluation.
Germany's position is one of
strength. There is no fiscal weak
ness in Germany's position that
would force action. What De
Gaulle and some economists

wanted was an appreciation of
the mark. This would work op
positively from a devaluation,
making imports cheaper and ex
ports more expensive.
The effect, again other things
equal, would be to raise imports
and curb exports, thus lessening
the balance-of-payments surplus,
and, hopefully, helping France
and other needy countries.
Germany Declines
Germany understandably de
clined to appreciate her curren
cy, leaving the move up to
France.
At a meeting of treasury and
central bank officials last week
end, credits totalling more than
$2 billion were given France. The
expectation was that these cred
its would be used to tide France
over while she underwent read
justment after devaluation. De
Gaulle's refusal to devalue
stunned the financial and eco
nomic world.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry
Fowler apparently expressed the
official U.S. position when he
"applauded" De Gaulle's action.
Prof. Tarshis thinks devaluation
would have been preferrable,
"I'm scared of the alternatives."
Tarshis feels the crisis in the fu
ture will be aggravated by the
French stand, j
CritieaJ of Fowler
Tarshis is particularly critical
of Fowler's stand. "I hope he's a
better lawyer than economist,"
Tarshis said yesterday. Fowler
was an attorney before assum
ing the treasury post.
Tarshis is pessimistic over
chances to change radically the
international monetary system.
Many have urged a summit con
ference on the monetary prob
lem with an aim toward intro
ducing more flexibility into the
system.
Presently, all currencies have
set values in relation to the dol
lar and crises often arise over
currencies that are weak and
cannot keep their relative posi
tion. The only alternative, other
than stop-gap loans, is usually
devaluation.
There are many alternatives
put forth, ranging from "float
ing exchange rates," where mar
ket forces (supply and demand)
determine relative worth, to
wider use of "Special Drawing
Rights" which are used like
loans to tide countries over cri
ses.
But best estimates are that
"earthquakes" will keep on
coming.
