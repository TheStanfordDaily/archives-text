PARIS (AP) — President
Charles de Gaulle received hope
ful reports from money markets
Monday on his decision to keep
the franc intact and backed up
his gamble by sending France's
toughest shock police to block
any outward flow of currency.

While stocks and the franc
were moving up on the reopened
Paris exchanges, and the franc
firmed in Zurich, De Gaulle or
dered squads of the black-capped
Companie Republicaine de Se
curite, France's elite police, to
the nation's borders. They will
help enforce a series of severe
new exchange regulations.
Buffeted for two weeks in a
storm of speculation, the franc
reached its highest level since
the May-June crisis. This seemed
to French officials to reflect con
fidence in De Gaulle's program
for escaping devaluation by "tak
ing hold of ourselves" at home.
Reaction from foreign capi
tals, however, was still cautious
with some bankers still main
taining restrictions on trading
their francs.
