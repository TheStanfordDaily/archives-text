# Czech Liberalization Spurs New Economic Expansion
## 
### CHARLIE JONAS 
"The situation in Czechoslo
vakia is much more complicated
than it seems," stated Dr. Jaro
slav Jirasek, Director of the
Czech Institute of Management.
"To undertake such huge re
forms is not an easy stroll.
Rather, it is a desperate fight."
Dr. Jirasek, now on his first
visit to the United States, spent
Nov. 7 and 8 with members of
the Stanford community. He is
now traveling alone, taking a
break from leading 45 Czech in
dustrial managers around the
country.

The Institute which he directs
engages in four principal areas
of activity: research, training,
consulting, and the dissemina
tion of information in the field
of industrial management. Its
income is derived principally
from its own activities; a gov
ernment subsidy provides the
remainder.
But when government gives
money, it tries to direct at least
in part where that money shall
be spent. So, says Dr. Jirasek,
"we are trying to go ahead with
our reforms, but would rather
not have the government at
tached. We would rather be sup
ported directly by our indus
tries."
Long-Range Plans
The reforms of which he
spoke were planned when he
was director for the long-range
planning of not only the Czech
economy but also of science,
health, and education. The plans
covered a ten-to-fifteen-year
period.
"We had the plans," explained
Jirasek, "but it was impossible
to develop the right techniques
for implementation within the
existing political framework."
He left the organization after
long disagreements with the
government.
With Alexander Dubcek's rise
to the Prime Ministry, the long
sought reforms could begin. But
there were still difficulties. "If
you spoke of reforms, you most
ly meant theoreticians," said Jir
asek. It was necessary to "join
together the brilliant ideas with
the energy of the people. This is
the political art."
Need For Scientific Progress
"We want to join science,
management, and the working
people together. But we must
have scientific advancement. It
is the necessity of life. But this
is not enough itself." To bridge

the gap between theory and im
plementation, four degrees of
the revolution developed.
The first of these was of
course the intellectuals: profes
sors, journalists, scientists. At
this level the reforms were de
veloped. From there, they
spread to the level of produc
tion and management. But it
was not until August that the
involvement of the workers and
farmers was achieved.
Unusual Revolution
The history of Czechoslovakia
within the last nine months is of
great historical interest. It is
one of the few countries in
which a revolution started with
in the party in power and did
not lead to an eventual split in
that party. Rather, the revolu
tion served to bring the Com
munist structure and the rest
of the nation closer together.
The Soviet Union has yet been
unable to divide the country
once again.
Certainly one of the more im
portant factors involved in the
liberalization, according to Dr.
Jirasek, was the great number
of intellectuals in key positions
within the structure of the
party. Most officers of the Cen
tral Committee have the highest
university degrees. Dr. Jirasek
is no exception, having his doc
torate in Business Administra
tion and Management from the
Prague Institute of Technology.
More Educated Leaders
"In the 50's, people of almost
no education were in positions
of power not recommended by
their education and experience.
Some proved quite good, having
a natural skill for leadership."
Most officials began attending
university classes during the
afternoons and evenings. Those
that did not gradually disap
peared, not being capable of
management or leadership.

economy but also of science,
health, and education. The plans
covered a ten-to-fifteen-year
period.
"We had the plans," explained
Jirasek, "but it was impossible
to develop the right techniques
for implementation within the
existing political framework."
He left the organization after
long disagreements with the
government.
With Alexander Dubcek's rise
to the Prime Ministry, the long
sought reforms could begin. But
there were still difficulties. "If
you spoke of reforms, you most
ly meant theoreticians," said Jir
asek. It was necessary to "join
together the brilliant ideas with
the energy of the people. This is
the political art."
Need For Scientific Progress
"We want to join science,
management, and the working
people together. But we must
have scientific advancement. It
is the necessity of life. But this
is not enough itself." To bridge

the gap between theory and im
plementation, four degrees of
the revolution developed.
The first of these was of
course the intellectuals: profes
sors, journalists, scientists. At
this level the reforms were de
veloped. From there, they
spread to the level of produc
tion and management. But it
was not until August that the
involvement of the workers and
farmers was achieved.
Unusual Revolution
The history of Czechoslovakia
within the last nine months is of
great historical interest. It is
one of the few countries in
which a revolution started with
in the party in power and did
not lead to an eventual split in
that party. Rather, the revolu
tion served to bring the Com
munist structure and the rest
of the nation closer together.
The Soviet Union has yet been
unable to divide the country
once again.
Certainly one of the more im
portant factors involved in the
liberalization, according to Dr.
Jirasek, was the great number
of intellectuals in key positions
within the structure of the
party. Most officers of the Cen
tral Committee have the highest
university degrees. Dr. Jirasek
is no exception, having his doc
torate in Business Administra
tion and Management from the
Prague Institute of Technology.
More Educated Leaders
"In the 50's, people of almost
no education were in positions
of power not recommended by
their education and experience.
Some proved quite good, having
a natural skill for leadership."
Most officials began attending
university classes during the
afternoons and evenings. Those
that did not gradually disap
peared, not being capable of
management or leadership.
"The situation in Czechoslo
vakia is much more complicated
than it seems," stated Dr. Jaro
slav Jirasek, Director of the
Czech Institute of Management.
"To undertake such huge re
forms is not an easy stroll.
Rather, it is a desperate fight."
Dr. Jirasek, now on his first
visit to the United States, spent
Nov. 7 and 8 with members of
the Stanford community. He is
now traveling alone, taking a
break from leading 45 Czech in
dustrial managers around the
country.

The Institute which he directs
engages in four principal areas
of activity: research, training,
consulting, and the dissemina
tion of information in the field
of industrial management. Its
income is derived principally
from its own activities; a gov
ernment subsidy provides the
remainder.
But when government gives
money, it tries to direct at least
in part where that money shall
be spent. So, says Dr. Jirasek,
"we are trying to go ahead with
our reforms, but would rather
not have the government at
tached. We would rather be sup
ported directly by our indus
tries."
