# Villanova Wins Again
## Harriers 2nd In Nation 
### GARY CAVALLI 
A year marked by broken rec
ords and an unbroken string of
dual-meet victories ended sensa
tionally for the Stanford cross
country team Monday in New
York.
Participating in their first na
tional meet, Coach Marshall
Clark's Indians corralled a sec
ond-place finish behind Villano
va. The Tribe wound up with
101 points to 78 for the defend
ing champions from Villanova,
who won their third straight na
tional title.
Brook Thomas paced the Stan
ford effort, as he has all year,
with an excellent 30:05 clocking
over the six-mile course for a
17th place finish. Junior Greg
Brock was right on his heels,

checking in 20th with a time of
30:07.
Senior Allen Sanford finished
29th, while promising sopho
more Don Kardong placed 39th
and Chuck Menz ran 71st. Sixth
man Bob Anchondo, whose posi
tion did not count in team stand
ings, wound up 88th.
Tribe All-Americans
By virtue of their finish in the
nation's top 20, both Thomas
and Brock automatically landed
berths on the Ail-American
cross-country team.
Tom Donnelly sparked the
Villanova victory with an eighth
place finish in 29:58. Donnelly's
actual position for the purposes
of team standings was third,
however, because five of those
finishing ahead of him did not
compete with a complete team.

The other members of the
championship Villanova contin
gent were Dick Buerkle (22nd),
Dell McCormack (29th), Chris
Mason (36th) and Frank Mur
phy (47th).
Junior Mike Ryan of the Air
Force won the individual cham
pionship by 60 yards over Steve
Stageberg of Georgetown. Ryan
clocked 29:17, breaking the old
course record by over 40 sec
onds. Actually the top nine fin
ishers all cracked the previous
standard.
Former Stanford Student
Ryan, who was a star miler
at Wilcox High School in Santa
Clara, attended Stanford as a
freshman before transferring to
the Air Force Academy in the
fall of 1967. Unbeaten in nine
dual meets this season, Ryan
had competed at Van Courtland
earlier this year in a special
meet with St. John's, arranged
by his coach Arne Arneson to
make him familiar with the
course.
Rain Sunday night made the
course "sorta mushy," according
to Stanford coach Marshall
Clark, who telephoned the re
sults to Tribe track coach Pay
ton Jordan yesterday morning.
The race was run on the three
mile Van Courtland freshman
course, with the 233 runners
covering two laps each. 217 men
finished the championship race,
held in the East for the first
time.
