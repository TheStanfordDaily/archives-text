# Dislocations Down Cal IM Champs
## 
### 
Quarterback Mike Evans led
the Dislocations to a 22-14 vic
tory over Cal's intramural foot
ball champions, the Theta Delts,
Saturday morning in Berkeley.
The Dislocations got off to a
quick 14-0 lead in the IM Big
Game on two Evans touchdown
passes. Evans hit Larry Barrett
with a 10-yard scoring strike,
and followed with another TD
aerial to Bud West, a 15-yarder.
The first conversion attempt
failed, but Evans connected with
Barrett for two points after
the second tally.
Cal's Theta Delts came back
on a 40-yard interception re
turn by Joe Acker to make it
14-6, and added a two-point con
version to cut the Stanford lead
to 14-8.
But Evans flipped a screen
pass to Bruce Busching, and

Busching sped 50 yards for what
turned out to be the decisive
touchdown. The Dislocations'
quarterback again went to Bar
rett for the two-pointer, making
it 22-8.

The Theta Delts scored early
in the second half to cut the
lead to 22-14, but the Disloca
tions' defense rose to the occas
ion late in the game to shut off
the Cal contingent three times
inside the 10 yard line.
