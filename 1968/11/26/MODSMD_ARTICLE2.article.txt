# Administration Meets TA Salary Demands
## 
### MARK WEINBERGER 
The administration moved yes
terday to meet teaching assis
tant (TA) demands for immed
iate salary raises, but accept
ance of the proposal remained
uncertain.
Provost Richard Lyman said
$22,450 in reserve funds would
be activated to provide grants
in-aid relief this year for de
partments "with the most acute
problems."
The supplementary funds will
make available starting in Jan
uary, $200 per TA to each of
the six units judged "urgent
cases" by a recent administra
tion study.
Political science TA's, who
first issued the demands last
month, were slated to meet late
last night to consider Lyman's
proposal. Acceptance by this
group-—consid red to be the
most militant—would assure an
end to talk of a TA strike.
Strike Vote?
However, rejection of the ad
ministration's proposal by the
political science TA's would
mean that a strike vote will be
taken at tonight's graduate stu
dent union m eting.
The 170-member American
Federation of Teachers Local
1816 voted at a meeting last
week to hold a secret ballot
strike vote if no settlem nt of
the demands was reached by
meeting time—B p.m. tonight in
Room 300, Engineering Corner.
Union membership has risen
appreciably in the past few
w eks in anticipation of a pos
sible rejection of administration
counter-offers to the demands.
Passage of a strike vote could
paralyze the University, union
organizers claim. Besides a call
for all teaching assistants to re
fuse to teach, t ntative approval
was given recently by the Santa
Clara County Labor Council to
the application of strike sanc
tions to the University.
Afternoon Meeting
Lyman disclosed the counter
proposal to recent demands at a
hastily-called m eting yesterday
afternoon with TA's, administra
tors, and several deans and de
partment heads.
Departments and grants-in-aid
figures were announced by Ly
man in a memorandum to deans
and department heads as fol
lows: English, $9,800; French
and Italian, $3,000; G rman,
$3,230; Political Science, $2,000;
Spanish and Portugese, $2,400;
and undergraduate special in
"racism and prejudice," $2,000.
Distribution of these funds
was left to departmental discre
tion. That left the possibility
that additional TA's could be
hired by some departments rath
er than a pay increase for cur
rent TA's.
The money will be drawn from
from departmental, school, and
provost reserve funds.
Raise For Next Year
At the same time, Lyman re
affirmed the University's com
mitment to provide a .$lOO pay
increase next year for all full
time TA's, which went part way

in meeting political science TA
demands for an immediate $700
per year salary raise plus a
dependent allowance.
Lyman noted that planned in
creases in faculty and adminis
tration salaries next year have
been scaled down to provide the
$160,000 to cover the teaching as
sistant stipend increaces.
Lyman declared that he was
"angry" over the tactics used by
graduate students to make
known their grievances. "We
need to think through the notion
of academic trade unionism," he
declared.
The provost added that given
the short strike deadline declared
by the TA negotiators, the ad
ministration had "called upon
the University's reserves as fair
ly, equitably, and safely as pos
sible."
TA's Upset
After the meeting, political sci
ence TA leader Richard Young
claimed that his group was
"quite mad."
"We were expecting more
money," Young explained. "We
had been led to believe that a
larger pay increase would occur
this year. That is why we have
to go back to the TA's (for last
night's political science meeting)

to see if they will accept the ad
ministration offer."
Young also expressed concern
over the method of funding for
increased stipends this year.
"The raise in our department
will come from administration
or political science department
sourres. If the poltical science de
partment has to shoulder the en
tire burden for our raise, it
might mean the curtailment of
some departmental academic en
terprises."
Sweeping Study
At the meeting, Lyman noted
the need for a "thorough re
view" of the role, work load,
and compensation of the gradu
ate student with teaching re
sponsibilities. He asked that the
study be completed by the end
of Winter Quarter.
The need for the study was
borne out, he explained, by a
preliminary survey of TA prac
tices within departments which
showed "an enormous variety"
of TA standards. This great di
versity stemmed from "depart
mental autonomy run wild," he
asserted.
Lyman said the survey showed
that TA's in some departments
such as English were "carrying
an entire course on their back,"
others had "significant teaching

loads" as section leaders, while
a third group did little more
than grade papers and hold of
fice hours.
The memorandum claimed
that "in a university like Stan
ford, it should not take the
threat of a strike to get us
working together to solve prob
lems in which we all have a vi
tal stake."
Proper Attention
"We verge already on invok
ing the self-fulfilling prophecy
that only demands and emer
gencies receive proper atten
tion.
"We must develop ways of
seeking change that widens par
ticipation, insures attention to
the full range of relevant con
siderations, and produce conclu
sions which can command con
sent on the basis of substance
rather than through the power
of the proposer," Lyman's mem
orandum concluded.
A tense moment occurred at
the meeting when most of po
litical science TA's entered the
conference room. Lyman chal
lenged their attendance, but they
replied that they only wished to
listen. They were permitted to
remain.

group-—consid red to be the
most militant—would assure an
end to talk of a TA strike.
Strike Vote?
However, rejection of the ad
ministration's proposal by the
political science TA's would
mean that a strike vote will be
taken at tonight's graduate stu
dent union m eting.
The 170-member American
Federation of Teachers Local
1816 voted at a meeting last
week to hold a secret ballot
strike vote if no settlem nt of
the demands was reached by
meeting time—B p.m. tonight in
Room 300, Engineering Corner.
Union membership has risen
appreciably in the past few
w eks in anticipation of a pos
sible rejection of administration
counter-offers to the demands.
Passage of a strike vote could
paralyze the University, union
organizers claim. Besides a call
for all teaching assistants to re
fuse to teach, t ntative approval
was given recently by the Santa
Clara County Labor Council to
the application of strike sanc
tions to the University.
Afternoon Meeting
Lyman disclosed the counter
proposal to recent demands at a
hastily-called m eting yesterday
afternoon with TA's, administra
tors, and several deans and de
partment heads.
Departments and grants-in-aid
figures were announced by Ly
man in a memorandum to deans
and department heads as fol
lows: English, $9,800; French
and Italian, $3,000; G rman,
$3,230; Political Science, $2,000;
Spanish and Portugese, $2,400;
and undergraduate special in
"racism and prejudice," $2,000.
Distribution of these funds
was left to departmental discre
tion. That left the possibility
that additional TA's could be
hired by some departments rath
er than a pay increase for cur
rent TA's.
The money will be drawn from
from departmental, school, and
provost reserve funds.
Raise For Next Year
At the same time, Lyman re
affirmed the University's com
mitment to provide a .$lOO pay
increase next year for all full
time TA's, which went part way

in meeting political science TA
demands for an immediate $700
per year salary raise plus a
dependent allowance.
Lyman noted that planned in
creases in faculty and adminis
tration salaries next year have
been scaled down to provide the
$160,000 to cover the teaching as
sistant stipend increaces.
Lyman declared that he was
"angry" over the tactics used by
graduate students to make
known their grievances. "We
need to think through the notion
of academic trade unionism," he
declared.
The provost added that given
the short strike deadline declared
by the TA negotiators, the ad
ministration had "called upon
the University's reserves as fair
ly, equitably, and safely as pos
sible."
TA's Upset
After the meeting, political sci
ence TA leader Richard Young
claimed that his group was
"quite mad."
"We were expecting more
money," Young explained. "We
had been led to believe that a
larger pay increase would occur
this year. That is why we have
to go back to the TA's (for last
night's political science meeting)

to see if they will accept the ad
ministration offer."
Young also expressed concern
over the method of funding for
increased stipends this year.
"The raise in our department
will come from administration
or political science department
sourres. If the poltical science de
partment has to shoulder the en
tire burden for our raise, it
might mean the curtailment of
some departmental academic en
terprises."
Sweeping Study
At the meeting, Lyman noted
the need for a "thorough re
view" of the role, work load,
and compensation of the gradu
ate student with teaching re
sponsibilities. He asked that the
study be completed by the end
of Winter Quarter.
The need for the study was
borne out, he explained, by a
preliminary survey of TA prac
tices within departments which
showed "an enormous variety"
of TA standards. This great di
versity stemmed from "depart
mental autonomy run wild," he
asserted.
Lyman said the survey showed
that TA's in some departments
such as English were "carrying
an entire course on their back,"
others had "significant teaching

loads" as section leaders, while
a third group did little more
than grade papers and hold of
fice hours.
The memorandum claimed
that "in a university like Stan
ford, it should not take the
threat of a strike to get us
working together to solve prob
lems in which we all have a vi
tal stake."
Proper Attention
"We verge already on invok
ing the self-fulfilling prophecy
that only demands and emer
gencies receive proper atten
tion.
"We must develop ways of
seeking change that widens par
ticipation, insures attention to
the full range of relevant con
siderations, and produce conclu
sions which can command con
sent on the basis of substance
rather than through the power
of the proposer," Lyman's mem
orandum concluded.
A tense moment occurred at
the meeting when most of po
litical science TA's entered the
conference room. Lyman chal
lenged their attendance, but they
replied that they only wished to
listen. They were permitted to
remain.
The administration moved yes
terday to meet teaching assis
tant (TA) demands for immed
iate salary raises, but accept
ance of the proposal remained
uncertain.
Provost Richard Lyman said
$22,450 in reserve funds would
be activated to provide grants
in-aid relief this year for de
partments "with the most acute
problems."
The supplementary funds will
make available starting in Jan
uary, $200 per TA to each of
the six units judged "urgent
cases" by a recent administra
tion study.
Political science TA's, who
first issued the demands last
month, were slated to meet late
last night to consider Lyman's
proposal. Acceptance by this
group-—consid red to be the
most militant—would assure an
end to talk of a TA strike.

counter-offers to the demands.
Passage of a strike vote could
paralyze the University, union
organizers claim. Besides a call
for all teaching assistants to re
fuse to teach, t ntative approval
was given recently by the Santa
Clara County Labor Council to
the application of strike sanc
tions to the University.
Afternoon Meeting
Lyman disclosed the counter
proposal to recent demands at a
hastily-called m eting yesterday
afternoon with TA's, administra
tors, and several deans and de
partment heads.
Departments and grants-in-aid
figures were announced by Ly
man in a memorandum to deans
and department heads as fol
lows: English, $9,800; French
and Italian, $3,000; G rman,
$3,230; Political Science, $2,000;
Spanish and Portugese, $2,400;
and undergraduate special in
"racism and prejudice," $2,000.
Distribution of these funds
was left to departmental discre
tion. That left the possibility
that additional TA's could be
hired by some departments rath
er than a pay increase for cur
rent TA's.
The money will be drawn from
from departmental, school, and
provost reserve funds.
Raise For Next Year
At the same time, Lyman re
affirmed the University's com
mitment to provide a .$lOO pay
increase next year for all full
time TA's, which went part way

in meeting political science TA
demands for an immediate $700
per year salary raise plus a
dependent allowance.
Lyman noted that planned in
creases in faculty and adminis
tration salaries next year have
been scaled down to provide the
$160,000 to cover the teaching as
sistant stipend increaces.
Lyman declared that he was
"angry" over the tactics used by
graduate students to make
known their grievances. "We
need to think through the notion
of academic trade unionism," he
declared.
The provost added that given
the short strike deadline declared
by the TA negotiators, the ad
ministration had "called upon
the University's reserves as fair
ly, equitably, and safely as pos
sible."
TA's Upset
After the meeting, political sci
ence TA leader Richard Young
claimed that his group was
"quite mad."
"We were expecting more
money," Young explained. "We
had been led to believe that a
larger pay increase would occur
this year. That is why we have
to go back to the TA's (for last
night's political science meeting)

to see if they will accept the ad
ministration offer."
Young also expressed concern
over the method of funding for
increased stipends this year.
"The raise in our department
will come from administration
or political science department
sourres. If the poltical science de
partment has to shoulder the en
tire burden for our raise, it
might mean the curtailment of
some departmental academic en
terprises."
Sweeping Study
At the meeting, Lyman noted
the need for a "thorough re
view" of the role, work load,
and compensation of the gradu
ate student with teaching re
sponsibilities. He asked that the
study be completed by the end
of Winter Quarter.
The need for the study was
borne out, he explained, by a
preliminary survey of TA prac
tices within departments which
showed "an enormous variety"
of TA standards. This great di
versity stemmed from "depart
mental autonomy run wild," he
asserted.
Lyman said the survey showed
that TA's in some departments
such as English were "carrying
an entire course on their back,"
others had "significant teaching

loads" as section leaders, while
a third group did little more
than grade papers and hold of
fice hours.
The memorandum claimed
that "in a university like Stan
ford, it should not take the
threat of a strike to get us
working together to solve prob
lems in which we all have a vi
tal stake."
Proper Attention
"We verge already on invok
ing the self-fulfilling prophecy
that only demands and emer
gencies receive proper atten
tion.
"We must develop ways of
seeking change that widens par
ticipation, insures attention to
the full range of relevant con
siderations, and produce conclu
sions which can command con
sent on the basis of substance
rather than through the power
of the proposer," Lyman's mem
orandum concluded.
A tense moment occurred at
the meeting when most of po
litical science TA's entered the
conference room. Lyman chal
lenged their attendance, but they
replied that they only wished to
listen. They were permitted to
remain.
The administration moved yes
terday to meet teaching assis
tant (TA) demands for immed
iate salary raises, but accept
ance of the proposal remained
uncertain.
Provost Richard Lyman said
$22,450 in reserve funds would
be activated to provide grants
in-aid relief this year for de
partments "with the most acute
problems."
The supplementary funds will
make available starting in Jan
uary, $200 per TA to each of
the six units judged "urgent
cases" by a recent administra
tion study.
Political science TA's, who
first issued the demands last
month, were slated to meet late
last night to consider Lyman's
proposal. Acceptance by this
group-—consid red to be the
most militant—would assure an
end to talk of a TA strike.
Strike Vote?
However, rejection of the ad
ministration's proposal by the
political science TA's would
mean that a strike vote will be
taken at tonight's graduate stu
dent union m eting.
The 170-member American
Federation of Teachers Local
1816 voted at a meeting last
week to hold a secret ballot
strike vote if no settlem nt of
the demands was reached by
meeting time—B p.m. tonight in
Room 300, Engineering Corner.
Union membership has risen
appreciably in the past few
w eks in anticipation of a pos
sible rejection of administration
counter-offers to the demands.
Passage of a strike vote could
paralyze the University, union
organizers claim. Besides a call
for all teaching assistants to re

was given recently by the Santa
