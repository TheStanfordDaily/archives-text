For the sake of clarification, the Daily Sports Department hereby
severs all connections with the Editorial Board.
Monday's editorial, entitled '"Big Game Dying," was the straw
that broke the camel's back, so to speak. The persistence of these
radicals in condemning university athletics has reached such mag
nitude that it demands retaliation.
The pompous air assumed by the author (who is now hiding in
Haight-Ashbury) in referring scornfully to "pom pon sex symbols
in short skirts ... a pitiable sight . . . anachronisms of an age
gone by" only emphasizes the fact that it is this type of attitude,
rather than Big Game fever, which is in need of "evolution" if it is
to survive.
We could point out that over 75,000 fans fought their way through
the smog and traffic in Berkeley to see the Big Game. Does this
indicate that for "the majority of us . . . all it stood for is dead," as
the edit writer would have us believe? And if the turnout at Fri
day night's rally was not overwhelming, it could have been because
the Daily news staff saw fit not to publicize the bonfire and list
the time it began.
We could point out that it is just the type of dedication and
self-discipline stressed in athletics which is sorely needed by those
who set themselves up as god-like critics of all the university's ills.
The members of the Dally Editorial Board claim to be supporters
of civil rights, brotherhood, and equality among men. Yet they ig
nore the fact that it is on the athletic field that men of all races,
creeds, and colors compete on the same level without prejudice.
Perhaps the trouble stems from the activists' own unfamiliarity
with athletics. To most of those on the Editorial Board, the term
"fumble" refers to missing the handoff on an illegal marijuana sale.
The closest most of them have ever come to a football game is
when they joined a sit-in protesting the use of the word "yippee"
by an excited fan. It seems they thought the fan was referring to
student activists in a derogatory manner.
No, despite what you may read on the Daily editorial page, tho
Big Game isn't dying. What is dying is the type of inane, anti
athletic propaganda circulated by the Editorial Board.

INK BOWL ACTION —Stanford quarterback Slingshot Jones looks
downfield for receiver Mercury Meredith, as DAILY business man
ager Len Costello provides the pass protection. Jones' passes to
Meredith, Costello, and Casaba Cavalli sparked the DAILY staff to
an early 12-7 lead, but the Cal eleven battled back for a 26-18 vic
tory. Tradition was upheld for the 69th time, however, as the
school which lost the Ink Bowl won the Big Game.

Haight-Ashbury) in referring scornfully to "pom pon sex symbols
in short skirts ... a pitiable sight . . . anachronisms of an age
gone by" only emphasizes the fact that it is this type of attitude,
rather than Big Game fever, which is in need of "evolution" if it is
to survive.
We could point out that over 75,000 fans fought their way through
the smog and traffic in Berkeley to see the Big Game. Does this
indicate that for "the majority of us . . . all it stood for is dead," as
the edit writer would have us believe? And if the turnout at Fri
day night's rally was not overwhelming, it could have been because
the Daily news staff saw fit not to publicize the bonfire and list
the time it began.
We could point out that it is just the type of dedication and
self-discipline stressed in athletics which is sorely needed by those
who set themselves up as god-like critics of all the university's ills.
The members of the Dally Editorial Board claim to be supporters
of civil rights, brotherhood, and equality among men. Yet they ig
nore the fact that it is on the athletic field that men of all races,
creeds, and colors compete on the same level without prejudice.
Perhaps the trouble stems from the activists' own unfamiliarity
with athletics. To most of those on the Editorial Board, the term
"fumble" refers to missing the handoff on an illegal marijuana sale.
The closest most of them have ever come to a football game is
when they joined a sit-in protesting the use of the word "yippee"
by an excited fan. It seems they thought the fan was referring to
student activists in a derogatory manner.
No, despite what you may read on the Daily editorial page, tho
Big Game isn't dying. What is dying is the type of inane, anti
athletic propaganda circulated by the Editorial Board.

INK BOWL ACTION —Stanford quarterback Slingshot Jones looks
downfield for receiver Mercury Meredith, as DAILY business man
ager Len Costello provides the pass protection. Jones' passes to
Meredith, Costello, and Casaba Cavalli sparked the DAILY staff to
an early 12-7 lead, but the Cal eleven battled back for a 26-18 vic
tory. Tradition was upheld for the 69th time, however, as the
school which lost the Ink Bowl won the Big Game.
For the sake of clarification, the Daily Sports Department hereby
severs all connections with the Editorial Board.
Monday's editorial, entitled '"Big Game Dying," was the straw
that broke the camel's back, so to speak. The persistence of these
radicals in condemning university athletics has reached such mag
nitude that it demands retaliation.
The pompous air assumed by the author (who is now hiding in
Haight-Ashbury) in referring scornfully to "pom pon sex symbols
