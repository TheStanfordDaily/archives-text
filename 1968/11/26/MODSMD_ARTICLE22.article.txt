## Virginia Woolf "Moving' 
### ROBERT EGAN 
The production of Edward Al
bee's "Who's Afraid of Virginia
Woolf?" currently at the Man
hattan Playhouse (Manhattan
and W. Bayshore, Palo Alto) is
an effective piece of theatre, oft
en moving and always compe
tent. Its chief virtue is inventive
ness, as it brings out and illumi
nates the full range of this bril
liant and very complex play.
Everyone, I suppose, is now
aware that Virginia Woolf is
about four people—a middle
aged and a young faculty cou
ple who, in the course of an all
night bender, assault and lace
rate each other verbally and
emotionally. Playing a series of
"games"—"Hump the Hostess",
"Humiliate the Host", "Get the
Guests" and so forth—they peel
away each other's labels (as one
of them puts it), pulling off the
skin, sloshing aside the organs
and cracking the bones to re
veal the marrow of their disor
dered lives: the frustration and
failure of George and Martha's
marriage and the potential dis
aster inherent in the union of
Nick and Honey, the younger
couple.
But competitive anatomy is
only the play's starting point.
While "Fun and Games" is the
title of Albee's first act, the de

mons raised in the second, "Wal
purgisnacht," are formally con
fronted and ritually allayed in
the third, appropriately titled
"The Exorcism." II is this, the
work's ritual nature, that direc
tor Judith Dresch has captured
and conveyed most powerfully.
Comic Effect
Like "King Lear" and "Long
Day's Journey," this play should
be an emotionally exhausting
and purgative experience for its
audience. Its comic effect, of
which there is a great deal, must
involve us, through our laugh
ter, in the persecution of each
character, to the extent that we
share responsibility for their
pain and participate in the relief
and hope, however, tentative,
that are gained with their final
self-knowledge.
Taking advantage of her thea
tre's intimate proportions, Mrs.
Dresch effectively accomplishes
this involvement. Her staging of
the climactic sequence—Mar
tha's recital of the life of their
"son" while George chants a
"Dies Irae" that ends in his an
nouncement of the son's death
is finely orchestrated and
deeply moving.
Eric Silins is a whimsical, re
flective George—less an avenger
than a reluctant "Magister Lu
di," aware that the suffering he

is inflicting on others and on
himself is a necessary means to
an end. lie gives a fine, sensitive
performance.
Magnificent Martha
Patricia Saville's Martha is a
magnificent, red-maned 1 ioness
of a woman; her bray is beauti
fully offensive. She manages,
moreover, to bring out far more
than the obvious- the extrovert
castrator in Martha's charac
ter. Her long soliloquy at the
start of the final act is an effec
tive portrait of remorse and ag
ony.
Honey is perhaps the most
problematical role of the play.
Albee seems to like her least of
the four, and he gives the ac
tress a difficult line to tread be
tween character and caricature.
Jaqueline Ames treads it mas
terfully, managing to convey all
the simpering and passively de
structive qualities of the char
acter while endowing her with
an individuality and a strange
kind of beauty that the play
wright himself may not have
forseen.
Lauren Thornhill, finally, is
solidly competent as Nick. If
his range and flexibility are a
bit inhibited, the role can be
played on a limited emotional
scale, and he does so quite con
vincingly.
The production will run again
on November 29, November 30
and December 7. It is definitely
worth seeing.

Everyone, I suppose, is now
aware that Virginia Woolf is
about four people—a middle
aged and a young faculty cou
ple who, in the course of an all
night bender, assault and lace
rate each other verbally and
emotionally. Playing a series of
"games"—"Hump the Hostess",
"Humiliate the Host", "Get the
Guests" and so forth—they peel
away each other's labels (as one
of them puts it), pulling off the
skin, sloshing aside the organs
and cracking the bones to re
veal the marrow of their disor
dered lives: the frustration and
failure of George and Martha's
marriage and the potential dis
aster inherent in the union of
Nick and Honey, the younger
couple.
But competitive anatomy is
only the play's starting point.
While "Fun and Games" is the
title of Albee's first act, the de

mons raised in the second, "Wal
purgisnacht," are formally con
fronted and ritually allayed in
the third, appropriately titled
"The Exorcism." II is this, the
work's ritual nature, that direc
tor Judith Dresch has captured
and conveyed most powerfully.
Comic Effect
Like "King Lear" and "Long
Day's Journey," this play should
be an emotionally exhausting
and purgative experience for its
audience. Its comic effect, of
which there is a great deal, must
involve us, through our laugh
ter, in the persecution of each
character, to the extent that we
share responsibility for their
pain and participate in the relief
and hope, however, tentative,
that are gained with their final
self-knowledge.
Taking advantage of her thea
tre's intimate proportions, Mrs.
Dresch effectively accomplishes
this involvement. Her staging of
the climactic sequence—Mar
tha's recital of the life of their
"son" while George chants a
"Dies Irae" that ends in his an
nouncement of the son's death
is finely orchestrated and
deeply moving.
Eric Silins is a whimsical, re
flective George—less an avenger
than a reluctant "Magister Lu
di," aware that the suffering he

is inflicting on others and on
himself is a necessary means to
an end. lie gives a fine, sensitive
performance.
Magnificent Martha
Patricia Saville's Martha is a
magnificent, red-maned 1 ioness
of a woman; her bray is beauti
fully offensive. She manages,
moreover, to bring out far more
than the obvious- the extrovert
castrator in Martha's charac
ter. Her long soliloquy at the
start of the final act is an effec
tive portrait of remorse and ag
ony.
Honey is perhaps the most
problematical role of the play.
Albee seems to like her least of
the four, and he gives the ac
tress a difficult line to tread be
tween character and caricature.
Jaqueline Ames treads it mas
terfully, managing to convey all
the simpering and passively de
structive qualities of the char
acter while endowing her with
an individuality and a strange
kind of beauty that the play
wright himself may not have
forseen.
Lauren Thornhill, finally, is
solidly competent as Nick. If
his range and flexibility are a
bit inhibited, the role can be
played on a limited emotional
scale, and he does so quite con
vincingly.
The production will run again
on November 29, November 30
and December 7. It is definitely
worth seeing.
The production of Edward Al
bee's "Who's Afraid of Virginia
Woolf?" currently at the Man
hattan Playhouse (Manhattan
and W. Bayshore, Palo Alto) is
an effective piece of theatre, oft
en moving and always compe
tent. Its chief virtue is inventive
ness, as it brings out and illumi
nates the full range of this bril
liant and very complex play.
