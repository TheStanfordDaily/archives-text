# Turmoil Continues to Plague Two Bay Area State Colleges
## 
### 
Bay area schools were rocked
by turmoil again yesterday as
faculty and administration came
under attack at San Francisco
State and violence flared up at
San Jose State College.
The three day covocation in
tended to smooth over last
week's trouble at San Francisco
State got off to a rocky start
with one of the panelists calling
the college president a "pig."
Faculty and students crowded
the auditorium for the panel and
thousands of others watched
from their classrooms on closed
circuit television.
The program was delayed for
more than an hour as disagree
ment over the agenda occurred.
President Robert Smith said the
program committee would dis
cuss it from their seats at tables
on the stage.
President Called 'Pig'
At that point Jerry Varnado,
a leader of the striking BSU
said "this pig, Robert Smith
wants us to sit here." There
were some hooting and jeers
from the audience and Smith
went on conferring with others
on stage.
Classes have been suspended
since Friday for the third time
within a month as a result of
violence and vandalism in a
strike called by the BSU Nov. 6.
Fire Bombs
Meanwhile at San Jose State
two fire bombs were thrown
through a window of an unoc

cupied children's day care cen
ter.
Otherwise, a student strike at
San Jose State seemed to be re
ceiving little support.
Police surmised the bombs
which did little damage, were
meant for the Educational Op
portunities Program (EOP) of
fice, which is two doors from the
care center.
The EOP was devised by the
college last year to encourage
minority students to enroll at
San Jose State.
A sign implanted in front of
the care center read, "Niggers,
if you strike, we fight."
The sign was in reference to
a student strike called Friday by
the United Black Students for
Action (ÜBSA) in support of
demands it has made to the ad
ministration.
Reagan's Reaction
The day's events brought al
most immediate reaction from
Governor Reagan in Los An
geles.
Reagan said that Californians
want an immediate solution to
the "disgrareful situation" at
San Francisco State College.
Theodore Meriam. chairman of
the state college system's trus
tees meeting, said the convoca
tion would probably continue un
til Thanksgiving.
But Reagan told newsmen "I
think the people 0 f California
are overwhelmingly of a mind

that this is a disgraceful situa
tion and should be settled im
mediately."
The Governor also said "Those
convocations should not even
take place. That's just further
vacillation."
