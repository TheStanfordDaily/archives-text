# Mexican-American Students To Seek Admissions Change
## 
### 
The Mexican-American Stu
dents Confederation (MASC)
will present a set of four pro
posals to University officials this
morning.
Dealing with increased Mexi
can-American admissions and
hiring of Mexican-American ad
ministrators, the proposals will
be presented to Provost Richard
Lyman after an 11:15 press con
ference in front of Building 1
on the Quad.
MASC leader Luis Nogales, a
third-year law student, yester
day outlined the four proposals.
They include the admission next
fall of 100 Mexican-American
undergraduates. There are pres
ently 53 Mexican-American stu
dents at Stanford, according to
Nogales.

Other requests include hiring
of one Mexican-American ad
ministrator to work with the
Assistant Provost for Inter-
Group Relations, one Mexican-
American admissions officer and
a Mexican-American counselor.
"Future" proposals reportedly
will include the creation of a
Brown Studies major similar to
to the recently announced Black
Studies program.
Nogales yesterday pointed out
that less than one-half of one
per cent of Stanford students
are Mexican-Americans, in an
area with heavy Mexican-Ameri
can concentration.
Provost Lyman received a pre
liminary copy of the proposals
last Friday and is expected to
have some reply today. It is not
clear whether Lyman will be
present at the 11:15 press con
ference. Some observers think
MASC will present the formal
requests to Lyman after the
press conference.
In many ways the MASC pro
posals are similar to the de
mands made by the Stanford
Black Students Union last April.
One significant difference is that
no proposals for additional Mex
ican-American employment at
Stanford are included in the
package proposal of MASC.
MASC members say their

membership includes at least 37
of the 53 Mexican-American stu
dents here. There is one Mexi
can-American professor at Stan
ford, in the medical school.
Nogales yesterday emphasized
that "no demands are being
made." He said, instead, that he
hoped negotiations would start
soon on the proposals.

press conference.
In many ways the MASC pro
posals are similar to the de
mands made by the Stanford
Black Students Union last April.
One significant difference is that
no proposals for additional Mex
ican-American employment at
Stanford are included in the
package proposal of MASC.
MASC members say their

membership includes at least 37
of the 53 Mexican-American stu
dents here. There is one Mexi
can-American professor at Stan
ford, in the medical school.
Nogales yesterday emphasized
that "no demands are being
made." He said, instead, that he
hoped negotiations would start
soon on the proposals.
