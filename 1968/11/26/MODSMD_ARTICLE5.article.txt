# Aide Reflects On Johnson Years
## 
### MARGIE WOLF 
S. Douglass Cater, former spe
cial aide to President Johnson,
yesterday outlined some dilem
mas of the chief executive, "the
most overworked, over-burdened
man in history."
The White House assistant for
health, education, and welfare
programs analyzed the organiza
tion of the modern Presidency
and the communication gap, "th >
most baffling problem any Pres
ident has faced."
Alabama-born Cater casually
addressed a sprinkling of listen
ers in Dinkelspiel Auditorium.
His Southern drawl has faded
but has not been erased by Har
vard schooling and newspaper
reporting in Washington since
Franklin Roosevelt's days.
"I used to write knowledgably
about power," Cater recalled.
"But after four years in the
White House I'm not so sure."
"Too often we equate the
growth of the role of the mod
ern President with a growth of
his power. The two are not by
any means connected," Cater
said.
Presidents' Roles
Modern Presidents "wear more
hats" than the traditional ones
of commander-in-chief and head
of state, Cater noted. They man
age "a bureaucracy on top of a
bureaucracy," he continued, and
risk becoming a clerk instead of
a leader.
The small staff closest to the
President become "time-motion
experts" to make the most of
the chief executive's calendar,
Cater said.
Suggested Remedies
Remedies for the exhausting
pace, however, are not easy to
implement. Business has sug
gested a five-day work week and
long vacation, but this would
not succeed unless Congress and
the press also met problems on

a nine to five schedule, Cater re
lated skeptically.
"The President can't lighten
his burden by dividing it up,"
Cater said, because the Consti
tution charges a single man
with the executive responsibili
ty. Cater suggested the Presi
dent needs freedom to make spe
cific delegations of power at spe
cific times, but he must be able
to recall the authority as well.
By adding experts to lighten
the President's load "you would
soon have such a population ex
plosion in the President's office
that he becomes a clerk." The
man "should be given as much
flexibility as possible to shape"
the office, Cater said.
"Nixon has certain notions
about how to run the place bet
ter," Cater remarked, saying the
President-elect wanted to elim
inate crisis from the method of
governing. "If he can accomplish
that I might consider voting for
him next time," Cater quipped.
Johnson's Failure
The aide recalled that Presi
dent Johnson admitted his great
est failure was in communica
tions. Cater said the credibility
gap extended at least to Teddy
Roosevelt, whom the press called
a "congenital liar."
A President sometimes resorts
to evasion to keep from insult
ing another country, as when
appointment of ambassadors is
not released until the host coun
try approves the selection, Cater
explained.
He also suggested Johnson
avoided the "public way" of de
claring war in Vietnam to keep
all alternatives for settlement
open.
Cater said that in domestic
affairs, "When you're putting a
program togeth r, you're trying
to build a consensus so it's not
killed before it's born. This re
quires a certain lack of candor."

pace, however, are not easy to
implement. Business has sug
gested a five-day work week and
long vacation, but this would
not succeed unless Congress and
the press also met problems on

a nine to five schedule, Cater re
lated skeptically.
"The President can't lighten
his burden by dividing it up,"
Cater said, because the Consti
tution charges a single man
with the executive responsibili
ty. Cater suggested the Presi
dent needs freedom to make spe
cific delegations of power at spe
cific times, but he must be able
to recall the authority as well.
By adding experts to lighten
the President's load "you would
soon have such a population ex
plosion in the President's office
that he becomes a clerk." The
man "should be given as much
flexibility as possible to shape"
the office, Cater said.
"Nixon has certain notions
about how to run the place bet
ter," Cater remarked, saying the
President-elect wanted to elim
inate crisis from the method of
governing. "If he can accomplish
that I might consider voting for
him next time," Cater quipped.
Johnson's Failure
The aide recalled that Presi
dent Johnson admitted his great
est failure was in communica
tions. Cater said the credibility
gap extended at least to Teddy
Roosevelt, whom the press called
a "congenital liar."
A President sometimes resorts
to evasion to keep from insult
ing another country, as when
appointment of ambassadors is
not released until the host coun
try approves the selection, Cater
explained.
He also suggested Johnson
avoided the "public way" of de
claring war in Vietnam to keep
all alternatives for settlement
open.
Cater said that in domestic
affairs, "When you're putting a
program togeth r, you're trying
to build a consensus so it's not
killed before it's born. This re
quires a certain lack of candor."
S. Douglass Cater, former spe
cial aide to President Johnson,
yesterday outlined some dilem
mas of the chief executive, "the
most overworked, over-burdened
man in history."
The White House assistant for
health, education, and welfare
programs analyzed the organiza
tion of the modern Presidency
and the communication gap, "th >
most baffling problem any Pres
ident has faced."
Alabama-born Cater casually
addressed a sprinkling of listen
ers in Dinkelspiel Auditorium.
His Southern drawl has faded
but has not been erased by Har
vard schooling and newspaper
reporting in Washington since
Franklin Roosevelt's days.
"I used to write knowledgably
about power," Cater recalled.
"But after four years in the
White House I'm not so sure."
"Too often we equate the
growth of the role of the mod
ern President with a growth of
his power. The two are not by
any means connected," Cater
said.
Presidents' Roles
Modern Presidents "wear more
hats" than the traditional ones
of commander-in-chief and head
of state, Cater noted. They man
age "a bureaucracy on top of a
bureaucracy," he continued, and
risk becoming a clerk instead of
a leader.
The small staff closest to the
President become "time-motion
experts" to make the most of
the chief executive's calendar,
Cater said.

pace, however, are not easy to
