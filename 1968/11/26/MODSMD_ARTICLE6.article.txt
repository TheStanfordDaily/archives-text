## Downtown Plan: No Vacancy 
### ANDREW MOSS 
Remember the AFT's housing
agitation at the end of summer
quarter?
Last week, about two months
after the start of the agitation,
the committee that came out of
it finally met. Meanwhile the
committee, which was supposed
to have had all sorts of staff
members and trustees on it, had
been slightly castrated. No staff
members, no trustees and its
function is now "advisory."
I suppose all this Is about par
for the bureaucratic course but
it does not inspire confidence.
One gets the feeling that the
committee strategy is serving its

usual function of soaking up dis
sent.
Like everybody else I was as
suming that the wheels would
churn and a proposal would
eventually emerge. Then my in
terest suddenly got kicked from
the theoretical to the practical
plane: my rent got jumped $40 a
month. Rents in downtown Palo
Alto are more or less incredible.
I was already paying $140 for a
dilapidated apartment.
It turns out that downtown
Palo Alto, which means every
thing from Embarcadero to
Menlo Park, is to be redeveloped
under a scheme called the Down
town Development Plan.
The plan is fundamentally
aimed at turning sleepy old Uni
versity Avenue into a kind of
financial and corporate mall. It
doesn't include people like me.
In fact it doesn't include any low
rent people at all because the
area on either side of University
Avenue is scheduled for high
rent apartment houses and pro

fessional buildings. The rest of
the area is going to be expensive
family housing.
Out go the old people, the low
rent people and the students. The
only reason we are allowed in
now is to pay the taxes on ex
isting property till the plan
gets rammed through. Mean
while values and rents go up and
the realtors shuffle us around,
waiting for the bonanza.
An enormous chunk of high
density living space is going to
be made over completely, turned
into a financial district with a
surrounding belt of high-priced
housing and services for office
workers. Anybody who doesn't
fit into that pattern is going to
be forced out — students because
they can't afford the rents, old
people because their property
taxes will skyrocket, small busi
nesses downtown because they
will lose their customers and
householders when they find out
that sleepy little Paly has be
come Wall Street over night.

It's a staggering example of
the profit motive at work, of the
scale of disregard on which large
lumps of urban capital can op
erate. When you think that the
kind of people who are doing this
to Palo Alto will soon be getting
the franchises to rebuild the city
centers, the mind boggles.
Who are they? They are th->
usual California people — Bank
of America, etc. — plus the usual
local people — Hare, Brewer and
Kelly, who built that tower on
University, Warren Thoits, the
Free U's arch enemy, plus Stan
ford. The Downtown Plan is all
a part of that vast fantasy, the
"community of technical schol
ars" that Stanford, its industrial
park, and the whole goddamn
area are all about.
In case anybody thinks I am
being paranoid about this, let
me refer you to a speech made
by Frederick Terman, one of the
main architects of the scheme,
to the Palo Alto Chamber of
Commerce (quoted in the Stan
ford Observer last year).
"The developments that have
taken place in Palo Alto and its
environs in the 20 years since
the Second World War are inex
tricably bound up with the trans
formation of Stanford from a re
spected but essentially regional
institution to one of the great
universities of. this country."
Those developments, unfortu
nately, don't include a place for
students to live. Like the rest of
the fantasy, the Downtown Plan
is based on a model for society
and the University which does
not concern itself with the stu
dents as human beings. It is
good old Stanford that is throw
ing me out of my home.
The University justifies this
lack of concern with the myth of
the "residential university." Fact
is that most Stanford students
live off campus, but the residen
tial hoax has been used to jus
tify a lack of organised interest
in the living conditions of the
majority.
So I don't have much faith in
the housing committee. It hap
pens that I want to live in a place
and a way that do not fit the
master plan. And when it comes
to a conflict between the stu
dents who populate the Univer
sity and the people who run it,
I know who is going to win.
