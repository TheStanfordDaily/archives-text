# The
						Case Against A Volunteer Army
## 
### DENIS HAYES 
The concept of a volunteer army has been em
braced by a wide spectrum of our most prominent
national politicians, including the President-elect.
Senator Mark Hatfield of Oregon will introduce
a bill to establish such an animal during the next
session of Congress.
The draft of Hatfield's bill provides for higher
military salaries, expansion of in-service educa
tion and training, greater opportunities for en
listed men to become officers, reduction in length
of time required before promotion, betted social,
cultural and recreational facilities and higher
bonuses for re-enlistment.
It may be that, when all the evidence, pro and
con, has been weighed, the case for the volunteer
army will be persuasive. But there presently seem
to be some substantive reasons to question the
wisdom of such a system. I am indebted for some
of the ideas which follow to Professor Frank
Levy at Berkeley.
1. To speak of an "enlightened military" is a
contradiction in terms to many. But most will at
least grant that there are greater and lesser
stages of unenlightenment.
A voluntary army would consist of a fairly
homogeneous group of people who find military
life attractive. This phenomenon would parallel

the gravitation of a certain type of mentality to
urban police forces.
The army is probably even more important to
not admit that the original focus for that atten
tion was the fact that we were to be the cannon
national tone, policy, and development than the
police force is to the city. There has long been a
great respect among the American civilian gov
ernment for military opinion. And after the civil
ian government has formulated the goals, there
is very great lattitude given the military estab
lishment in terms of strategy to achieve the de
sired ends.
It would be desirable to avoid a situation in
which the military establishment would share a
distinctive life-style and a largely coherent view
of the world.
2. The American public morality has recently
been brought into serious question. The matter
can, I suppose, be debated. But I would contend
that the middle-class anti-war movement is
largely the product of the drafting of middle
class sons for service in Vietnam.
It is a fortunate thing for America that her
youth rose up in protest against her Asian in
volvement, that students focused attention upon
the Oakland induction center and rushed the
Pentagon, that students rang millions of door

bells for McCarthy. And I think that for a great
many of the young this activism grew from a
sincere concern over the l*» Hue of the war.
But we would be deluding ourselves if we did
fodder. There is a direct correlation between the
intrusion of the draft into the college campuses
and the involvement of college students in anti
war movements.
The progression of the slogans, after all, was
"Hell no, I won't go;" then, as a spirit of solidar
ity grew, "Hell no, we won't go;" but only within
the past year or so has this evolved into the
moral imperative, "Hell no, nobody goes.'
The Johnson administration has seen an enor
mous increase in the executive's discretionary
power to initiate and wage war, and if the Presi
dent had a well-equipped force of professional
mercenaries at his disposal, there might well be
no popular check whatsoever upon the form and
frequency of American intervention.
3. We already have the problem of a defense
establishment with a vested interest in its own
perpetuation. Presently, however, much of this
establishment is transient, wanting nothing more
than to get two years' spuds peeled and get out.
A volunteer army, on the other hand, would
presume a very high rate of reenlistment and
overwhelming preponderance of career officers.

Joined with the defense interests in American
industry and with the paranoid style of U.S.
Congresses in the realm of international affairs,
this volunteer army would be a significant force
for increased militarism. The best one might
hope for would be sustained militarism at the
present level.
4. If American had a volunteer army it would
be in the national interest to keep a good supply
of "volunteers". Volunteers then, as today, would
simply mean men who have nowhere else to turn.
Granted the present distribution of wealth, educa
tion, opportunity, and justice, it seems likely that
a husky percentage of the "volunteers" would be
drawn from minority groups, from Appalachia,
and from the foggy bayous of the deep South.
Although this post-Great Society period still
enjoys a certain amount of talk about job crea
tion and massive federally-sponsored self-help
projects in poverty-stricken areas, one must ser
iously wonder whether Congress would fund
such programs, if the programs were success
fully competing for the very same young men
"needed" to "volunteer" for the army.
Before one buys either a used car or a volun
teer army, one had better scrutinize both the
product and the dealer very closely: the product
for defects, and the dealer for motives.
