• Robert's Rule
Editor, THE DAILY:
Yale Braunstein's justification
of his voting on the Speech Ap
propriation is based on a section
of Robert's "Rules of Order"
lifted out of context. Section 58
states:
If a member of the assembly,
he (the chairman) Is entitled
to vote when the vote Is by
ballot, and In all other cases
where the vote would change
the result Thus, in a case
where a two-thirds vote is nec
essary, and his vote thrown
with the minority would pre
vent the adoption of the ques
tion, he can cast his vote.
By merely quoting the last
sentence, Mr. Braunstein com
pletely changed the meaning of
the paragraph. He is not a mem
ber of LASSU. He was not on
the list of LASSU representa
tives, nor did he submit a proxy
at the meeting. Therefore, he
had no basis for voting on that
measure and the Speech Associ
ation Bill gained the necessary
votes.
JIM VERNON
• Speaker's Ruling
Editor, THE DAILY:
The Daily article concerning
LASSU's appropriation for the
Speech Association ignored the
fact that the legislature had
overturned Yale Braunstein's
ruling that a two-thirds vote be
necessary. There is nothing in
the LASSU Constitution or in
the By-Laws, or even in Rob
ert's "Rules of Order" which re
quires a two-thirds vote for such
an appropriation.
Therefore, the Speaker's rul
ing that such a vote was neces
sary constituted a "decision of
the chair" as defined by Rob
ert's "Rules" and was amenable
to being overturned by the legis
lature as a whole. The Speaker
implicitly recognized this when
he allowed the motion and vote
on the appeal to take place.
Whether Messrs. Braunstein
and Swift believe that such a
measure should require a two
thirds vote is irrelevant. It
is not their decision to make.
Since it is not explicitly dealt
with in the Constitution, LASSU
has every right to overrule the
Speaker and decide for itself.
This is what happened last
Thursday.

• Braunstein's Case
Editor, THE DAILY:
In regard to Mr. Vernon's let
ter—l did not quote out of con
text, he quoted from the wrong
source. The ASSU Constitution
explicitly states that Robert's
Rules of Order be used, but Mr.
Vernon's quote is from Robert's
Revised Rules of Order. Too
bad.
Mr. Peterson addresses a dif
ferent issue, but he is also in
correct. Robert's Rides is clear
in that a majority can not im
peril the rights of the minority
by overturning rules. I was mis
taken in allowing the appeal to
take place, but I shall try to pre
vent such occurrences in the fu
ture. Actually the only proceed
ural question that is valid is
whether the Speech Association
supplemental appropri
ation should ever have been al
lowed on the floor.

• Kudo For Yale
Editor, THE DAILY:
There continues to be a great
deal said about the tawdry at
tempt by the Speech Association
to appropriate the ASSU Con
tingency Fund. An aspect that
has escaped notice so far, and
I am ashamed that it has done
so, is the outstandingly compe
tent manner in which the Speak
er of the Legislature, Yale

Braunstein, has handled the
matter.
Whilst the Legislature itself
is castigated unfairly from all
sides, and appeals of his author
ity are made that amount to
personal attacks, Yale has han
dled the whole sordid business
with impartiality and adherence
to our constitution and proced
ures.
We say this as LASSU mem
bers who have been quite fre
quently at odds with Mr. Braun
stein, and will no doubt be
again.

• AFT Support
Editor, THE DAILY:
As teaching fellows and teach
ing assistants in the Law School,
we have been following with
particular interest the progress
of wage negotiations between
the University and the teaching
assistants in the English, Politi
cal Science, and Anthropology
departments. These negotiations
appear now to have reached a
critical stage, and we feel it
necessary to state our support
of what we believe to be the
legitimate demands of the teach
ing assistants.
We are in agreement with and
endorse two basic propositions:
1. That the teaching assistants
have the right to organize them
selves as a union and that the
University has the consequent
obligation to recognize the union
so organized and to bargain col
lectively with its representa
tives;
2. That the present economic
situation of the teaching assist
ants is unsatisfactory. The de
mand for $3000 a year plus a
$300 allowance for each depend
ent, effective winter quarter, is
therefore entirely justified.
We believe that the Univers
ity's contention that such extra
funds are not presently avail
able embodies a statement of
priorities rather than economic
necessities. We believe that
these priorities are in need of
re-evaluation to bring them into
line with the needs of the Uni
versity's student body and its
graduate teaching staff.

• Sound Of Silence
Editor, THE DAILY:
Perhaps it is about time, Mr.
McMahon, that University policy
should be tolerable to more than
the campus activists. I'm heart
ened to learn that C-15 will have
representative student members,
voicing my opinion along with
yours. It is especially pleasant
to know that others who share
my faith in the democratic pro
cess and the integrity of our Ad
ministration and Faculty to
work for meaningful change
have arisen from the ranks of
the silent middle to participate
in ASSU-SU leadership.
THOMAS BAKER
• DAILY Deplored
Editor, THE DAILY:
In another of their brilliant,
soul-searching editorials on the
ills and physical infirmities on
the Stanford campus, the noble
editors of the glorified crib sheet,
The Stanford Dally, have once
again taken it upon themselves
to crusade for the collective stu
dent body in condemning Big
Game as "a pitiable sight" and
calling for its "evolution." Beau
tiful, just beautiful.
This sermon regurgitates
memories of last year's ASSU
meeting just before Big Game
when the band played to a cap
tive audience, much to the con
sternation of Caesare Masarenti,
who proudly proclaimed his ab
stinence from all football games.
Do the editors also claim the
identical dedication?

Perhaps the sagacious editors
are unaware of the emotions
present in the rooting section
near the end of the fourth quar
ter, when Gene Washington was
removed from the lineup to the
ringing cheers of "We love Wash
ington," or the mad rush at the
final gun to the Cal sidelines to
claim the Axe, led by those ac
cursed "pom-pon sex symbols in
short skirts." I've yet to discover
what is so horrible about five
beautiful girls in mini-outfits.
Granted, Stanford is lacking in
school spirit, when compared to
Cal, for example, though the an
tics of the Phantom and the de
fense offered by Stanford stu
dents in preventing a Cal paint
ing raid late Tuesday night,
shows that the spirit is not dead.
It is, rather, sleeping, but is that
any reason to discredit attempts
to revive that flagging emotion?
Or does it seem more pressing
to be fighting for the righteous
causes of student freedom, civil
rights, or grape boycotts to the
exclusion of any cause that does
not carry with it the fate of the
world? These issues have their
place, certainly, and important
ones, but so, too, does the tradi
tion that the editors wish to
hurl to the sidelines in a quest
for God knows what.
Though I feel that should
heads be counted, one would find
more students at Big Game than
involved in a student boycott, I
do not claim to speak for a
"majority." Rather, I speak for
myself alone. I am proud of the
football team which represents
this university and I am not pre
pared to dig a grave on the
fifty yard line for the Axe and
thereby bury the proverbial hat
chet with Cal. I express my senti
ments with two simple words:
BEAT CAL.

• DAILY Reviled
Editor, THE DAILY:
Monday's Daily has come and
gone, its editorials a maudlin
tribute to "student opinions"
that never have been and never
will be.
Your editorial writer ("an
achronisms of an age gone by")
should be shot immediately so
that his prose can never be in
flicted on us again.
You suggest that "an evolu
tion of Big Game is essential if
it is to survive as the attitudes
of students change." By actual
count, this is the 478 th time you
have suggested that some Stan
ford institution must evolve in
the light of changing attitudes.
I say the time has come to put
the shoe on the other foot: Un
less the editorials of the Stan
ford Daily evolve, coming closer
into conformity with the atti
tudes of real, live Stanford stu
dents, the future of the paper
will be—or ought to be—in ser
ious doubt.
The spirt of Big Game is not
dying. True, better attendance
could have been expected at
some of the week's activities—
if the Daily had given them bet
ter publicity. I think that most

students find the recent diminu
tion of Big Game spirit at this
University to be far more arti
ficial than the "hackneyed slo
gans and worn-out traditions"
you disparage. I think, in fact,
that the "irrational" rivalry with
a certain school across the Bay
will outlast even Stanford's
more rational dislike of a certain
student newspaper. You have,
for perhaps the 478 th time, mis
judged the opinion of "the ma
jority of us."
The Daily would do well to
follow the advice of our new
Yell Leaders "Keep the Faith."
You will find, if you do so, that
the reports of Big Game's death
have been greatly exaggerated.

• Ticket Deadlines
Editor, THE DAILY:
Three students offered a valid
question in the Daily of Friday,
November 22nd when they ex
pressed disappointment at not
being able to buy student tickets
to the Big Game. First, let's be
sure that the Stanford Athletic
Program is now and always has
been conducted primarily for the
interest and enjoyment of Stan
ford students either as partici
pants or spectators.
Now, relating directly to the
problem of allocating tickets to

a "high demand" event, let's re
call that Big Game tickets went
on sale September 23rd and re
mained on sale to any and all
students through November
12th. If the more than 11,000
registered Stanford students had
sought to attend the Stanford vs.
California football game in Ber
keley, each of them could have
purchased a student ticket prior
to the "final deadline."
The reason for the "deadline"
is simply that thousands upon
thousands of ticket orders must
be filled at some point. This
point happened to be November
12th, at which time officials in
the Athletic Department had to
put a limit on the student alloca
tion so that the seats in the
perimeter area could be filled
with ticket orders in hand.
You might be interested to
know that 6,082 student tickets
were sold to the Big Game and
more than 7,000 to the U.S.C.
game in Stanford Stadium on
October 12th when the same
type of "deadline" situation pre
vailed.
In summary, students should
always understand that they
have first call on tickets, but
deadlines must be imposed at
some point. Anyone who re
spects these deadlines, will never
be disappointed.
Incidentally, the new Roscoe
Maples Pavilion will allow many
more students to enjoy basket
ball than ever before. However,
even with a greatly enlarged
facility, it will be necessary for
students to watch for ticket an
nouncements and purchase tick
ets promptly at that time to
avoid disappointment.
