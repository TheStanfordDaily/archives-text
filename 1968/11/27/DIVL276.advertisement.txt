THE PATCH COMMISSION
by Fredrick Crews
has it
A rather anti-establishment book by a rather anti-establish
mentarian who more than turned you on with The Pooh
Perplex. The Minneapolis Tribune says it's sure to "outrage
most administration loyalists and right-wingers, delight fourth
party dissidents, and make entertaining reading for all but the
apolitical during campaign '68." Mr. William Hogan, in the
S.F. Chronicle, calls it"the wittiest satire in years." You can
call for it wherever anti-establishment books are sold. $3.95
