# Liberals Impede SDS
## Radical Movement 'A Way of Life' 
### PHILIP TAUBMAN MARGIE WOLF (Second of two articles) 
Building a radical movement
at Stanford "becomes a way of
life" according to one memb r of
Students for a Democratic Soci
ety (SDS). He adds, "We might
succeed if it weren't for the
damn liberals."

Analysis

Most SDS members believe
th ? liberal posture of the Stan
ford community is the main
roadblock to successfully radi
calizing the University. They
feel, however, that liberalism
can be defeated and that Stan
ford offers some distinct incent
ives for the struggle.
Radicalizing Stanford, individ
uals in SDS argue, would be
"hitting the center of the sys
tem" and would affect diverse

areas from Vietnam to General
Motors. Overcoming liberalism
is possible, th y continue, noting
that only a year ago most pres
ent members of SDS were lib
erals.
As SDS trys to build a move
ment, members are asking what
conditions are unique to Stan
ford, and how productive non
violence can be in combatting
"the system". The answers they
provide are varied and complex,
interwoven by one common
thread—the key question is
"How did I become a radical?"
Evolution
Understanding the process of
evolution from liberalism or con
servatism to radicalism is to
know how others can be en
couraged in similar' dir ctions,
SDS members say. Without such
knowledge, they doubt a radical
movement can survive.
Myron Filene and others com
menting on advantages of Stan
ford think the University har
bors students who will be the

very top leaders of society. Hal
Hamilton, a junior and leader in
SDS, bcliev s "Stanford is a rul
ing class school. We've got the
big targets here, not only in Uni
versity associations, hut in the
student body."
Fred Cohen, often active and
outspoken in SDS, comments on
a more specific advantage,
"Stanford is in a gr at location
for bringing home to students
the guts of what's wrong in
America. When we talk about
imperialism or the military-in
dustrial complex, we can point
down the peninsula to Lockheed
or to the Industrial Park and
SRI."
Bay Area Radicals
Beyond Stanford, SDS mem
bers point out, th re is a large
pool of radicals in the Bay Area
and radical activities are con
stantly growing at Berkeley or
San Francisco State. The whole
area, they believe, provid a
supportive atmospher in which

radicalism is not totally foreign
to everyday life.
Many of these advantages,
SDS members agree, are offset
by liberal institutions and indi
viduals at Stanford. Liberalism
itself is the bog y man of SDS.
To a typical SDS member, liber
alism is largely responsible for
the "sick state of society" and
the argument goes, while lib
erals always criticize, they new r
act and usually appease.
Filene's comments speak for
others in SDS when he says,
"Liberals never do anything but
in reaction. They nev r do any
thing to show me there is an

alternative to the SDS way of
change."
I,ilx>ral Environment
SDS feels Stanford has more
than its share of liberals in
powerful positions making life
difficult fo rradicals. Th se lib
difficult for radicals. These lib -
SDS picture, in a liberal institu
tion and the result, Cohen says,
is "a very liberal environment
in which there are no gut is
sues."
The broad handicap of liberal
ism is k ynoted by the Stanford
administration. David Pugh
claims, "The administration is a
mixed bag. As much as I know
and like some of them as indi
viduals, they are really nothing
but hired hands. But in many
ways they are undercutting the
radical movement.
"Provost Lyman is a good
man in many respects—he
builds the humanities and won't
throw radical professors out of
the school, but in public activi
ties he undercuts radicals and
even liberals. He and Packer are
basically elitists."
Start Toward Radicalism
Because of the liberal environ
ment and lib ral leaders—SDS
also points to liberal leaders in
the faculty and student body—
SDS members feel it is difficult
to get students started towan
radicalism. Leonard Siegel, a
proponent of more militant SDf. :
policies says, "We have a major
difficulty in getting Stanford
students to relate to the outsid<
world. Getting them into Palo


rnoto by Marshall Schwartz
"DAMN LIBERALS" —One member of Stanford SDS attributes
their lack of success in radicalizing- the Stanford campus to liberals
saying, "We might succeed if it weren't for those damn liberals."
The above picture is of a rally in the Old Union courtyard last
Spring during the sit-in over the suspension of seven anti-CIA
protestors.
Alto may be an important first
step in exposing them to the
hypocrisy of Stanford and liber
alism."
The question of violence or
nonviolence is central to deliber
ations about overcoming liberal
ism. SDS members do not seek
violence, they say, but neither do
they fear it.
On a broad level, Filene and
Hamilton, for example, think
"civil disobedi: nee is passe'."
Filene firmly states, "I won't
submit to institutional punish
ment for trying to make society
better. Civil disobedience only
legitimizes the power of people
you're trying to change."
Passed Nonviolence
More specifically on violence,
Pugh says,"I would say many of
us were turned on by nonviolent
people such as Dave Harris, but
we've passed that stage. I would
say we are aviolent. We may use
violence if it makes tactical
sense.
"I keep asking myself how
much of my reluctance to use
violence comes from humanitar
ian instincts and how much from
my class background. I can cer
tainly visualize a struggle some
day in which I will become vio
lent to fight repressiv2 force."
Pugh's comments on "class
background" lead into the key
question of how students become
radicals.
Born into an upper-middle
class suburban New York home,
he attended Phillips Exeter
Academy before entering Stan

ford. But Pugh explained that
from grade school on he was
"always a hacker."
Unjustly Blamed
Because he was frequently
blamed for trouble unjustly, he
feels he developed "an acut >
sense of injustice." A desire to
help other people with the same
problem originally became
meshed with Pugh's personal in
centives.
He was "very much a go-get
ter" as a freshman, on athletic
teams and president of his
house. But important trends be
gan to develop, aided by then
student body president Dave
Harris and Pugh's sponsor.
Pugh joined the non-violent
demonstration at the Oakland
induction center during October
of, his sophomore year. "This
was a very moral thing—not a
political act," ne said.
Arrest
His arrest and five day stay in
jail taught him "a hell of a lot."
He saw older p ople also being
held and began to think about
what it would mean to be a radi
cal later.
But Pugh said spring of last
year was "the point things
really happened." A course in
International Development stim
ulated his thoughts about im
perialism and "why the U.S. is
neo-imperialist."
The sit-in last May proved to
be emotionally important in his
thoughts. Pugh said he still hesi
tated to risk his position by
entering the Old Union, but that
he knew intellectually it was the
right thing to do.

He did go inside, and also con
fronted the problem of self-in
terest versus feelings on issues.
Pugh suggested that confronta
tions are important in clarifying
issues and "rooting people out
of their normal state of sloth."
Revolution From Below
Pugh started the summer
working for Senator McGinnison
who is considered a liberal.
"It really convinced me what
you need is not a new elite, but
a revolution from below," he
said. He quit after a month, feel
ling that change from above
was contradictory to democracy
and not lasting.
Returning to Stanford this
fall, Pugh joined SDS. He felt
it was the "only potentially vi
able group on campus." He said
SDS was personally satisfying
by providing a community at
mosphere, and that it provided
a vehicle for changing society.
Pugh noted many people in
SDS had been similarly radical
ized in the last year or two,
and that they could still recall
the mental steps of their con
version. They could use this
knowledge to reach other stu
dents.
"But time is running out. Peo
ple have got to change faster,"
he stated.
Pugh said he's moved beyond
conceiving of himself as a radi
cal, suggesting "radical" implied
a point on a fixed scale of values.
"I'm trying to find out what it
means to be a revolutionary,"
he explained, which involved an
uncharted area of thought and
action.
