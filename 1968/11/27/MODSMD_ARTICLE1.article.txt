# Liberals Impede SDS
## Radical Movement 'A Way of Life' 
### PHILIP TAUBMAN MARGIE WOLF (Second of two articles) 
Building a radical movement
at Stanford "becomes a way of
life" according to one memb r of
Students for a Democratic Soci
ety (SDS). He adds, "We might
succeed if it weren't for the
damn liberals."

Analysis

Most SDS members believe
th ? liberal posture of the Stan
ford community is the main
roadblock to successfully radi
calizing the University. They
feel, however, that liberalism
can be defeated and that Stan
ford offers some distinct incent
ives for the struggle.
Radicalizing Stanford, individ
uals in SDS argue, would be
"hitting the center of the sys
tem" and would affect diverse

areas from Vietnam to General
Motors. Overcoming liberalism
is possible, th y continue, noting
that only a year ago most pres
ent members of SDS were lib
erals.
As SDS trys to build a move
ment, members are asking what
conditions are unique to Stan
ford, and how productive non
violence can be in combatting
"the system". The answers they
provide are varied and complex,
interwoven by one common
thread—the key question is
"How did I become a radical?"
Evolution
Understanding the process of
evolution from liberalism or con
servatism to radicalism is to
know how others can be en
couraged in similar' dir ctions,
SDS members say. Without such
knowledge, they doubt a radical
movement can survive.
Myron Filene and others com
menting on advantages of Stan
ford think the University har
bors students who will be the

very top leaders of society. Hal
Hamilton, a junior and leader in
SDS, bcliev s "Stanford is a rul
ing class school. We've got the
big targets here, not only in Uni
versity associations, hut in the
student body."
Fred Cohen, often active and
outspoken in SDS, comments on
a more specific advantage,
"Stanford is in a gr at location
for bringing home to students
the guts of what's wrong in
America. When we talk about
imperialism or the military-in
dustrial complex, we can point
down the peninsula to Lockheed
or to the Industrial Park and
SRI."
Bay Area Radicals
Beyond Stanford, SDS mem
bers point out, th re is a large
pool of radicals in the Bay Area
and radical activities are con
stantly growing at Berkeley or
San Francisco State. The whole
area, they believe, provid a
supportive atmospher in which

radicalism is not totally foreign
to everyday life.
Many of these advantages,
SDS members agree, are offset
by liberal institutions and indi
viduals at Stanford. Liberalism
itself is the bog y man of SDS.
To a typical SDS member, liber
alism is largely responsible for
the "sick state of society" and
the argument goes, while lib
erals always criticize, they new r
act and usually appease.
Filene's comments speak for
others in SDS when he says,
"Liberals never do anything but
in reaction. They nev r do any
thing to show me there is an

alternative to the SDS way of
change."
I,ilx>ral Environment
SDS feels Stanford has more
than its share of liberals in
powerful positions making life
difficult fo rradicals. Th se lib
difficult for radicals. These lib -
SDS picture, in a liberal institu
tion and the result, Cohen says,
is "a very liberal environment
in which there are no gut is
sues."
The broad handicap of liberal
ism is k ynoted by the Stanford
administration. David Pugh
claims, "The administration is a
mixed bag. As much as I know
and like some of them as indi
viduals, they are really nothing
but hired hands. But in many
ways they are undercutting the
radical movement.
"Provost Lyman is a good
man in many respects—he
builds the humanities and won't
throw radical professors out of
the school, but in public activi
ties he undercuts radicals and
even liberals. He and Packer are
basically elitists."
Start Toward Radicalism
Because of the liberal environ
ment and lib ral leaders—SDS
also points to liberal leaders in
the faculty and student body—
SDS members feel it is difficult
to get students started towan
radicalism. Leonard Siegel, a
proponent of more militant SDf. :
policies says, "We have a major
difficulty in getting Stanford
students to relate to the outsid<
world. Getting them into Palo

"DAMN LIBERALS" —One member of Stanford SDS attributes
their lack of success in radicalizing- the Stanford campus to liberals
saying, "We might succeed if it weren't for those damn liberals."
