# STUDY OF EDUCATION
## 
### 
The Study of Education at Stanford (SES) is the most important
review of its kind in the history of the University. Its recommenda
tions, if adopted, will revise fundamental educational structures at
Stanford and set the direction of education for at least the next
decade. The Study's first two reports (there will be ten) appear
in today's Daily. They deserve the careful reading and considera
tion of every person at Stanford.
Faults in both broad and specific recommendations can be found
in the first two SES reports, as Bruce Campbell suggested in his
analysis of SES printed in last Friday's issue of the Daily magazine.
Perhaps SES did fail to question the most basic assumptions guid
ing education at Stanford such as the unquestioned position of the
faculty. Perhaps Stanford should retain the quarter system to offer
varied and extensive exposure to disciplines and courses.
Everyone at Stanford will have his "perhaps," but we feel there
is too much at stake for the improvement of Stanford education

to negate and stymie SES recommendations with petty arguments
and interest group politicking. This is particularly true for stu
dents. SES recommendations on undergraduate education call
for greatly liberalized requirements and structures which would
provide immense improvement in the undergraduate years at Stan
ford. It is in the interest of all students to support these recom
mendations.
Unfortunately, as much as recommendations concern students,
students have little to say about their adoption. Faculty power
will never be greater and more pervasive than in the acceptance or
rejection of SES proposals. It is impossible to predict how the
faculty will act. Certain recommendations may receive hostile hear
ing from faculty members whose personal interests are being chal
lenged by SES. Other more general proposals that divert power
from the faculty are likely to be seriously roadblocked.
The crucial example is the SES proposal for establishment of
a dean of undergraduate studies to act as "academic advocate" for
undergraduates. This proposal is the heart of all SES recommenda
tions on undergraduate education and is the most potentially bene
ficial for students. For years, undergraduates have been without
a powerful ally in the University sympathetic to student needs
in interdepartmental and non-departmental educational pursuits.
Whether the faculty accepts this proposal will largely depend
tin the very active support of students. In these days of student
activism, political questions dominate the scene. Student activism
on educational issues will be necessary for the dean of under
graduate studies to survive the workings of faculty power.
Thanksgiving, dead week, exams, and vacation should success
fully dull immediate student interest in SES. In January, however,
it will be more than worthwhile taking a faculty member to lunch
to discuss SES. The Daily will offer space for publication of letters
and columns debating SES and will more completely examine SES
proposals in editorials.
Many people at Stanford complain about the University. They
now have a chance to do something.

is too much at stake for the improvement of Stanford education

to negate and stymie SES recommendations with petty arguments
and interest group politicking. This is particularly true for stu
dents. SES recommendations on undergraduate education call
for greatly liberalized requirements and structures which would
provide immense improvement in the undergraduate years at Stan
ford. It is in the interest of all students to support these recom
mendations.
Unfortunately, as much as recommendations concern students,
students have little to say about their adoption. Faculty power
will never be greater and more pervasive than in the acceptance or
rejection of SES proposals. It is impossible to predict how the
faculty will act. Certain recommendations may receive hostile hear
ing from faculty members whose personal interests are being chal
lenged by SES. Other more general proposals that divert power
from the faculty are likely to be seriously roadblocked.
The crucial example is the SES proposal for establishment of
a dean of undergraduate studies to act as "academic advocate" for
undergraduates. This proposal is the heart of all SES recommenda
tions on undergraduate education and is the most potentially bene
ficial for students. For years, undergraduates have been without
a powerful ally in the University sympathetic to student needs
in interdepartmental and non-departmental educational pursuits.
Whether the faculty accepts this proposal will largely depend
tin the very active support of students. In these days of student
activism, political questions dominate the scene. Student activism
on educational issues will be necessary for the dean of under
graduate studies to survive the workings of faculty power.
Thanksgiving, dead week, exams, and vacation should success
fully dull immediate student interest in SES. In January, however,
it will be more than worthwhile taking a faculty member to lunch
to discuss SES. The Daily will offer space for publication of letters
and columns debating SES and will more completely examine SES
proposals in editorials.
Many people at Stanford complain about the University. They
now have a chance to do something.
The Study of Education at Stanford (SES) is the most important
review of its kind in the history of the University. Its recommenda
tions, if adopted, will revise fundamental educational structures at
Stanford and set the direction of education for at least the next
decade. The Study's first two reports (there will be ten) appear
in today's Daily. They deserve the careful reading and considera
tion of every person at Stanford.
Faults in both broad and specific recommendations can be found
in the first two SES reports, as Bruce Campbell suggested in his
analysis of SES printed in last Friday's issue of the Daily magazine.
Perhaps SES did fail to question the most basic assumptions guid
ing education at Stanford such as the unquestioned position of the
faculty. Perhaps Stanford should retain the quarter system to offer
varied and extensive exposure to disciplines and courses.
Everyone at Stanford will have his "perhaps," but we feel there
is too much at stake for the improvement of Stanford education
