• 'Facts 9 On Grapes
Editor, THE DAILY:
Having heard two Delano
growers give us the facts of the
grape strike last Wednesday
night, I certainly have changed
my mind about the strike.
I learned from these growers
that although they work long
hours in the field, they barely
manage to break even in their
business and that it is the farm
workers who earn up to $10,000
a year and drive around in shiny
new cars!
Furthermore one reason that
the growers must work so hard
is because of their great concern
for their workers; they get the

workers credit at the bank, they
set them up in business, and they
bail them out of jail (after all,
we know what happens when
you give a Chicano $10,000 . . .).
I now realize that the people
I saw living in shacks and the
young men I met who had been
harrassed by police must have
been growers!
Now that I do know the real
facts, my only question is; why
don't the growers go on strike
against the workers?

All quarter I have silently tol

erated misrepresentations, inac
curacies, and ordinary mistakes
by Daily reporters. But this time
you have gone too far. In your
Trivia quiz answers for this
week you state that the two
youngest Mouseketeers were Ke
vin and Karen. Now any Mouse
keteer fan knows perfectly well
that they were Cubby and Karen.
I sincerely hope the Trivia Edi
tor refrains in the future from
these personalized interpreta
tions of history and returns to
the primary purpose of The
Daily, namely the truthful re
porting of facts.

As a follow-up to my October
30 letter criticizing The Daily
for excessive bias and omissions
in news coverage, it seems ap
propriate to recognize The

two counts in recent weeks.
Keep up the better work!

Since Odysseus we have been

My thanks to The Daily's staff

for correcting my impressions of
this year's Big Game week.
It must have been the bright
lights at the boat house that
made me imagine thousands of
people crowded into Lake Lag
for the Bonfire. And that fire;
you could have burned the past
issues of The Daily and gotten
bigger flames.
Attendance at the game was
so bad there wasn't an empty
seat in the entire Stanford stu
dent section. Why I couldn't even
hear the mighty Cal rooters for
all the noise those apathetic
Stanford students were making.
I never realized that the alum
ni were the only ones who
cheered the Stanford band's re
pertoire of Midnight Hour, Walk
ing the Dog, and all those other
ancient songs that students hate.
And those sexy Pom Pon dollies
really turned me off — after all,
there are so many beautiful wo
men at Stanford that sex has be
come an absolute bore.
And for a game that was won
in the first quarter, it was obvi
ous that all those students stayed
around just to show how little
they cared about the axe.
Or maybe it wasn't my imagi
nation at all. Maybe it was just
that The Daily's editors spent
Saturday afternoon in Stanford
Stadium instead of Berkeley.

the growers must work so hard
is because of their great concern
for their workers; they get the

workers credit at the bank, they
set them up in business, and they
bail them out of jail (after all,
we know what happens when

All quarter I have silently tol

erated misrepresentations, inac
curacies, and ordinary mistakes
by Daily reporters. But this time
you have gone too far. In your
Trivia quiz answers for this
week you state that the two
youngest Mouseketeers were Ke
vin and Karen. Now any Mouse
keteer fan knows perfectly well
that they were Cubby and Karen.
I sincerely hope the Trivia Edi
tor refrains in the future from
these personalized interpreta
tions of history and returns to
the primary purpose of The
Daily, namely the truthful re
porting of facts.

My thanks to The Daily's staff

for correcting my impressions of
this year's Big Game week.
It must have been the bright
lights at the boat house that
made me imagine thousands of
people crowded into Lake Lag
for the Bonfire. And that fire;
you could have burned the past
issues of The Daily and gotten
bigger flames.
Attendance at the game was
so bad there wasn't an empty
seat in the entire Stanford stu
dent section. Why I couldn't even
hear the mighty Cal rooters for
all the noise those apathetic
Stanford students were making.
I never realized that the alum
ni were the only ones who
cheered the Stanford band's re
pertoire of Midnight Hour, Walk
ing the Dog, and all those other
ancient songs that students hate.
And those sexy Pom Pon dollies
really turned me off — after all,
there are so many beautiful wo
men at Stanford that sex has be
come an absolute bore.
And for a game that was won
in the first quarter, it was obvi
ous that all those students stayed
around just to show how little
they cared about the axe.
Or maybe it wasn't my imagi
nation at all. Maybe it was just
that The Daily's editors spent
Saturday afternoon in Stanford
Stadium instead of Berkeley.
