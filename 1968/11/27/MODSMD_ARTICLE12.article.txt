### JOHNIE SCOTT 
It is only in the appearances
of a Rose that we see its exten
sions. The end of the second
World War. Journals on the re
markable vicissitude of the Free
French. The Eisenhower Years
(which provided reams of notes
for latter-day American poets).
JFK and the Bay of Pigs, all of
this in growing up. Then, it was
Lyndon and his years. A
strength going against itself. All
of this to end with today, the
remarkable defeat of Hubert
Humphrey (or was it Nabokov,
sitting in a chair by his win
dow, somehow warned by a Pale
Fire?).
All of these thoughts, this sort
of thinking, which led me to to
day. It was Monday, November
25 (1968), in the late afternoon.
Me, leaning against the guard
rail above Tresidder Memorial
Union looking out and down on
the peoples going in and out of
the Beehive below. That morn
ing I had read Paul Rupert's
OH CHRIST! with several of my
schoolday cronies.
I wondered if he really had
made that final break. That is,
if Paul had achieved his own
freedom. I had not expected too
many of the learned Crowd to
show their faces Sunday. Big
Black is, after all is considered
and weighed in the mind, only
Big Black. A drummer who
could have been the New York
Met. Or Casey Stengel making
a final appearance at the Old-
Timers Game in Yankee Stadi

um. The Miracle of the Rose is
more important.
The Miracle of the Rose, and
the fact that on this day, this
Wednesday, Eldridge Cleaver
begins to breathe another sort
of air. However, enough said of
Eldridge. One must be careful
to avoid the pratfalls of school
marmish love affairs with the
socially diseased.
Tresidder Memorial Student
Union saved my life. No kidding,
it saved my life, for as I leaned
against its guardrail looking out
and down on the peoples going
in and out, backwards and for
wards, there suddenly came to
my mind the most strange and
disquieting of pictures. No, I
will not call what came to my
mind "pictures." It would be
much clearer were I to use the
word, Vision.
I saw, literally, hundreds up
on hundreds of Little Orphan
Annies walking back and forth
into and out of the Union. The
blank, stolid eyes that see only
straight ahead and never be
hind. The big shaggy dog that
goes everywhere Annie goes.
Little Male Orphan Annies and
Little Female Orphan Annies,
but most of all, Little Mixed-Up
Orphan Annies and all of them
cavilling about, of all things,
the lack of attention paid their
bodies, their various respective
Beings, by higher-ups in that
same social order.
Would you not be afraid to
have the faculty come out en
masse to see Big Black? Or a
more frightening aspect — to
really hear a Big Black as op

posed to seeing, which implies
and is, of truth, a gawking at?
Movements further made by the
vanguard (to believe that we
are all human, no matter what
slide projectors can conjure in
the Opera House, what light
shows, what fears of the past
future.)
This is the meaning of today,
that I began this past Monday
to feel myself realizing the enor
mity of you all. Looking at all
the pretty little girls in their
mini - skirts and wide - angled
goggle-shaped shades. All of
those soft blouses hinting of a
much lleshier softness beneath,
a body warm and to be cuddled
to. Then, flashes of the revul
sing thought.
No, to some, my black skin,
my black face, my black hands
as I hold them against the wind
rushing in upon my mind, black
metaphors ballooning the preg
nant atmosphere of This and
That would imply that my first
fear would be the obvious—that
of an overt black man in love
with (for Cleaver, at least, It
was the Ogre) the White Wom
an.
No, not this thought at all, but
something far more insidious.
The fact that the melting-pot
is for real. The fact that my
blood runs in the strains of
every race beneath the Sun. The
reality as it crushes me under
that it is the Living Metaphor
that threatens to strangle Me.
I am revulsed by the emptiness
of those Eyes, those hundreds
and hundreds of blank, white
eyes that see into and thru walls

but never see backwards, never
realize or what is more impor
tant, never understand what is
the Past Future.
The Bad Mouth could be the
Poor Mouth could be My Mouth
could be Your Mouth could be
Your Momma's Mouth as she
took you in the house one cold
morning years ago and berated
you up and down for not having
washed your ears or your face
or underenath your arms before
going off to play. The Bad
Mouth could be Any Mouth but
mostly the Poor Mouth that on
Thanksgiving Day watered and
hungered but that was the ex
tent of it because there never
was nor could be turkey or even
roast chicken.
Sunday, November 24, of this
year, I gave a poetry reading in
Serra House. Art Wilson was
with me as well as his wife, who
is also my sister, Lana. Art and
I read together. "Song for Los
ers," "Once Feeling Has En
tered," "The Diary of a Hope-
Peddler," "The Man Who Had
Everything To Die For," and
numerous other collected pieces
which we interspersed with jazz
tracks from Max Roach, Chico
Hamilton, Pharoh Sanders, John
C o 11 r a n e (Ohnedarusi), Lee
Morgan. All of the stronger spir
its.
Lights were low (until I or
dered them cut on so that I
could see what I was reading)
and people were scattered about
on the rug, comfortable as far
as I could make out. That,
mixed-in with the good Scotch
that was to be had, made toler

ance fairly easy until I got deep
er into my work, which was
when I began to edit and cut,
not in spite of, but because of
where I was and what I was
doing.
We all want so hard to grow
up and move away from here.
But some of us have too much
of the waifish spirit within us.
For some of You, it will for
ever be Peter Pan singing "I'll
never grow up, never grow up,
never grow up, not I." But for
others, and Us, it will be a dif
ferent movement, sans the sort
of practical headed thinking that
has been responsible for the
deprivation that is Now.
Want a bone to chew on? Try
this—if the poverty-level for the
American Black Man were ex
tended equilaterally to his White
Brother the United States of
America would suffer a more
severe Depression than that
which came down in the 1930'5.
Thoughts and ruminations from
the real world, as Ferlinghetti
might call a new book? I think
not.
Better to be for real and more
understood — the words come
closer to the initial sounds
made by the Flesh (wind sounds,
farts, grunts, slobbering over
old bones). All this is no more
than mute testimonial to the
fortitude of today's average
American newspaper and the
faceless man sipping tasteless
coffee over it. And no one, not
even now, truly understands the
depth of emotions on both sides
at SF State College. Happy
Thanksgiving!

made that final break. That is,
if Paul had achieved his own
freedom. I had not expected too
many of the learned Crowd to
show their faces Sunday. Big
Black is, after all is considered
and weighed in the mind, only
Big Black. A drummer who
could have been the New York
Met. Or Casey Stengel making
a final appearance at the Old-
Timers Game in Yankee Stadi

um. The Miracle of the Rose is
more important.
The Miracle of the Rose, and
the fact that on this day, this
Wednesday, Eldridge Cleaver
begins to breathe another sort
of air. However, enough said of
Eldridge. One must be careful

marmish love affairs with the
socially diseased.
Tresidder Memorial Student
Union saved my life. No kidding,
it saved my life, for as I leaned
against its guardrail looking out
and down on the peoples going
in and out, backwards and for
wards, there suddenly came to
my mind the most strange and
disquieting of pictures. No, I
will not call what came to my
mind "pictures." It would be
much clearer were I to use the
word, Vision.
I saw, literally, hundreds up
on hundreds of Little Orphan
Annies walking back and forth
into and out of the Union. The
blank, stolid eyes that see only
straight ahead and never be
hind. The big shaggy dog that
goes everywhere Annie goes.
Little Male Orphan Annies and
Little Female Orphan Annies,
but most of all, Little Mixed-Up
Orphan Annies and all of them
cavilling about, of all things,
the lack of attention paid their
bodies, their various respective
Beings, by higher-ups in that
same social order.
Would you not be afraid to
have the faculty come out en
masse to see Big Black? Or a
more frightening aspect — to
really hear a Big Black as op

posed to seeing, which implies
and is, of truth, a gawking at?
Movements further made by the
vanguard (to believe that we
are all human, no matter what
slide projectors can conjure in
the Opera House, what light
shows, what fears of the past
future.)
This is the meaning of today,
that I began this past Monday
to feel myself realizing the enor
mity of you all. Looking at all
the pretty little girls in their
mini - skirts and wide - angled
goggle-shaped shades. All of
those soft blouses hinting of a
much lleshier softness beneath,
a body warm and to be cuddled
to. Then, flashes of the revul
sing thought.
No, to some, my black skin,
my black face, my black hands
as I hold them against the wind
rushing in upon my mind, black
metaphors ballooning the preg
nant atmosphere of This and
That would imply that my first
fear would be the obvious—that
of an overt black man in love
with (for Cleaver, at least, It
was the Ogre) the White Wom
an.
No, not this thought at all, but
something far more insidious.
The fact that the melting-pot
is for real. The fact that my
blood runs in the strains of
every race beneath the Sun. The
reality as it crushes me under
that it is the Living Metaphor
that threatens to strangle Me.
I am revulsed by the emptiness
of those Eyes, those hundreds
and hundreds of blank, white
eyes that see into and thru walls

but never see backwards, never
realize or what is more impor
tant, never understand what is
the Past Future.
The Bad Mouth could be the
Poor Mouth could be My Mouth
could be Your Mouth could be
Your Momma's Mouth as she
took you in the house one cold
morning years ago and berated
you up and down for not having
washed your ears or your face
or underenath your arms before
going off to play. The Bad
Mouth could be Any Mouth but
mostly the Poor Mouth that on
Thanksgiving Day watered and
hungered but that was the ex
tent of it because there never
was nor could be turkey or even
roast chicken.
Sunday, November 24, of this
year, I gave a poetry reading in
Serra House. Art Wilson was
with me as well as his wife, who
is also my sister, Lana. Art and
I read together. "Song for Los
ers," "Once Feeling Has En
tered," "The Diary of a Hope-
Peddler," "The Man Who Had
Everything To Die For," and
numerous other collected pieces
which we interspersed with jazz
tracks from Max Roach, Chico
Hamilton, Pharoh Sanders, John
C o 11 r a n e (Ohnedarusi), Lee
Morgan. All of the stronger spir
its.
Lights were low (until I or
dered them cut on so that I
could see what I was reading)
and people were scattered about
on the rug, comfortable as far
as I could make out. That,
mixed-in with the good Scotch
that was to be had, made toler

ance fairly easy until I got deep
er into my work, which was
when I began to edit and cut,
not in spite of, but because of
where I was and what I was
doing.
We all want so hard to grow
up and move away from here.
But some of us have too much
of the waifish spirit within us.
For some of You, it will for
ever be Peter Pan singing "I'll
never grow up, never grow up,
never grow up, not I." But for
others, and Us, it will be a dif
ferent movement, sans the sort
of practical headed thinking that
has been responsible for the
deprivation that is Now.
Want a bone to chew on? Try
this—if the poverty-level for the
American Black Man were ex
tended equilaterally to his White
Brother the United States of
America would suffer a more
severe Depression than that
which came down in the 1930'5.
Thoughts and ruminations from
the real world, as Ferlinghetti
might call a new book? I think
not.
Better to be for real and more
understood — the words come
closer to the initial sounds
made by the Flesh (wind sounds,
farts, grunts, slobbering over
old bones). All this is no more
than mute testimonial to the
fortitude of today's average
American newspaper and the
faceless man sipping tasteless
coffee over it. And no one, not
even now, truly understands the
depth of emotions on both sides
at SF State College. Happy
Thanksgiving!
It is only in the appearances
of a Rose that we see its exten
sions. The end of the second
World War. Journals on the re
markable vicissitude of the Free
French. The Eisenhower Years
(which provided reams of notes
for latter-day American poets).
JFK and the Bay of Pigs, all of
this in growing up. Then, it was
Lyndon and his years. A
strength going against itself. All
of this to end with today, the
remarkable defeat of Hubert
Humphrey (or was it Nabokov,
sitting in a chair by his win
dow, somehow warned by a Pale
Fire?).
All of these thoughts, this sort
of thinking, which led me to to
day. It was Monday, November
25 (1968), in the late afternoon.
Me, leaning against the guard
rail above Tresidder Memorial
Union looking out and down on
the peoples going in and out of

mind "pictures." It would be
much clearer were I to use the
word, Vision.
I saw, literally, hundreds up
on hundreds of Little Orphan
Annies walking back and forth
into and out of the Union. The
blank, stolid eyes that see only
straight ahead and never be
hind. The big shaggy dog that
goes everywhere Annie goes.
Little Male Orphan Annies and
Little Female Orphan Annies,
but most of all, Little Mixed-Up
Orphan Annies and all of them
cavilling about, of all things,
the lack of attention paid their
bodies, their various respective
Beings, by higher-ups in that
same social order.
Would you not be afraid to
have the faculty come out en
masse to see Big Black? Or a
more frightening aspect — to
really hear a Big Black as op

posed to seeing, which implies
and is, of truth, a gawking at?
Movements further made by the
vanguard (to believe that we
are all human, no matter what
slide projectors can conjure in
the Opera House, what light
shows, what fears of the past
future.)
This is the meaning of today,
that I began this past Monday
to feel myself realizing the enor
mity of you all. Looking at all
the pretty little girls in their
mini - skirts and wide - angled
goggle-shaped shades. All of
those soft blouses hinting of a
much lleshier softness beneath,
a body warm and to be cuddled
to. Then, flashes of the revul
sing thought.
No, to some, my black skin,
my black face, my black hands
as I hold them against the wind
rushing in upon my mind, black
metaphors ballooning the preg
nant atmosphere of This and
That would imply that my first
fear would be the obvious—that
of an overt black man in love
with (for Cleaver, at least, It
was the Ogre) the White Wom
an.
No, not this thought at all, but
something far more insidious.
The fact that the melting-pot
is for real. The fact that my
blood runs in the strains of
every race beneath the Sun. The
reality as it crushes me under
that it is the Living Metaphor
that threatens to strangle Me.
I am revulsed by the emptiness
of those Eyes, those hundreds
and hundreds of blank, white
eyes that see into and thru walls

but never see backwards, never
realize or what is more impor
tant, never understand what is
the Past Future.
The Bad Mouth could be the
Poor Mouth could be My Mouth
could be Your Mouth could be
Your Momma's Mouth as she
took you in the house one cold
morning years ago and berated
you up and down for not having
washed your ears or your face
or underenath your arms before
going off to play. The Bad
Mouth could be Any Mouth but
mostly the Poor Mouth that on
Thanksgiving Day watered and
hungered but that was the ex
tent of it because there never
was nor could be turkey or even
roast chicken.
Sunday, November 24, of this
year, I gave a poetry reading in
Serra House. Art Wilson was
with me as well as his wife, who
is also my sister, Lana. Art and
I read together. "Song for Los
ers," "Once Feeling Has En
tered," "The Diary of a Hope-
Peddler," "The Man Who Had
Everything To Die For," and
numerous other collected pieces
which we interspersed with jazz
tracks from Max Roach, Chico
Hamilton, Pharoh Sanders, John
C o 11 r a n e (Ohnedarusi), Lee
Morgan. All of the stronger spir
its.
Lights were low (until I or
dered them cut on so that I
could see what I was reading)
and people were scattered about
on the rug, comfortable as far
as I could make out. That,
mixed-in with the good Scotch
that was to be had, made toler

ance fairly easy until I got deep
er into my work, which was
when I began to edit and cut,
not in spite of, but because of
where I was and what I was
doing.
We all want so hard to grow
up and move away from here.
But some of us have too much
of the waifish spirit within us.
For some of You, it will for
ever be Peter Pan singing "I'll
never grow up, never grow up,
never grow up, not I." But for
others, and Us, it will be a dif
ferent movement, sans the sort
of practical headed thinking that
has been responsible for the
deprivation that is Now.
Want a bone to chew on? Try
this—if the poverty-level for the
American Black Man were ex
tended equilaterally to his White
Brother the United States of
America would suffer a more
severe Depression than that
which came down in the 1930'5.
Thoughts and ruminations from
the real world, as Ferlinghetti
might call a new book? I think
not.
Better to be for real and more
understood — the words come
closer to the initial sounds
made by the Flesh (wind sounds,
farts, grunts, slobbering over
old bones). All this is no more
than mute testimonial to the
fortitude of today's average
American newspaper and the
faceless man sipping tasteless
coffee over it. And no one, not
even now, truly understands the
depth of emotions on both sides
at SF State College. Happy
Thanksgiving!
It is only in the appearances
of a Rose that we see its exten
sions. The end of the second
World War. Journals on the re
markable vicissitude of the Free
French. The Eisenhower Years
(which provided reams of notes
for latter-day American poets).
JFK and the Bay of Pigs, all of
this in growing up. Then, it was
Lyndon and his years. A
strength going against itself. All
of this to end with today, the
remarkable defeat of Hubert
Humphrey (or was it Nabokov,
sitting in a chair by his win
dow, somehow warned by a Pale
Fire?).
All of these thoughts, this sort
of thinking, which led me to to
day. It was Monday, November
25 (1968), in the late afternoon.
Me, leaning against the guard
rail above Tresidder Memorial
Union looking out and down on
the peoples going in and out of
the Beehive below. That morn
ing I had read Paul Rupert's
OH CHRIST! with several of my
schoolday cronies.
I wondered if he really had
made that final break. That is,
if Paul had achieved his own
freedom. I had not expected too
many of the learned Crowd to
show their faces Sunday. Big
Black is, after all is considered
and weighed in the mind, only
Big Black. A drummer who
could have been the New York
Met. Or Casey Stengel making
a final appearance at the Old-
Timers Game in Yankee Stadi

um. The Miracle of the Rose is
more important.
The Miracle of the Rose, and
the fact that on this day, this
Wednesday, Eldridge Cleaver
begins to breathe another sort
of air. However, enough said of
Eldridge. One must be careful
to avoid the pratfalls of school
marmish love affairs with the
socially diseased.
Tresidder Memorial Student
Union saved my life. No kidding,
it saved my life, for as I leaned
against its guardrail looking out
and down on the peoples going
in and out, backwards and for
wards, there suddenly came to
my mind the most strange and
disquieting of pictures. No, I
will not call what came to my

This is the meaning of today,
that I began this past Monday
to feel myself realizing the enor
mity of you all. Looking at all
the pretty little girls in their
mini - skirts and wide - angled
goggle-shaped shades. All of
those soft blouses hinting of a
much lleshier softness beneath,
a body warm and to be cuddled
to. Then, flashes of the revul
sing thought.
No, to some, my black skin,
my black face, my black hands
as I hold them against the wind
rushing in upon my mind, black
metaphors ballooning the preg
nant atmosphere of This and
That would imply that my first
fear would be the obvious—that
of an overt black man in love
with (for Cleaver, at least, It
was the Ogre) the White Wom
an.
No, not this thought at all, but
something far more insidious.
The fact that the melting-pot
is for real. The fact that my
blood runs in the strains of
every race beneath the Sun. The
reality as it crushes me under
that it is the Living Metaphor
that threatens to strangle Me.
I am revulsed by the emptiness
of those Eyes, those hundreds
and hundreds of blank, white
eyes that see into and thru walls

but never see backwards, never
realize or what is more impor
tant, never understand what is
the Past Future.
The Bad Mouth could be the
Poor Mouth could be My Mouth
could be Your Mouth could be
Your Momma's Mouth as she
took you in the house one cold
morning years ago and berated
you up and down for not having
washed your ears or your face
or underenath your arms before
going off to play. The Bad
Mouth could be Any Mouth but
mostly the Poor Mouth that on
Thanksgiving Day watered and
hungered but that was the ex
tent of it because there never
was nor could be turkey or even
roast chicken.
Sunday, November 24, of this
year, I gave a poetry reading in
Serra House. Art Wilson was
with me as well as his wife, who
is also my sister, Lana. Art and
I read together. "Song for Los
ers," "Once Feeling Has En
tered," "The Diary of a Hope-
Peddler," "The Man Who Had
Everything To Die For," and
numerous other collected pieces
which we interspersed with jazz
tracks from Max Roach, Chico
Hamilton, Pharoh Sanders, John
C o 11 r a n e (Ohnedarusi), Lee
Morgan. All of the stronger spir
its.
Lights were low (until I or
dered them cut on so that I
could see what I was reading)
and people were scattered about
on the rug, comfortable as far
as I could make out. That,
mixed-in with the good Scotch
that was to be had, made toler

ance fairly easy until I got deep
er into my work, which was
when I began to edit and cut,
not in spite of, but because of
where I was and what I was
doing.
We all want so hard to grow
up and move away from here.
But some of us have too much
of the waifish spirit within us.
For some of You, it will for
ever be Peter Pan singing "I'll
never grow up, never grow up,
never grow up, not I." But for
others, and Us, it will be a dif
ferent movement, sans the sort
of practical headed thinking that
has been responsible for the
deprivation that is Now.
Want a bone to chew on? Try
this—if the poverty-level for the
American Black Man were ex
tended equilaterally to his White
Brother the United States of
America would suffer a more
severe Depression than that
which came down in the 1930'5.
Thoughts and ruminations from
the real world, as Ferlinghetti
might call a new book? I think
not.
Better to be for real and more
understood — the words come
closer to the initial sounds
made by the Flesh (wind sounds,
farts, grunts, slobbering over
old bones). All this is no more
than mute testimonial to the
fortitude of today's average
American newspaper and the
faceless man sipping tasteless
coffee over it. And no one, not
even now, truly understands the
depth of emotions on both sides
at SF State College. Happy
Thanksgiving!
It is only in the appearances
of a Rose that we see its exten
sions. The end of the second
World War. Journals on the re
markable vicissitude of the Free
French. The Eisenhower Years
(which provided reams of notes
for latter-day American poets).
JFK and the Bay of Pigs, all of
this in growing up. Then, it was
Lyndon and his years. A
strength going against itself. All
of this to end with today, the
remarkable defeat of Hubert
Humphrey (or was it Nabokov,
sitting in a chair by his win
dow, somehow warned by a Pale
Fire?).
All of these thoughts, this sort
of thinking, which led me to to
day. It was Monday, November
25 (1968), in the late afternoon.
Me, leaning against the guard
rail above Tresidder Memorial
Union looking out and down on
the peoples going in and out of
the Beehive below. That morn
ing I had read Paul Rupert's
OH CHRIST! with several of my
schoolday cronies.
I wondered if he really had
made that final break. That is,
if Paul had achieved his own
freedom. I had not expected too
many of the learned Crowd to
show their faces Sunday. Big
Black is, after all is considered
and weighed in the mind, only
Big Black. A drummer who
could have been the New York
Met. Or Casey Stengel making
a final appearance at the Old-
Timers Game in Yankee Stadi

um. The Miracle of the Rose is
more important.
The Miracle of the Rose, and
the fact that on this day, this
Wednesday, Eldridge Cleaver
begins to breathe another sort
of air. However, enough said of
Eldridge. One must be careful
to avoid the pratfalls of school
marmish love affairs with the
socially diseased.
Tresidder Memorial Student
Union saved my life. No kidding,
it saved my life, for as I leaned
against its guardrail looking out
and down on the peoples going
in and out, backwards and for
wards, there suddenly came to
my mind the most strange and
disquieting of pictures. No, I
will not call what came to my
mind "pictures." It would be
much clearer were I to use the
word, Vision.
I saw, literally, hundreds up
on hundreds of Little Orphan
Annies walking back and forth
into and out of the Union. The
blank, stolid eyes that see only
straight ahead and never be
hind. The big shaggy dog that
goes everywhere Annie goes.
Little Male Orphan Annies and
Little Female Orphan Annies,
but most of all, Little Mixed-Up
Orphan Annies and all of them
cavilling about, of all things,
the lack of attention paid their
bodies, their various respective
Beings, by higher-ups in that
same social order.
Would you not be afraid to
have the faculty come out en
masse to see Big Black? Or a
more frightening aspect — to
really hear a Big Black as op

posed to seeing, which implies
and is, of truth, a gawking at?
Movements further made by the
vanguard (to believe that we
are all human, no matter what
slide projectors can conjure in
the Opera House, what light
shows, what fears of the past
future.)
