(Because of the serious franc situation I'm us
ing again my column on explaining Thanksgiving
Day to the French people. This holiday which
means so much to us is incomprehensible to them,
and I sincerely believe if the French could under
stand Thanksgiving, they could understand us.)
One of our most important holidays is Thanks
giving Day (known in France as le jour de merci
donnant).
Le jour de merci donnant was first started by
a group of pilgrims (pelegrins) who fled from I'-
Angleterre before the McCarran Act to found a
colony in the new world (le nouveau monde),
where they could shoot Indians (les peaux
rouages) and eat turkey (diiule) to their heart's
content. They landed at a place called Plymouth
(now a famous voiture Americaine) in a wooden
sailing ship called the Mayflower (or Fleur de
mai) in 1620.
But while the pelegTius were killing the dindes,
the peaux-rouges were killing the pelegrins, and
there were several hard winters ahead for both
of them.
In 1623, after another harsh year, the pelegrins'
crops were so good that they decided to have a
celebration and give thanks because more mais
was raised by the pelegrins than pelegrins were
killed by les peaux-rouges.
Every year on the jour de merci donnant, par
ents tell their children an amusing story about
the first celebration.

It concerns a brave capitaine named Miles Stan
dish (known in France as Kilometres Deboutish)
and a young, shy lieutenant named Jean Alden.
Both of them were in love with a flower of Ply
mouth called Priscilla Mullens (no translation).
The vieux capitaine said to the jeune lieutenant:
"Go to the damsel Priscilla (allez tres vite chez
Priscilla), the loveliest maiden of Plymouth (la
plus jolie demoiselle de Plymouth). Say that a
blunt old captain, a man not of words but of ac
tion (un vieux Fanfan la Tulipe), offers his hand
and his heart, the hand and heart of a soldier.
Not in these words, you know, but this, in short,
is my meaning.
Although Jean was fit to be tied (eonvenable a
etre emballe), friendship prevailed over love and
he went to do his duty. But instead of using ele
gant language he blurted out his mission. Pris
cilla was muted with amazement and sorrow
At length she exclaimed, interrupting the omi
nous silence: "If the great captain of Plymouth
is so very eager to wed me, who does he not
come himself and take the trouble to woo me?
Jean said that Kilometres Deboutish was very
busy and didn't have time for those things. He
staggered on, telling what a wonderful husband
Kilometres would make. But finally Priscilla
arched her eyebrows and said in a tremulous
voice: "Why don't you speak for yourself, John?
And so, every fourth Thursday in November,
American families sit down at a large table brim
ming with tasty dishes, and for the only time
during the year eat better than the French do.
