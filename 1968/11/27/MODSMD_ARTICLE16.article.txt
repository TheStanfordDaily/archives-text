# Friendly Cop Speaks
## 'Police Not Out To Suppress Rights' 
### BARBARA RITZ 
(EDITOR'S NOTK ... As one
Daily staffer was doing her
job one night at 4 a.m., the Stan
ford police suddenly burst Into
the Daily office.)
POLICE: "0.K., what's going
on here?"
DAILY STAFFER: "Just rou
tine work, officer."
POLICE: "We got a call
about a disturbance outside the
DAILY office.
DAILY STAFFER: (looks puz
zled) "There's nobody here but
me."
POLICE: (looks puzzled) "Not
another false alarm? Well, you
might as well come along any
way," he said. So the Daily
staffer went along on the rou
tine beat.
It's no closely guarded secret
who is using marijuana on cam
pus, commented the patrolman,
and the Stanford police could
easily play a game of finding
out. But they aren't doing it.
The Stanford police would
rather leave the investigations
and vice squad tactics up to the
county Sheriff's office. Mean
while, the Stanford police are
too busy getting Stanford stu
dents out of trouble and possi
bly out of jail when they're ar
rested by the Palo Alto police
force.

In spite of critical remarks
made by some campus organiza
tions, the Stanford police aren't
out to suppress anyone's rights,
patrolman Wayne Warwick told
The Daily.
'Fascist Dig' Hurts
"It hurts to be called a fascist
pig or some equally colorful
name by them when you are
trying to help them out of situ
ations in which they can't help
themselves," he said.
There are complaints made
against "your armed and dan
gerous police on the Stanford
campus," he said. "But what are
you supposed to do when you
confront three guys who are
stripping a motorcycle, who
probably aren't even Stanford
students, and you aren't wear
ing a gun?" he asked. "Do you
tell them to break it up?"
There are many places where
it's unsafe for Stanford students
to walk through, Warwick said.
Most of these areas are dimly
lit roads or completely dark
ened places concealed by a heavy
wall of eucalyptus trees.
Behind the mausoleum are a
series of footpaths and dirt
roads that lead toward the Stan
ford shopping plaza. Few stu
dents would actually use those
footpaths unless they had to.
Warwick told The Daily that

a high powered lamp was put
up to illuminate a walkway lead
ing toward Embarcadero Road.
Students who live off campus
use the path when returning
home in the evening.
Patrols Needed
Nurses at the Veteran's Hos
pital get off duty at all hours of
the day. Warwick commented
that the patrol cars are needed
in these areas. He labeled Frost
Amphitheater as a "hangout for
midnight pot parties and other
goings-on."
"There are so many places
like these on the campus. It's
not a question of being either
brave or foolish enough to come
here," he explained. "Some
times students just have to walk
this way. Or else they don't
think that anything dangerous
can happen to them."
Warwick called Stanford Uni
versity a "regular little city"
with enough people to create
any number of situations that
require police protection.
Campus Assaults
Several campus incidents of
attempted assaults on students
have been reported. Last year
an armed man wearing a gold
earring in his left ear threat
ened students walking alone at
night. The man was arrested
later this year.
Incidents of attempted as
saults have kept the police force
alert to the need for constant
patrol of the campus. The thirty
policemen are more involved
with protection than they are
with persecution of Stanford
students.
Bell Discusses Protection
Stanford Police Chief Thomas

Bell discussed various ways the
Stanford police force can pro
tect students.
"Normally if a Stanford stu
dent is arrested in another jur
isdiction, the other police force
doesn't call us," he said. "If it's
a question of whether or not
they will arrest a student, and
if his past record and attitude
comes into question, then we
can offer assistance."
Chief Bell explained that the
county Sheriff's office does not
usually tell the Stanford police
about its activities with Stan
ford students. He added, how
ever, that if the Stanford police
learn of an individual situation,
then they usually attempt to no
tify the Dean of Student's office
in order to help out the stu
dent.
'Middle Man*
Bell described the Stanford
police as a kind of "middle
man" in situations involving the
administration and students in
campus problems. The Stanford
police are also more involved
with preliminary investigations
than with arrests, he said.
"We do get reports once in a
while from students in which
they lodge complaints that pot
smoking is going on in some
dorm on campus. We have no
choice but to take some action
here."
Marijuana Solution
Bell, however, feels that more
can be accomplished by going
to the source of the marijuana
problem on campus. He believes
in telling students about the
hazards of pot smoking and the
consequences they face if they
are caught.

Going to the other extreme is
no solution, he explained. "You
don't accomplish a whole lot by
arresting a mass of students,"
Bell said. "But if a violation is
thrown at our face, we don't
ignore it."
Bell would prefer that stu
dents see something besides the
cop image that most people are
so aware of.
"We go out of our way to give
talks to students," he said, in
dicating a speech given last
Wednesday night by Sergeant
Carl Giletz about Civil War fire
arms. Bell also mentioned talks
to various cub scout groups on
bicycle safety.
"We like to have students see
us as human beings, too."
