# Volunteer Center Finally Permanent
## 
### BRIAN McCAFFREY 
After two years of false starts
the university has finally estab
lished a permanent placement
service for students interested
in doing volunteer work.
The Volunteer Services Cen
ter, located on the third floor of
the Clubhouse, lists contacts and
descriptions for numerous proj
ects including tutoring, working
with handicapped blind or re
tarded children, counseling, re
search assistance or work with
foreign students.
The office came into being last
April 1 through the combined ef
forts of the Dean of Stutdents'
office and Cardinals Board, a
campus service organization. A
number of similar efforts have
preceded the creation of the Vol
unteer Services Center in the
past two years but none with
lasting success. The Center is
presently being supported by
funds from the Dean of Stu
dents office.
Several local high schools are
in need of tutors for their stu
dents. Two projects especially
being emphasized are the "Go-
Go to College" tutorial at Ra
venswood High School which is
sponsored by the Black Students
Union and the Mountain View

High School tutorial sponsored
by Robert Cree Freelon Inc.
National Programs
In addition to acting as a
clearinghouse for local projects
the center also provides infor
mation and applications for most
national programs, such as
VISTA, Peace Corps and Job
Corps. Information is also avail
able on projects being run dur
ing the summer and the vaca
tions.
Mrs. Barbara Dray, Assistant
Dean of Students, and sponsor
its functions very shortly. Rep
resentatives from different proj
ects will be coming to residence
halls for dinner to discuss their
programs.
Hopefully this will spur an
increase in the number of vol
unteers and perhaps provide the
impetus for starting residence
involvement. Plans for faculty
involvement, seminars and orien
tation are also under considera
tion.
The center is open Monday
through Friday from 8 a.m. to
6 p.m. There is a tremendous
need for volunteers in the near
by communities and the only re
quirement is the steady commit
ment of an hour or two a week.
