# Program For Ph.D. In Religion Started
## 
### 
The Senate of the Academic
Council recently approved plans
to institute a Ph.D. curriculum
in religious studies at Stanford
next year.
The new graduate program
will be administered by Humani
ties Special Programs. The eight
prof ssors of religious studies at
Stanford will serve as teaching
staff. Eleven other faculty mem
bers from other departments
will contribute to the program
through their specialities.
According to Professor Wil
liam A. Clebsch, head of Hu
manities Sp cial Programs, the
program is designed as a "hu
manistic study of religions,"
rather than a training ground
for those interested in minister
ial pursuits.

Clebsch explained that the
program was developed in re
sponse to concern d student in
terest and a demand for profes
sional educators in the field of
religious studies. He also de
scribed the program as a vehicle
for preparing editors, writers,
and others in religious oriented
fields.
A 1966 study of present li
brary facilities at Stanford, Cleb
sch pointed out, indicated that
long runs of approximately two
thirds of the periodicals deemed
necessary for graduate theologi
cal study are catalogued. He
also m ntioned other University
library sources such as the rare
book holdings in the Bender
room as indispensable to the
study of the history of Western
religious thought.
