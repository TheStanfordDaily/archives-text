# Library's 7th Floor Mystery
## Bender Room Has Valuable Books 
### BARBARA HYLAND 
For many people there is
something mysterious about the
locked part of the seventh level
of the stacks. Even some of the
staff at the Main library wonder
and speculate about it.
One librarian said she had no
idea what was kept up there, but
she was very curious to know.
The man at the information
desk said that he had heard that
the section was locked in order
to safeguard dirty books. He
claimed that they were fre
quently stolen because of their
prurient appeal.
Julius Barclay, chief of the
Division of Special Collections,
refuted this and discussed the

puzzling closed stacks.
Since most pornography is
readily available in paperback,
most dirty books are kept on the
open shelves. Only "a handful of
pornographic books that are dif
ficult to buy" are kept locked be
cause they are "very expensive,"
he explained.
Not Unique
Keeping books under lock and
key is "not unique to Stanford."
Barclay said the books in the
special collections are there be
cause of their "monetary value,
fragility, beauty, and unique
ness."
The seventh level of the stacks
houses part of the Charlotte
Ashley Felton Memorial Library.

This is a collection of nineteenth
and twentieth century English
and American literature.
Many of the special collection
books are shelved in the Bender
Room. The card eatalogue for
all the special collections which
include the Felton Library, the
Rare Books Collection, the
Gunst Collection, The Newton
Collection, and the Manuscript
Collection, is also there.
Barclay stressed that the Ben
der Room is "not an ivory tower
or a treasure room." The books
are meant for both faculty and
students. By filling out a call
slip one can use any of them.
Bender Comfort
The Bender Room with its
comfortable chairs, glass book
cases, Persian rugs, and an
tiques is more reminiscent of a
library in an old mansion than
in a university building. Bar
clay urges students just to come
in and look around. He re
marked how unfortunate it is
that the only time some students
come there is when they tour
the campus with their parents
on graduation day.
In looking through the book
cases, one can only marvel at
the beautifully bound and print
ed volumes. The first printed
copy of Aristotle; fifteenth cen
tury manuscripts painted on vel
lum; old memory books; copies
of David Copperfield in its ori
ginal magazine installment
form; personal letters of D. H.
Lawrence; first editions of "Pa
radise Lost"â€”all can be found
in the Bender Room.

Barclay said that the Special
Collections contain 70,000 vol
umes, but he could not estimate
their value. Prices fluctuate con
siderably. In acquiring books, he
does not play the market. In
stead, he deals with reputable
book dealers or buys through
catalogues.
The Felton Library is the larg
est and "most widely used" of
the seventh floor mystery rooms,
according to Barclay. This li
brary tries to build a collection
of an author in depth, using bi
ographies, bibliographies, let
ters, and manuscripts.
English Authors
It is strongest in nineteenth
contury English and twentieth
Century American authors. It
has extensive material on Thac
keray, Trollope, Dickens, Brown
ing, and Kipling. Of the later
English authors, Lawrence,
Joyce, and Shelley are most com
plete. Barclay said that it is
weak in Keats and Wordsworth.
In American literature the
Felton Library has fine collec
tions of James, Train, Whitman,
Hemingway, and London. The
material for Emerson and Haw
thorne is not as comprehensive.
Another part of the special
collections is the Rare Book sec
tion. Books are kept there be
cause of their age. There is con
siderable amount of sixteenth
century literature published on
the continent, "which reflects a
direct interest of the faculty."
Due to limited funds, the li
brary tries to build on its
strengths. There is consequently

a concentration of eighteenth
century English and German
literature and also books of the
French Revolutionary period in
the Rare Books Collection.
Book Art
The Gunst Collection reflects
the history of book arts and fine
printing for all countries and all
periods. The books are "beautiful
examples of printing and also
important texts." The "best bind
ing done in the country" has
been in the San Francisco area
which Barclay said is especially
fortunate in acquiring books.
Also in the special collections
is the Newton Collection, which
shows the history of mathema
tics, physics, and astronomy. It
concentrates on Newton and the
people whom he influenced.
The Manuscript Collection is
divided into two parts. The first
part complements the Felton Li
brary with letters of its authors.
The second part houses the
Borel manuscripts given in 191!i.
These include over a million doc
uments on California politics
and history- Barclay said the stu
dents come from as far as Har
vard, Princeton, and Yale to re
fer to the collection, but that
very few Stanford students ever
use it.
One can reach the Bender
Room at the seventh floor of
the Main Library by braving the
shaky elevator, or if less coura
geous, by taking the stairs. Then
when the question of the mys
terious closed shelves arises, one
will be able to smile smugly and
knowingly.
