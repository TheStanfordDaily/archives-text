# Espresso, Pastrami, Music Make Warm Coffeehouse
## 
### 
"This place oozes atmosphere,
(signed) Monday night"
The new coffeehouse in Tre
sidder Memorial Union sets its
informal tone with spontaneous
messages such as this one writ
ten on the walls.
Stanford's pool sharks would
hardly recognize their old haunt
since November 1. It has been
transformed into a warm and
friendly meeting place with the
help of a hard-working commit
tee and $20,000 from Tresidder.
The daytime crowd includes
little-old-ladies in hats and busi
ness men in white shirts and
ties. They just don't fit in, even
though the coffeehouse tries to
cater to different segments of
the Stanford community.
Patrons are encouraged to use
the open stage, put up th« ir own
artwork, and in general, to "do
their own thing." This means
anything from an impromptu
play to a three-hour lunch.
Genuine Espresso Machine
The genuine espresso coffee
machine (complete with groans)

is essential in making this a real
coffeehouse and not just another
coffeeshop. "The bar (which
serves anything from Cappucino
coffce to Pastrami sandwiches)
is the common denominator
bringing together people from
all walks of life," according to
Richard Elmore, general mana
ger
With a few restrictions of time
and volume, almost anyone can
use the stage to show off his
abilities. Flute solos, folk music,
harmanica blowing accompany
the whir of the coffee machine.
Sam MoGowan is now a regu
lar singer and piano player be
cause of the devoted, late-hour
clientele he's built up. A veteran
of European coffeehouses, Sam
says,"I really dig the place."
In general, the Coffffeehouse
Committee, headed by Ted Lor
ing, tries to achieve an atmos
phere that is conducive to good,
uninhibited conversation. There
has been debate between those
who want more and louder en
tertainment (such as electric

bands) and those who prefer a
lower sound level.
Greg Yahna, in charge of pro
gramming, is making enthusi
astic plans for the future. The
goal in the 7-8 p.m. coffe-hours
(every night except Friday and
Saturday) is "a personal ex
change with people you nor
mally encounter in impersonal
situations—like classes or read
ing them in the various media."
When a proposed seminar room
is completed, classes may be
scheduled for the "quiet corner."
Financial Problem
The main problems are basic
ally financial: lack of proper ac
coustics and sound system, un
trained staff, insufficient bar
equipment. LASSU appropriated
$800 to help out, but it isn't
enough for everything that is
needed.
"We think we're making a
profit, but we're not sure yet.
We can't afford to work at a
loss," says Elmore. "Tresidder
has already broken into their
reserve building fund to help
us."
