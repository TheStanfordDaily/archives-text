## Ralston Rehired As Football Coach Daily Sport 
### 
Stanford announced yesterday
that Coach John Ralston's ap
pointment as head football coach
will be renewed when his pres
ent appointment expires Janu
ary 31, 1969. The terms of the
new appointment were not an
nounced but it was revealed that
the contract will extend beyond
one year, as has been the case
in the past.
Taylor Enthusiastic
Director of Athletics Chuck
Taylor expressed his enthusiasm
for Ralston's appointment.
"Coach Ralston has done an ex
cellent job for Stanford. His
coaches and team have produced
an imaginative and exciting sea
son exemplified by a thorough
mastery of fundamentals and
one of the finest offensive rec
ords in the country.

"The team's third place finish
in the Pacific-Eight Confex*ence
is the best record of a Stanford
football team in several years.
We feel confident that Coach
Ralston, his assistant coach s,
and team members are well on
their way to many more excit ing
and successful seasons."
We're No. 19!
Stanford ended the year with
a 6-3-1 record, third place in the
Pacific-Eight Confer nee and the
19th spot in the final national
ranking by UPI.
Ralston still isn't completely
satisfied, however. "The only
successful year is 10-0, or pos
sibly 9-1 because you expect to
have one bad game a year as
we had against Oregon State.
But not three flat games in a
row," he declared.

Ralston was especially pleased
about the Big Game win. "Every
Big Game win is satisfying, but
this was the sweetest of them
all."
Ralston's teams have won five
out of the last six Big Games.
He continues, "I've often
thought that the first and last
games of the year are the most
important. The momnntum of
the last three games should car
ry over to next year."
Some of next year's momen
tum will be in the form of such
returning stars as Jim Plunkett,
Don Parish, Bubba Brown,
Howie Williams, Jack Lasater,
and a host of others.
The main holes to be filled
will be in the defensive line,
and of course flanker Gene
Washington.

Some of next year's momen

returning stars as Jim Plunkett,
Don Parish, Bubba Brown,
Howie Williams, Jack Lasater,
and a host of others.
The main holes to be filled

Stanford announced yesterday
that Coach John Ralston's ap
pointment as head football coach
will be renewed when his pres
ent appointment expires Janu
ary 31, 1969. The terms of the
new appointment were not an
nounced but it was revealed that
the contract will extend beyond
one year, as has been the case
in the past.
Taylor Enthusiastic
Director of Athletics Chuck
Taylor expressed his enthusiasm
for Ralston's appointment.
"Coach Ralston has done an ex
cellent job for Stanford. His
coaches and team have produced
an imaginative and exciting sea
son exemplified by a thorough
mastery of fundamentals and
one of the finest offensive rec
ords in the country.

"The team's third place finish
in the Pacific-Eight Confex*ence
is the best record of a Stanford
football team in several years.
We feel confident that Coach
Ralston, his assistant coach s,
and team members are well on
their way to many more excit ing
and successful seasons."
We're No. 19!
Stanford ended the year with
a 6-3-1 record, third place in the
Pacific-Eight Confer nee and the
19th spot in the final national
ranking by UPI.
Ralston still isn't completely
satisfied, however. "The only
successful year is 10-0, or pos
sibly 9-1 because you expect to
have one bad game a year as
we had against Oregon State.
But not three flat games in a
row," he declared.

Ralston was especially pleased
about the Big Game win. "Every
Big Game win is satisfying, but
this was the sweetest of them
all."
Ralston's teams have won five
out of the last six Big Games.
He continues, "I've often
thought that the first and last
games of the year are the most
important. The momnntum of
the last three games should car
ry over to next year."
Some of next year's momen
tum will be in the form of such
returning stars as Jim Plunkett,
Don Parish, Bubba Brown,
Howie Williams, Jack Lasater,
and a host of others.
The main holes to be filled
will be in the defensive line,
and of course flanker Gene
Washington.
