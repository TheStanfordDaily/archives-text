HOOPLA â€”Stanford's basketball season gets under way this Satur
day night at 8 p.m. as the Tribe takes on Northwestern in the Pa
vilion. The first game in the new Roscoe Maples Pavilion Ls sched
uled for January 3 against Brigham Young.
Senior Guard Don Griffin (above, driving around UCLA's Lucius
Allen) will be carrying most of the scoring burden this season.
Griir was the Tribe's second leading scorer last year, averaging 12
points per game.
Other returning starters are forward Mai McElwain, and centers
Bill Palmer and Steve Kuchenbecher, both juniors. Palmer got off
to a promising start last year as a soph, but was sidelined for the
season by a torn ligament in his knee. Kuchenbecher was the reg
ular center for the rest of the s<*ason.
Dennis O'Neill and Mike Michael, both stars on last year's frosh
team, are the leading sophomores. O'Neill averaged 21.4 last year
and set a frosh single-game scoring mark with 38.
Ijvck of height, for the umpteenth year in a row, will be the
Tribe's major problem this season. Palmer, at 6-7, is the bigg<*st man
on the team. The front line will average a pygmy-like 6-5.
