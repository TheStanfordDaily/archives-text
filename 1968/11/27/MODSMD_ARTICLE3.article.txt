# TA's Reach Pay Increase Settlement After Blast At Administration Tactics
## 
### MARK WEINBERGER 
Teaching assistants (TA's)
yesterday accepted an adminis
tration compromise on salary
increase demands, thus averting
a threatened TA strike.
Political science TA's accepted
as "a significant first step" a
solution in which they will re
ceive a package deal of $300 for
the r st of this academic year,
although with many grumblings
about administration tactics.
Richard Young and Frank
Cady, representatives of politi
cal science and English TA's who
issued pay increase demands last
month, last night convinced the
membership of the graduate stu
dent union to accept the s ttle
ment.
The strike threat was ended
when American Federation of

Teachers Local 1816 (AFT)
voted overwhelmingly not to
take a strike vot^.
Acceptance of the compromise
by the ten political science TA's
assured an end to the month
long controversy, since the TA's
from that department first pre
sent d demands for an immed
iate $700 per year increase and
have consistently taken the most
militant stands.
The settlement reached in
cludes approximately $200 in ex
tra funds for this year for r ach
TA in six academic programs
judged "urgent cases". In addi
tion, political science TA's will
receive an additional $100 each
from department sources.
Widespr ad dissatisfac
tion among political science
graduate students and some fac

ulty resulted from faculty-ad
ministration-TA conferences this
week. One student commented,
"We've be n deceived, double
crossed, and lied to" by the ad
ministration and a faculty mem
ber added that the settlement
was "a shoddy deal."
As an example of shodiness, it
was reported that a firm settl -
ment of $400 per political science
TA was agreed upon by students
and administrators last Friday,
only to be slashed to $200 over
the weekend.
Last night's AFT meeting took
a militant tone, although th 90
members present voted with lit
tle dissent to endorse TA-admin
istration settlement and to with
hold a strike vote.
However, the union made it
clear that th • issue of TA work

loads and compensation is by no
means closed. The members
voted to continue salary nego
tiations with the administration
"where the students concerned
so desire it," to increas « pay to
all departments "where need
can be shown by the end of win
ter quarter, to consider salaries
and compensation for research
assistants and graduate stud nts
in general, and to set up a Uni
versity-wide grievance proced
ure for union members.
Members vociferously con
demned administration tactics, it
was dr-cided not to take a strik
vote "at this time."
It was felt an "unambiguous
victory" had been won since the
administration had replied di
rectly to the union, thus grant
ing de facto recognition, and had
recognized that TA's are paid
for servic s rendered since work
loads are now being taken into
consideration, rather than sim
ply part of the graduate educa
tion 4 process.
Graduate Student Association
President Barry Askinas com
mented at the meeting that his
group would take no active ne
gotiating role in salary dis
cussions.
Before the meeting, political
scientist Young explained the
actions of his group. "While we
are not completely happy with
the settlement, we have re
ceived a significant pay increase.

We regard a strike as only a last
resort," Young said.
In addition, he explained, the
political science TA's were
"pleased that a settlement was
made to increase the stipends of
all have-not teaching assistants,"
referring to the $200 increases
given to six other departments
by the administrators.
On the subject of the addition
al faculty funds amounting to
$100 per TA to be added to de
partmental and administrative
reserves, Young had this to say:
"The faculty is very sympathe
tic to our problems and felt that
we are underpaid. They are try
ing to help us by subsidizing the
administration subsidy."
Also, Young extolled the bene
ficial value of the graduate stu
dent union in reaching the set
tlement, stating that "the admin
istration turned us down cold
earlier and only found money
after demands and strike pres
sure were exerted."
Young added later that "deal
ings with Mr. Lyman were com
pletely unsatisfactory. Future
good faith negotiations with him
are impossible."
After their meeting Monday
night, the political science TA's
issued a statement that, in addi

tion to accepting the adminis
tration's salary proposal, placed
the blame for the recent con
frontation on "administration
delay and recalcitrance."
The TA's added that "the ad
ministration has not been com
pletely candid with us about its
resources, plans and decision
making apparatus ... we as
sume and expect that this situ
ation will not persist and look
forward to the negotiation of
next year's contract with the
administration this spring."
In comments to The Dally
yesterday, Provost Richard Ly
man stated, "I hope we've solved
this." He had "no comment" as
to whether incoming President
Kenneth Pitzer agreed to the
settlement.
Lyman expressed the hope
that future disagreements could
be "worked out without threats"
on one side and "without delay
and footdragging on the other.
'No Footdragging'
However, Lyman denied that
the administration was guilty of
"delay and footdragging" over
the TA salary issue. "The whole

issue was first brought up at an
October 16 press conference," he
noted. "That's not much time."
Lyman claimed that any blame
for delay in treating the prob
lem rests with individual de
partments. "Departments did
not get involved quickly or fully
enough," he said.
He explained that depart
ments did not evaluate the fi
nancial situation of their teach
ing assistants until administra
tors began departmental sur
veys.
"Teaching assistants are part
of departments. Departments
have not taken full responsibili
ty for them," he stated.
On a more optimistic note, Ly
man hoped that "we can get
this whole business on a differ
ent footing, a more reasonable
basis." He said that the present
solution is only "an immediate
poultice," for use until a sweep
ing review of assumptions un
derlying the teaching assistant
system can be begun.
"We have to make sure that
we have a viable and reasonable
system" that can deal effective
ly with inequities, he explained.
"We've just begun at this point."
Political Science Prof. Charles
Drekmeier, who worked closely

with the department's TA's, saw
the settlement in a different
light.
"Many of us feel this raise was
a token, a gesture. It was just
enough to put off a strike,"
Drekmeier charged. "The TA's
are very unhappy; the whole
thing was a bit shoddy. And
many of us on the faculty a
gree."
Drekmeier added that the raise
came for a large part from de
partmental reserves.
"We were asked to make a
contribution out of our reserves.
We now can't spend the funds
for other pressing needs" like
guest lecturers and subsidies
for dissertation writers. "As far
as we are concerned, the raise
came from our department," he
stated.
According to Drekmeier, the
proposed extra $100 in salary
raises will come from another
department account. The reason
for the additional funds is that
"other departments don't have
work loads comparable to the
one for our TA's." He said that
the extra $1,000 may be taken
at a faculty meeting this after
noon from the reader - hiring
fund, thus limiting faculty use
of hired paper-readers.

Teaching assistants (TA's)
yesterday accepted an adminis
tration compromise on salary
increase demands, thus averting
a threatened TA strike.
Political science TA's accepted
as "a significant first step" a
solution in which they will re
ceive a package deal of $300 for
the r st of this academic year,
although with many grumblings
about administration tactics.
Richard Young and Frank
Cady, representatives of politi
cal science and English TA's who
issued pay increase demands last
month, last night convinced the
membership of the graduate stu
dent union to accept the s ttle
ment.
The strike threat was ended
when American Federation of

Teachers Local 1816 (AFT)
voted overwhelmingly not to
take a strike vot^.
Acceptance of the compromise
by the ten political science TA's
assured an end to the month
long controversy, since the TA's
from that department first pre
sent d demands for an immed
iate $700 per year increase and
have consistently taken the most
militant stands.
The settlement reached in
cludes approximately $200 in ex
tra funds for this year for r ach
TA in six academic programs
judged "urgent cases". In addi
tion, political science TA's will
receive an additional $100 each
from department sources.
Widespr ad dissatisfac
tion among political science
graduate students and some fac

ulty resulted from faculty-ad
ministration-TA conferences this
week. One student commented,
"We've be n deceived, double
crossed, and lied to" by the ad
ministration and a faculty mem
ber added that the settlement
was "a shoddy deal."
As an example of shodiness, it
was reported that a firm settl -
ment of $400 per political science
TA was agreed upon by students
and administrators last Friday,
only to be slashed to $200 over
the weekend.
Last night's AFT meeting took
a militant tone, although th 90
members present voted with lit
tle dissent to endorse TA-admin
istration settlement and to with
hold a strike vote.
However, the union made it
clear that th • issue of TA work

loads and compensation is by no
means closed. The members
voted to continue salary nego
tiations with the administration
"where the students concerned
so desire it," to increas « pay to
all departments "where need
can be shown by the end of win
ter quarter, to consider salaries
and compensation for research
assistants and graduate stud nts
in general, and to set up a Uni
versity-wide grievance proced
ure for union members.
Members vociferously con
demned administration tactics, it
was dr-cided not to take a strik
vote "at this time."
It was felt an "unambiguous
victory" had been won since the
administration had replied di
rectly to the union, thus grant
ing de facto recognition, and had
recognized that TA's are paid
for servic s rendered since work
loads are now being taken into
consideration, rather than sim
ply part of the graduate educa
tion 4 process.
Graduate Student Association
President Barry Askinas com
mented at the meeting that his
group would take no active ne
gotiating role in salary dis
cussions.
Before the meeting, political
scientist Young explained the
actions of his group. "While we
are not completely happy with
the settlement, we have re
ceived a significant pay increase.

We regard a strike as only a last
resort," Young said.
In addition, he explained, the
political science TA's were
"pleased that a settlement was
made to increase the stipends of
all have-not teaching assistants,"
referring to the $200 increases
given to six other departments
by the administrators.
On the subject of the addition
al faculty funds amounting to
$100 per TA to be added to de
partmental and administrative
reserves, Young had this to say:
"The faculty is very sympathe
tic to our problems and felt that
we are underpaid. They are try
ing to help us by subsidizing the
administration subsidy."
Also, Young extolled the bene
ficial value of the graduate stu
dent union in reaching the set
tlement, stating that "the admin
istration turned us down cold
earlier and only found money
after demands and strike pres
sure were exerted."
Young added later that "deal
ings with Mr. Lyman were com
pletely unsatisfactory. Future
good faith negotiations with him
are impossible."
After their meeting Monday
night, the political science TA's
issued a statement that, in addi

tion to accepting the adminis
tration's salary proposal, placed
the blame for the recent con
frontation on "administration
delay and recalcitrance."
The TA's added that "the ad
ministration has not been com
pletely candid with us about its
resources, plans and decision
making apparatus ... we as
sume and expect that this situ
ation will not persist and look
forward to the negotiation of
next year's contract with the
administration this spring."
In comments to The Dally
yesterday, Provost Richard Ly
man stated, "I hope we've solved
this." He had "no comment" as
to whether incoming President
Kenneth Pitzer agreed to the
settlement.
Lyman expressed the hope
that future disagreements could
be "worked out without threats"
on one side and "without delay
and footdragging on the other.
'No Footdragging'
However, Lyman denied that
the administration was guilty of
"delay and footdragging" over
the TA salary issue. "The whole

issue was first brought up at an
October 16 press conference," he
noted. "That's not much time."
Lyman claimed that any blame
for delay in treating the prob
lem rests with individual de
partments. "Departments did
not get involved quickly or fully
enough," he said.
He explained that depart
ments did not evaluate the fi
nancial situation of their teach
ing assistants until administra
tors began departmental sur
veys.
"Teaching assistants are part
of departments. Departments
have not taken full responsibili
ty for them," he stated.
On a more optimistic note, Ly
man hoped that "we can get
this whole business on a differ
ent footing, a more reasonable
basis." He said that the present
solution is only "an immediate
poultice," for use until a sweep
ing review of assumptions un
derlying the teaching assistant
system can be begun.
"We have to make sure that
we have a viable and reasonable
system" that can deal effective
ly with inequities, he explained.
"We've just begun at this point."
Political Science Prof. Charles
Drekmeier, who worked closely

with the department's TA's, saw
the settlement in a different
light.
"Many of us feel this raise was
a token, a gesture. It was just
enough to put off a strike,"
Drekmeier charged. "The TA's
are very unhappy; the whole
thing was a bit shoddy. And
many of us on the faculty a
gree."
Drekmeier added that the raise
came for a large part from de
partmental reserves.
"We were asked to make a
contribution out of our reserves.
We now can't spend the funds
for other pressing needs" like
guest lecturers and subsidies
for dissertation writers. "As far
as we are concerned, the raise
came from our department," he
stated.
According to Drekmeier, the
proposed extra $100 in salary
raises will come from another
department account. The reason
for the additional funds is that
"other departments don't have
work loads comparable to the
one for our TA's." He said that
the extra $1,000 may be taken
at a faculty meeting this after

for the additional funds is that

Teaching assistants (TA's)
yesterday accepted an adminis
tration compromise on salary
increase demands, thus averting
a threatened TA strike.
Political science TA's accepted
as "a significant first step" a
solution in which they will re
ceive a package deal of $300 for
the r st of this academic year,
although with many grumblings
about administration tactics.
Richard Young and Frank
Cady, representatives of politi
cal science and English TA's who
issued pay increase demands last
month, last night convinced the
membership of the graduate stu
dent union to accept the s ttle
ment.
The strike threat was ended
when American Federation of

Teachers Local 1816 (AFT)
voted overwhelmingly not to
take a strike vot^.
Acceptance of the compromise
by the ten political science TA's
assured an end to the month
long controversy, since the TA's
from that department first pre
sent d demands for an immed
iate $700 per year increase and
have consistently taken the most
militant stands.
The settlement reached in
cludes approximately $200 in ex
tra funds for this year for r ach
TA in six academic programs
judged "urgent cases". In addi
tion, political science TA's will
receive an additional $100 each
from department sources.
Widespr ad dissatisfac
tion among political science
graduate students and some fac

ulty resulted from faculty-ad
ministration-TA conferences this
week. One student commented,
"We've be n deceived, double
crossed, and lied to" by the ad
ministration and a faculty mem
ber added that the settlement
was "a shoddy deal."
As an example of shodiness, it
was reported that a firm settl -
ment of $400 per political science
TA was agreed upon by students
and administrators last Friday,
only to be slashed to $200 over
the weekend.
Last night's AFT meeting took
a militant tone, although th 90
members present voted with lit
tle dissent to endorse TA-admin
istration settlement and to with
hold a strike vote.
However, the union made it
clear that th • issue of TA work

loads and compensation is by no
means closed. The members
voted to continue salary nego
tiations with the administration
"where the students concerned
so desire it," to increas « pay to
all departments "where need
can be shown by the end of win
ter quarter, to consider salaries
and compensation for research
assistants and graduate stud nts
in general, and to set up a Uni
versity-wide grievance proced
ure for union members.
Members vociferously con
demned administration tactics, it
was dr-cided not to take a strik
vote "at this time."
It was felt an "unambiguous
victory" had been won since the
administration had replied di
rectly to the union, thus grant
ing de facto recognition, and had
recognized that TA's are paid
for servic s rendered since work
loads are now being taken into
consideration, rather than sim
ply part of the graduate educa
tion 4 process.
Graduate Student Association
President Barry Askinas com
mented at the meeting that his
group would take no active ne
gotiating role in salary dis
cussions.
Before the meeting, political
scientist Young explained the
actions of his group. "While we
are not completely happy with
the settlement, we have re
ceived a significant pay increase.

We regard a strike as only a last
resort," Young said.
In addition, he explained, the
political science TA's were
"pleased that a settlement was
made to increase the stipends of
all have-not teaching assistants,"
referring to the $200 increases
given to six other departments
by the administrators.
On the subject of the addition
al faculty funds amounting to
$100 per TA to be added to de
partmental and administrative
reserves, Young had this to say:
"The faculty is very sympathe
tic to our problems and felt that
we are underpaid. They are try
ing to help us by subsidizing the
administration subsidy."
Also, Young extolled the bene
ficial value of the graduate stu
dent union in reaching the set
tlement, stating that "the admin
istration turned us down cold
earlier and only found money
after demands and strike pres
sure were exerted."
Young added later that "deal
ings with Mr. Lyman were com
pletely unsatisfactory. Future
good faith negotiations with him
are impossible."
After their meeting Monday
night, the political science TA's
issued a statement that, in addi

tion to accepting the adminis
tration's salary proposal, placed
the blame for the recent con
frontation on "administration
delay and recalcitrance."
The TA's added that "the ad
ministration has not been com
pletely candid with us about its
resources, plans and decision
making apparatus ... we as
sume and expect that this situ
ation will not persist and look
forward to the negotiation of
next year's contract with the
administration this spring."
In comments to The Dally
yesterday, Provost Richard Ly
man stated, "I hope we've solved
this." He had "no comment" as
to whether incoming President
Kenneth Pitzer agreed to the
settlement.
Lyman expressed the hope
that future disagreements could
be "worked out without threats"
on one side and "without delay
and footdragging on the other.
'No Footdragging'
However, Lyman denied that
the administration was guilty of
"delay and footdragging" over
the TA salary issue. "The whole

issue was first brought up at an
October 16 press conference," he
noted. "That's not much time."
Lyman claimed that any blame
for delay in treating the prob
lem rests with individual de
partments. "Departments did
not get involved quickly or fully
enough," he said.
He explained that depart
ments did not evaluate the fi
nancial situation of their teach
ing assistants until administra
tors began departmental sur
veys.
"Teaching assistants are part
of departments. Departments
have not taken full responsibili
ty for them," he stated.
On a more optimistic note, Ly
man hoped that "we can get
this whole business on a differ
ent footing, a more reasonable
basis." He said that the present
solution is only "an immediate
poultice," for use until a sweep
ing review of assumptions un
derlying the teaching assistant
system can be begun.
"We have to make sure that
we have a viable and reasonable
system" that can deal effective
ly with inequities, he explained.
"We've just begun at this point."
Political Science Prof. Charles
Drekmeier, who worked closely

with the department's TA's, saw
the settlement in a different
light.
"Many of us feel this raise was
a token, a gesture. It was just
enough to put off a strike,"
Drekmeier charged. "The TA's
are very unhappy; the whole
thing was a bit shoddy. And
many of us on the faculty a
gree."
Drekmeier added that the raise
came for a large part from de
partmental reserves.
"We were asked to make a
contribution out of our reserves.
We now can't spend the funds
for other pressing needs" like
guest lecturers and subsidies
for dissertation writers. "As far
as we are concerned, the raise
came from our department," he
stated.
According to Drekmeier, the
proposed extra $100 in salary
raises will come from another

proposed extra $100 in salary
raises will come from another
department account. The reason
for the additional funds is that
"other departments don't have
work loads comparable to the
one for our TA's." He said that
the extra $1,000 may be taken
at a faculty meeting this after
noon from the reader - hiring

of hired paper-readers.
Teaching assistants (TA's)
yesterday accepted an adminis
tration compromise on salary
increase demands, thus averting
a threatened TA strike.
Political science TA's accepted
as "a significant first step" a
solution in which they will re
ceive a package deal of $300 for
the r st of this academic year,
although with many grumblings
about administration tactics.
Richard Young and Frank
Cady, representatives of politi
cal science and English TA's who
issued pay increase demands last
month, last night convinced the
membership of the graduate stu
dent union to accept the s ttle
ment.
The strike threat was ended
when American Federation of

Teachers Local 1816 (AFT)
voted overwhelmingly not to
take a strike vot^.
Acceptance of the compromise
by the ten political science TA's
assured an end to the month
long controversy, since the TA's
from that department first pre
sent d demands for an immed
iate $700 per year increase and
have consistently taken the most
militant stands.
The settlement reached in
cludes approximately $200 in ex
tra funds for this year for r ach
TA in six academic programs
judged "urgent cases". In addi
tion, political science TA's will
receive an additional $100 each
from department sources.
Widespr ad dissatisfac
tion among political science
graduate students and some fac

ulty resulted from faculty-ad
ministration-TA conferences this
week. One student commented,
"We've be n deceived, double
crossed, and lied to" by the ad
ministration and a faculty mem
ber added that the settlement
was "a shoddy deal."
As an example of shodiness, it
was reported that a firm settl -
ment of $400 per political science
TA was agreed upon by students
and administrators last Friday,
only to be slashed to $200 over
the weekend.
Last night's AFT meeting took
a militant tone, although th 90
members present voted with lit
tle dissent to endorse TA-admin
istration settlement and to with
hold a strike vote.
However, the union made it
clear that th • issue of TA work

loads and compensation is by no
means closed. The members
voted to continue salary nego
tiations with the administration
"where the students concerned
so desire it," to increas « pay to
all departments "where need
can be shown by the end of win
ter quarter, to consider salaries
and compensation for research
assistants and graduate stud nts
in general, and to set up a Uni
versity-wide grievance proced
ure for union members.
Members vociferously con
demned administration tactics, it
was dr-cided not to take a strik
vote "at this time."
It was felt an "unambiguous
victory" had been won since the
administration had replied di
rectly to the union, thus grant
ing de facto recognition, and had
recognized that TA's are paid
for servic s rendered since work
loads are now being taken into
consideration, rather than sim
ply part of the graduate educa
tion 4 process.
Graduate Student Association
President Barry Askinas com
mented at the meeting that his
group would take no active ne
gotiating role in salary dis
cussions.
Before the meeting, political
scientist Young explained the
actions of his group. "While we
are not completely happy with
the settlement, we have re
ceived a significant pay increase.

We regard a strike as only a last
resort," Young said.
In addition, he explained, the
political science TA's were
"pleased that a settlement was
made to increase the stipends of
all have-not teaching assistants,"
referring to the $200 increases
given to six other departments
by the administrators.
On the subject of the addition
al faculty funds amounting to
$100 per TA to be added to de
partmental and administrative
reserves, Young had this to say:
"The faculty is very sympathe
tic to our problems and felt that
we are underpaid. They are try
ing to help us by subsidizing the
administration subsidy."
Also, Young extolled the bene
ficial value of the graduate stu
dent union in reaching the set
tlement, stating that "the admin
istration turned us down cold
earlier and only found money
after demands and strike pres
sure were exerted."
Young added later that "deal
ings with Mr. Lyman were com
pletely unsatisfactory. Future
good faith negotiations with him
are impossible."
After their meeting Monday
night, the political science TA's
issued a statement that, in addi

tion to accepting the adminis
tration's salary proposal, placed
the blame for the recent con
frontation on "administration
delay and recalcitrance."
The TA's added that "the ad
ministration has not been com
pletely candid with us about its
resources, plans and decision
making apparatus ... we as
sume and expect that this situ
ation will not persist and look
forward to the negotiation of
next year's contract with the
administration this spring."
In comments to The Dally
yesterday, Provost Richard Ly
man stated, "I hope we've solved
this." He had "no comment" as
to whether incoming President
Kenneth Pitzer agreed to the
settlement.
Lyman expressed the hope
that future disagreements could
be "worked out without threats"
on one side and "without delay
and footdragging on the other.
'No Footdragging'
However, Lyman denied that
the administration was guilty of
"delay and footdragging" over
the TA salary issue. "The whole

issue was first brought up at an
October 16 press conference," he
noted. "That's not much time."
Lyman claimed that any blame
for delay in treating the prob
lem rests with individual de
partments. "Departments did
not get involved quickly or fully
enough," he said.
He explained that depart
ments did not evaluate the fi
nancial situation of their teach
ing assistants until administra
tors began departmental sur
veys.
"Teaching assistants are part
of departments. Departments
have not taken full responsibili
ty for them," he stated.
On a more optimistic note, Ly
man hoped that "we can get
this whole business on a differ
ent footing, a more reasonable
basis." He said that the present
solution is only "an immediate
poultice," for use until a sweep
ing review of assumptions un
derlying the teaching assistant
system can be begun.
"We have to make sure that
we have a viable and reasonable
system" that can deal effective
ly with inequities, he explained.
"We've just begun at this point."
Political Science Prof. Charles
Drekmeier, who worked closely

with the department's TA's, saw
the settlement in a different
light.
"Many of us feel this raise was
a token, a gesture. It was just
enough to put off a strike,"
Drekmeier charged. "The TA's
are very unhappy; the whole
thing was a bit shoddy. And
many of us on the faculty a
gree."
Drekmeier added that the raise
came for a large part from de
partmental reserves.
"We were asked to make a
contribution out of our reserves.
We now can't spend the funds
for other pressing needs" like
guest lecturers and subsidies
for dissertation writers. "As far
as we are concerned, the raise
came from our department," he
stated.
According to Drekmeier, the
proposed extra $100 in salary
raises will come from another
department account. The reason
