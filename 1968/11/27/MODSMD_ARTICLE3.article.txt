# TA's Reach Pay Increase Settlement After Blast At Administration Tactics
## 
### MARK WEINBERGER 
Teaching assistants (TA's)
yesterday accepted an adminis
tration compromise on salary
increase demands, thus averting
a threatened TA strike.
Political science TA's accepted
as "a significant first step" a
solution in which they will re
ceive a package deal of $300 for
the r st of this academic year,
although with many grumblings
about administration tactics.
Richard Young and Frank
Cady, representatives of politi
cal science and English TA's who
issued pay increase demands last
month, last night convinced the
membership of the graduate stu
dent union to accept the s ttle
ment.
The strike threat was ended
when American Federation of

Teachers Local 1816 (AFT)
voted overwhelmingly not to
take a strike vot^.
Acceptance of the compromise
by the ten political science TA's
assured an end to the month
long controversy, since the TA's
from that department first pre
sent d demands for an immed
iate $700 per year increase and
have consistently taken the most
militant stands.
The settlement reached in
cludes approximately $200 in ex
tra funds for this year for r ach
TA in six academic programs
judged "urgent cases". In addi
tion, political science TA's will
receive an additional $100 each
from department sources.
Widespr ad dissatisfac
tion among political science
graduate students and some fac

ulty resulted from faculty-ad
ministration-TA conferences this
week. One student commented,
"We've be n deceived, double
crossed, and lied to" by the ad
ministration and a faculty mem
ber added that the settlement
was "a shoddy deal."
As an example of shodiness, it
was reported that a firm settl -
ment of $400 per political science
TA was agreed upon by students
and administrators last Friday,
only to be slashed to $200 over
the weekend.
Last night's AFT meeting took
a militant tone, although th 90
members present voted with lit
tle dissent to endorse TA-admin
istration settlement and to with
hold a strike vote.
However, the union made it
clear that th • issue of TA work

loads and compensation is by no
means closed. The members
voted to continue salary nego
tiations with the administration
"where the students concerned
so desire it," to increas « pay to
all departments "where need
can be shown by the end of win
ter quarter, to consider salaries
and compensation for research
assistants and graduate stud nts
in general, and to set up a Uni
versity-wide grievance proced
ure for union members.
Members vociferously con
demned administration tactics, it
was dr-cided not to take a strik
vote "at this time."
It was felt an "unambiguous
victory" had been won since the
administration had replied di
rectly to the union, thus grant
ing de facto recognition, and had
recognized that TA's are paid
for servic s rendered since work
loads are now being taken into
consideration, rather than sim
ply part of the graduate educa
tion 4 process.
Graduate Student Association
President Barry Askinas com
mented at the meeting that his
group would take no active ne
gotiating role in salary dis
cussions.
Before the meeting, political
scientist Young explained the
actions of his group. "While we
are not completely happy with
the settlement, we have re
ceived a significant pay increase.

We regard a strike as only a last
resort," Young said.
In addition, he explained, the
political science TA's were
"pleased that a settlement was
