# Submits Resignation
## SF State President Out 
### 
fet rife-torn San Francisco State
received another jolt yesterday
with the resignation of President
Robert R. Smith. Trustees acted
quickly to name internationally
known semanticist S. I. Haya
kawa to the post.
Smith cited "inability to rec
oncile conflict" on the troubled
campus as the major factor for
his resignation.
State College trustees, who
have been meeting for two days
made the decision of Smith's suc
cessor shortly after the accep
tance of his resignation.
The resignation was the sec
ond in a year at the college,
which has a history of student
disorders. Dr. John Summerskill
quit last spring after controver
sy over his handling of demon
strations.
Cites Reasons
Smith, who said he wrote out
his resignation Tuesday after
noon said his "inability to recon

cile effectively the conflicts be
tween the trustees, and the chan
celor, the faculty groups on cam
pus, the militant student groups
and political forces of the state"
was largely responsible for his
action.
He added: "Each has brought
such strenuous pressure to bear,
sometimes concurrently, in ef
forts to control decisions facing
me as college president in se
verely difficult situations that I
believe my effectiveness has
been reduced below the point
necessary for successfully ad
ministering the college in the im
mediate future."
The last three weeks at the
school has been disrupted while
Smith tried to deal with sporadic
violence and student strike pro
tests of various kinds.
Reagan Response
Gov. Reagan, who attended the
trustees' 15-hour closed session
was asked if Smith's resignation

had been requested.
"No, I can say without any
hesitation ... it was not re
quested," Reagan replied.
However, seven trustees of the
19 present in executive sessions
pointedly supported a statement
by trustee Louis H. Heilbron of
San Francisco saying he did
what he could do to prevent
Smith's resignation.
San Jose State
Meanwhile as events were oc
curring at San Francisco State
the situation at San Jose State
continued to worsen.
Black and white militants en
gaged in hit-run assaults, set
trash fires and burst into class
rooms. Eight persons were ar
rested, including five Negroes,
and were booked on charges
ranging from batter and disturb
ing the peace to resisting arrest
and grand theft.
There were no major injuries,
