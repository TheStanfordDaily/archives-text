# Mexican-Americans Request Wider Recruitment Policies
## 
### CRAIG WILSON 
Making an obvious effort to draw a distinction
between demands and proposals the Mexican
American Student Confederation yesterday pre
sented a list of four "proposals" designed among
other things to enroll "at least 100 new Mexican
American students" during 1969-70.
The proposals were made in a meeting with
Provost Robert Lyman and included a request
for Mexican-American administrative representa
tives on the Provost's staff and in the Admis
sions and Counseling Offices.
Luis Nogales, Chairman of MASC and a third
year law student at the Stanford Law School la
belled conditions as serious and said it was "very
urgent to take steps to remedy the situation."
"Although Stanford, largely through the per
suasion of the Black Student Union, has taken
measures to increase the enrollment of all mi
nority groups, it is felt that the needs of the
Mexican-American community are not being ade
quately fulfilled," said Nogales.
Double Minority Enrollment
Last Spring following a student-faculty admis
sions study and Martin Luther King's assassina
tion, Stanford announced it would try to double
minority student enrollment to about 350 by
1969-70.'
Lyman said he was "interested in the facts"
sighted in a memorandum Nogales was dispers
ing and said the all American Universities have
been slow to meet conditions on campus."

"We are going to have to move faster," he
said. He called the report dealing with their re
quests "straightforward and comprehensible."
Efforts to secure private financial support from
foundations and corporations for this purpose so
far have proven to be "very disappointing," he
said.
Referring to the method in which the propo
sals were made Lyman said "confrontation poli
tics style is a waste of a lot of energy that could
go into constructive action. The minute you have
a threat of a possibility in case something
doesn't happen you have to consider and make
a contingency plan in case it doesn't happen."
Drop Rate Higher
In his memorandum Nogales cited the fact that
California accounts for about half of the popula
tion of Mexican-Americans in the Southwest and
said that Mexican-Americans outnumber Blacks
almost two to one in California.
In spite of this the school drop out rate is
higher than any other group and only two per
cent of the four year college enrollment in Cali
fornia is Mexican-American while the group
constitutes 12 per cent of the population,
This fall approximately 15 Mexican-American
students were admitted as freshmen in a class
of about 1400. Overall, Mexican-Americans now
comprise about one-half of one per cent of the
University's total enrollment of "11,300.

"Although Stanford, largely through the per
suasion of the Black Student Union, has taken
measures to increase the enrollment of all mi
nority groups, it is felt that the needs of the
Mexican-American community are not being ade
quately fulfilled," said Nogales.
Double Minority Enrollment
Last Spring following a student-faculty admis
sions study and Martin Luther King's assassina
tion, Stanford announced it would try to double
minority student enrollment to about 350 by
1969-70.'
Lyman said he was "interested in the facts"
sighted in a memorandum Nogales was dispers
ing and said the all American Universities have
been slow to meet conditions on campus."

"We are going to have to move faster," he
said. He called the report dealing with their re
quests "straightforward and comprehensible."
Efforts to secure private financial support from
foundations and corporations for this purpose so
far have proven to be "very disappointing," he
said.
Referring to the method in which the propo
sals were made Lyman said "confrontation poli
tics style is a waste of a lot of energy that could
go into constructive action. The minute you have
a threat of a possibility in case something
doesn't happen you have to consider and make
a contingency plan in case it doesn't happen."
Drop Rate Higher
In his memorandum Nogales cited the fact that
California accounts for about half of the popula
tion of Mexican-Americans in the Southwest and
said that Mexican-Americans outnumber Blacks
almost two to one in California.
In spite of this the school drop out rate is
higher than any other group and only two per
cent of the four year college enrollment in Cali
fornia is Mexican-American while the group
constitutes 12 per cent of the population,
This fall approximately 15 Mexican-American
students were admitted as freshmen in a class
of about 1400. Overall, Mexican-Americans now
comprise about one-half of one per cent of the
University's total enrollment of "11,300.
Making an obvious effort to draw a distinction
between demands and proposals the Mexican
American Student Confederation yesterday pre
sented a list of four "proposals" designed among
other things to enroll "at least 100 new Mexican
American students" during 1969-70.
The proposals were made in a meeting with
Provost Robert Lyman and included a request
for Mexican-American administrative representa
tives on the Provost's staff and in the Admis
sions and Counseling Offices.
Luis Nogales, Chairman of MASC and a third
year law student at the Stanford Law School la
belled conditions as serious and said it was "very
urgent to take steps to remedy the situation."
