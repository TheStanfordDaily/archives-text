# Semesters, Frosh Tutorials Urged In SES Report
## 
### MARSHALL E. SCHWARTZ 
Major revisions in undergrad
uate education hav< been recom
mended by the Steering Commit
tee of the Study of Education at
Stanford (SES) in the first two
of ten official reports, released
today.
A massive shift of teaching
resources to a fr shman tutorial
program, modification of the
grading system, easing course
requirements, institution of a
semester system, and establish
ment of a post of Dean of Under
graduate Studies are among th .•
suggested changes.
(The full text of both reports,
"The Study and Its Purposes"
and "Undergraduate Education,"
are published as a supplement to
today's Daily, and can be found
inside. Future r ports may be
printed as they are released.)
The Committee blasted the
present General Studies Pro
gram for "rigitity, superficiality,

sel ctivity, and unreality, and
said that the idea of a general
education, as typified by pro
grams at Harvard, Chicago and
Columbia, is "dead or dying."
Freshman Tutorials
Drawing upon the successful
freshman seminar program, the
reports suggested the establish
ment of fr shman tutorials,
taught by regular faculty mem
bers, with not more than 12 stu
dents in each program.
The Committee urged imple
mentation of the tutorials, which
they hope will eventually replace
W> stern Civilization and Fresh
man English programs, as soon
as possible for all freshmen will
ing to participate.
Other recommendations in
clude:
• No school or department
may prescribe more than half
of an undergraduate major's
total program;
• Any student, at any time,

may propose his own interde
partm ntal major with the ap
proval of a member of the Aca
demic Council, which must bo
approved by the Dean of Under
graduate Studies;
• A limited number of stu
dents should be able to design
their entire und rgraduate pro
gram, as part of a new Uni
versity Honors Program;
General Education
• A two-year general educa
tion college, on the lines of the
Hutchins experiment at Chicago,
and Prof. Joseph Tussman's pro
gram at B rkeley, should be
established here;
• The academic calendar
should be altered, changing from
a quarter to a semester system,
with a two-week reading period
included it th • end of each sem
ester;
• The unit-credit system
should be replaced by the
"course" system, with four
courses being a normal semester
load, three a minimum, and five
a maximum (on? less if the
quarter system is retained); and
• Grade point averages
should be given, with a student
merely not receiving credit for
a course he would have failed. A
student should be allowed to
take as many pass-fail courses
as he chooses, if the instructor
approves.
The Academic Senate will be
gin discussing the proposals next
quarter.
Report Next Week
Then xt report to be issued,
"University Residences and
Campus Life," should be out
next week.
This final version of the under
graduate education report differs
very little from an earlier re
port, which received limited cir
cu^tjrvn.
Hiere have been "a number
of niiiiui changes," according

to Robert Hind, staff director of
SES and associate dean of under
graduate education.
Tutorial Not Feasible
One alteration was the addi
tion of a paragraph strongly ad
vising undergraduates to take a
language, even though the Com
mittee recommended that the
language requirement as such be
dropped.
Another change was brought
about by the realization that it
would not be feasible to institute
the freshman tutorial program
for all incoming students in the
first year.
Therefore, the recommenda
tion was changed to ask the
adoption of the plan as quickly
as possible. Hind also noted that
the program will only be made
available to the freshmen, not
forced on them.
This idea comes from the re
cent difficulties with senior col
loquia, where student interest
and available topics often do not
coincide.

The section on the engineering
program was also rewritten sub
stantially, because the Commit
tee had previously been missing
information on accreditation.
The new suggestion allows both
for a broader, unspecialized en
gineering major as well as a
highly developed, in-depth pro
gram.
Heated Criticism
So far, only two of the sugges
tions in the report have come
under heated criticism. These are
the proposals for a Dean of Un
dergraduate Studies and the se
mester system.
Many faculty members of the
School of Humanities and Sci
ences have already expressed dis
pleasure with the former pro
posal.
But Hind said very few disa
gree with the idea of having one
office coordinating all the re
lated programs. The "major con
cern is with structure," whether
the post would be equal to or un
der that of the Humanities and
Sciences dean.
Predicting the outcome of the
semester-quarter fight is diffi
cult, Hind noted, because the
"faculty is pretty much split."
But he expressed optimism for
the Committee's plan, because
the semester system "has never
before been argued for from the
point of a reading period," which
he considers "the crucial, focal
thing" in the suggestion.
None of the eight other SES
reports will be issued before the
beginning of winter quarter.
