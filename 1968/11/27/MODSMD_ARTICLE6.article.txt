# Semesters, Frosh Tutorials Urged In SES Report
## 
### MARSHALL E. SCHWARTZ 
Major revisions in undergrad
uate education hav< been recom
mended by the Steering Commit
tee of the Study of Education at
Stanford (SES) in the first two
of ten official reports, released
today.
A massive shift of teaching
resources to a fr shman tutorial
program, modification of the
grading system, easing course
requirements, institution of a
semester system, and establish
ment of a post of Dean of Under
graduate Studies are among th .•
suggested changes.
(The full text of both reports,
"The Study and Its Purposes"
and "Undergraduate Education,"
are published as a supplement to
today's Daily, and can be found
inside. Future r ports may be
printed as they are released.)
The Committee blasted the
present General Studies Pro
gram for "rigitity, superficiality,

sel ctivity, and unreality, and
said that the idea of a general
education, as typified by pro
grams at Harvard, Chicago and
Columbia, is "dead or dying."
Freshman Tutorials
Drawing upon the successful
freshman seminar program, the
reports suggested the establish
ment of fr shman tutorials,
taught by regular faculty mem
bers, with not more than 12 stu
dents in each program.
The Committee urged imple
mentation of the tutorials, which
they hope will eventually replace
W> stern Civilization and Fresh
man English programs, as soon
as possible for all freshmen will
ing to participate.
Other recommendations in
clude:
• No school or department
may prescribe more than half
of an undergraduate major's
total program;
• Any student, at any time,

may propose his own interde
partm ntal major with the ap
proval of a member of the Aca
demic Council, which must bo
approved by the Dean of Under
graduate Studies;
• A limited number of stu
dents should be able to design
their entire und rgraduate pro
gram, as part of a new Uni
versity Honors Program;
General Education
• A two-year general educa
tion college, on the lines of the
Hutchins experiment at Chicago,
and Prof. Joseph Tussman's pro
gram at B rkeley, should be
established here;
• The academic calendar
should be altered, changing from
a quarter to a semester system,
with a two-week reading period
included it th • end of each sem
ester;
• The unit-credit system
should be replaced by the
