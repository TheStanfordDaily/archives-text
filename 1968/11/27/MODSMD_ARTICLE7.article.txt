# Carlsmith-Landauer Duo Ends
## Psych I Prof To Leave 
### SUSAN SWARD 
The Carlsmith-Landauer duo,
which has stimulated, educated
and amused students for five
consecutive years, will cease
with the last lecture of Psychol
ogy 1 this quarter.
After five years as an assist
ant professor in psychology at
Stanford, Tom Landaucr is leav
ing at the end of the quarter for
Bell Telephone Laboratories at
Murray Hill, New Jersey. There
he will be occupied with re
search in the field of learning
and memory.
The 36-year-old Landaucr is to
many, the classic example of a
teacher who has loved his pro
fession and his students.
Touching his grey and white
beard, Landaucr mused, "If I
discover I can't live without
teaching, I'll go back to it. I
imagine I'll find it harder to live
without students than I will find
it to live without teaching."
Psych I Favorite
Psychology 1 has been Lan
dauer's favorite teaching experi
ence at Stanford.
"Starting courses ought to be
very exciting and fascinating,
and yet introductory courses are
generally despised by the people
who take them and teach them,"
Landaucr said in an interview
with The Daily. "The role of the
undergraduate teacher is to
prove to the student that the
material is in fact interesting."
Humor Necessary
"I have a tendency not to re
press my temptations to be fun
ny," Landaucr noted. "I think
the whole world is to bo laughed
at whenever possible, but I also

believe very strongly in what I
say in lecture. Life is too short
to live without humor."
"My self-control is a little less
good than it should be, but if it
helps keep the students awake,
it's worth it. Sleeping students
don't learn anything."
Speaking about undergradu
ates at Stanford, Landaucr com
plemented them. "They seem to
know what life is about," he
said, "and at the same time
they're serious, ambitious stu
dents. By and large, they are
not ready to spend this four
years preparing for the next
four years." In this respect,
Stanford undergraduates come
off more favorably than students
at Harvard or Dartmouth where
he has also taught.
Three Functions
There are three functions a
teacher may serve, according to
Landaucr.
"He can tell people what to
read because the teacher is paid
to read everything. He can try to
show students why things are
interesting and exciting, and he
can show people what is wrong
with their work. The critical
function is, believe it or not,
very closely related to grading."
Leaving Teaching
Now as he looks toward his
new job at Bell Laboratories,
Landaucr says that he will en
joy pure research. Accepting a
pure research position â€” which
is a hard thing to find, accord
ing to Landaucr he will be
leaving behind the frustration
which comes from dividing the
teacher's time between teaching
and research.

"I feel very fortunate in be
ing offered a pure research po
sition," Landaucr noted. "I will
miss undergraduates, though,
because I like them. I've never
wanted to grow up myself, and
it gives me the illusion that I'm
still an undergraduate when I
spend a lot of time among
them."
Landauer's partner in the pre
sentation of Psychology 1 over
the past five years has been J.
Merrill Carlsmith. Carlsmith
had nothing but words of praise
for his colleague.

When questioned about Lan
dauer's departure from Stan
ford, CarLsmith sat thoughtfully
behind his desk for a few mo
ments. Then he said,
"I think Landauer is the best
teacher I have ever seen. I think
it's really sad that a lot of stu
dents are going to miss taking
his courses."
Carlsmith went on to admit,
"I've never missed a lecture of
his in psychology 1 during the
five times we've taught it. I
don't think I'm going to teach
Psychology 1 without him."
