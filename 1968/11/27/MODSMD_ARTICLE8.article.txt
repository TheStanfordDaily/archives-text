(Editor's Note: We regret
Sports Editor Gary Cavalli's
recent imputations that the
members of the Editorial Board
are anti-athletic in their outlook
and that they indulge in the use
of illegal drugs. We do not see
how that touches on the ques
tion at hand. But we hope Mr.
Cavalli will have the goodness
to establish enough "connection"
with the Board, which he
severed in yesterday's DAILY,
to accept his salary check. If not,
we propose to forward it to the
Athletic Department to show
our continuing interest and con
cern in Stanford's sports pro
gram.)
