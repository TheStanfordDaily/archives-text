What if they gave a revolution and nobody came?
The revolution was predicted for Stanford this quarter, but it
hasn't materialized yet and we doubt it soon will. The Students
tor a Democratic Society may have been trying to give a revolu
tion, but Stanford Research Institute (SRI) is in Menlo Park
and Lytton Plaza is in Palo Alto.
And besides Acting President Robert Glaser had placed himself
in what looked tolerably like the vanguard of the revolution to
many observers. And his SRI study was quite satisfactory for many
students who might have been inflamed by a more heavy-handed
administration.
Earlier there were noises about having the Reserve Officer's
Training Corps be the Winter Palace for the local coup. But the
Academic Senate debated and had another committee, and pro
gress seemed to be slightly made. And that was all that was needed
to make the Winter Palace melt into red tile, without any fires
at all.
Some said President-designate Kenneth Pitzer's coming was to
be the Rubicon of revolt. It might be yet, but the word from
Rome is that influential leaders of many political shades are going
to accept him for the time being, at least, in spite of a rumor among
the poets and plebians that he doesn't speak Latin.
And the revolutionary cadres seem to be studying more now;
all students do. And the depression over Mr. Humphrey's defeat
and elation over Mr. Nixon's victory meld into a vast apathy that
results in reading more.
The quarter's score? The Administration: 16 (two long passes,
two conversions, and a safety by default since no one else was
playing); The Revolution: â€”7 (Revolutionaries left the field to
read Milton); The Faculty: 7 (By default; they started their Senate
and nobody else started a Senate this quarter); The Student

Masses: 2 (They read slightly more, thereby increasing their col
lective grade-point averages by an estimated .004 points and sub
sequently their lifetime earnings by $5000 apiece.)
there will be a rematch next quarter. The Crimson Tide (the
Scarlet Wave?) is getting a new coach, and the players are con
fident of calm. The Revolutionists may be back in there plugging,
this time with a public address system.
An important booster for the Tide is the reforms of the Study of
Education at Stanford, likely to evoke some debate and perhaps
some reform. This will no doubt free the students to do more
reading.
Don't misunderstand. We are a bit disappointed with the season,
since it is true that there have as yet been no real results. But the
Tide's studies may be wreaking some results next quarter, and
they, along with Coach Pitzer and SES should make an interesting
series.
