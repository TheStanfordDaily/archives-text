# SES Report Proposes 'Campus-Town' Plan
## 
### 
A campus-town concept including
a University "Main Street," apartment
units for younger faculty and graduate
students, and increased coeducational
residences are among 20 recommenda
tions in the third Study of Education
at Stanford (SES) report.
In a discussion of future building,
the report proposes that an Architec
tural Review Council, composed of ex
perts of "national stature," should be
appointed for planning all major
University building projects.

Fraternities, according to the rec
ommendations, should take immediate
action toward "complete elimination
of discriminatory clauses in their local
or national charters" and adopt a
mutual preference system for recruit
ing new members.
The document, "University Resi
dences and Campus Life," is one of 10
reports to be submitted by the SES
Steering Committee to the Academic
Council for consideration.

Formal deliberation of SFS rec
ommendations by the Senate will not
begin until late winter quarter to pro
vide the campus community with the
opportunity to submit comments,
reactions, and suggested modifications.
Panel Discussions Planned
A number of forums and panel
discussions arc planned for January,
according to Steering Committee
Chairman Herbert Packer. He added
that comments may also be sent to his
office.
The latest report emphasizes the
importance of campus living and en
vironment, stating, "the University can
never educate in the true sense of the
word, but it can supply the environ
ment and the means necessary to in
sure that those who have come here
may cducate each other and them
selves."
The report states that its "first
and primary" recommendation is stu
dent freedom of residential choice to
best accommodate his interests, tal
ents, and "enhance his intellectual,
spiritual, and humane development:
that is to say, his education."
One of the main recommenda
tions calls for a campus "Main Street."
It would consist of shops and other
facilities between Dinkclspicl Auditor
ium and Campus Drive, paralleling
La sue n Street and opposite the
planned Music Building.
The committee says Main Street
might contain a cooperative, general
merchandise store; a coffee house; a
second-hand bookstore; an art print
shop; and a pizzeria or similar eating
establishment.
Endowment Building Source
"All of the buildings should be
built as a University endowment invesi
mcnt," the report says,"and designed
to be as aesthetically pleasing and in
viting as their function intends."
Listed as a matter of "highest
priority" is the construction of new
coeducational residences for about 500
undergraduates. It is recommended
that the design should provide privacy
of single rooms combined with lounge
and kitchenette facilities.
At least 50 apartment units
should be constructed adjacent to the
new undergraduate residences. These
would be available for younger faculty
members and graduate students, in that
order of priority.
A supporting statement declares
that such units would "offer younger
faculty members and graduate students
a greater opportunity to live on cam
pus and to become more closely in
volved in campus life."
In addition, the proximity "might
encourage some degree of communica
tion between faculty and student resi
dents without artificiality or compul
sion on either side."
Fraternities Attacked
The report takes aim at campus
fraternities, blasting them for retaining
vestiges of racial and religious discrim
ination in charters and practices; for
promoting, in many instances, an
"anti-intellectual atmosphere quite out
of keeping in a university"; and for
maintaining "a selection mechanism
that is out of character with an open
university."
Fraternities should be required to
disaffiliate from any national organiza
tion that refuses to eliminate discrim
inatory clauses in their charters, the
report states. It added that any frater
nity which retains a policy of cither dc
facto or dc jure discrimination should
be required to leave the campus.
Also, the committee asked for the
trial of a mutual preference system for
recruiting of new fraternity members.
The mutual preference plan revolves
around a preference draw for both fra
ternities and prospective members,
thus assuring equal access to frater
nities for all interested students.
Commenting on Stanford's build
ing program, the committee says that

the original quadrangle is "as pleasing
today as at the time of the Quad's
construction. Its individual buildings
are gradually being reconstructed, but
at very substantial cost."
Quad Justified
The report adds that this recon
struction is essential and the cost of
preserving the Quad is justified, "but it
does call attention to two existing
problems.
"First, there is the superficial
design identification with elements of
the Quad's 'Richardson Romanesque'
in new construction . . . The second
is the tendency to reproduce the aura
of durability presented by the Quad, to
wrap the University in concrete and
steel, which does not yield easily to
changing needs.
The committee suggests that the
University's buildings should be flex
ible to allow "easy and economical re
modeling and alteration to meet our
changing needs."
The Steering Committee praised
the campus-town concept put forth by
the Residence Committee, and added
that further study of the question is
needed.
The Residence Committee callcd
for the creation of several clusters of
residences for about 1,500 people
each, with housing for undergraduates,
graduates, and young faculty members.
These communities would include
recreational centers, grocery stores, art
project rooms, libraries, and seminar
rooms.
Build Community
"Facilities of these various kinds
should be placed at different points
throughout the towns to bring people
together from all over the community
into new relationships based on
common interests," the Residence
Committee recommended. The final re
port asked that such facilities be incor
porated soon into Escondido Village.
Prof. Lewis Spitz of history was
chairman of the Committee on Resi
dence Programs and Policies and Art
Prof. Matthew Kahn headed the Com
mittee on Campus Environment. Both
committees, which submitted their re

ports to the Steering Committee last
June, include students, faculty, and
staff.
The Steering Committee also
made the following recommendations
in its report:
"Because the purposes of educa
tion for both American and foreign
students will best be served by the
creation of a truly cosmopolitan, intel
lectual community at Stanford, suf
ficient space should be provided in all
Stanford student housing to accom
modate foreign students who wish to
live on campus. The allotment of
housing space should be accomplished
without reference to distinctions
between American and foreign stu
dents. This principle should inform
housing policies on both the graduate
and the undergraduate level."

chairman of the Committee on Resi
dence Programs and Policies and Art
Prof. Matthew Kahn headed the Com
mittee on Campus Environment. Both
committees, which submitted their re

ports to the Steering Committee last
June, include students, faculty, and
staff.
The Steering Committee also
made the following recommendations
in its report:
"Because the purposes of educa
tion for both American and foreign
students will best be served by the
creation of a truly cosmopolitan, intel
lectual community at Stanford, suf
ficient space should be provided in all
Stanford student housing to accom
modate foreign students who wish to
live on campus. The allotment of
housing space should be accomplished
without reference to distinctions
between American and foreign stu
dents. This principle should inform
housing policies on both the graduate
and the undergraduate level."
A campus-town concept including
a University "Main Street," apartment
units for younger faculty and graduate
students, and increased coeducational
residences are among 20 recommenda
tions in the third Study of Education
at Stanford (SES) report.
In a discussion of future building,
the report proposes that an Architec
tural Review Council, composed of ex
perts of "national stature," should be
appointed for planning all major
University building projects.

Fraternities, according to the rec
ommendations, should take immediate
action toward "complete elimination
of discriminatory clauses in their local
or national charters" and adopt a
mutual preference system for recruit
ing new members.
The document, "University Resi
dences and Campus Life," is one of 10
reports to be submitted by the SES
Steering Committee to the Academic
Council for consideration.

Formal deliberation of SFS rec
ommendations by the Senate will not
begin until late winter quarter to pro
vide the campus community with the
opportunity to submit comments,
reactions, and suggested modifications.
Panel Discussions Planned
A number of forums and panel
discussions arc planned for January,
according to Steering Committee
Chairman Herbert Packer. He added
that comments may also be sent to his
office.
The latest report emphasizes the
importance of campus living and en
vironment, stating, "the University can
never educate in the true sense of the
word, but it can supply the environ
ment and the means necessary to in
sure that those who have come here
may cducate each other and them
selves."
The report states that its "first
and primary" recommendation is stu
dent freedom of residential choice to
best accommodate his interests, tal
ents, and "enhance his intellectual,
spiritual, and humane development:
that is to say, his education."
One of the main recommenda
tions calls for a campus "Main Street."
It would consist of shops and other
facilities between Dinkclspicl Auditor
ium and Campus Drive, paralleling
La sue n Street and opposite the
planned Music Building.
The committee says Main Street
might contain a cooperative, general
merchandise store; a coffee house; a
second-hand bookstore; an art print
shop; and a pizzeria or similar eating
establishment.
Endowment Building Source
"All of the buildings should be
built as a University endowment invesi
mcnt," the report says,"and designed
to be as aesthetically pleasing and in
viting as their function intends."
Listed as a matter of "highest
priority" is the construction of new
coeducational residences for about 500
undergraduates. It is recommended
that the design should provide privacy
of single rooms combined with lounge
and kitchenette facilities.
At least 50 apartment units
should be constructed adjacent to the
new undergraduate residences. These
would be available for younger faculty
members and graduate students, in that
order of priority.
A supporting statement declares
that such units would "offer younger
faculty members and graduate students
a greater opportunity to live on cam
pus and to become more closely in
volved in campus life."
In addition, the proximity "might
encourage some degree of communica
tion between faculty and student resi
dents without artificiality or compul
sion on either side."
Fraternities Attacked
The report takes aim at campus
fraternities, blasting them for retaining
vestiges of racial and religious discrim
ination in charters and practices; for
promoting, in many instances, an
"anti-intellectual atmosphere quite out
of keeping in a university"; and for
maintaining "a selection mechanism
that is out of character with an open
university."
Fraternities should be required to
disaffiliate from any national organiza
tion that refuses to eliminate discrim
inatory clauses in their charters, the
report states. It added that any frater
nity which retains a policy of cither dc
facto or dc jure discrimination should
be required to leave the campus.
Also, the committee asked for the
trial of a mutual preference system for
recruiting of new fraternity members.
The mutual preference plan revolves
around a preference draw for both fra
ternities and prospective members,
thus assuring equal access to frater
nities for all interested students.
Commenting on Stanford's build
ing program, the committee says that

the original quadrangle is "as pleasing
today as at the time of the Quad's
construction. Its individual buildings
are gradually being reconstructed, but
at very substantial cost."
Quad Justified
The report adds that this recon
struction is essential and the cost of
preserving the Quad is justified, "but it
does call attention to two existing
problems.
"First, there is the superficial
design identification with elements of
the Quad's 'Richardson Romanesque'
in new construction . . . The second
is the tendency to reproduce the aura
of durability presented by the Quad, to
wrap the University in concrete and
steel, which does not yield easily to
changing needs.
The committee suggests that the
University's buildings should be flex
ible to allow "easy and economical re
modeling and alteration to meet our
changing needs."
The Steering Committee praised
the campus-town concept put forth by
the Residence Committee, and added
that further study of the question is
needed.
The Residence Committee callcd
for the creation of several clusters of
residences for about 1,500 people
each, with housing for undergraduates,
graduates, and young faculty members.
These communities would include
recreational centers, grocery stores, art
project rooms, libraries, and seminar
rooms.
Build Community
"Facilities of these various kinds
should be placed at different points
throughout the towns to bring people
together from all over the community
into new relationships based on
common interests," the Residence
Committee recommended. The final re
port asked that such facilities be incor
porated soon into Escondido Village.

changing needs."
The Steering Committee praised
the campus-town concept put forth by
the Residence Committee, and added
that further study of the question is
needed.
The Residence Committee callcd
for the creation of several clusters of
residences for about 1,500 people
each, with housing for undergraduates,
graduates, and young faculty members.
These communities would include
recreational centers, grocery stores, art
project rooms, libraries, and seminar
rooms.
Build Community
"Facilities of these various kinds
should be placed at different points
throughout the towns to bring people
together from all over the community
into new relationships based on
common interests," the Residence
Committee recommended. The final re
port asked that such facilities be incor
porated soon into Escondido Village.
Prof. Lewis Spitz of history was
chairman of the Committee on Resi
dence Programs and Policies and Art
Prof. Matthew Kahn headed the Com
mittee on Campus Environment. Both
committees, which submitted their re

ports to the Steering Committee last
June, include students, faculty, and
staff.
The Steering Committee also
made the following recommendations
in its report:
"Because the purposes of educa
tion for both American and foreign
students will best be served by the
creation of a truly cosmopolitan, intel
lectual community at Stanford, suf
ficient space should be provided in all
Stanford student housing to accom
modate foreign students who wish to
live on campus. The allotment of
housing space should be accomplished
without reference to distinctions
between American and foreign stu
dents. This principle should inform
housing policies on both the graduate
and the undergraduate level."
A campus-town concept including
a University "Main Street," apartment
units for younger faculty and graduate
students, and increased coeducational
residences are among 20 recommenda
tions in the third Study of Education
at Stanford (SES) report.
In a discussion of future building,
the report proposes that an Architec
tural Review Council, composed of ex
perts of "national stature," should be
appointed for planning all major
University building projects.

Fraternities, according to the rec
ommendations, should take immediate
action toward "complete elimination
of discriminatory clauses in their local
or national charters" and adopt a
mutual preference system for recruit
ing new members.
The document, "University Resi
dences and Campus Life," is one of 10
reports to be submitted by the SES
Steering Committee to the Academic
Council for consideration.

Formal deliberation of SFS rec
ommendations by the Senate will not
begin until late winter quarter to pro
vide the campus community with the
opportunity to submit comments,
reactions, and suggested modifications.
Panel Discussions Planned
A number of forums and panel
discussions arc planned for January,
according to Steering Committee
Chairman Herbert Packer. He added
that comments may also be sent to his
office.
The latest report emphasizes the
importance of campus living and en
vironment, stating, "the University can
never educate in the true sense of the
word, but it can supply the environ
ment and the means necessary to in
sure that those who have come here
may cducate each other and them
selves."
The report states that its "first
and primary" recommendation is stu
dent freedom of residential choice to
best accommodate his interests, tal
ents, and "enhance his intellectual,
spiritual, and humane development:
that is to say, his education."
One of the main recommenda
tions calls for a campus "Main Street."
It would consist of shops and other
facilities between Dinkclspicl Auditor
ium and Campus Drive, paralleling
La sue n Street and opposite the
planned Music Building.
The committee says Main Street
might contain a cooperative, general
merchandise store; a coffee house; a
second-hand bookstore; an art print
shop; and a pizzeria or similar eating
establishment.
Endowment Building Source
"All of the buildings should be
built as a University endowment invesi
mcnt," the report says,"and designed
to be as aesthetically pleasing and in
viting as their function intends."
Listed as a matter of "highest
priority" is the construction of new
coeducational residences for about 500
undergraduates. It is recommended
that the design should provide privacy
of single rooms combined with lounge
and kitchenette facilities.
At least 50 apartment units
should be constructed adjacent to the
new undergraduate residences. These
would be available for younger faculty
members and graduate students, in that
order of priority.
A supporting statement declares
that such units would "offer younger
faculty members and graduate students
a greater opportunity to live on cam
pus and to become more closely in
volved in campus life."
In addition, the proximity "might
encourage some degree of communica
tion between faculty and student resi
dents without artificiality or compul
sion on either side."
Fraternities Attacked
The report takes aim at campus
fraternities, blasting them for retaining
vestiges of racial and religious discrim
ination in charters and practices; for
promoting, in many instances, an
"anti-intellectual atmosphere quite out
of keeping in a university"; and for
maintaining "a selection mechanism
that is out of character with an open
university."
Fraternities should be required to
disaffiliate from any national organiza
tion that refuses to eliminate discrim
inatory clauses in their charters, the
report states. It added that any frater
nity which retains a policy of cither dc
facto or dc jure discrimination should
be required to leave the campus.
Also, the committee asked for the
trial of a mutual preference system for
recruiting of new fraternity members.
The mutual preference plan revolves
around a preference draw for both fra
ternities and prospective members,
thus assuring equal access to frater
nities for all interested students.
Commenting on Stanford's build
ing program, the committee says that

the original quadrangle is "as pleasing
today as at the time of the Quad's
construction. Its individual buildings
are gradually being reconstructed, but
at very substantial cost."
Quad Justified
The report adds that this recon
struction is essential and the cost of
preserving the Quad is justified, "but it
does call attention to two existing
problems.
"First, there is the superficial
design identification with elements of
the Quad's 'Richardson Romanesque'
in new construction . . . The second
is the tendency to reproduce the aura
of durability presented by the Quad, to
wrap the University in concrete and
steel, which does not yield easily to
changing needs.
The committee suggests that the
University's buildings should be flex
ible to allow "easy and economical re
modeling and alteration to meet our
changing needs."

the original quadrangle is "as pleasing
today as at the time of the Quad's
construction. Its individual buildings
are gradually being reconstructed, but
at very substantial cost."
Quad Justified
The report adds that this recon
struction is essential and the cost of
preserving the Quad is justified, "but it
does call attention to two existing
problems.
"First, there is the superficial
design identification with elements of
the Quad's 'Richardson Romanesque'
in new construction . . . The second
is the tendency to reproduce the aura
of durability presented by the Quad, to
wrap the University in concrete and
steel, which does not yield easily to
changing needs.
The committee suggests that the
University's buildings should be flex
ible to allow "easy and economical re
modeling and alteration to meet our
changing needs."
The Steering Committee praised
the campus-town concept put forth by
the Residence Committee, and added
that further study of the question is
needed.
The Residence Committee callcd
for the creation of several clusters of
residences for about 1,500 people
each, with housing for undergraduates,
graduates, and young faculty members.
These communities would include
recreational centers, grocery stores, art
project rooms, libraries, and seminar
rooms.
Build Community
"Facilities of these various kinds
should be placed at different points
throughout the towns to bring people
together from all over the community
into new relationships based on
common interests," the Residence
Committee recommended. The final re
port asked that such facilities be incor
porated soon into Escondido Village.
Prof. Lewis Spitz of history was
chairman of the Committee on Resi
dence Programs and Policies and Art
Prof. Matthew Kahn headed the Com
mittee on Campus Environment. Both
committees, which submitted their re

ports to the Steering Committee last
June, include students, faculty, and
staff.
The Steering Committee also
made the following recommendations
in its report:
"Because the purposes of educa
tion for both American and foreign
students will best be served by the
creation of a truly cosmopolitan, intel
lectual community at Stanford, suf
ficient space should be provided in all
Stanford student housing to accom
modate foreign students who wish to
live on campus. The allotment of
housing space should be accomplished
without reference to distinctions
between American and foreign stu
dents. This principle should inform
housing policies on both the graduate
and the undergraduate level."
