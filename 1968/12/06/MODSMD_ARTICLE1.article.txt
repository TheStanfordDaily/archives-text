# SES Report Proposes 'Campus-Town' Plan
## 
### 
A campus-town concept including
a University "Main Street," apartment
units for younger faculty and graduate
students, and increased coeducational
residences are among 20 recommenda
tions in the third Study of Education
at Stanford (SES) report.
In a discussion of future building,
the report proposes that an Architec
tural Review Council, composed of ex
perts of "national stature," should be
appointed for planning all major
University building projects.

Fraternities, according to the rec
ommendations, should take immediate
action toward "complete elimination
of discriminatory clauses in their local
or national charters" and adopt a
mutual preference system for recruit
ing new members.
The document, "University Resi
dences and Campus Life," is one of 10
reports to be submitted by the SES
Steering Committee to the Academic
Council for consideration.

Formal deliberation of SFS rec
ommendations by the Senate will not
begin until late winter quarter to pro
vide the campus community with the
opportunity to submit comments,
reactions, and suggested modifications.
Panel Discussions Planned
A number of forums and panel
discussions arc planned for January,
according to Steering Committee
Chairman Herbert Packer. He added
that comments may also be sent to his
office.
The latest report emphasizes the
importance of campus living and en
vironment, stating, "the University can
never educate in the true sense of the
word, but it can supply the environ
ment and the means necessary to in
sure that those who have come here
may cducate each other and them
selves."
The report states that its "first
and primary" recommendation is stu
dent freedom of residential choice to
best accommodate his interests, tal
ents, and "enhance his intellectual,
spiritual, and humane development:
that is to say, his education."
One of the main recommenda
tions calls for a campus "Main Street."
It would consist of shops and other
facilities between Dinkclspicl Auditor
ium and Campus Drive, paralleling
La sue n Street and opposite the
planned Music Building.
The committee says Main Street
might contain a cooperative, general
merchandise store; a coffee house; a
second-hand bookstore; an art print
shop; and a pizzeria or similar eating
establishment.
Endowment Building Source
"All of the buildings should be
built as a University endowment invesi
