# Summer Festival To Go On; Foundation Aids Funding
## 
### 
A $50,000 grant from the San
Francisco Foundation has assured the
1969 season of Stanford Summer
Festival of the Arts, and provided a
strong base of support for future sea
sons as well.
The grant, payable over the next
five years, will aid in underwriting the
yearly costs of the internationally fa
mous artistic program.
While additional funds must still
be sought to guarantee and support the
festival beyond the present summer,
the 112 oundation's Distribution Com
mittee noted, "We hope in making the
grant in this way that others will
become interested in helping with the
annual deficit."

Two other major anonymous gifts
have already been pledged for 1969.
It is the second time in three
years that the San Francisco Founda
tion, a community trust for the Bay
Area, has paved the way for the
Festivals' continuance. A $25,000 gift
late in 1966 provided the beginning
support for the 1967 Festival. Funds
remaining from that gift were used in
the 1968 season as well.
According to Festival Director
Virgil Whitakcr, "Our delight with the
additional support from the San
Francisco Foundation is practically
boundless. We arc indebted to the
directors for their continued and favor
able expressions of faith in our achieve
ments. Their past support has been a
catalyst for other generous donors who
have combined to assure our existence.
Naturally, we hope it will continue to
be so."

Adding to Whitaker's comments,
festival Producer Stephen Baffrcy said,
"We require a minimum underwriting
fund of $50,000 to support each sea
son of quality presentations similar to
those of our past five years. The first
payment of the new San Francisco
112 oundation gift ($15,000) combines
with existing pledges to give us what
we must have to complete plans for
1969.
"In addition, it is critical that we
identify support for future seasons as
well; otherwise we will be severely
handicapped in making the long-range
plans that a program of our inter
national scope requires."
Festival and University officials
are presently attempting to solicit the
additional support for the program.
Whitakcr has been the director
and Baffrcy the producer since the in
ception of the program in 1964.
