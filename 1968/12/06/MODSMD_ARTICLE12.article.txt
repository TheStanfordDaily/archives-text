# Provost Cites Increase In Minority Enrollment
## 
### 
Enrollment of A fro-American and
Mexican-American students at
Stanford has risen from an estimated
175 last year to 291 this year, Provost
Richard Lyman said yesterday.
In a review circulated to all
faculty members on University actions
since the Black Student Union agree
ment last April, Lyman said this year's
freshman class included 75 black
students and about 15 Mexican-
Americans. In addition, 17 students
from these two groups were admitted
as transfers.
"Plans are being made with neigh
boring junior colleges for a systematic
program of transfer to Stanford for
students recruited by the junior col
leges and jointly identified as having
the ability to continue their work at
Stanford," he added. The colleges arc
Foothill and San Mateo.
His report indicated Stanford has
neared the half-way mark in meeting
its commitment to try to double minor
ority group enrollment to about 350
by 1969-70.
Achieving this objective will
require a net increase of about 75 minor
ity undergraduates next fall, with an
increase in student aid funds amount
ing to about $168,000, he said.
'Major Effort'
"Sustaining this level of expend
iture, and I hope even increasing it in
years ahead, will require a major
university effort," he said. At present,
minority students receive $281,905 in
financial aid from the University's
funds, plus $37,200 in federal econo
mic opportunity grants, and $82,700
in nonfederal outside awards. These
figures do not include loans or work
study jobs.
"Federal student aid programs
have been affected by the general
reduction in funds for domestic social
purposes. The outlook for 1969-70 is
not yet clear other than that an in
crease in aid funds to Stanford seems
unlikely.
"Extensive efforts to raise money
from private sources have been only
moderately successful, but it is too
early yet to judge their ultimate suc
cess. These efforts will be continued."
Since mid-May, he reported, more
than half of all job placements made
through the University Personnel Of
fice have been individuals from minor
ity groups. In this period, a total of
123 minority employees were added to
the University staff.
But "very few" of the 70 jobs not
filled through the Personnel Office went
to individuals from minority groups.
"It is essential that vacancies be
reported to the Personnel Office in a
timely manner and we are exploring
ways to insure that this is done,"
Lyman said.
Minority Profs
Two assistant professors from
minority groups have been appointed
to the faculty in education and history,
he reported, but of all the pledges
made last spring, "this is perhaps the
most difficult to fulfill in a short
period."
Both black and Mexican-
American students have been working
with a task-force headed by Prof.
Robert Hess, education, to arrange a
tutorial program and other nccessary
educational supplements for 11 min
ority students admitted on a special
basis this fall. The groups includes
eight blacks and three Mexican-
Americans.
Summarizing activities not

covered by the April agreement,
Lyman said:
*Meyer Library has established an
A fro-American section with about
1,000 volumes, including several hun
dred new acquisitions, "as a resource

for the entire community on these neg
lected subjects."
*A new undergraduate major in
African and Afro-American Studies has
been organized for up to 15 sopho
mores and juniors, starting in January.
In addition, there have been sev
eral developments at the graduate and
professional school level, he said:
*Thc School of Law has started a
new program in which minority stu
dents may take four years, rather than
the usual three, to earn the LL.B.
Three students are currently enrolled.
*The Graduate School of Business
has announced a new program for
minority students, combining work ex
perience with study toward the MBA
degree.
*The School of Engineering plans
to use its Honors Cooperative Program
to recruit college juniors who would
work for a participating firm and study
toward a master's degree.
*The School of Medicine will hold
10 places in its entering class next
fall for qualified minority students.

not yet clear other than that an in

unlikely.
"Extensive efforts to raise money
from private sources have been only
moderately successful, but it is too
early yet to judge their ultimate suc
cess. These efforts will be continued."
Since mid-May, he reported, more
than half of all job placements made
through the University Personnel Of
fice have been individuals from minor
ity groups. In this period, a total of
123 minority employees were added to
the University staff.
But "very few" of the 70 jobs not
filled through the Personnel Office went
to individuals from minority groups.
"It is essential that vacancies be
reported to the Personnel Office in a
timely manner and we are exploring
ways to insure that this is done,"
Lyman said.
Minority Profs
Two assistant professors from
minority groups have been appointed
to the faculty in education and history,
he reported, but of all the pledges
made last spring, "this is perhaps the
most difficult to fulfill in a short
period."
Both black and Mexican-
American students have been working
with a task-force headed by Prof.
Robert Hess, education, to arrange a
tutorial program and other nccessary
educational supplements for 11 min
ority students admitted on a special
basis this fall. The groups includes
eight blacks and three Mexican-
Americans.
Summarizing activities not

covered by the April agreement,
Lyman said:
*Meyer Library has established an
A fro-American section with about
1,000 volumes, including several hun
dred new acquisitions, "as a resource

for the entire community on these neg
lected subjects."
*A new undergraduate major in
African and Afro-American Studies has
been organized for up to 15 sopho
mores and juniors, starting in January.
In addition, there have been sev
eral developments at the graduate and
professional school level, he said:
*Thc School of Law has started a
new program in which minority stu
dents may take four years, rather than
the usual three, to earn the LL.B.
Three students are currently enrolled.
*The Graduate School of Business
has announced a new program for
minority students, combining work ex
perience with study toward the MBA
degree.
*The School of Engineering plans
to use its Honors Cooperative Program
to recruit college juniors who would
work for a participating firm and study
toward a master's degree.
*The School of Medicine will hold
10 places in its entering class next
fall for qualified minority students.
Enrollment of A fro-American and
Mexican-American students at
Stanford has risen from an estimated
175 last year to 291 this year, Provost
Richard Lyman said yesterday.
In a review circulated to all
faculty members on University actions
since the Black Student Union agree
ment last April, Lyman said this year's
freshman class included 75 black
students and about 15 Mexican-
Americans. In addition, 17 students
from these two groups were admitted
as transfers.
"Plans are being made with neigh
boring junior colleges for a systematic
program of transfer to Stanford for
students recruited by the junior col
leges and jointly identified as having
the ability to continue their work at
Stanford," he added. The colleges arc
Foothill and San Mateo.
His report indicated Stanford has
neared the half-way mark in meeting
its commitment to try to double minor
ority group enrollment to about 350
by 1969-70.
Achieving this objective will
require a net increase of about 75 minor
ity undergraduates next fall, with an
increase in student aid funds amount
ing to about $168,000, he said.
'Major Effort'
"Sustaining this level of expend
iture, and I hope even increasing it in
years ahead, will require a major
university effort," he said. At present,
minority students receive $281,905 in
financial aid from the University's
funds, plus $37,200 in federal econo
mic opportunity grants, and $82,700
in nonfederal outside awards. These
figures do not include loans or work
study jobs.
