The impact of the draft on Stan
ford men is increasing, after a slow
start this academic year.
William Leland, senior counselor
on Selective Service problems, said
today that he estimates 25-30 men
have received draft notices so far this
quarter, "but I expect it to increase."
His analysis was borne out by
Thomas Robinson, assistant dean of
the School of Law. and William llanne
man. assistant dean for student affairs
of the Graduate School of Business.
"The number is increasing," said
Robinson, "and between now and next
September, I think there will be signifi
cant attrition. Of our total 430 enroll
ment, we could lose 50 by next Sep
tember, not because all of them will be
drafted, but that under the draft's
coercion, they will do other things."
The normal number of law school
admissions is 155. Robinson said, but
this year 189 were admitted to allow
for attrition. Next fall, the same pro
cedure will be followed. "I or the
upper classes," Robinson said, "we
hope to admit more transfers and
women, and those with deferments."
In the business school. Hanneman
estimated there arc 50 to 60 "vulner
able" students, and he expects the
number of draft calls to increase, but
so far, "we have lost only one." Hanne
man added that lie has written five to
10 letters supporting appeals from in
dividuals that they be allowed to finish
the year.
