# U.S. Rep. Talks
## Science In Politics 
### 
Scientists must accept a new re
sponsibility, that of becoming political
ly involved in promoting the interests
of science before Congress, the chair
man of the powerful House Committee
on Science and Astronautics said here
Tuesday.
Congressman George Miller
(D-Alameda), speaking at a seminar,
asserted that the "faith and fear"
rationale for research appropriations is
no longer sufficient. Scientists will
have to plead their own case

"vigorously and competently" in com
petition with other demands on Con
gress, he said.
"Let mc quickly assure you I do
not mean partisan politics," added the
Alameda Democrat. I think we can
identify persons in both parties who
understand science policy and arc
receptive to information and advice.
"Also I believe that participation
by scientists in the political arena is
completely honorable and
appropriate a completion of total
professional service." Miller said that
the government's multi-billion-dollar
support of science in the past 25 years
has given the nation the best scientific
resources in the world.
"Testimony to our preeminence
includes the technology gap complaints
of Western Europe, the award of Nobel
Prizes, the prestiage of our space pro
gram and the continued military
strength undergirding our national
security," he said.
"Scientific research-basic, funda
mental, undirected, academic- is at the
heart of our total strength. But today
the rationale for patronage of research
appears to be insufficient to hold the
desired high level of funding in the face
of great competition for the available
dolloars.
Political Sense
"The appropriation actions of the
Congress must make politial sense.
Science and technology are only a part
of the many demands and pressures
which become integrated in the legis
lative process. 'Faith and fear' are not
enough to sustain the federal expendi
tures at a level which many of us think
is needed.
"There is a certain fickleness in
the Congress toward scientific pro
jects," he continued. The Congress'
interest fluctuates" just as public
opinion rises and falls. The space pro
gram, to my chagrin, is an outstanding
example. Thus the advocacy of
science's claim for support must be
repeated and sustained especially for
the large, expensive, equipment-leased
programs."

"First, science research is rele
vant," he said. "Regardless of its basic
character, research is relevant to our
national problems because society is so
complex and so strongly based on tech
nology.
Relevance
"You should constantly seek ex
amples of relevance in research," he
told the Stanford group, "and bring
them to the attention of the public and
the Congress. For example ecology, as
a science, has languished on the shores
of Walden Pond for a century. Now we
see the international biological pro
gram as the information base for much
of the enormous expenditures for the
future for restoring and maintaining
the quality of the environment."
Secondly, he said, evaluation of
the impact of research results should
be added to the sequence of research,
development and application.
