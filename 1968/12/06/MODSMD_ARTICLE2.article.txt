# Pitzer Analyzes Stanford's Future
## 
### 
(The following interview with
University President Kenneth Pitzer
took place Wednesday.) THE DAILY:
The American university has bccomc
more and more tied to federal aid.
What provisions could there be to pro
tect universities from sudden cutbacks
like this year's?
Pitzer: The University can't protect it
self completely from sudden cutbacks
in aid but the thing that I think is most
important here, and that a number of
us are working on, is to promote a real
ization of responsibility on the part of
Congress as well as the Executive
Branch that a steady level of con
tinuity in this sort of thing is essential
for the welfare of the universities.
THE DAILY: Do you foresee any dif
ference between the Johnson and
Nixon administrations in their policies
toward universities?
Pitzer: 1 don't see any very substantial
difference. I can't imagine a better ap

pointment that Dr. Du√üridge as an in
dication of commitment in this area.
THE DAILY: What role should the
university take in trying to improve
both the quality of life in America and
the growing intolerance of some seg
ments of the population toward
others?
Pitzer: The university is in no way lim
ited in advocating qualities such as tol
erance, and I have no inhibitions about
speaking in favor of something like
that at all. The university even more
effectively advocates it by demonstra
tion and any time that there's any
action toward intolerance on the
university campus the university is in
fact contributing an adverse effect here
even though it is by no means an offi
cial position of the university. The
example 1 used in my speech at St.
Thomas University was the question of
gold payments. For the university to

questions from about 150 students Tuesday afternoon, after Students for a
Democratic Society had walked from White Plaza to "greet" him and talk
with him about the University.
adopt an official stand on a question
like that is in effect an abridgment of
academic freedom. People ought to be
free to advocate their positions. The
university can have very important
constructive influence on the quality
of life in the country. But this will oc
cur almost entirely, however, by indi
vidual actions and the actions of sub
groups of the university rather than
resolutions of the board of trustees.
THE DAILY: Some persons say that
not to take a stand against the Vietnam
war is really to take an implicit stand
for it.
Pitzer: I just can't agree that that's the
case. As I said yesterday afternoon (to
SDS members and others), I'm just as
anxious to stop that war as anybody
else. But 1 don't think that justifies me
in trying to abridge the individual citi
zen's rights of other people in this
country.
THE DAILY: How do you plan to
communicate* with students on a day
to-day basis as well as in time of crisis?
Pitzer: I intend to have an open com
munication with students as extensive
ly as feasible. And I would welcome
suggestions as to a mechanism in this
regard. The thing that happened ....
I've had dinner in student groups and
discussions afterwards. I think this is a
useful mechanism but it isn't the com

plete answer. Maybe there should be
some occasional announced discussion
hours at some appropriate place.
THE DAILY: What is your view on the
Cleaver controversy at Berkeley?
Pitzer: I don't want to get into the
details of their controversy, but it
seems to me that faculty appointments
ought to be recommended by the exist
ing faculty, and then reviewed and
officially appointed by administrative
officers, or in the case of the longest
term appointments by the regents....
THE DAILY: Some students have been
upset here by the failure of some
young professors to gain tenure,
allegedly because of the "publish or
perish" tendency here. What is your
opinion of the "publish or perish"
question?
Pitzer: I don't know the details of any
of the situations here. But I'm very
much in favor of valid, substantial
student evaluation of teaching quality
being an important factor in the
decision about tenure and reappoint
ments. The problem is at least as much
gettir.g substantial representative
student opinion into the process. I
think the faculty leadership are really
quite willing to consider it if the infor
mation is available. ...
THE DAILY: The Study of Education
has suggested a general education college
in which presumably teaching-oriented

instructors would predominate- over
research-oriented ones. What is your
feeling on that?
Pitzer: Anyone who is seriously pro
posing something of that type ought to
study very closely the history of the
college at Chicago, which has in effect
been dismantled in the direction of
going back to having a single faculty
seeking this dual quality in each ap
pointment .... There's really a desire
among students if they're going to go
to a university such as Stanford or
Chicago to be taught by teachers that
are really the top authorities in their
fields.
THE DAILY: In your opinion should a
university administration react dif
ferently to racial crises than to other
sorts of student crises?
Pitzer: I don't see why one should
react differently to different crises. I
think one tries to understand as dispas
sionately as possible the merits of ques
tions and come to conclusions that are
in line with the basic objectives and
qualities of the institution together
with appropriate recognition of the
views of various members of the com
munity.
THE DAILY: Do you foresee any
changes in the administration, perhaps
in the role of the provost?
Pitzer: I don't want to comment on
any particular position, but the begin

ning of any new administration is the
natural time to eonsider changcs in
organization, and details of assign
ments of responsibility, and 1 intend to
study that sort of question here. In
fact I've already started to seek the
advice of the elected leaders of the
faculty and elected leaders of the
student body for that matter. ... I'd
like to say, too, that in any new ap
pointments that might develop that
carry major responsibility 1 will be
seeking faculty and student advice in
the selection of the individuals, pos
sibly through these elected leaders or
through other committees that may be
elected under their auspices.
THE DAILY: How do you feel about
having students on the next presi
dential selection committee?
Pitzer: I'm all in favor of having stu
dents involved appropriately in the
selection process. Now in the technical
sense the selection committee will pre
sumably be a trustee committee, but
the faculty had a major role in the pro
cess this time and, as 1 think you prob
ably know, it's been set up at Rice for
my successor such that I think students
will in effect serve on the search com
mittee.
THE DAILY: How would you react to
the idea of standing for confirmation
to the presidency in a campus-wide
referendum as some students have sug
gested?
Pitzer: 1 don't think that's a good
mechanism for running the university.
I think the University is
essentially a professional area and the
process of choosing people needs to be
one in which the professional
qualifications-and I use professional in
a very broad sense-can be properly
evaluated by fellow professionals in
that area.
THE DAILY: Were you in consultation
about the recent settlement of the
salary dispute between the University
and Political Science TA's? What is
your view of the settlement?
Pitzer: No, I was not in consultation; I
did, incidental to other conversations
with Dr. Glaser, Dr. Lyman, 1 did hear
reports as to how this was going. I
didn't attempt to involve myself in
them in any significant way. And I
don't believe there's any useful pur
pose to my commenting on the
solution. I judge it was reasonably
partially satisfactory to various groups.
I would hope that this type of
negotiations, this mechanism, would
not really be used in relationships with

this sort of group of the campus com
munity in the future. I would hope
that we could have the degree of open
ness of communication to get under
standing and to work out satisfactory
means to avert a crisis or confrontation
type of situation.
THE DAILY: Do you foresee any
changes in the role of the University
Chapel or its dean?
Pitzer: 1 have no reason to believe
there's any change needed there. I
haven't looked into it with any great
detail but I have noted that Dean
Napier is one of the invited speakers at
Rice in the coming months. And 1 got
good reports from his counterpart at
Rice. I've had a pleasant conversation
with him. As far as I'm concerned,
there are no problems.
THE DAILY: Some persons have been
concerned also about the Hoover
Institution. What role do you think
Hoover should play in the future?
Pitzer: Again, I want to familiarize
myself personally with their activities,
and 1 have not had a chance to do so
yet except in a very casual way. I will
say that just in a preliminary view I
would like and hope to see that over a
period of time, the Hoover Institution,
which is a major library and research
resource, in certain areas could be
drawn somewhat into the teaching and
graduate study area of activity. It has a
special history and there are some
special limitations on this, but that's
the direction in which I'd like to sec it
move.
THE DAILY: What is your reaction to
the SDS's "welcome" for you?
Pitzer: Well, I can think of more
cordial ways of being welcomed to
campus, but on the other hand it
actually generated an opportunity to
visit with a number of students who
arc conccrned about matters, and 1
think it was in the net entirely con
structive.

In a later interview with the local
press Pitzer said he believed the Board
of Trustees should have more com
munication with students than one
student trustee could afford. He also
said in response to a question about
whether he would move to strengthen
the humanities area as well as the
sciences as he had as president of Rice
University in Houston, Texas, "I think
so. I believe we should try to
strengthen those areas that are any
thing less than the very best."

THE DAILY: What role should the
university take in trying to improve
both the quality of life in America and
the growing intolerance of some seg
ments of the population toward
others?
Pitzer: The university is in no way lim
ited in advocating qualities such as tol
erance, and I have no inhibitions about
speaking in favor of something like
that at all. The university even more
effectively advocates it by demonstra
tion and any time that there's any
action toward intolerance on the
university campus the university is in
fact contributing an adverse effect here
even though it is by no means an offi
cial position of the university. The
example 1 used in my speech at St.
Thomas University was the question of
gold payments. For the university to

adopt an official stand on a question
like that is in effect an abridgment of
academic freedom. People ought to be
free to advocate their positions. The
university can have very important
constructive influence on the quality
of life in the country. But this will oc
cur almost entirely, however, by indi
vidual actions and the actions of sub
groups of the university rather than
resolutions of the board of trustees.
THE DAILY: Some persons say that
not to take a stand against the Vietnam
war is really to take an implicit stand
for it.
Pitzer: I just can't agree that that's the
case. As I said yesterday afternoon (to
SDS members and others), I'm just as
anxious to stop that war as anybody
else. But 1 don't think that justifies me
in trying to abridge the individual citi
zen's rights of other people in this
country.
THE DAILY: How do you plan to
communicate* with students on a day
to-day basis as well as in time of crisis?
Pitzer: I intend to have an open com
munication with students as extensive
ly as feasible. And I would welcome
suggestions as to a mechanism in this
regard. The thing that happened ....
I've had dinner in student groups and
discussions afterwards. I think this is a
useful mechanism but it isn't the com

plete answer. Maybe there should be
some occasional announced discussion
hours at some appropriate place.
THE DAILY: What is your view on the
Cleaver controversy at Berkeley?
Pitzer: I don't want to get into the
details of their controversy, but it
seems to me that faculty appointments
ought to be recommended by the exist
ing faculty, and then reviewed and
officially appointed by administrative
officers, or in the case of the longest
term appointments by the regents....
THE DAILY: Some students have been
upset here by the failure of some
young professors to gain tenure,
allegedly because of the "publish or
perish" tendency here. What is your
opinion of the "publish or perish"
question?
Pitzer: I don't know the details of any
of the situations here. But I'm very
much in favor of valid, substantial
student evaluation of teaching quality
being an important factor in the
decision about tenure and reappoint
ments. The problem is at least as much
gettir.g substantial representative
student opinion into the process. I
think the faculty leadership are really
quite willing to consider it if the infor
mation is available. ...
THE DAILY: The Study of Education
has suggested a general education college
in which presumably teaching-oriented

instructors would predominate- over
research-oriented ones. What is your
feeling on that?
Pitzer: Anyone who is seriously pro
posing something of that type ought to
study very closely the history of the
college at Chicago, which has in effect
been dismantled in the direction of
going back to having a single faculty
seeking this dual quality in each ap
pointment .... There's really a desire
among students if they're going to go
to a university such as Stanford or
Chicago to be taught by teachers that
are really the top authorities in their
fields.
THE DAILY: In your opinion should a
university administration react dif
ferently to racial crises than to other
sorts of student crises?
Pitzer: I don't see why one should
react differently to different crises. I
think one tries to understand as dispas
sionately as possible the merits of ques
tions and come to conclusions that are
in line with the basic objectives and
qualities of the institution together
with appropriate recognition of the
views of various members of the com
munity.
THE DAILY: Do you foresee any
changes in the administration, perhaps
in the role of the provost?
Pitzer: I don't want to comment on
any particular position, but the begin

ning of any new administration is the
natural time to eonsider changcs in
organization, and details of assign
ments of responsibility, and 1 intend to
study that sort of question here. In
fact I've already started to seek the
advice of the elected leaders of the
faculty and elected leaders of the
student body for that matter. ... I'd
like to say, too, that in any new ap
pointments that might develop that
carry major responsibility 1 will be
seeking faculty and student advice in
the selection of the individuals, pos
sibly through these elected leaders or
through other committees that may be
elected under their auspices.
THE DAILY: How do you feel about
having students on the next presi
dential selection committee?
Pitzer: I'm all in favor of having stu
dents involved appropriately in the
selection process. Now in the technical
sense the selection committee will pre
sumably be a trustee committee, but
the faculty had a major role in the pro
cess this time and, as 1 think you prob
ably know, it's been set up at Rice for
my successor such that I think students
will in effect serve on the search com
mittee.
THE DAILY: How would you react to
the idea of standing for confirmation
to the presidency in a campus-wide
referendum as some students have sug
gested?
Pitzer: 1 don't think that's a good
mechanism for running the university.
I think the University is
essentially a professional area and the
process of choosing people needs to be
one in which the professional
qualifications-and I use professional in
a very broad sense-can be properly
evaluated by fellow professionals in
that area.
THE DAILY: Were you in consultation
about the recent settlement of the
salary dispute between the University
and Political Science TA's? What is
your view of the settlement?
Pitzer: No, I was not in consultation; I
did, incidental to other conversations
with Dr. Glaser, Dr. Lyman, 1 did hear
reports as to how this was going. I
didn't attempt to involve myself in
them in any significant way. And I
don't believe there's any useful pur
pose to my commenting on the
solution. I judge it was reasonably
partially satisfactory to various groups.
I would hope that this type of
negotiations, this mechanism, would
not really be used in relationships with

this sort of group of the campus com
munity in the future. I would hope
that we could have the degree of open
ness of communication to get under
standing and to work out satisfactory
means to avert a crisis or confrontation
type of situation.
THE DAILY: Do you foresee any
changes in the role of the University
Chapel or its dean?
Pitzer: 1 have no reason to believe
there's any change needed there. I
haven't looked into it with any great
detail but I have noted that Dean
Napier is one of the invited speakers at
Rice in the coming months. And 1 got
good reports from his counterpart at
Rice. I've had a pleasant conversation
with him. As far as I'm concerned,
there are no problems.
THE DAILY: Some persons have been
concerned also about the Hoover
Institution. What role do you think
Hoover should play in the future?
Pitzer: Again, I want to familiarize
myself personally with their activities,
and 1 have not had a chance to do so
yet except in a very casual way. I will
say that just in a preliminary view I
would like and hope to see that over a
period of time, the Hoover Institution,
which is a major library and research
resource, in certain areas could be
drawn somewhat into the teaching and
graduate study area of activity. It has a
special history and there are some
special limitations on this, but that's
the direction in which I'd like to sec it
move.
THE DAILY: What is your reaction to
the SDS's "welcome" for you?
Pitzer: Well, I can think of more
cordial ways of being welcomed to
campus, but on the other hand it
actually generated an opportunity to
visit with a number of students who
arc conccrned about matters, and 1
think it was in the net entirely con
structive.
* * *
In a later interview with the local
press Pitzer said he believed the Board
of Trustees should have more com
munication with students than one
student trustee could afford. He also
said in response to a question about
whether he would move to strengthen
the humanities area as well as the
sciences as he had as president of Rice
University in Houston, Texas, "I think
so. I believe we should try to
strengthen those areas that are any
thing less than the very best."
(The following interview with
University President Kenneth Pitzer
took place Wednesday.) THE DAILY:
The American university has bccomc
more and more tied to federal aid.
What provisions could there be to pro
tect universities from sudden cutbacks
like this year's?
Pitzer: The University can't protect it
self completely from sudden cutbacks
in aid but the thing that I think is most
important here, and that a number of
us are working on, is to promote a real
ization of responsibility on the part of
Congress as well as the Executive
Branch that a steady level of con
tinuity in this sort of thing is essential
for the welfare of the universities.
THE DAILY: Do you foresee any dif
ference between the Johnson and
Nixon administrations in their policies
toward universities?
Pitzer: 1 don't see any very substantial
difference. I can't imagine a better ap

pointment that Dr. Du√üridge as an in

with him about the University.
adopt an official stand on a question
like that is in effect an abridgment of
academic freedom. People ought to be
free to advocate their positions. The
university can have very important
constructive influence on the quality
of life in the country. But this will oc
cur almost entirely, however, by indi
vidual actions and the actions of sub
groups of the university rather than
resolutions of the board of trustees.
THE DAILY: Some persons say that
not to take a stand against the Vietnam
war is really to take an implicit stand
for it.
Pitzer: I just can't agree that that's the
case. As I said yesterday afternoon (to
SDS members and others), I'm just as
anxious to stop that war as anybody
else. But 1 don't think that justifies me
in trying to abridge the individual citi
zen's rights of other people in this
country.
THE DAILY: How do you plan to
communicate* with students on a day
to-day basis as well as in time of crisis?
Pitzer: I intend to have an open com
munication with students as extensive
ly as feasible. And I would welcome
suggestions as to a mechanism in this
regard. The thing that happened ....
I've had dinner in student groups and
discussions afterwards. I think this is a
useful mechanism but it isn't the com

plete answer. Maybe there should be
some occasional announced discussion
hours at some appropriate place.
THE DAILY: What is your view on the
Cleaver controversy at Berkeley?
Pitzer: I don't want to get into the
details of their controversy, but it
seems to me that faculty appointments
ought to be recommended by the exist
ing faculty, and then reviewed and
officially appointed by administrative
officers, or in the case of the longest
term appointments by the regents....
THE DAILY: Some students have been
upset here by the failure of some
young professors to gain tenure,
allegedly because of the "publish or
perish" tendency here. What is your
opinion of the "publish or perish"
question?
Pitzer: I don't know the details of any
of the situations here. But I'm very
much in favor of valid, substantial
student evaluation of teaching quality
being an important factor in the
decision about tenure and reappoint
ments. The problem is at least as much
gettir.g substantial representative
student opinion into the process. I
think the faculty leadership are really
quite willing to consider it if the infor
mation is available. ...
THE DAILY: The Study of Education
has suggested a general education college
in which presumably teaching-oriented

instructors would predominate- over
research-oriented ones. What is your
feeling on that?
Pitzer: Anyone who is seriously pro
posing something of that type ought to
study very closely the history of the
college at Chicago, which has in effect
been dismantled in the direction of
going back to having a single faculty
seeking this dual quality in each ap
pointment .... There's really a desire
among students if they're going to go
to a university such as Stanford or
Chicago to be taught by teachers that
are really the top authorities in their
fields.
THE DAILY: In your opinion should a
university administration react dif
ferently to racial crises than to other
sorts of student crises?
Pitzer: I don't see why one should
react differently to different crises. I
think one tries to understand as dispas
sionately as possible the merits of ques
tions and come to conclusions that are
in line with the basic objectives and
qualities of the institution together
with appropriate recognition of the
views of various members of the com
munity.
THE DAILY: Do you foresee any
changes in the administration, perhaps
in the role of the provost?
Pitzer: I don't want to comment on
any particular position, but the begin

ning of any new administration is the
natural time to eonsider changcs in
organization, and details of assign
ments of responsibility, and 1 intend to
study that sort of question here. In
fact I've already started to seek the
advice of the elected leaders of the
faculty and elected leaders of the
student body for that matter. ... I'd
like to say, too, that in any new ap
pointments that might develop that
carry major responsibility 1 will be
seeking faculty and student advice in
the selection of the individuals, pos
sibly through these elected leaders or
through other committees that may be
elected under their auspices.
THE DAILY: How do you feel about
having students on the next presi
dential selection committee?
Pitzer: I'm all in favor of having stu
dents involved appropriately in the
selection process. Now in the technical
sense the selection committee will pre
sumably be a trustee committee, but
the faculty had a major role in the pro
cess this time and, as 1 think you prob
ably know, it's been set up at Rice for
my successor such that I think students
will in effect serve on the search com
mittee.
THE DAILY: How would you react to
the idea of standing for confirmation
to the presidency in a campus-wide
referendum as some students have sug
gested?
Pitzer: 1 don't think that's a good
mechanism for running the university.
I think the University is
essentially a professional area and the
process of choosing people needs to be
one in which the professional
qualifications-and I use professional in
a very broad sense-can be properly
evaluated by fellow professionals in
that area.
THE DAILY: Were you in consultation
about the recent settlement of the
salary dispute between the University
and Political Science TA's? What is
your view of the settlement?
Pitzer: No, I was not in consultation; I
did, incidental to other conversations
with Dr. Glaser, Dr. Lyman, 1 did hear
reports as to how this was going. I
didn't attempt to involve myself in
them in any significant way. And I
don't believe there's any useful pur
pose to my commenting on the
solution. I judge it was reasonably
partially satisfactory to various groups.
I would hope that this type of
negotiations, this mechanism, would
not really be used in relationships with

this sort of group of the campus com
munity in the future. I would hope
that we could have the degree of open
ness of communication to get under
standing and to work out satisfactory
means to avert a crisis or confrontation
type of situation.
THE DAILY: Do you foresee any
changes in the role of the University
Chapel or its dean?
Pitzer: 1 have no reason to believe
there's any change needed there. I
haven't looked into it with any great
detail but I have noted that Dean
Napier is one of the invited speakers at
Rice in the coming months. And 1 got
good reports from his counterpart at
Rice. I've had a pleasant conversation
with him. As far as I'm concerned,
there are no problems.
THE DAILY: Some persons have been
concerned also about the Hoover
Institution. What role do you think
Hoover should play in the future?
Pitzer: Again, I want to familiarize
myself personally with their activities,
and 1 have not had a chance to do so
yet except in a very casual way. I will
say that just in a preliminary view I
would like and hope to see that over a
period of time, the Hoover Institution,
which is a major library and research
resource, in certain areas could be
drawn somewhat into the teaching and
graduate study area of activity. It has a
special history and there are some
special limitations on this, but that's
the direction in which I'd like to sec it
move.
THE DAILY: What is your reaction to
the SDS's "welcome" for you?
Pitzer: Well, I can think of more
cordial ways of being welcomed to
campus, but on the other hand it
actually generated an opportunity to
visit with a number of students who
arc conccrned about matters, and 1
think it was in the net entirely con
structive.
* * *
In a later interview with the local
press Pitzer said he believed the Board
of Trustees should have more com
munication with students than one
student trustee could afford. He also
said in response to a question about
whether he would move to strengthen
the humanities area as well as the
sciences as he had as president of Rice
University in Houston, Texas, "I think
so. I believe we should try to
strengthen those areas that are any
thing less than the very best."
(The following interview with
University President Kenneth Pitzer
took place Wednesday.) THE DAILY:
The American university has bccomc
more and more tied to federal aid.
What provisions could there be to pro
tect universities from sudden cutbacks
like this year's?
Pitzer: The University can't protect it
self completely from sudden cutbacks
in aid but the thing that I think is most
important here, and that a number of
us are working on, is to promote a real
ization of responsibility on the part of
Congress as well as the Executive
Branch that a steady level of con
tinuity in this sort of thing is essential
for the welfare of the universities.
THE DAILY: Do you foresee any dif
ference between the Johnson and
Nixon administrations in their policies
toward universities?
Pitzer: 1 don't see any very substantial
difference. I can't imagine a better ap

pointment that Dr. Du√üridge as an in
dication of commitment in this area.
THE DAILY: What role should the
university take in trying to improve
both the quality of life in America and
the growing intolerance of some seg
ments of the population toward
others?
Pitzer: The university is in no way lim
ited in advocating qualities such as tol
erance, and I have no inhibitions about
speaking in favor of something like
that at all. The university even more
effectively advocates it by demonstra
tion and any time that there's any
action toward intolerance on the
university campus the university is in
fact contributing an adverse effect here
even though it is by no means an offi
cial position of the university. The
example 1 used in my speech at St.
Thomas University was the question of
gold payments. For the university to

THE DAILY: How do you plan to
communicate* with students on a day
to-day basis as well as in time of crisis?
Pitzer: I intend to have an open com
munication with students as extensive
ly as feasible. And I would welcome
suggestions as to a mechanism in this
regard. The thing that happened ....
I've had dinner in student groups and
discussions afterwards. I think this is a
useful mechanism but it isn't the com

plete answer. Maybe there should be
some occasional announced discussion
hours at some appropriate place.
THE DAILY: What is your view on the
Cleaver controversy at Berkeley?
Pitzer: I don't want to get into the
details of their controversy, but it
seems to me that faculty appointments
ought to be recommended by the exist
ing faculty, and then reviewed and
officially appointed by administrative
officers, or in the case of the longest
term appointments by the regents....
THE DAILY: Some students have been
upset here by the failure of some
young professors to gain tenure,
allegedly because of the "publish or
perish" tendency here. What is your
opinion of the "publish or perish"
question?
Pitzer: I don't know the details of any
of the situations here. But I'm very
much in favor of valid, substantial
student evaluation of teaching quality
being an important factor in the
decision about tenure and reappoint
ments. The problem is at least as much
gettir.g substantial representative
student opinion into the process. I
think the faculty leadership are really
quite willing to consider it if the infor
mation is available. ...
THE DAILY: The Study of Education
has suggested a general education college
in which presumably teaching-oriented

instructors would predominate- over
research-oriented ones. What is your
feeling on that?
Pitzer: Anyone who is seriously pro
posing something of that type ought to
study very closely the history of the
college at Chicago, which has in effect
been dismantled in the direction of
going back to having a single faculty
seeking this dual quality in each ap
pointment .... There's really a desire
among students if they're going to go
to a university such as Stanford or
Chicago to be taught by teachers that
are really the top authorities in their
fields.
THE DAILY: In your opinion should a
university administration react dif
ferently to racial crises than to other
sorts of student crises?
Pitzer: I don't see why one should
react differently to different crises. I
think one tries to understand as dispas
sionately as possible the merits of ques
tions and come to conclusions that are
in line with the basic objectives and
qualities of the institution together
with appropriate recognition of the
views of various members of the com
munity.
THE DAILY: Do you foresee any
changes in the administration, perhaps
in the role of the provost?
Pitzer: I don't want to comment on
any particular position, but the begin

ning of any new administration is the
natural time to eonsider changcs in
organization, and details of assign
ments of responsibility, and 1 intend to
study that sort of question here. In
fact I've already started to seek the
advice of the elected leaders of the
faculty and elected leaders of the
student body for that matter. ... I'd
like to say, too, that in any new ap
pointments that might develop that
carry major responsibility 1 will be
seeking faculty and student advice in
the selection of the individuals, pos
sibly through these elected leaders or
through other committees that may be
elected under their auspices.
THE DAILY: How do you feel about
having students on the next presi
dential selection committee?
Pitzer: I'm all in favor of having stu
dents involved appropriately in the
selection process. Now in the technical
sense the selection committee will pre
sumably be a trustee committee, but
the faculty had a major role in the pro
cess this time and, as 1 think you prob
ably know, it's been set up at Rice for
my successor such that I think students
will in effect serve on the search com
mittee.
THE DAILY: How would you react to
the idea of standing for confirmation
to the presidency in a campus-wide
referendum as some students have sug
gested?
Pitzer: 1 don't think that's a good
mechanism for running the university.
I think the University is
essentially a professional area and the
process of choosing people needs to be
one in which the professional
qualifications-and I use professional in
a very broad sense-can be properly
evaluated by fellow professionals in
that area.
THE DAILY: Were you in consultation
about the recent settlement of the
salary dispute between the University
and Political Science TA's? What is
your view of the settlement?
Pitzer: No, I was not in consultation; I
did, incidental to other conversations
with Dr. Glaser, Dr. Lyman, 1 did hear
reports as to how this was going. I
didn't attempt to involve myself in
them in any significant way. And I
don't believe there's any useful pur
pose to my commenting on the
solution. I judge it was reasonably
partially satisfactory to various groups.
I would hope that this type of
negotiations, this mechanism, would
not really be used in relationships with

this sort of group of the campus com
munity in the future. I would hope
that we could have the degree of open
ness of communication to get under
standing and to work out satisfactory
means to avert a crisis or confrontation
type of situation.
THE DAILY: Do you foresee any
changes in the role of the University
Chapel or its dean?
Pitzer: 1 have no reason to believe
there's any change needed there. I
haven't looked into it with any great
detail but I have noted that Dean
Napier is one of the invited speakers at
Rice in the coming months. And 1 got
good reports from his counterpart at
Rice. I've had a pleasant conversation
with him. As far as I'm concerned,
there are no problems.
THE DAILY: Some persons have been
concerned also about the Hoover
Institution. What role do you think
Hoover should play in the future?
Pitzer: Again, I want to familiarize
myself personally with their activities,
and 1 have not had a chance to do so
yet except in a very casual way. I will
say that just in a preliminary view I
would like and hope to see that over a
period of time, the Hoover Institution,
which is a major library and research
resource, in certain areas could be
drawn somewhat into the teaching and
graduate study area of activity. It has a
special history and there are some
special limitations on this, but that's
the direction in which I'd like to sec it
move.
THE DAILY: What is your reaction to
the SDS's "welcome" for you?
Pitzer: Well, I can think of more
cordial ways of being welcomed to
campus, but on the other hand it
actually generated an opportunity to
visit with a number of students who
arc conccrned about matters, and 1
think it was in the net entirely con
structive.
* * *
In a later interview with the local
press Pitzer said he believed the Board
of Trustees should have more com
munication with students than one
student trustee could afford. He also
said in response to a question about
whether he would move to strengthen
the humanities area as well as the
sciences as he had as president of Rice
University in Houston, Texas, "I think
so. I believe we should try to
strengthen those areas that are any
thing less than the very best."
(The following interview with
University President Kenneth Pitzer
took place Wednesday.) THE DAILY:
The American university has bccomc
more and more tied to federal aid.
What provisions could there be to pro
tect universities from sudden cutbacks
like this year's?
Pitzer: The University can't protect it
self completely from sudden cutbacks
in aid but the thing that I think is most
important here, and that a number of
us are working on, is to promote a real
ization of responsibility on the part of
Congress as well as the Executive
Branch that a steady level of con
tinuity in this sort of thing is essential
for the welfare of the universities.
THE DAILY: Do you foresee any dif
ference between the Johnson and
Nixon administrations in their policies
toward universities?
Pitzer: 1 don't see any very substantial
difference. I can't imagine a better ap

pointment that Dr. Du√üridge as an in
dication of commitment in this area.
THE DAILY: What role should the
university take in trying to improve
both the quality of life in America and
the growing intolerance of some seg
ments of the population toward
others?
Pitzer: The university is in no way lim
ited in advocating qualities such as tol
erance, and I have no inhibitions about
speaking in favor of something like
that at all. The university even more
effectively advocates it by demonstra
tion and any time that there's any
action toward intolerance on the
university campus the university is in
fact contributing an adverse effect here
even though it is by no means an offi
cial position of the university. The
example 1 used in my speech at St.
Thomas University was the question of
gold payments. For the university to

adopt an official stand on a question
like that is in effect an abridgment of
academic freedom. People ought to be
free to advocate their positions. The
university can have very important
constructive influence on the quality
of life in the country. But this will oc
cur almost entirely, however, by indi
vidual actions and the actions of sub
groups of the university rather than
resolutions of the board of trustees.
THE DAILY: Some persons say that
not to take a stand against the Vietnam
war is really to take an implicit stand
for it.
Pitzer: I just can't agree that that's the
case. As I said yesterday afternoon (to
SDS members and others), I'm just as
anxious to stop that war as anybody
else. But 1 don't think that justifies me
in trying to abridge the individual citi
zen's rights of other people in this
country.

young professors to gain tenure,
allegedly because of the "publish or
perish" tendency here. What is your
opinion of the "publish or perish"
question?
Pitzer: I don't know the details of any
of the situations here. But I'm very
much in favor of valid, substantial
student evaluation of teaching quality
being an important factor in the
decision about tenure and reappoint
ments. The problem is at least as much
gettir.g substantial representative
student opinion into the process. I
think the faculty leadership are really
quite willing to consider it if the infor
mation is available. ...
THE DAILY: The Study of Education
has suggested a general education college
in which presumably teaching-oriented

instructors would predominate- over
research-oriented ones. What is your
feeling on that?
Pitzer: Anyone who is seriously pro
posing something of that type ought to
study very closely the history of the
college at Chicago, which has in effect
been dismantled in the direction of
going back to having a single faculty
seeking this dual quality in each ap
pointment .... There's really a desire
among students if they're going to go
to a university such as Stanford or
Chicago to be taught by teachers that
are really the top authorities in their
fields.
THE DAILY: In your opinion should a
university administration react dif
ferently to racial crises than to other
sorts of student crises?
Pitzer: I don't see why one should
react differently to different crises. I
think one tries to understand as dispas
sionately as possible the merits of ques
tions and come to conclusions that are
in line with the basic objectives and
qualities of the institution together
with appropriate recognition of the
views of various members of the com
munity.
THE DAILY: Do you foresee any
changes in the administration, perhaps
in the role of the provost?
Pitzer: I don't want to comment on
any particular position, but the begin

ning of any new administration is the
natural time to eonsider changcs in
organization, and details of assign
ments of responsibility, and 1 intend to
study that sort of question here. In
fact I've already started to seek the
advice of the elected leaders of the
faculty and elected leaders of the
student body for that matter. ... I'd
like to say, too, that in any new ap
pointments that might develop that
carry major responsibility 1 will be
seeking faculty and student advice in
the selection of the individuals, pos
sibly through these elected leaders or
through other committees that may be
elected under their auspices.
THE DAILY: How do you feel about
having students on the next presi
dential selection committee?
Pitzer: I'm all in favor of having stu
dents involved appropriately in the
selection process. Now in the technical
sense the selection committee will pre
sumably be a trustee committee, but
the faculty had a major role in the pro
cess this time and, as 1 think you prob
ably know, it's been set up at Rice for
my successor such that I think students
will in effect serve on the search com
mittee.
THE DAILY: How would you react to
the idea of standing for confirmation
to the presidency in a campus-wide
referendum as some students have sug
gested?
Pitzer: 1 don't think that's a good
mechanism for running the university.
I think the University is
essentially a professional area and the
process of choosing people needs to be
one in which the professional
qualifications-and I use professional in
a very broad sense-can be properly
evaluated by fellow professionals in
that area.
THE DAILY: Were you in consultation
about the recent settlement of the
salary dispute between the University
and Political Science TA's? What is
your view of the settlement?
Pitzer: No, I was not in consultation; I
did, incidental to other conversations
with Dr. Glaser, Dr. Lyman, 1 did hear
reports as to how this was going. I
didn't attempt to involve myself in
them in any significant way. And I
don't believe there's any useful pur
pose to my commenting on the
solution. I judge it was reasonably
partially satisfactory to various groups.
I would hope that this type of
negotiations, this mechanism, would
not really be used in relationships with

this sort of group of the campus com
munity in the future. I would hope
that we could have the degree of open
ness of communication to get under
standing and to work out satisfactory
means to avert a crisis or confrontation
type of situation.
THE DAILY: Do you foresee any
changes in the role of the University
Chapel or its dean?
Pitzer: 1 have no reason to believe
there's any change needed there. I
haven't looked into it with any great
detail but I have noted that Dean
Napier is one of the invited speakers at
Rice in the coming months. And 1 got
good reports from his counterpart at
Rice. I've had a pleasant conversation
with him. As far as I'm concerned,
there are no problems.
THE DAILY: Some persons have been
concerned also about the Hoover
Institution. What role do you think
Hoover should play in the future?
Pitzer: Again, I want to familiarize
myself personally with their activities,
and 1 have not had a chance to do so
yet except in a very casual way. I will
say that just in a preliminary view I
would like and hope to see that over a
period of time, the Hoover Institution,
which is a major library and research
resource, in certain areas could be
drawn somewhat into the teaching and
graduate study area of activity. It has a
special history and there are some
special limitations on this, but that's
the direction in which I'd like to sec it
move.
THE DAILY: What is your reaction to
the SDS's "welcome" for you?
Pitzer: Well, I can think of more
cordial ways of being welcomed to
campus, but on the other hand it
actually generated an opportunity to
visit with a number of students who
arc conccrned about matters, and 1
think it was in the net entirely con
structive.

In a later interview with the local
press Pitzer said he believed the Board
of Trustees should have more com
munication with students than one
student trustee could afford. He also
said in response to a question about
whether he would move to strengthen
the humanities area as well as the
sciences as he had as president of Rice
University in Houston, Texas, "I think
so. I believe we should try to
strengthen those areas that are any
thing less than the very best."
(The following interview with
University President Kenneth Pitzer
took place Wednesday.) THE DAILY:
The American university has bccomc
more and more tied to federal aid.
What provisions could there be to pro
tect universities from sudden cutbacks
like this year's?
Pitzer: The University can't protect it
self completely from sudden cutbacks
in aid but the thing that I think is most
important here, and that a number of
us are working on, is to promote a real
ization of responsibility on the part of
Congress as well as the Executive
Branch that a steady level of con
tinuity in this sort of thing is essential
for the welfare of the universities.
THE DAILY: Do you foresee any dif
ference between the Johnson and
Nixon administrations in their policies
toward universities?
Pitzer: 1 don't see any very substantial
difference. I can't imagine a better ap

pointment that Dr. Du√üridge as an in
dication of commitment in this area.
THE DAILY: What role should the
university take in trying to improve
both the quality of life in America and
the growing intolerance of some seg
ments of the population toward
others?
Pitzer: The university is in no way lim
ited in advocating qualities such as tol
erance, and I have no inhibitions about
speaking in favor of something like
that at all. The university even more
effectively advocates it by demonstra
tion and any time that there's any
action toward intolerance on the
university campus the university is in
fact contributing an adverse effect here
even though it is by no means an offi
cial position of the university. The
example 1 used in my speech at St.
Thomas University was the question of
gold payments. For the university to

Democratic Society had walked from White Plaza to "greet" him and talk
with him about the University.
adopt an official stand on a question
like that is in effect an abridgment of
academic freedom. People ought to be
free to advocate their positions. The
university can have very important
constructive influence on the quality
of life in the country. But this will oc
cur almost entirely, however, by indi
vidual actions and the actions of sub
groups of the university rather than
resolutions of the board of trustees.
THE DAILY: Some persons say that
not to take a stand against the Vietnam
war is really to take an implicit stand
for it.
Pitzer: I just can't agree that that's the
case. As I said yesterday afternoon (to
SDS members and others), I'm just as
anxious to stop that war as anybody
else. But 1 don't think that justifies me
in trying to abridge the individual citi
zen's rights of other people in this
country.
THE DAILY: How do you plan to
communicate* with students on a day
to-day basis as well as in time of crisis?
Pitzer: I intend to have an open com
munication with students as extensive
ly as feasible. And I would welcome
suggestions as to a mechanism in this
regard. The thing that happened ....
I've had dinner in student groups and
discussions afterwards. I think this is a
useful mechanism but it isn't the com

plete answer. Maybe there should be
some occasional announced discussion
hours at some appropriate place.
THE DAILY: What is your view on the
Cleaver controversy at Berkeley?
Pitzer: I don't want to get into the
details of their controversy, but it
seems to me that faculty appointments
ought to be recommended by the exist
ing faculty, and then reviewed and
officially appointed by administrative
officers, or in the case of the longest
term appointments by the regents....
THE DAILY: Some students have been
upset here by the failure of some
