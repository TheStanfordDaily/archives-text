# Board Reports Budget Gap
## 
### 
Trustees of the University have approved 1969-70 budget guidelines
calling for spending $715,000 from reserves, University President Kenneth
Pitzer reported to faculty representatives yesterday.
A comparable deficit is anticipated for the current academic year, main
ly because of sharp reductions in federal research expenditures.
The Trustees have also authorized a project control budget of $20
million for a new library building, Pitzer reported, funds for the new struc
ture will have to be raised before construction can start in the present
parking lot area behind the Main Library.
Pitzer made the disclosures in the first of a regular series of reports on
trustee actions, newly authorized by the board ut his request.
In his initial address to the Senate of the Academic Council, he strongly
emphasized his commitment to open communication and warmly endorsed
recent suggestions for change in campus governance recommended by the
American Association of University Professors.
"If we arc to approach ;is closely as possible the atmosphere of a
community of scholars, we must do everything we can to make information
openly available and to encourage free discussion of matters of general
interest to the community," he said.
"Thus, 1 am opposed to unnecessary secrecy in administrative matters
just as much as I am opposed to secrecy in connection with research
activities on university campuses."
