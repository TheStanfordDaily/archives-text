## 'Sit-In' Greets Pitzer 
### 
A sit-in, of sorts, took placc Tues
day afternoon in President Kenneth
Pitzer's office on the Quad. The
Stanford Students for a Democratic
Society (SDS) sponsored the four-hour
long session as part of their "Greet
Pitzer Week."
I vents got under way at 1 with a
march from White Plaza to Pitzer's
temporary offices in Building 1 on the
Quad. Some 50 students took part in
the march which ended in the
reception room of the president's of
fice on the second floor of the
building.
President Pitzer was having lunch
at the faculty Club when the students
arrived. Asst. Dean of Students Bob
Rosch stood at the door of the
building telling the marchers, as they
walked in, that Pitzer would be back
around 2 and would be happy to talk
then.

The students marched up the
stairs and milled around in the
reception room. One secretary, Mrs.
Sarah Stephenson, was present when
the students arrived and she remained
at her post throughout the afternoon.
Religion Professor William
Clcbsch, a member of the faculty com
mittee on campus disturbances,
announced to the group that they were
interfering with the conduct of the
University and therefore might be in
violation of University policy.
I ew students left after the warn
ing and Clcbsch himself later said that
the demonstration had not really inter
fered with the operation of the
University.
Pitzer returned from lunch
around 2 and invited the students in
his office to come outside "so we can

discuss things." Students occupying
the office split over whether to accept
his offer, but most did with only a doz
en staying in the officc.
Pitzer then held an hour-long dis
cussion with students and others who
happened by. A crowd of closc to 150
were present for most of the outdoor
discussion.
Answering questions from the stu
dents, Pitzer said he is "very much op
posed to American domination of
others" and "just as much concerned
about getting the war stopped as any
o c else."
Pitzer finished his discussion with
the students around 3 and somejjf the
students then returned to his officc. A
dozen remained until five o'clock
when, according to their previously an
nounced plan, they left.

others" and "just as much concerned
about getting the war stopped as any
o c else."
Pitzer finished his discussion with
the students around 3 and somejjf the
students then returned to his officc. A
dozen remained until five o'clock
when, according to their previously an
nounced plan, they left.
A sit-in, of sorts, took placc Tues
day afternoon in President Kenneth
Pitzer's office on the Quad. The
Stanford Students for a Democratic
Society (SDS) sponsored the four-hour
long session as part of their "Greet
Pitzer Week."
I vents got under way at 1 with a
march from White Plaza to Pitzer's
temporary offices in Building 1 on the
Quad. Some 50 students took part in
the march which ended in the
reception room of the president's of
fice on the second floor of the
building.
President Pitzer was having lunch
at the faculty Club when the students
arrived. Asst. Dean of Students Bob
Rosch stood at the door of the
building telling the marchers, as they
walked in, that Pitzer would be back
around 2 and would be happy to talk
then.

The students marched up the
stairs and milled around in the
reception room. One secretary, Mrs.
Sarah Stephenson, was present when
the students arrived and she remained
at her post throughout the afternoon.
Religion Professor William
Clcbsch, a member of the faculty com
mittee on campus disturbances,
announced to the group that they were
interfering with the conduct of the
University and therefore might be in
violation of University policy.
I ew students left after the warn
ing and Clcbsch himself later said that
the demonstration had not really inter
fered with the operation of the
University.
Pitzer returned from lunch
around 2 and invited the students in
his office to come outside "so we can

discuss things." Students occupying
the office split over whether to accept
his offer, but most did with only a doz
en staying in the officc.
Pitzer then held an hour-long dis
cussion with students and others who
happened by. A crowd of closc to 150
were present for most of the outdoor
discussion.
Answering questions from the stu
dents, Pitzer said he is "very much op
posed to American domination of
others" and "just as much concerned
about getting the war stopped as any
o c else."
Pitzer finished his discussion with
the students around 3 and somejjf the
students then returned to his officc. A
dozen remained until five o'clock
when, according to their previously an
nounced plan, they left.
