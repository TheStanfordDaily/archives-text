# What's With The Daily?
## 
### 
Today The Daily joins many other leading campus news
papers at major campuses in switching from the tradi
tional hottype method of typesetting and composition to
the more modern and, we hope, less expensive cold type
process.
In the hot type process letters are cast on slugs of
lead that are then composited to form the pages. In cold
type a computerized typewriter justifies the copy which
is then pasted onto the page.
The main motivation for the changeover is money.
Although our former compositor was very cooperative
with us, we did not believe we could afford to stay there.
And the estimates for the cold type process predict that
in the long run we may be saving money that can then be
diverted into programs that will bring better coverage of
the news.
As for the size of today's paper, that was caused by
our lack of advertisements. But we'll be back to normal
size and appearance, and we hope on the way to im
proved news coverage, come our first issue of winter
quarter Jan. 6.
