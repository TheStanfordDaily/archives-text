# Judicial Statement
## Thievery In Bookstore 
### 
(The following is a statement re
leased by the members of the Tempo
rary Judicial Council.-Ed.)
On Wednesday, November 20th,
the Temporary Judicial Council met to
hear six separate cases involving petty
thefts from the Stanford Bookstore.
Each student had been caught "red
handed" leaving the store without
having paid for the items taken. The
students ail admitted that they had
taken the items knowingly and without
justification.
The individual defendants ranged
from sophomores to graduate students,
male and female; none was notably
poor; all could easily have afforded the
items stolen. By academic standards
the students were highly intelligent,
each having a grade point average close
to 3.0 or better. Yet in spite of their
wealth and intelligence, each of these
students, who readily admitted that
stealing is not acceptable by their own
standards, let alone the standards of
society, nevertheless walked out with
the items in question. Some even ad
mitted, with commendable candor,
that they had previously stolen similar
items from the Bookstore.

The total value of the goods
stolen by the six students tried by the
Council was less than $15, ranging
from a 19c pen to a $4.95 book. By
way of contrast, the value of the time
spent in disposing of these cases can be
modestly estimated at $420 (12 per
sons' time at $10 per hour for 3-1/2
hours). This figure excludes the cost of
apprehending the students, of setting
hearings, of providing for tape record
ings, of checking facts with the Book
store and others, and of determining
and supervision the penalties.
Costly Behavior
The Temporary Judicial Council
intends to design its penalties to cut
down or eliminate such serious and
costly behavior, by making individuals
reflect in advance regarding their con
duct. There are two types of penalty
available for this purpose. One is to
require the payment of costs, by way
of fines. The other is to publicize
"dumb" acts as a means of reminding
members of the community, as well as
defendants, of their obligations. Al
though the Council is not now dis
posed to go to the extremes possible,
either by levying fines amounting to

the total cost of its judicial proceedings
or by placing guilty defendants in a
pillory in White Plaza, it will levy lesser
variations of these penalties.
Of course, such severe penalties may be
adopted to deal with those individuals
who steal habitually or with premed
itation.
The individuals involved in these
cases are not thieves in any classic
sense; their offenses were committed
because of their own carelessness- a
failure to consider the nature and
effect of their acts; acts done, as one of
the students put it, because they
"seemed so easy." Once caught and
forced to think serious about their con
duct, the students were obviously
mortified. As one defendant summed it
up, "It was a dumb thing to do."
Careless
Because the Council believes that
such conduct is basically the result of
careless rather than criminal behavior,
it does not intend to penalize offenders
by turning the cases over to municipal
authorities, whose penalties may be
stiff indeed, or by imposing ultimate
sanctions of expulsion or suspension.

hear six separate cases involving petty
thefts from the Stanford Bookstore.
Each student had been caught "red
handed" leaving the store without
having paid for the items taken. The
students ail admitted that they had
taken the items knowingly and without
justification.
The individual defendants ranged
from sophomores to graduate students,
male and female; none was notably
poor; all could easily have afforded the
items stolen. By academic standards
the students were highly intelligent,
each having a grade point average close
to 3.0 or better. Yet in spite of their
wealth and intelligence, each of these
students, who readily admitted that
stealing is not acceptable by their own
standards, let alone the standards of
society, nevertheless walked out with
the items in question. Some even ad
mitted, with commendable candor,
that they had previously stolen similar
items from the Bookstore.

The total value of the goods
stolen by the six students tried by the
Council was less than $15, ranging
from a 19c pen to a $4.95 book. By
way of contrast, the value of the time
spent in disposing of these cases can be
modestly estimated at $420 (12 per
sons' time at $10 per hour for 3-1/2
hours). This figure excludes the cost of
apprehending the students, of setting
hearings, of providing for tape record
ings, of checking facts with the Book
store and others, and of determining
and supervision the penalties.
Costly Behavior
The Temporary Judicial Council
intends to design its penalties to cut
down or eliminate such serious and
costly behavior, by making individuals
reflect in advance regarding their con
duct. There are two types of penalty
available for this purpose. One is to
require the payment of costs, by way
of fines. The other is to publicize
"dumb" acts as a means of reminding
members of the community, as well as
defendants, of their obligations. Al
though the Council is not now dis
posed to go to the extremes possible,
either by levying fines amounting to

the total cost of its judicial proceedings
or by placing guilty defendants in a
pillory in White Plaza, it will levy lesser
variations of these penalties.
Of course, such severe penalties may be
adopted to deal with those individuals
who steal habitually or with premed
itation.
The individuals involved in these
cases are not thieves in any classic
sense; their offenses were committed
because of their own carelessness- a
failure to consider the nature and
effect of their acts; acts done, as one of
the students put it, because they
"seemed so easy." Once caught and
forced to think serious about their con
duct, the students were obviously
mortified. As one defendant summed it
up, "It was a dumb thing to do."
Careless
Because the Council believes that
such conduct is basically the result of
careless rather than criminal behavior,
it does not intend to penalize offenders
by turning the cases over to municipal
authorities, whose penalties may be
stiff indeed, or by imposing ultimate
sanctions of expulsion or suspension.
