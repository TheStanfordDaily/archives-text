• Concerning Spuds <£ Armies
Editor, THE DAILY:
Watchdog Denis Hayes has
warned us to be careful about accepting
an apparently good proposal-the abol
ishment of the draft.
He says that out of the drafting of
middle-class sons (bad) has arisen the
middle-class anti-war movement
(good). And he says that the large tran
sient element in the defense establish
ment-those who want "nothing more
than to get two years' spuds peeled and
get out"-helps check the self-perpetu
ating tendencies of that establishment.
A year and a half ago I rode on a
bus from the S.F. airport to Oakland,
on which all but two of the passengers
were young servicemen who were to
get off at the Oakland army base (the
"jumping-off point"). I honestly didn't
hear anyone talking about two years of

potato-peeling. As a matter of fact, I
didn't hear one damn word from any
of them in twenty minutes.
When they arrived, they were
packed standing in trollies (like those
in the Disneyland parking-lot-but with
bars) and were locked in from outside.
That's your cue, Denis. What 1
mean is: you should wait at the airport
for such a bus (there are plenty still, 1
believe), get on, and ride along with
the servicemen. At the base, before
they are locked into the trollies, hop
off the bus and read them your "Case
Against a Volunteer Army."
Tell them how we (2-S) intellec
tuals have not only found flaws in the
volunteer army idea, but have seen
actually good effects coming from the
present system (e.g. its protection of us
from a close-knit, militaristic, Appa
lachian "pig" force).
After that, tell me how a volun
teer military-no matter how "homo
geneous" in attitudes-would figure in
a senseless, suicidal intervention like
the present one: (That is, if the sacri
ficial flock doesn't carve you up like a
big spud beforehand!)

• Rejects Volunteer Army
Editor, THE DAILY:
1 heartily concur with Denis
Hayes' article, "The Case Against a
Volunteer Army."
The fast-moving, irrevocable
decisive nature of military engagements
makes it necessary to have strict
discipline within a military force where
performance of duty is concerned. In
the past, however, that necessity was
often used as an excuse for persons in
positions of authority at all levels with
in our armed forces to inject their own
preferences and whims into the per
sonal life of subordinates, and fre
quently to engage in brutal, sadistic
forms of discipline.
Though this aspect of military life
still exists, it has been considerably
mitigated in recent years, largely, 1
believe, because an increasing number
of today's young enlisted men and
junior officers can't be bullied as effec
tively. It now produces greater morale
problems than before, increased
AWOL's, and non-cooperation in per
formance of duties.
Similarly the young men in to
day's armed forces arc more politically
aware, and there is widespread disap
proval of our current military involve
ment in Vietnam. As an example of
this sentiment note that an over
whelming mafority of Army- ROTC
cadets polled in a straw ballot at Stan
ford voted for both Humphrey and
Cranston, a fact which must be some
expression of anti-war sentiment. And
it's damn hard to fight with an army
that thinks the war is unwise and/or
wrong. On the domestic scene, even
Americans must consider the possi
bility of future meddling with the
political processes by military leaders.
To attempt a coup d'etat, however,
would be an exceedingly risky venture
with an army consisting largely of to
day's civilian oriented, semi-unwilling
junior officers and enlisted men. Would
these salutary moderating influences
exist within the armed forces if they
consisted entirely of willing volunteers
who joined because their authoritarian,
force-oriented personalities found com
fort and fulfillment in an army of like
minded individuals?

Director Howard Brown says,

" 'The Window' is similar to
'Sister George' with its unusual char

• Rejects Volunteer Army
Editor, THE DAILY:
1 heartily concur with Denis
Hayes' article, "The Case Against a
Volunteer Army."
The fast-moving, irrevocable
decisive nature of military engagements
makes it necessary to have strict
discipline within a military force where
performance of duty is concerned. In
the past, however, that necessity was
often used as an excuse for persons in
positions of authority at all levels with
in our armed forces to inject their own
preferences and whims into the per
sonal life of subordinates, and fre
quently to engage in brutal, sadistic
forms of discipline.
Though this aspect of military life
still exists, it has been considerably
mitigated in recent years, largely, 1
believe, because an increasing number
of today's young enlisted men and
junior officers can't be bullied as effec
tively. It now produces greater morale
problems than before, increased
AWOL's, and non-cooperation in per
formance of duties.
Similarly the young men in to
day's armed forces arc more politically
aware, and there is widespread disap
proval of our current military involve
ment in Vietnam. As an example of
this sentiment note that an over
whelming mafority of Army- ROTC
cadets polled in a straw ballot at Stan
ford voted for both Humphrey and
Cranston, a fact which must be some
expression of anti-war sentiment. And
it's damn hard to fight with an army
that thinks the war is unwise and/or
wrong. On the domestic scene, even
Americans must consider the possi
bility of future meddling with the
political processes by military leaders.
To attempt a coup d'etat, however,
would be an exceedingly risky venture
with an army consisting largely of to
day's civilian oriented, semi-unwilling
junior officers and enlisted men. Would
these salutary moderating influences
exist within the armed forces if they
consisted entirely of willing volunteers
who joined because their authoritarian,
force-oriented personalities found com
fort and fulfillment in an army of like
minded individuals?

Dusenbcrry and Andros Thompson
appear in "Creditors" by August
Strindberg, to be presented with "The
Window" by Frank Marcus in the
Little Theater 8 p.m. tonight and
tomorrow.
Director Howard Brown says,
"Creditors' may well be the grand
father of the modern 'marital blitz'
play, such as 'Who's Afraid of Virginia
Woolf.' To a certain extent, 'Creditors'
shares the half cynical, half ironic tone
of Albee's play. Strindberg's is a swift

revealing the monster and child in the
heart of everyone."
" 'The Window' is similar to
'Sister George' with its unusual char
acters, implicated in uncommonly pro
vocative situations," director Stephen
Book says. "Marcus possesses that rare
and enviable theatrical commodity: the
ability to be both comic and affecting

• Concerning Spuds <£ Armies
Editor, THE DAILY:
Watchdog Denis Hayes has
warned us to be careful about accepting
an apparently good proposal-the abol
ishment of the draft.
He says that out of the drafting of
middle-class sons (bad) has arisen the
middle-class anti-war movement
(good). And he says that the large tran
sient element in the defense establish
ment-those who want "nothing more
than to get two years' spuds peeled and
get out"-helps check the self-perpetu
ating tendencies of that establishment.
A year and a half ago I rode on a
bus from the S.F. airport to Oakland,
on which all but two of the passengers
were young servicemen who were to
get off at the Oakland army base (the
"jumping-off point"). I honestly didn't
hear anyone talking about two years of

potato-peeling. As a matter of fact, I
didn't hear one damn word from any
of them in twenty minutes.
When they arrived, they were
packed standing in trollies (like those
in the Disneyland parking-lot-but with
bars) and were locked in from outside.
That's your cue, Denis. What 1
mean is: you should wait at the airport
for such a bus (there are plenty still, 1
believe), get on, and ride along with
the servicemen. At the base, before
they are locked into the trollies, hop
off the bus and read them your "Case
Against a Volunteer Army."

CREDITORS-Richard Rckow, Lynne
Dusenbcrry and Andros Thompson
appear in "Creditors" by August
Strindberg, to be presented with "The
Window" by Frank Marcus in the
Little Theater 8 p.m. tonight and
tomorrow.
Director Howard Brown says,
"Creditors' may well be the grand
father of the modern 'marital blitz'
play, such as 'Who's Afraid of Virginia
Woolf.' To a certain extent, 'Creditors'
shares the half cynical, half ironic tone
of Albee's play. Strindberg's is a swift
and ruthless play. It bares the soul,
revealing the monster and child in the
heart of everyone."
" 'The Window' is similar to
'Sister George' with its unusual char
acters, implicated in uncommonly pro
vocative situations," director Stephen
Book says. "Marcus possesses that rare
and enviable theatrical commodity: the
ability to be both comic and affecting
almost within the same breath."
• Concerning Spuds <£ Armies
Editor, THE DAILY:
Watchdog Denis Hayes has
warned us to be careful about accepting
an apparently good proposal-the abol
ishment of the draft.
He says that out of the drafting of
middle-class sons (bad) has arisen the
middle-class anti-war movement
(good). And he says that the large tran
sient element in the defense establish
ment-those who want "nothing more
than to get two years' spuds peeled and
get out"-helps check the self-perpetu
ating tendencies of that establishment.
A year and a half ago I rode on a
bus from the S.F. airport to Oakland,
on which all but two of the passengers
were young servicemen who were to
get off at the Oakland army base (the
"jumping-off point"). I honestly didn't
hear anyone talking about two years of

potato-peeling. As a matter of fact, I
didn't hear one damn word from any
of them in twenty minutes.
When they arrived, they were
packed standing in trollies (like those
in the Disneyland parking-lot-but with
bars) and were locked in from outside.
That's your cue, Denis. What 1
mean is: you should wait at the airport
for such a bus (there are plenty still, 1
believe), get on, and ride along with
the servicemen. At the base, before
they are locked into the trollies, hop
off the bus and read them your "Case
Against a Volunteer Army."
Tell them how we (2-S) intellec
tuals have not only found flaws in the
volunteer army idea, but have seen
actually good effects coming from the
present system (e.g. its protection of us
from a close-knit, militaristic, Appa
lachian "pig" force).
After that, tell me how a volun
teer military-no matter how "homo
geneous" in attitudes-would figure in
a senseless, suicidal intervention like
the present one: (That is, if the sacri
ficial flock doesn't carve you up like a
big spud beforehand!)

• Rejects Volunteer Army
Editor, THE DAILY:
1 heartily concur with Denis
Hayes' article, "The Case Against a
Volunteer Army."
The fast-moving, irrevocable
decisive nature of military engagements
makes it necessary to have strict
discipline within a military force where
performance of duty is concerned. In
the past, however, that necessity was
often used as an excuse for persons in
positions of authority at all levels with
in our armed forces to inject their own
preferences and whims into the per
sonal life of subordinates, and fre
quently to engage in brutal, sadistic
forms of discipline.
Though this aspect of military life
still exists, it has been considerably
mitigated in recent years, largely, 1
believe, because an increasing number
of today's young enlisted men and
junior officers can't be bullied as effec
tively. It now produces greater morale
problems than before, increased
AWOL's, and non-cooperation in per
formance of duties.
