# Faculty Decison
## Poli Sci Courses Cancelled 
### MARK WEINBERGER 
Plans for a number of graduate
student-led political science cour
ses dealing with contemporary
issues were cancelled over the va
cation when none of them met
faculty specifications.
Only three of the 11 student
initiated courses were submitted
to a faculty committee for review,
but only one received faculty
sponsorship.
The faculty body judged the
proposed courses under an interim
policy governing departmental
credit that was formulated in the
wake of student attempts last
month to organize their own
courses.
In all, 170 names appeared on
With Trustees

lists for the 11 courses, with as
many as 40 .egistrants for one,
The The' .y and Practice of
Marxism. Most of the courses
carried a L. f tist tinge, with titles
such as Blac *. Politics, Imperial
ism, the Cub., n Revolution, and
Pre-Socratic 1. ought-the Bible
and Marx.
In a meeting Dec. 3, 115
undergraduate and graduate stu
dents met to draw up a list of
courses in which they were inter
ested that the political science de
partment did not offer. The stu
dents were told by organizers that
credit would be authorized
thorugh the departmental directed
reading program, with a faculty
member offering his sponsorship.

Graduate student organizers
thought taht credit for the courses
was readily forthcoming; they
thought that one or two profes
sors would approve their courses
and delegate responsibility for
them to the student teachers.
This notion didn't stick too
well with the department. As a re
sult of several meetings and re
commendations, the department
issued a Dec. 12 interim policy for
the delegation of teaching respon
sibility to graduate students.
The policy promulgated class
size and unit limitations, in addi
tion to requiring submission of a
reading list and course outline.
The committee would also judge
the student's qualification to
teach the proposed course.

"In the past, we've had several
advanced graduate students, very
knowledgeable, lead courses under
a senior faculty member," com
mented Political Science Prof.
Raymond Wolfinger, who serves
on the faculty plans and policy
committee. "But the proposed
courses are a very different kind
of operation by the very nature of
the number of courses. We
thought they had to be controlled
in some manner."
Of the three courses ultimately
submitted to the faculty body,
none emerged successfully; for
various reasons, support was not
forthcoming from faculty spon
sors.
One of the graduate student or
ganizers, Frank Cassidy, stated
that the courses were set up so
that "students could indicate
what they wanted to learn and the
department would back us up
with their resources."
"Students have expressed a
high degree of dissatisfaction with
course offerings, as was shown by
the 115 students who attended
the meeting during dead week,"
Cassidy claimed. He added that by
vacation, seven of the 11 pro
posed courses had drawn suffi
cient interest, but only three of
those were submitted to the fac
ulty committee since student
teachers had already left for the
holidays.
Cassidy announced a Wednes
day meeting in Tresidder Union at
4 p.m. to discuss future action, al
though he cautioned, "Our inter
est is not in disrupting the depart
ment, but rather general student
concern about the department
and its course offerings."


ADMISSIONS REPORTâ€”"Just as there should be many ways to 'get
an education* at Stanford, so should there be many ways to be
admitted to Stanford," according to the SES admissions report. It
goes on, "No description of 'average' people can portray Stanford.
We wish to attract to Stanford applicants who are not average people
and who know that Stanford is not a community of averages."
