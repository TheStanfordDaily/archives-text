Those who congratulate David Packard on his nomina
tion as Deputy Secretary of Defense clearly have little
understanding of what he faces in Washington. Shifting
subordinates from docile employees at Hewlett-Packard to
strong-headed generals in the Pentagon is a move deserving
sympathy.
We extend our sympathy combined with a sense of re
gret that Stanford is losing one of its most progressive,
fair-minded trustees. In a Board that often distinguishes
itself in lack of imagination and scholarly insight, Packard
has stepped beyond the stereotype style expected of a
millionaire businessman. Not to deny that his credentials
make him the personification of the military-industrial
educational complex or that the debate over placing his
$300 million of Hewlett-Packard stock in trust or on the
market is superfluous to the reality that Packard has a
stake in his business with or without stock.
Even as an immensely successful businessman, however,

Packard has often exhibited a surprising understanding and
appreciation of student questioning that surpasses that of
numerous academicians who profess ultimate disdain for
money grubbing businessmen. Packard's record in minority
group relations adds to the picture of a man able to see
beyond profit and loss figures. His intervention, for ex
ample, in the dispute at the College of San Mateo, offers a
creative solution to a problem with more than a potential
for violence.
We urge him to carry the same desire for peace to the
Pentagon and Nixon foreign policy planning.
