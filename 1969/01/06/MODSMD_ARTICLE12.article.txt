Does modern science dehuman
ize man?
It is easy to find deeply ambiv
alent feelings about science among
intellectuals (even including some
scientists), in Congress, among
alientated youths and among be
wildered citizens. We live in a
scientific age whose glories and
terrors are both credited to
science. At this level, we can hard
ly deny that our ever-growing
scientific mastery over the forces
of nature imposes an almost un
bearable responsibility on political
authority and on a democratic
electorate to learn about, think
about, plan for and use these
forces for real human benefit.
In this climate, many people
have become highly sensitized to
more ethereal questions that are
raised by the scientific study of
man. One such question is the
doctrine of mechanism. Dr. D. E.
Wooldridge, a well-known physi
cist* and systems engineer and a
successful industrialist—formerly
president of TRW (Thompson-
Ramo-Wooldridge) Inc.—has
written several excellent syntheses
of present-day thought in biology.
Mechanical Man
His latest work, "Mechanical
Man—the Physical Basis of Intel
ligent Life," concludes "that a
single body of natural laws opera
ting on a single set of material

particles completely accounts for
the origin and properties of living
organisms. Accordingly, a man is
essentially no more than a com
plex machine."
A few eccentrics aside, the
whole community of contempor
ary science shares the view that
the same laws of nature apply to
nonliving and living matter alike.
All of us who investigate the
chemistry and physics of living
organisms pursue our work as if
organisms were complex
machines, and we find man to
exhibit no tissues or functions
that would except him from this
way of analyzing human nature.
Nevertheless, we are or should
be careful to state just what we
mean before we assert that "man
is a machine," and much more so
before using the phrase "merely a
machine." The statement that
man is "a mere machine," or a
mere anything, is a needless irri
tant to precise communication
between scientists and laymen.
(We might better proclaim that
"man is merely the most complex
product of organic evolution on
earth, the only organism whose in
telligence has evolved to the point
that his culture far transcends his
biological endowment.")
A Retort
The "mere machine" phrase is
usually a retort to the claim that
there are mysteries of human nat
ure that are, in principle, beyond
the reach of scientific investiga
tion. Scientists would do better to

save their breath quarreling about
what they can analyze in princi
ple; in their own work, they are
mercilessly pragmatic about con
fining their conclusions to what
they can examine in practice.

There are, in fact, theoretical
limits to scientific analysis that
may justify men in repudiating
Dr. Wooldridge's assertion that
"the concept of the machinelike
nature of man is incompatible
with a long-cherished belief in
human uniqueness."
There is nothing "mere" about
a machine as complex as a man;
the word "machine" is just a
manner of speaking about the
scientist's faith in a universe or
dered by natural law. That faith
was expressed most eloquently by
the French philosopher the
Marquis de Laplace, who averred
that, given complete knowledge of
the universe at one instant, the
scientist could in principle com
pute all of its future states in in
finite detail.
In practice, we must now
remind ourselves, the scientist and
his computers are machines that
occupy space and consume
energy. Dr. Rolf Landauer of IBM
has pointed out that the process
of calculation itself soon reaches
fundamental limits. If the whole
visible universe were one gigantic
computer, made of components at
the-theoretical lower limit of size
and energy consumption, it would
still be insufficient for some pro
blems that are soluble "in princi
ple."
Far short of the complexity
represented by a human being,
some mere machines called com
puters nevertheless have already
reached the point where their
actual behavior is predictable only
to a rough approximation, and we
must be careful to program inter
nal checks to detect when these
highly individualized robots devi
ate from their intended instruc
tions.
