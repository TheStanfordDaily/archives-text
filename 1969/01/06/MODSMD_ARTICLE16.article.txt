### Maury M. Travis Stanford, BA, MA Earth Sciences 
Students come to school to learn
For knowledge they can ever yearn:
In vain they find professors gone
To research grants in Washington!
Professors rush to research glad,
Their reputation in fever mad:
Dame fickle fortune is for few
Who louse up the literature anew!
Students deserted in riots clashes,
As from cloistered halls and classes:
Abandoned by their colleges and schools
They Realize —too late—they have been fools!
Professors who do not publish
Are penalized by reasons rubbish:
Teaching is the forgotten name,
Research is the road to fame!
L'envoi
Teachers who by students cherish
Must publish or by meat—axe perish:
Tenure is the goal for all,
Though students are lost in ivy's hall.
