# It's No Joke
## Street Church 
### DICK GREGORY 
At a time when the unbridled
spirit of youthful protest is both
challenging and revitalizing the
political and institutional struc
tures of our society, it is curious
to see the church today threaten
ed by a youth reaction of a differ
ent sort.
There is a conspicuous absence
of youthful protest directed at the
church, demanding reform and
seriously challenging both basic
values and practices. By and large,
young people tend simply to ig
nore the church, apparently seeing
it as an institution not worthy of
their revolutionary energies.
Youth's Indifference
Speaking to a large Protestant
gathering in New York City in
October, John D. Rockefeller 3rd,
Chairman of the Rockefeller
Foundation, aptly described the
current mood of young people re
garding the church. Said Rocke
feller: "No institution in our soci
ety is today suffering more from
the sheer indifference of the
young.
By and large, they have dis
missed the church as archaic, in
effective, and even irrelevant . . .
Qne young man told me: 'There's
a genuine religious revival going"
on, but the church is missing out
on it!' Another said: 'The church

could fill a great need in our soci
ety, if it would focus less on the
divine and more on how to apply
Christian teaching to today's '
world.' "
Indeed there is a great and act
ive revival of religious values being
enacted in the lives of young
people the world over. They are
searching for true meaning in life,
insisting upon real values worthy
of life investment and demanding
that morality be a way of life for
individuals, governments and insti
tutions.
The voice of youth echoes
throughout the corriders of
America's most honored institu
tions with the simple message that
no longer will a man's worth be
judged by the clothes he wears,
the position he holds or the social
bearing he affects, but rather by
the quality of life he leads.
Street Prophets
The young prophets of the new
religious awakening will not be
found in the churches. They will
be found rather in the streets.
Much like the prophets of an earl
ier day, their moral demands are
too pure and their devotion to
ethical behaviour too rigorous to*
be comfortably contained in org-'
anized religious structures. The
church would only dare embrace
these new young radical prophets
at the expense of its own institu
tional life.
Church Bombings
In the early days of the-civil
rights movement, many southern
churches were bombed, burned
and destroyed. Actually, the des- I
truction of the church building
testified to a renewed relevance of
religion.
The reason why churches were
destroyed in the South is because
ministers finally started telling the
truth about freedom and used
their pulpits to actively combat
injustice. For years southern
ministers had been afraid to speak*
It has often been said that you
get your best education in the
streets. Today's youth are telling
both church and society that the \
same pattern is true when applied
to religious experience.
