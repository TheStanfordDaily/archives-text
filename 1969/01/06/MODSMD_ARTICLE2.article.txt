# Pitzer Requests New Group

To increase student and faculty
communication with the Board of
Trustees, President Kenneth Pitzer
will recommend formation of a
University Advisory Committee at
the January 14 trustee meeting.
The committee would include five
students, five faculty members,
and five trustees, to be chaired by
a sixteenth member, the Univer
sity president.
The committee, according to
Pitzer, "would take up matters of
consequence to the whole Univer
sity and make recommendations
to the proper decision-making
bodies." Pitzer emphasizes, how
ever, that the committee is not in
tended to supersede present struc
tures such as the Committee of
Fifteen and the Student Conduct
Legislative Council (SCLC).
The plan Pitzer will recom
mend stresses employment of the
committee to put students and
faculty in closer contact with
Trustees. He hopes it will be a
mechanism through which Trus
tees can be better informed about?
campus developments, particu
larly those which may come be
fore the Board for a decision.
The committee will be en

couraged to offer specific recom
mendations to the Board prior to
trustee deliberations on "action
items" in the Trustee agenda.
Both Pitzer and Board President
William Parmer Fuller 111 hope the
committee will be a first step in
wider student and faculty partici
pation in trustee policy forma
tion.
The initial idea for an advisory
committee was generated by trust
ee John Gardner, former Secret
ary of Health, Education and Wel
fare and presently chairman of the
Urban Coalition. Specific plans
were developed by Pitzer in con
sultation with Fuller. Leonard
Schiff, chairman of the Academic
Senate, and Denis Hayes, ASSU
president were also consulted.
Hayes is less than enthusiastic
about the plan, feeling it will do
little to make substantial inroads
on trustee homogeneity.
If the Board accepts Pitzer's
recommendation, as they are ex
pected to do, the next step in for
mation will be selection of mem
bers. Pitzer's plan stipulates that
the president of the Board, Chair
man of the Academic Senate, and
ASSU president automatically be

members. Selection of four other
individuals from each constitu
ency will be made by established
methods.
If the committee is established,
the first item on its agenda will
probably concern selection of a
successor to David Packard. (See
story on Packard.) Fuller has
stated that he sees the committee
as a vehicle in which students can
argue the case for student partici
pation in the selection process to
replace Packard and for student
membership on the Board.
Pitzer revealed this past week
end that he has appointed an ad
hoc committee on executive org
anization to advise him on chang
ing unviersity organization and
making major appointments.
Members of the ad hoc com
mittee are Schiff, Business Profes
sor George Bach, chairman of the
faculty committee on committees;
Sidney Raffel, chairman of the
faculty advisory board which
passes on faculty appointments
and tenure decisions; Robert
Glaser, dean of the Medical school
and acting president of Stanford
prior to Pitzer's arrival; Denis
Hayes; and Victor von Schlegel,
ASSU vice president.

to the proper decision-making
bodies." Pitzer emphasizes, how
ever, that the committee is not in
tended to supersede present struc
tures such as the Committee of
Fifteen and the Student Conduct
Legislative Council (SCLC).
The plan Pitzer will recom
mend stresses employment of the
committee to put students and
faculty in closer contact with
Trustees. He hopes it will be a
mechanism through which Trus
tees can be better informed about?
campus developments, particu
larly those which may come be
fore the Board for a decision.
The committee will be en

couraged to offer specific recom
mendations to the Board prior to
trustee deliberations on "action
items" in the Trustee agenda.
Both Pitzer and Board President
William Parmer Fuller 111 hope the
committee will be a first step in
wider student and faculty partici
pation in trustee policy forma
tion.
The initial idea for an advisory
committee was generated by trust
ee John Gardner, former Secret
ary of Health, Education and Wel
fare and presently chairman of the
Urban Coalition. Specific plans
were developed by Pitzer in con
sultation with Fuller. Leonard
Schiff, chairman of the Academic
Senate, and Denis Hayes, ASSU
president were also consulted.
Hayes is less than enthusiastic
about the plan, feeling it will do
little to make substantial inroads
on trustee homogeneity.
If the Board accepts Pitzer's
recommendation, as they are ex
pected to do, the next step in for
mation will be selection of mem
bers. Pitzer's plan stipulates that
the president of the Board, Chair
man of the Academic Senate, and
ASSU president automatically be

members. Selection of four other
individuals from each constitu
ency will be made by established
methods.
If the committee is established,
the first item on its agenda will
probably concern selection of a
successor to David Packard. (See
story on Packard.) Fuller has
stated that he sees the committee
as a vehicle in which students can
argue the case for student partici
pation in the selection process to
replace Packard and for student
membership on the Board.
Pitzer revealed this past week
end that he has appointed an ad
hoc committee on executive org
anization to advise him on chang
ing unviersity organization and
making major appointments.
Members of the ad hoc com
mittee are Schiff, Business Profes
sor George Bach, chairman of the
faculty committee on committees;
Sidney Raffel, chairman of the
faculty advisory board which
passes on faculty appointments
and tenure decisions; Robert
Glaser, dean of the Medical school
and acting president of Stanford
prior to Pitzer's arrival; Denis
Hayes; and Victor von Schlegel,
ASSU vice president.
To increase student and faculty
communication with the Board of
Trustees, President Kenneth Pitzer
will recommend formation of a
University Advisory Committee at
the January 14 trustee meeting.
The committee would include five
students, five faculty members,
and five trustees, to be chaired by
a sixteenth member, the Univer
sity president.
The committee, according to
Pitzer, "would take up matters of
consequence to the whole Univer
sity and make recommendations
to the proper decision-making
bodies." Pitzer emphasizes, how
