# British Campus Move Set
## 
### 
Stanford will move its British
campus from Harlaxton Manor to
Cliveden, the University an
nounced Friday. The move has
been under consideration for sev
eral months, and The Daily first
reported the possible move to
Cliveden in September.
Cliveden, between Oxford and
London, was the former home of
Lord and Lady Astor. Now it is
owned by Britain's National
Trust, which has kept it open for
visits by the public.
It was the gathering place of
members of the "Cliveden set"
who are said to have influenced
the British foreign policy which
led to Munich. It was the site of
the Profumo affair of 1963.
In 1963, John Profumo,
Britain's War Minister, was the
focus of a scandal which rocked
the British government. Since
1955, Dr. Stephen Ward, osteo
path and procurer, had had a
country cottage on the Cliveden
estate which he leased from his
friend and patient Lord Astor.
Stanford has signed a long-term
lease effective April 7, 1969.
Cliveden lies on the Thames about
40 miles west of central London.
The lease covers the manor itself,
two small cottages, garage, boat
house on the Thames, a swimming
pool, and a cricket field paddock

a tew minutes' walk from the
house.
The Harlaxton campus, which
will be released to another occu
pant, is located near Grantham,
100 miles north of London in the
Lincolnshire midlands.
Provost Richard Lyman said
the opportunity to move to
Cliveden "comes at a most pro
pitious time, and the University
looks forward to the significant
curricular improvements which
can be made in the new location.
It should result in a richer educa
tional and cultural program, with
increased involvement of Stanford
students in the British environ
ment."
Between now and Stanford's
occupation of Cliveden, substan
tial renovation and rehabilitation
will be made so that the estate
will accommodate students,
tutors, faculty, administration,
and part of the staff.
The long library and the small
library, which are open to the
public, will be used by the Univer
sity when the house is not on
show. The libraries and other pub
lic rooms and the gardens will
continue to be maintained by the
trust.
Cliveden will continue to be
open to visitors three times a
week from April to late October,
and the gardens for five days a
week, under the terms of the
lease.


NEW CAMPUS—Clivedon will be the sight of the British Overseas Cam
pus starting this spring quarter. Substantial renovation will be under
taken before students and faculty arrive.

lic rooms and the gardens will
continue to be maintained by the
trust.
Cliveden will continue to be
open to visitors three times a
week from April to late October,
and the gardens for five days a
week, under the terms of the
lease.


NEW CAMPUS—Clivedon will be the sight of the British Overseas Cam
pus starting this spring quarter. Substantial renovation will be under
taken before students and faculty arrive.
Stanford will move its British
campus from Harlaxton Manor to
Cliveden, the University an
nounced Friday. The move has
been under consideration for sev
eral months, and The Daily first
reported the possible move to
Cliveden in September.
Cliveden, between Oxford and
London, was the former home of
Lord and Lady Astor. Now it is
owned by Britain's National
Trust, which has kept it open for
visits by the public.
It was the gathering place of
members of the "Cliveden set"
who are said to have influenced
the British foreign policy which
led to Munich. It was the site of
the Profumo affair of 1963.
In 1963, John Profumo,
Britain's War Minister, was the
focus of a scandal which rocked
the British government. Since
1955, Dr. Stephen Ward, osteo
path and procurer, had had a
country cottage on the Cliveden
estate which he leased from his
friend and patient Lord Astor.
Stanford has signed a long-term
lease effective April 7, 1969.
Cliveden lies on the Thames about
40 miles west of central London.
The lease covers the manor itself,
two small cottages, garage, boat
house on the Thames, a swimming
pool, and a cricket field paddock

a tew minutes' walk from the
house.
The Harlaxton campus, which
will be released to another occu
pant, is located near Grantham,
100 miles north of London in the
Lincolnshire midlands.
Provost Richard Lyman said
the opportunity to move to
Cliveden "comes at a most pro
pitious time, and the University
looks forward to the significant
curricular improvements which
can be made in the new location.
It should result in a richer educa
tional and cultural program, with
increased involvement of Stanford
students in the British environ
ment."
Between now and Stanford's
occupation of Cliveden, substan
tial renovation and rehabilitation
will be made so that the estate
will accommodate students,
tutors, faculty, administration,
and part of the staff.
The long library and the small
library, which are open to the
public, will be used by the Univer
sity when the house is not on
show. The libraries and other pub
lic rooms and the gardens will
continue to be maintained by the
trust.
Cliveden will continue to be
