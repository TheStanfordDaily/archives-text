# Faculty-Student Body Sought To Study Proposals Of SES
## 
### MARSHALL SCHWARTZ 
A unique coalition of students
is attempting to bring student par
ticipation—a feature which
marked the preparation of the
Study of Education at Stanford
(SES) —to the process of approv
ing the Study's recommendations.
Included in the ground are
ASSU President Denis Hayes,
LASSU Speaker Yale Braunstein
and former speaker Michael Wein
stein, SDS members George Rein
hardt and Myron Filene, and
several former SES staff and com
mittee members.
The group is proposing that a
joint faculty-student body be
established for the purpose of act
ing in the SES proposals.
"We feel that the thorough dis
cussion and the final acceptance
of these (SES) proposals should
not be left to closed sessions of
the Academic Senate and political
maneuverings between academic
departments and the administra
tion," the coalition declared in a
handbill distributed in registration
packets.
"Both the method of accept-,
ance and the substance of the SES
recommendations exhibit the pol
itical compromising fated to
undermine the basic premises of
the Study," the statement contin
ued. "Feeling the necessity for
student participation in matters as

essential as our own education, we
have taken the iniatiative in re
storing community-wide critical
discussion of the recommendation
of the Study of Education at
Stanford."
The group feels that leaving the
approval of proposals to an all
faculty . body is at cross-purposes
with the basic philosophy of the
Study.
In this regard, the group cites
specific assumptions taken by the
Study which state the idea of th
student setting forth his own edu
cational plants; all from the first
volume of the SES report:
"The word 'education' comes
from the Latin verb educare
meaning 'to lead forth.' To lead
does not mean to compel, or to
push, or to pull."
". . . education must be the
concern of the student himself,
self-willed and in a large measure
self-directed."
"Faculty determination of
what will be made goes
completely against the idea of a
'self-willed' or 'self-directed' edu
cation," according to Michael
Weinstein.
As for the joint committee to
act on the Study's ideas, any such
body would have to established
by the Academic Senate.
"We're not looking for 50 per
cent of the membership—but we
do want significant student repre
sentation," Weinstein added.

But the coalition is intent on
seeing its plan approved, and
hopes a confrontation can be
avoided.
Meanwhile, they are planning a
series of meetings between SES
members and those in the coali
tion in various dorms to better
acquaint the students with the
Study's recommendations.
The philosophy of the group
goes beyond action on SES plans.
Weinstein noted that a similar
contradictory situation exists in
all departments, where curriculum
and staff questions are all decided
on by the faculty, with the stu
dents having no official say.

act on the Study's ideas, any such
body would have to established
by the Academic Senate.
"We're not looking for 50 per
cent of the membership—but we
do want significant student repre
sentation," Weinstein added.

But the coalition is intent on
seeing its plan approved, and
hopes a confrontation can be
avoided.
Meanwhile, they are planning a
series of meetings between SES
members and those in the coali
tion in various dorms to better
acquaint the students with the
Study's recommendations.
The philosophy of the group
goes beyond action on SES plans.
Weinstein noted that a similar
contradictory situation exists in
all departments, where curriculum
and staff questions are all decided
on by the faculty, with the stu
dents having no official say.
A unique coalition of students
is attempting to bring student par
ticipation—a feature which
marked the preparation of the
Study of Education at Stanford
(SES) —to the process of approv
ing the Study's recommendations.
Included in the ground are
ASSU President Denis Hayes,
LASSU Speaker Yale Braunstein
and former speaker Michael Wein
stein, SDS members George Rein
hardt and Myron Filene, and
several former SES staff and com
mittee members.
The group is proposing that a
joint faculty-student body be
established for the purpose of act
ing in the SES proposals.
"We feel that the thorough dis
cussion and the final acceptance
of these (SES) proposals should
not be left to closed sessions of
the Academic Senate and political
maneuverings between academic
departments and the administra
tion," the coalition declared in a
handbill distributed in registration
packets.
"Both the method of accept-,
ance and the substance of the SES
recommendations exhibit the pol
itical compromising fated to
undermine the basic premises of
the Study," the statement contin
ued. "Feeling the necessity for
student participation in matters as

essential as our own education, we
have taken the iniatiative in re
storing community-wide critical
discussion of the recommendation
of the Study of Education at
Stanford."
The group feels that leaving the
approval of proposals to an all
faculty . body is at cross-purposes
with the basic philosophy of the
Study.
In this regard, the group cites
specific assumptions taken by the
Study which state the idea of th
student setting forth his own edu
cational plants; all from the first
volume of the SES report:
"The word 'education' comes
from the Latin verb educare
meaning 'to lead forth.' To lead
does not mean to compel, or to
push, or to pull."
". . . education must be the
concern of the student himself,
self-willed and in a large measure
self-directed."
"Faculty determination of
what will be made goes
completely against the idea of a
'self-willed' or 'self-directed' edu
cation," according to Michael
Weinstein.
As for the joint committee to
act on the Study's ideas, any such
body would have to established
by the Academic Senate.
