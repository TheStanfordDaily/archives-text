# Library Chief To Go To Yale
## 
### 
Rutherford D. Rogers, director
of University libraries at Stanford
since 1964, has been named librar
ian of Yale University, effective
July 1.
His appointment was disclosed
by Yale President Kingman Brews
ter Jr. last month.
Former deputy librarian of the
Library of Congress, Rogers will
supervise a staff of more than 500
and a budget of approximately $6
million at Yale, which has about
5.4 million volumes in its collec
tions.
During the past four years at
Stanford, the University has
doubled its rate of library book
acquisitions and nearly tripled the
rate of cataloging. Rogers' staff
here totals about 275, with a
budget of $3.5 million. Total col
lections recently topped the three
million mark. The University's
combined library expenditures
last year were $5.7 million, more
than twice the level of 1962-63.
Tw.o years ago, Stanford
opened the new $5 million Meyer
Library for undergraduates. Last
month, the Board of Trustees
authorized a $20 million project
control budget for a major ex
pansion of the Main Library. The
basic configuration and much of
the detailed planning for this new
structure is now set.
