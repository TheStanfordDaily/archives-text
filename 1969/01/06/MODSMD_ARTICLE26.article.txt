# Pitzer Bans Athletic Events Against Segregated Schools
## 
### 
Stanford University athletic
teams will be operating under a
new policy in the future which
will preclude competition with
schools which practice racial dis
crimination.
The plicy was announced last
Thursday by President Kenneth
Pitzer just prior to a two game
basketball series with Brigham
Young amidst rumors of a sit-in
by the Black Student Union in the
Saturday's game which was seen
on national television.
The rumored sit-in never
materialized but Stanford basket
ball coach Howard Dallmar told
the two black members of the
school cage squad Don Griffin and
Bill Barber, that neither player
would be required to play in
either of the games if he did not
desire.
The two Stanford athletes
agreed to play starting in each
contest.
Griffin responded with 52
points in the two games with 33
in the second game paving the
way to a 94-78 victory.
In announcing the new policy
Dr. Pitzer requested the campus
Human Relations Commission,
headed by Prof. Byron Sher, to
consult with the Athletic Depart
ment and recommend how such a
policy may be implemented in the
University's future sports sched
ule.
Pitzer said, "Stanford expects
to honors its current contractual
commitments, but the University
also has an obligation to the black
community and others to re
examine how future scheduling of
athletic events can be carried out
within the context of Stanford's
commitment to the support of
human dignity and the equality of
education opportunity.
The new policy was announced

following a meeting with Black
Student Union co-chairman John
Powell and Nate Kirtman. The
two students described the dis
cussion as constructive in tone."
The Human Relations Commis
sion has nine members, including
Kirtman and three other students.
Brigham Young, a Mormon
University, has been the target of
black athlete protests because of
the Mormon Church's alleged rac
ial policies. The church operates
the University.
Late last year Birgham Young
was the center of a controversy
when seven black memb rs of the

San Jose State College football
team refused to play in the last
game of the season with the
school. Black members of the Uni
versity of Texas-El Paso track
team boycotted a meet with BYU
last spring.
Pitzer did not mention
Birgham Young University or any
other schools by name in his
announcement.
Pitzer has been President of the
University only a month since
leaving Rice University in Texas.
There he ended racial segregation
when he went to court to change
the school's admission policies.
