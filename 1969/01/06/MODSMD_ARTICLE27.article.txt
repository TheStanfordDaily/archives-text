# First Win In New Pavilion
## Indian Cagers Shock BYU 
### 
The pieces are beginning to fall
into place for the 1968-69 version
of the Stanford basketball team.
That much became evident Sat
urday afternoon, when Coach
Howie Dallmar's Indians routed
Brigham Young 94-78. It was a su
perlative team effort that turned
the trick, as the Stanford quintet
reversed a 95-89 BYU victory the
previous evening.
The twin bill marked the
opening of the spanking new three
million dollar Roscoe Maples
Pavilion. The attractive 8,000 seat
structure will house the Tribe for
the final eight home games of the
current season.
Senior guard Don Griffin, Stan
ford's most potent offensive
weapon throughout the young
season, tied a personal career
highwater mark of 33 points in
Saturday afternoon's nationally
televised game. Averaging nearly
23 points per game, the elusive
Griffin has moved up to 10th
place on the Indians' All-Time
scoring list.
Ballhandling, at times a sore
spot for the iS-ibe (4-7) in pre
vious contests, proved to be the
difference in the Saturday's
victory. Griffin complemented his

shooting with some excellent
passing, while sophomore Mike
Michel showed a great deal of
poise and deception in
contributing several assists. Of the
18 field goals Stanford made in
the second half, an incredible 14
of them were layups, the majority
of which were set up by excellent
passes.
•The Indians stormed to a 10-0
lead after three minutes of play,
and the Cougars hastily called
time out to regroup. But Stanford
maintained the whip hand
throughout the first half, going
into the locker room with a 43-34
edge.
Griffin funneled 16 points in
the half, while he and 6-7 junior
center Bill Palmer controlled the
back boards.
Palmer began to assert himself
offensively in the second stanza,
scoring 12 points from in close, 6
of them on beautiful reverse
layins. Ruffner continued to have
his troubles locating the
backboard, winding up with a
paltry three rebounds in the game.
Scott Warner, who replaced
Ruffner when he fouled out with
7:28 remaining, corralled four
caroms. Palmer was high man in

the game with 15 rebounds, and
added 16 points.
The Cougars closed to within
two points at 57-55, but layups
by Palmer and co-captain Mai
McElwain, plus a free thrfTW ny
Griffin, gave the Indianfc some
breathing room. With Palmer,
McElwain and Bill Halligan
scoring consistently inside, usually
on passes from Michel and Griffin,
the issue was never in doubt after
that.
Sweet Revenge
The victory was a sweet one
for the Indians, who had their
debut in the Maples Pavilion
spoiled Friday night when the
Cougars prevailed 95-89.
The Tribe grabbed an early
14-4 lead, but saw it dissipate be
fore halftime. With forward Karl
Liimo hitting an assortment of
drives and jumpers, the Cougars
took a 48-45 lead at the inter
mission.
Consecutive buckets by
McElwain, Griffin and Michel gave
the Cards a brief 51-50 edge in the
opening minutes of the second
half, but Lynn Parsons and Marty
Lythgoe grabbed the hot hand
and put the Cougars back in front
59-53.

several timely assists.

and matched his own career high of 33 points.
