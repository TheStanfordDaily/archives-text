# Washington Shines In Shrine Game
## 
### 
Stanford flanker Gene
Washington added to his growing
hardware collection 10 days ago
when he was awarded the William
M. Coffman Trophy as the Out
standing Offensive Player in the
East-West Shrine Game.
Washington caught seven passes
for 128 yards and one touchdown
to spark the West to an 18-7 upset
win. Gene also doubled as a kick
returner for Bob Davaney's West
squad.
Two other Stanford football
standouts, George Buehler and
Malcolm Snider, joined
Washington on the West
contingent. Buehler saw action on
both the offensive and defensive
lines, one of only three West per
formers to play both ways.
Snider, co-captain of the Tribe
eleven and a first team selection
on the Sporting News All-
American squad, played his
typical outstanding game at
offensive tackle.
The same three athletes re

presented Stanford in the Hula
Bowl Game, played last Saturday
in Honolulu. Washington, Snider
and Buehler performed for the
South team, which fell 13-7.
Though the passing game was
severely hampered by a field
which had turned into a literal
swamp after two days of
torrential rain, Washington
emerged as the game's leading re
ceiver. The South completed only
eight passes, and Gene caught
three of them for 56 yards. He
also worked his way into the clear
several times on long patterns, but
on each occasion was under
thrown or overthrown by USC's
Steve Sogge or Oklahoma State's
Ronnie Johnson.
All three men—Washington,
Snider and Buehler—are expected
to be tabbed early in the
combined NFL-AFL draft, which
will be held January 28. But
before that Washington will
compete in Saturday's Senior
Bowl Game in Mobile, Alabama.
