## Sequoia: Promising Hint 
### 
by GAIL ANDERSON, SUSAN
HUDGENS, & SCOTT DAVIS
The Autumn 1968 issue of
Sequoia is a promising hint that
creativity at Stanford may not be
dead. Honest and often interesting
perceptions frequently make up
for lack of sophistication, and a
sense of poetic feeling for an un
developed sense of poetic form.
Richard Kershner's prose
poem, "I can say I love you for
your blood. .." and his poem
"Elements of Death: The Snow
Man" alone would make the
magazine worthwhile. The first of
these combines perceptive images
with an original sense of poetic or
ganization and of how a poem
works: classicial allusion and a
simple three-part form combine
with pared-down perceptions to
produce a kind of mature balance
much student poetry lacks. He has
a gift for capturing aspirations in a
concise way: "You wanted to be a
boy so long you understood your
womanhood; when you found
you were a girl you aspired to be a
whore."
Ed McClanahan's short story,
"Generations Yet Unborn," de
monstrates the same kind of de
veloped coherence, along with the
outrageously stripped-down

humor which consistently delights
the reader of McClanahan's prose.
Bob Yaeger's "Worked the
fields . . . ." is simpler and less
pretentious than a good deal of
Sequoia poetry although some
what to the detriment of his
sophistication. He has an excellent
if not overly original control of
tone which is crucial to the be
lievability of his personality, an
old man working in the fields. But
his control of words is perhaps
too good, sounding often less like
a farm worker than like a literate
college student describing how a
farm worker thinks. He is a bit
too facile ("the truck was the fu
rnishing source of the shade") but
this is a problem the rest of the
poets in the volume could use a
little more of.
A few of the remaining poems,
however, reveal an abysmal ig
norance of form and a tiresome
predominance of self-indulgence
and self-description. "Sensa

tional" imagery oozes from every
line, and the rhymes and rhythms
have approximately the poetic
function of Mother Goose.
The poems combine attractive
perceptions often dulled by mis
handled expression or unexciting
form In what form exists, often
flashy and imposed on the
material rather than issuing from
it, words, rhythms, and allusions
tend to conflict with one another
and work against consistency.
Photographically Sequoia is
good but limited. In the final four
photographs form and light work
together to create simple but
powerful statements.
Unfortunately they are marred by
poor reproduction. The cover
photograph isstaged and dishonest;
the contrasting light fragments the
scene, already disjointed and con
fused. There is no excuse for re
peating the same figure (and
shortcomings) in the lead photo
graph.

HUDGENS, & SCOTT DAVIS
The Autumn 1968 issue of
Sequoia is a promising hint that
creativity at Stanford may not be
dead. Honest and often interesting
perceptions frequently make up
for lack of sophistication, and a
sense of poetic feeling for an un
developed sense of poetic form.
Richard Kershner's prose
poem, "I can say I love you for
your blood. .." and his poem
"Elements of Death: The Snow
Man" alone would make the
magazine worthwhile. The first of
these combines perceptive images
with an original sense of poetic or
ganization and of how a poem
works: classicial allusion and a
simple three-part form combine
with pared-down perceptions to
produce a kind of mature balance
much student poetry lacks. He has
a gift for capturing aspirations in a
concise way: "You wanted to be a
boy so long you understood your
womanhood; when you found
you were a girl you aspired to be a
whore."
Ed McClanahan's short story,
"Generations Yet Unborn," de
monstrates the same kind of de
veloped coherence, along with the
outrageously stripped-down

humor which consistently delights
the reader of McClanahan's prose.
Bob Yaeger's "Worked the
fields . . . ." is simpler and less
pretentious than a good deal of
Sequoia poetry although some
what to the detriment of his
sophistication. He has an excellent
if not overly original control of
tone which is crucial to the be
lievability of his personality, an
old man working in the fields. But
his control of words is perhaps
too good, sounding often less like
a farm worker than like a literate
college student describing how a
farm worker thinks. He is a bit
too facile ("the truck was the fu
rnishing source of the shade") but
this is a problem the rest of the
poets in the volume could use a
little more of.
A few of the remaining poems,
however, reveal an abysmal ig
norance of form and a tiresome
predominance of self-indulgence
and self-description. "Sensa

tional" imagery oozes from every
line, and the rhymes and rhythms
have approximately the poetic
function of Mother Goose.
The poems combine attractive
perceptions often dulled by mis
handled expression or unexciting
form In what form exists, often
flashy and imposed on the
material rather than issuing from
it, words, rhythms, and allusions
tend to conflict with one another
and work against consistency.
Photographically Sequoia is
good but limited. In the final four
photographs form and light work
together to create simple but
powerful statements.
Unfortunately they are marred by
poor reproduction. The cover
photograph isstaged and dishonest;
the contrasting light fragments the
scene, already disjointed and con
fused. There is no excuse for re
peating the same figure (and
