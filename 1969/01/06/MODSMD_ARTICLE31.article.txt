# Stern Fire An Accident
## 
### 
The early morning fire which
caused $125,000 damage to the
Donner Lounge of Stern Hall
December 9 has been diagnosed as
apparently accidental according to
Santa Clara County Fire Marshal
Bruce Wiggins.
Investigators have traced the
fire's starting point to the north
east corner of the lounge where a
wooden bookcase held a student
installed electrical appliance.
Meltallic remains of the appli
cance are being studied in the
sheriff's department crime labora
tory to determine whether faulty
wiring was the cause.
Said Wiggins, we have virtually
ruled out an incendiary cause be
cause lab analysis so far shows no
trace of a physical or chemical
substance in the debris."
Stanford fire chief John
Marston said when the fire started
in the bookcase, the fire spread up
the wooden shelves into the false
wooden ceiling which was install
ed when the lounge was redecora- i
ted a few years ago.
The fire burned through the
wood and paneling, dropping the
entire ceiling into the room and
warping the steel girders which
support the roof. This engulfed
the whole room, which was fitted
with rugs and furniture covered
with synthesic material.
At this point Marston theo
rizes, the noise of the fire awoke
students in an adjacent wing, one
of whom sounded the 5:49 fire
alarm which brought the firemen ;
within three minutes.
