# Faculty OK's Increased Pass-Fail
## 
### 
A liberalized policy at the Graduate School of Business will eh- «
able second-year students to take more than half their courses on a
pass-fail basis, effective with winter quarter 1969.
Approved at a recent faculty meeting, the new policy represents
substantial enlargement of a policy which since September 1967
permitted the students to take one ungraded course per quarter. It
will have little or no effect on first-year students who normally take
a study load consisting entirely of required courses.
Last year, 83 percent of the Business School students took one or
more ungraded courses, according to William Hannemann, dean of
student affairs. The main intent of the faculty action, said Hanne
mann, is to give the student greater control ove;his education by
encouraging him to follow his special interests.
At present, students are required to complete 48 units during
their second year in order to graduate. Of the total,, 20 units must be
taken in designated courses, and the balance are electives. The pa£s
fail electives may be taken in or out of the Business School but
approval by the course instructor is necessary in either case.
