# Packard's Defense Post
## A 						Trustee Goes To Washington 
### PHILIP TAUBMAN 
Stanford Trustee David Pack
ard, co-founder of an electronics
empire based in Palo Alto and
among the twenty richest men in
America, is headed for Washing
ton D.C., nominated as Deputy
Secretary of Defense.
Congress willing, Packard will
become number two man in the
Pentagon, sharing defense admin
istration and planning with De
fense Secretary-designate Melvin
Laird.
Packard leaves behind in Palo
Alto a business the Hewlett-
Packard Co., that markets more
than $280 million in electronic
measuring devices each year, a
yearly salary in excess of
$125,000, stock worth $300
million, and annual stock divi
dends amount to three quarters of
a million dollars.
He also leaves the Stanford
Board of Trustees searching for a
replacement under pressure from
students to involve students and
faculty in the selection process, if
not to name a student or faculty
member to the Board itself.
Hayes Discusses
Immediately following an
nouncement of Packard's appoint
ment, Denis Hayes, student body
president, and Yale Braunstein,

speaker of the student legislature,
discussed with President Kenneth
Pitzer the idea of finding a stu
dent to replace Packard. Hayes
concurrently contacted Board
President William Parmer Fuller
111, asking that the issue be dis
cussed at the next trustee meet
ing, scheduled for January 14.
Hayes followed his conversa
tion with a letter to the board
president, formally requesting
that four students be invited to
the Trustee meeting to argue the
case both for student and faculty
participation in the search for a
new Trustee as well as the broader
question of student and faculty
membership on the board.
Fuller replied negatively, in
forming Hayes that the agenda for
the Trustee meeting concerned
long range budget matters and,
therefore, this was not the proper
time to discuss selection of a new
Trustee. Pitzer agreed.
Pitzer and Fuller have assured
Hayes that the question will not
be dropped, specifically proposing
that Hayes pursue the matter in
the University Advisory Commit
tee which will probably be estab
lished at the January meeting.
Committee story.)
Fuller Comments
Contacted by The Daily, Fuller
commented, "I think the Board

really hasn't come to grips with
the question of student member
ship on the Board. I doubt there
will be one in the immediate
future, but there may be a faculty
member from another institution,
as the Stanford chapter of the As
sociation of American University
Professors (AAUP) suggested."
Fuller further noted, "The
Trustee Committee on Nomina
tions is not scheduled to meet be
fore the January Board meeting.
It could make recommendations
in February so that, with a month
for deliberation, the first possible
date for selection of a new trustee
is the March meeting, and that's
not a lead pipe cinch."
In a statement issued last week,
Hayes stated, "I emphasized to
Mr. Fuller that this opportunity
to break the homogeniety of the
Board must not be missed, I also
said that the trustee nominating
committee must contain students
and faculty.
Freeze-Out Wake
"In the wake of the President
ial selection freeze-out several
Trustees expressed their regret
that students had not been in
cluded in the selection process.
These statements were followed
by the usual liberal calls for an in
crease in effective student partici
pation.

"The January trustee's meeting
should see the moment of truth."
In light of responses from Ful
ler and Pitzer, Hayes is presently
considering his next move, samp
ling student opinion to see if there
is strong support for pushing the
issue with the trustees.
In an interview last week, Pack
ard said, "I don't see anything
wrong with a student on the nom
inating committee. In fact I think
it would be very helpful. There's
no question that the Board hasn't
kept up with student concerns."
Packard Progressive
As a Trustee, Packard built a
reputation as a progressive Trustee
by supporting liberal changes in
the University such as coeduca
tional housing and appearing at
the Old Union sit-in last May, the
only Trustee or top rank adminis
trator to enter the building and
talk with students.
Packard's style as a business ad
ministrator accentuates informal
ity and self-confidence. First
names are used by all employees
at Hewlett-Packard, plush offices
do not exist, no rigid hierarchies
are set, and Packard runs a non
union plant believing, according
to one of his top executives, "that
need for a union is simply another
way of saying there's bad manage
ment."
