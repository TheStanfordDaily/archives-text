# SES Calls For Variation In Undergrad Admission Categories
## 
### 
"Just as there should be many
ways to 'get an education' at
Stanford, so should there be many
ways to be admitted to Stanford"
says the latest report of the Study
of Education at Stanford (SES).
The report, Undergraduate Ad
missions and Financial Aid, is the
first comprehensive review of
admissions policy in at least ten
years.
Selection of students should be
done "within many separate and
distinct . . . categories," the SES
steering Committee recommends.
"An applicant demonstrating
competitive excellence in one area
should be accepted without re
ference to his position in other
categories."

It suggests that a Committee
on Admissions and Financial Aid,
including both students and
faculty members, become "the
primary policy making body" for
admissions. Its responsibilities
would include defining several
different admissions categories,
allocating them among each
entering class, and constantly
evaluating the results.
Recruiting Council
It also recommends formation
of a new Recruiting Council to
give students, faculty, and recent
alumni "increased responsibility
for eliciting a wide range of appli
cants," especially those from
minority groups. While most
people believe Stanford has a

single admissions standard, in
practice there already are
variations for alumni, faculty and
staff children, disadvantaged
minority students, and others.
The committee's re
commendations would make these
variations more explicit, create
new categories, and provide a sub
stantially improved means of
evaluating the effectiveness of
several different admissions
criteria. The image of "the
Stanford student" tends to be
self-fulfilling, the Committee
notes, because applicants tend to
come from those who fit the
image—or think they do.
"If a student body must have a
unitary image, Stanford's is a
good one," the committee adds.
"To it, and to the unstinting
efforts of our admissions officers,
belongs the credit for the ex
ceptionally high academic quality
of our applicant(s) ... To fit the
image, the single trait of academic
excellent must be buttressed by a
variety of skills and accomplish
ments in other areas (such as)
student government, athletics,
dramatics, or debating.
Ail-Around Stereotype
"There is nothing inhereAly
distressing about this notion. In
practice, however, this results in
the 'all-around' stereotype, the
essence of which is that one must
be everything simultaneously.

"We think that this aspect of
our students' image is both
strongly operative and strongly
undesirable. It is not true that one
must be 'all-around' to be
accepted at Stanford. This image,
however, discourages potential
applicants."
The main body of the report
was prepared by a "topic"
committee headed by Humanities
Professor William Clebsch. The
topic committee was composed of
students, faculty and admini
strators.
The Clebsch committee re
commends that "no single set of
selection criteria be applied to all
applicants that meet certain
minimal standards."
Four Categories
Instead, it suggests that
prospective students with a
reasonable chance of success at
Stanford be considered in four
separate categories: 50 percent
chosen on the basis of academic
competition; 20 percent on the
basis of special talents, evenly
divided among fine arts, science,
athletics, and community service
or public affairs; 20 percent on
the basis of all-around excellence;
and 10 percent by
selection among those meeting
minimum entrance requirements. .
The report criticizes Stanford's
present practice of using sex as a
criterion for selection as
"anachronistic and arbitrary." It
recommends that the proportion
of males enrolled be between 60
*•*

and 75 percent —with an
immediate shift to perhaps 33 per
cent females admitted, instead of
the present level of 27 percent.
It also suggests that
undergraduate transfer students
meet at least the same standards
as freshmen for admission and
have similar housing opportunities
on campus. This probably would
reduce the number of transfers ad
mitted by 50 percent or more
from the present level of 250 to
375 annually.
Menlo College
In the past many transfer
students have entered Stanford
from Menlo College in Menlo P
ark. Criticism has been directed
toward the admissions office for
this.
The Clebsch committee joins
the criticism saying, "Students
from Menlo College had an
average GPA for the years
1964-67 of 2.34. This latter figure
is by far the lowest figure we have
ever observed for any group of
students, no matterhow defined."
The average GPA for all transfer
students is around 2.8.
Financial aid grants should be
concentrated mostly on freshman
students, the report recommends.
Minority group students and those
of "outstanding merit," not to ex
ceed 5 to 10 percent of all those
admitted, would have priority on
grants sufficient to cover all costs
beyond those borne by their
families.
New Ranking
Remaining financial aid funds
would be offered applicants
"ranked in order by established
admissions procedures, without
regard for financial need."
Students in this group would be
offered a combination of grants,
jobs, and loans up to $400 or
$500 per year to meet costs be
yond those borne by their
families.
At present, about one-third the
entering class has their need met
by grants alone. Under the new
proposal, students below the top
5 to 10 percent would be treated
equally. "Such differences as may
exist (in academic promise below
this level) are only accentuated if
the less able students must work
while the more able do not," the
report notes.
The University should try to
establish a long-term, low-interest
loan fund available to all students
and give higher budget priority to
undergraduate financial aid, so
budgets for this purpose can be
guaranteed for several years, the
report says.
Besides Clebsch, committee
members include William
Alexander, Norton Batkin, John
Black, Merrill Carlsmith, Bernard
Cohen, Julia Hirsch, Lincoln
Moses, John Mothershed,
Clarkson Oglesby, Michael
Roberts, Robert Rosenzweig, and
Sandra Shapiro.
The Academic Senate will be
meeting the rest of this year to
consider this and other SES re
ports.

of Education at Stanford (SES).
The report, Undergraduate Ad
missions and Financial Aid, is the
first comprehensive review of
admissions policy in at least ten
years.
Selection of students should be
done "within many separate and
distinct . . . categories," the SES
steering Committee recommends.
"An applicant demonstrating
competitive excellence in one area
should be accepted without re
ference to his position in other
categories."

It suggests that a Committee
on Admissions and Financial Aid,
including both students and
faculty members, become "the
primary policy making body" for
admissions. Its responsibilities
would include defining several
different admissions categories,
allocating them among each
entering class, and constantly
evaluating the results.
Recruiting Council
It also recommends formation
of a new Recruiting Council to
give students, faculty, and recent
alumni "increased responsibility
for eliciting a wide range of appli
cants," especially those from
minority groups. While most
people believe Stanford has a

single admissions standard, in
practice there already are
variations for alumni, faculty and
staff children, disadvantaged
minority students, and others.
The committee's re
commendations would make these
variations more explicit, create
new categories, and provide a sub
stantially improved means of
evaluating the effectiveness of
several different admissions
criteria. The image of "the
Stanford student" tends to be
self-fulfilling, the Committee
notes, because applicants tend to
come from those who fit the
image—or think they do.
"If a student body must have a
unitary image, Stanford's is a
good one," the committee adds.
"To it, and to the unstinting
efforts of our admissions officers,
belongs the credit for the ex
ceptionally high academic quality
of our applicant(s) ... To fit the
image, the single trait of academic
excellent must be buttressed by a
variety of skills and accomplish
ments in other areas (such as)
student government, athletics,
dramatics, or debating.
Ail-Around Stereotype
"There is nothing inhereAly
distressing about this notion. In
practice, however, this results in
the 'all-around' stereotype, the
essence of which is that one must
be everything simultaneously.

"We think that this aspect of
our students' image is both
strongly operative and strongly
undesirable. It is not true that one
must be 'all-around' to be
accepted at Stanford. This image,
however, discourages potential
applicants."
The main body of the report
was prepared by a "topic"
committee headed by Humanities
Professor William Clebsch. The
topic committee was composed of
students, faculty and admini
strators.
The Clebsch committee re
commends that "no single set of
selection criteria be applied to all
applicants that meet certain
minimal standards."
Four Categories
Instead, it suggests that
prospective students with a
reasonable chance of success at
Stanford be considered in four
separate categories: 50 percent
chosen on the basis of academic
competition; 20 percent on the
basis of special talents, evenly
divided among fine arts, science,
athletics, and community service
or public affairs; 20 percent on
the basis of all-around excellence;
and 10 percent by
selection among those meeting
minimum entrance requirements. .
The report criticizes Stanford's
present practice of using sex as a
criterion for selection as
"anachronistic and arbitrary." It
recommends that the proportion
of males enrolled be between 60
*•*

and 75 percent —with an
immediate shift to perhaps 33 per
cent females admitted, instead of
the present level of 27 percent.
It also suggests that
undergraduate transfer students
meet at least the same standards
as freshmen for admission and
have similar housing opportunities
on campus. This probably would
reduce the number of transfers ad
mitted by 50 percent or more
from the present level of 250 to
375 annually.
Menlo College
In the past many transfer
students have entered Stanford
from Menlo College in Menlo P
ark. Criticism has been directed
toward the admissions office for
this.
The Clebsch committee joins
the criticism saying, "Students
from Menlo College had an
average GPA for the years
1964-67 of 2.34. This latter figure
is by far the lowest figure we have
ever observed for any group of
students, no matterhow defined."
The average GPA for all transfer
students is around 2.8.
Financial aid grants should be
concentrated mostly on freshman
students, the report recommends.
Minority group students and those
of "outstanding merit," not to ex
ceed 5 to 10 percent of all those
admitted, would have priority on
grants sufficient to cover all costs
beyond those borne by their
families.
New Ranking
Remaining financial aid funds
would be offered applicants
"ranked in order by established
admissions procedures, without
regard for financial need."
Students in this group would be
offered a combination of grants,
jobs, and loans up to $400 or
$500 per year to meet costs be
yond those borne by their
families.
At present, about one-third the
entering class has their need met
by grants alone. Under the new
proposal, students below the top
5 to 10 percent would be treated
equally. "Such differences as may
exist (in academic promise below
this level) are only accentuated if
the less able students must work
while the more able do not," the
report notes.
The University should try to
establish a long-term, low-interest
loan fund available to all students
and give higher budget priority to
undergraduate financial aid, so
budgets for this purpose can be
guaranteed for several years, the
report says.
Besides Clebsch, committee
members include William
Alexander, Norton Batkin, John
Black, Merrill Carlsmith, Bernard
Cohen, Julia Hirsch, Lincoln
Moses, John Mothershed,
Clarkson Oglesby, Michael
Roberts, Robert Rosenzweig, and
Sandra Shapiro.
The Academic Senate will be
meeting the rest of this year to
consider this and other SES re
ports.

done "within many separate and
distinct . . . categories," the SES
steering Committee recommends.
"An applicant demonstrating
competitive excellence in one area
should be accepted without re
ference to his position in other
categories."

It suggests that a Committee
on Admissions and Financial Aid,
including both students and
faculty members, become "the
primary policy making body" for
admissions. Its responsibilities
would include defining several
different admissions categories,
allocating them among each
entering class, and constantly
evaluating the results.
Recruiting Council
It also recommends formation
of a new Recruiting Council to
give students, faculty, and recent
alumni "increased responsibility
for eliciting a wide range of appli
cants," especially those from
minority groups. While most
people believe Stanford has a

single admissions standard, in
practice there already are
variations for alumni, faculty and
staff children, disadvantaged
minority students, and others.
The committee's re
commendations would make these
variations more explicit, create
new categories, and provide a sub
stantially improved means of
evaluating the effectiveness of
several different admissions
criteria. The image of "the
Stanford student" tends to be
self-fulfilling, the Committee
notes, because applicants tend to
come from those who fit the
image—or think they do.
"If a student body must have a
unitary image, Stanford's is a
good one," the committee adds.
"To it, and to the unstinting
efforts of our admissions officers,
belongs the credit for the ex
ceptionally high academic quality
of our applicant(s) ... To fit the
image, the single trait of academic
excellent must be buttressed by a
variety of skills and accomplish
ments in other areas (such as)
student government, athletics,
dramatics, or debating.
Ail-Around Stereotype
"There is nothing inhereAly
distressing about this notion. In
practice, however, this results in
the 'all-around' stereotype, the
essence of which is that one must
be everything simultaneously.

"We think that this aspect of
our students' image is both
strongly operative and strongly
undesirable. It is not true that one
must be 'all-around' to be
accepted at Stanford. This image,
however, discourages potential
applicants."
The main body of the report
was prepared by a "topic"
committee headed by Humanities
Professor William Clebsch. The
topic committee was composed of
students, faculty and admini
strators.
The Clebsch committee re
commends that "no single set of
selection criteria be applied to all
applicants that meet certain
minimal standards."
Four Categories
Instead, it suggests that
prospective students with a
reasonable chance of success at
Stanford be considered in four
separate categories: 50 percent
chosen on the basis of academic
competition; 20 percent on the
basis of special talents, evenly
divided among fine arts, science,
athletics, and community service
or public affairs; 20 percent on
the basis of all-around excellence;
and 10 percent by
selection among those meeting
minimum entrance requirements. .
The report criticizes Stanford's
present practice of using sex as a
criterion for selection as
"anachronistic and arbitrary." It
recommends that the proportion
of males enrolled be between 60
*•*

and 75 percent —with an
immediate shift to perhaps 33 per
cent females admitted, instead of
the present level of 27 percent.
It also suggests that
undergraduate transfer students
meet at least the same standards
as freshmen for admission and
have similar housing opportunities
on campus. This probably would
reduce the number of transfers ad
mitted by 50 percent or more
from the present level of 250 to
375 annually.
Menlo College
In the past many transfer
students have entered Stanford
from Menlo College in Menlo P
ark. Criticism has been directed
toward the admissions office for
this.
The Clebsch committee joins
the criticism saying, "Students
from Menlo College had an
average GPA for the years
1964-67 of 2.34. This latter figure
is by far the lowest figure we have
ever observed for any group of
students, no matterhow defined."
The average GPA for all transfer
students is around 2.8.
Financial aid grants should be
concentrated mostly on freshman
students, the report recommends.
Minority group students and those
of "outstanding merit," not to ex
ceed 5 to 10 percent of all those
admitted, would have priority on
grants sufficient to cover all costs
beyond those borne by their
families.
New Ranking
Remaining financial aid funds
would be offered applicants
"ranked in order by established
admissions procedures, without
regard for financial need."
Students in this group would be
offered a combination of grants,
jobs, and loans up to $400 or
$500 per year to meet costs be
yond those borne by their
families.
At present, about one-third the
entering class has their need met
by grants alone. Under the new
proposal, students below the top
5 to 10 percent would be treated
equally. "Such differences as may
exist (in academic promise below
this level) are only accentuated if
the less able students must work
while the more able do not," the
report notes.
The University should try to
establish a long-term, low-interest
loan fund available to all students
and give higher budget priority to
undergraduate financial aid, so
budgets for this purpose can be
guaranteed for several years, the
report says.
Besides Clebsch, committee
members include William
Alexander, Norton Batkin, John
Black, Merrill Carlsmith, Bernard
Cohen, Julia Hirsch, Lincoln
Moses, John Mothershed,
Clarkson Oglesby, Michael
Roberts, Robert Rosenzweig, and
Sandra Shapiro.
The Academic Senate will be
meeting the rest of this year to
consider this and other SES re
ports.
