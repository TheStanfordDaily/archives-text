# Crises May Reignite On Area Campuses
## 
### 
Stanford appears to be in the
eye of the student power hurri
cane in the Bay Area. Crisis con
ditions prevail at at least three
colleges, San Francisco State, San
Jose State, and the College of San
Mateo.
The latter campus is still suffer
ing from repercussions from an
outbreak of violence following a
rally of minority students at the
San Mateo campus. In the after
math of the violence Bob Hoover,
the black director of the Readi
ness Program, serving minority
students, was fired from his post.
Students- and others have pro
tested the firing.
Over the weekend a plan was
proposed to have Hoover, in
effect, remain in charge of all min
ority programs in the College of
San Mateo district. The plan was
apparently proposed by Stanford
Trustee and Deputy Secretary of
Defense-designate David Packard.
Packard, who serves on the
board of the local Urban Coali
tion, also arranged for the Coali
tion to grant the Readiness Pro
gram $25,000 to help finance the
program which has run into fin
ancial troubles.
Meanwhile, San Francisco
1 State College, its acting president
quoting Abraham Lincoln as he

—- H
pounded stakes on warning signs,
braced for Monday's scheduled re
opening after a three-week layoff.
Dr. S. I. Hayakawa, whose ap
pointment Nov. 26 preceded two
chaotic weeks in which the cam
pus remained open under police
protection, announced over the
weekend a ban on rallies in the
central campus area.
But he set aside the athletic
field for rallies by permit.
A threatened faculty strike at
San Jose State College originally
scheduled for today has been
postponed until Wednesday, a
spokesman for the American
Federation of TEachers (AFT) has
announced.
Prof. E. E. Rutherford, presi
dent of the AFT Local 1362 at
San Jose State, said members of
his chapter will spend Monday
and Tuesday manning the picket
lines at embattled San Francisco
State College.
If college trustees do not begin
negotiations on AFT demands,
Rutherford said, unionized profes
sors will strike San Jose State be
ginning Wednesday.

Packard and partner William
Hewlett, also a Stanford Trustee,
built a garage workshop and idea
for improving audio oscillators in
1939, into an electronics comp
any with world-wide offices and
manufacturing plants.

ing from repercussions from an
outbreak of violence following a
rally of minority students at the
San Mateo campus. In the after
math of the violence Bob Hoover,
the black director of the Readi
ness Program, serving minority
students, was fired from his post.
Students- and others have pro
tested the firing.
Over the weekend a plan was
proposed to have Hoover, in
effect, remain in charge of all min
ority programs in the College of
San Mateo district. The plan was
apparently proposed by Stanford
Trustee and Deputy Secretary of
Defense-designate David Packard.
Packard, who serves on the
board of the local Urban Coali
tion, also arranged for the Coali
tion to grant the Readiness Pro
gram $25,000 to help finance the
program which has run into fin
ancial troubles.
Meanwhile, San Francisco
1 State College, its acting president

pounded stakes on warning signs,
braced for Monday's scheduled re
opening after a three-week layoff.
Dr. S. I. Hayakawa, whose ap
pointment Nov. 26 preceded two
chaotic weeks in which the cam
pus remained open under police
protection, announced over the
weekend a ban on rallies in the
central campus area.
But he set aside the athletic
field for rallies by permit.
A threatened faculty strike at
San Jose State College originally
scheduled for today has been
postponed until Wednesday, a
spokesman for the American
Federation of TEachers (AFT) has
announced.
Prof. E. E. Rutherford, presi
dent of the AFT Local 1362 at
San Jose State, said members of
his chapter will spend Monday
and Tuesday manning the picket
lines at embattled San Francisco
State College.
If college trustees do not begin
negotiations on AFT demands,
Rutherford said, unionized profes
sors will strike San Jose State be
ginning Wednesday.

Packard and partner William
Hewlett, also a Stanford Trustee,
built a garage workshop and idea
for improving audio oscillators in
1939, into an electronics comp
any with world-wide offices and
manufacturing plants.
