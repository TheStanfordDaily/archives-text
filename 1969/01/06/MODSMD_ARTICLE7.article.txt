# Evil Flu Bug May Strike Students

If you have not yet had the flu, there is a five to ten percent
chance you might have it soon.
Dr. James McClenahan of Cowell Health Center says,"I don't
know that we'll be having an epidemic, but it is about time that we
should see some Hong Kong. Students have been going home. When
everybody gets back on campus, everyone will have had it, or it will
be just about ready to break. We don't anticipate anything alarming,
though."
Nationwide, the flu has been alarming, causing 3,594 deaths in
four weeks. McClenahan points out, however, "It is severe only for
older folks. In students it's uncomfortable, but they need not be
unduly concerned about it. It's like having a bad cold for a week."
There are many different symptoms for the many different types
of flu. A runny nose, sore throat and cough characterize respiratory
flu. Gastro-intestinal (GI) flu causes nausea, vomiting and diarrhea.
These last only one or two days, while the Hong Kong flu, symptom
ized by fever and that ache-all-over feeling, is more severe and lasts
four to six days.
Dr. McClenahan described Hong Kong flu as "bronchitis without
pneumonia, but not life-threatening for students because they gen
erally have no complications."
The only possible measure to take against flu is a 90 percent
successful vaccine. The vaccine was not available in large enough
quantities at the Health Center to do any mass immunization. Doc
tors used the little they had on people known to have some chronic
illness such as heart trouble or diabetes.
For those who do not get the vaccine and do get the flu, Dr.
McClenahan recommends, "Drink fluids. Get plenty of rest. And
take aspirin. Aspirin relieves fever and aches."
Some flu sufferers were thankful for the disease. It helped one
girl lose weight, and for another "it was very convenient to get it
during finals."
Colleges around the country are having flu problems, many clos
ing for Christmas vacation early and opening late. The University of
Florida is having the worst problems, though.
About 1,000 students will wear surgical masks around the campus
to combat the Hong Kong flu. The masks are "to filter germs carried
by airborne droplets of saliva." The masks, covering the mouth and
nose, interfere with eating, smoking and kissing, but the health
director hopes the students will cooperate. Many will probably
prefer the flu.
