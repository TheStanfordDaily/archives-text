A few students were so busy studying last quarter that
they missed our dead week edition. For them, still wonder
ing why we look so different these days, an explanation is
due.
We have joined many other leading campus newspapers
at major campuses in switching from the traditional hot
type method of typesetting and composition to the more
modern and, we hope, less expensive cold type process.
In the hot type process letters are cast on slugs of lead
that are then composited to form the pages. In cold type a
computerized typewriter justifies the copy which is then
pasted onto the page.
The main motivation for the changeover is money. Al
though our former compositor was very cooperative with
us, we did not believe we could afford to stay there. And
the estimates for the cpld type process predict that in the
long run we may be saving money that can be diverted into
programs that will bring better news coverage, both on
campus and in surrounding communities. The savings may
lead to more pages in each paper, more supplements, and
consequently better coverage of the campus scene.
