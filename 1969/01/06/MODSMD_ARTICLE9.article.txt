The ten reports of the Study of Education at Stanford
will all be published this quarter. The report on "The
Study and Its Purposes," "Undergraduate Education,"
"University Residences and Campus Life" appeared last
quarter. Today's Daily has the report on the study of
undergraduate admissions and financial aid.
These reports are the culmination of a two-year study

of the University by professors, students, and administra
tors, and they contain recommendations to the Academic
Senate that will affect almost every student-graduate and
undergraduate.
These reports are slated to go before the Academic Sen
ate for discussion and enactment or rejection starting Feb.
13. The reports will be split into small groups of recom
mendations on similar topics.
It is especially important that the entire University
community be aware of the substance of these reports and
of the opinions of others concerning them if the Senate is
to decide wisely. This holds equally for the efforts of some
students to set up a community governing body especially
to consider the recommendations.
And so we encourage the contribution of reactions to
the Study's reports and methods from any member of the
community-students, faculty, staff, administrators, and
Trustees. The Daily will try to group together reactions to
reports and print as much of the campus opinion contri
buted to us as space permits.
The Study of Education reports will affect everyone,
and now is the time to study them, to talk about them,
and to write about them—before they are accepted or re
jected as University policy.
