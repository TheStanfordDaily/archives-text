# SES Admissions Report Continues Trends
## 
### SUSAN SWARD 
The recommendations of the Committee on
Admissions and Financial Aid of the Study of
Education at Stanford (SES) have been greeted
with guarded approval.
The report issued yesterday represents two
years of work by a committee chaired by
William Clebsch, head of the Humanities
Special Programs. In an interview with The
Daily Clebsch stressed the fact that "the report
is in no sense my report."
In discussing the purpose behind his sub
committee's efforts, Clebsch said the sub
committee was asked to make the sort of rec
ommendations that would be flexible and that
would create diversity within the University
student body.
"I think we have done what we were asked
to do," Clebsch said. "There are many ways of
going about admissions policies. We have pre
sented one way. Admittedly it is not the only
way."
Won't 'Tie Hands'
According to Clebsch, the recommendations
are not intended to tie the hands of the ad
missions staff. Instead they are intended to set
up certain established registers of admissions
standards. These registers would be formulated
by a faculty-student committee working under
the guidance of the admissions staff.
Clebsch went on to discuss a specific seg
ment of the recommendations that promises to
be one of the more controversial proposals.
Under this proposal, 10 percent of the entering
class of students would be selected "from the
random competition" for entrance.
This proposal "is, as a start, the only statis
tical way possible to set up a control group

which tests the validity of the admissions
policy. Without a control group, we can't know
if we are getting the diversity we want in the
applicant group," Clebsch noted.
Praise for Sr.yder
When questioned about Rixford Snyder, the
Director of Admissions who announced his re
tirement from that post last quarter, Clebsch
had strong words of priase for Snyder.
"As much as anyone at Stanford, Dean
Snyder is to be credited for the improvement of
the academic excellence of this University. I
personally regret that Snyder has chosen to
change the area of his devoted service to the
University."
Discussing the fact that the Academic Senate
must pass on the SES recommendations,
Clebsch said, "The Senate is a body in whom I
have great confidence as to its willingness to
change things that should be changed."
Admissions Officer
Sterling Huntley, as Director of Transfer
Admissions and Associate Director of the
Admissions Office, commented yesterday on
the latest SES report.
Huntley stated, "I want to emphasize that I
am personally favorable to the general intent of
the report, and my only objection is with some
of the report's proposed techniques."
Huntley maintains that the recommenda
tions concerning admissions and financial aid
represent a philosophy "that already exists or is
developing" within the University.
Reforms 'Not Radical'
"The important thing is that the philosophy
of these reforms is not radical and is developing
in the right direction," Huntley said.
Speaking of the proposal that minority re

cruiting be extended more extensively outside
of the state of California, Huntley noted, "Here
we come up against the practical limitations of
financial aid. Given greater financial aid re
sources, I'd certainly support increased recruit
ing outside of the state.
"Then we could crank up a more exciting,
imaginative recruiting program. For example,
we would get a Mexican-American student from
Arizona to do recruiting work for Stanford
among Mexican-Americans in Arizona."
Recommendations 'Supportive'
Robert Huff, the Director of Financial Aid,
echoed Huntley's opinion that the recommen
dations "are supportive of the direction in
which we have been attempting to go."
Huff said, "no drastic changes have been
proposed. The report is helpful because it
brings into clear focus some of the areas we
have been particularly concerned with."
"From my standpoint," Huff concluded,
"these are all basically good recommendations
that need to be looked at carefully by all parts
of the University. I don't see any great problem
in implementing these recommendations if all
the concerned areas of the University approve
them."
Norton Batkin 111 is one of the three stu
dents on the nine-member SES Steering Com
mittee. He also sat on the sub-committee on
admissions and financial aid.
Commenting on the committee's report,
Batkin said, "We have done our best to approxi
mate what we felt was neededâ€”to bring Stan
ford closer to the ideal of what a university
should be."
Batkin feels that much of the criticism
directed aginst the SES reports so far would

have been more accurate if Stanford were a
liberal arts college. Given the fact that it is a
university, Batkin feels SES has done as well as
it could.
"I don't know if the report emphasized a
drift that was already present," Batkin said. "A
better way to phrase it is that we have tried to
put into the administrative process an explicit
statement of what kind of entering students the
faculty and students need and want in terms of
specific talents."
Denis Hayes, ASSU President, who is well
versed on the many ramifications of the SES
reports said, "I am delighted with many aspects
of the Clebsch Committee's draft," Hayes
noted, "and my only major disappointment is
with the report's approach to minority ad
missions."
Hayes fells that "Black, Chicano and other
minority students have an invaluable role to
play in evaluating the applications the recruit
ing drive elicits. Minority group members are
able to evaluate their peers from a much more
valid point of view than can even the most
highly-trained, white, middle-class admissions
officer."
Hayes focused on the fact that "it will be
most unfortunate if this source of ethnic ex
pertise continues to go untapped."
When the reactions to the admissions and
financial aid report of various University
personalities are weighed, William Clebsch's
comments on the possible alumni reaction to
the report stands out. Clebsch said, "If I were
an alumnus, I would be very reluctant to see
change down on the farm. Change is not easy to
live with, but it is worse to live without it. In
the last analysis, change is life."

University."
Discussing the fact that the Academic Senate
must pass on the SES recommendations,
Clebsch said, "The Senate is a body in whom I
have great confidence as to its willingness to

Admissions Officer
Sterling Huntley, as Director of Transfer
Admissions and Associate Director of the
Admissions Office, commented yesterday on
the latest SES report.
Huntley stated, "I want to emphasize that I
am personally favorable to the general intent of
the report, and my only objection is with some
of the report's proposed techniques."
Huntley maintains that the recommenda
tions concerning admissions and financial aid
represent a philosophy "that already exists or is
developing" within the University.
Reforms 'Not Radical'
"The important thing is that the philosophy
of these reforms is not radical and is developing
in the right direction," Huntley said.
Speaking of the proposal that minority re

cruiting be extended more extensively outside
of the state of California, Huntley noted, "Here
we come up against the practical limitations of
financial aid. Given greater financial aid re
sources, I'd certainly support increased recruit
ing outside of the state.
"Then we could crank up a more exciting,
imaginative recruiting program. For example,
we would get a Mexican-American student from
Arizona to do recruiting work for Stanford
among Mexican-Americans in Arizona."
Recommendations 'Supportive'
Robert Huff, the Director of Financial Aid,
echoed Huntley's opinion that the recommen
dations "are supportive of the direction in
which we have been attempting to go."
Huff said, "no drastic changes have been
proposed. The report is helpful because it
brings into clear focus some of the areas we
have been particularly concerned with."
"From my standpoint," Huff concluded,
"these are all basically good recommendations
that need to be looked at carefully by all parts
of the University. I don't see any great problem
in implementing these recommendations if all
the concerned areas of the University approve
them."
Norton Batkin 111 is one of the three stu
dents on the nine-member SES Steering Com
mittee. He also sat on the sub-committee on
admissions and financial aid.
Commenting on the committee's report,
Batkin said, "We have done our best to approxi
mate what we felt was neededâ€”to bring Stan
ford closer to the ideal of what a university
should be."
Batkin feels that much of the criticism
directed aginst the SES reports so far would

have been more accurate if Stanford were a
liberal arts college. Given the fact that it is a
university, Batkin feels SES has done as well as
it could.
"I don't know if the report emphasized a
drift that was already present," Batkin said. "A
better way to phrase it is that we have tried to
put into the administrative process an explicit
statement of what kind of entering students the
faculty and students need and want in terms of
specific talents."
Denis Hayes, ASSU President, who is well
versed on the many ramifications of the SES
reports said, "I am delighted with many aspects
of the Clebsch Committee's draft," Hayes
noted, "and my only major disappointment is
with the report's approach to minority ad
missions."
Hayes fells that "Black, Chicano and other
minority students have an invaluable role to
play in evaluating the applications the recruit
ing drive elicits. Minority group members are
able to evaluate their peers from a much more
valid point of view than can even the most
highly-trained, white, middle-class admissions
officer."
Hayes focused on the fact that "it will be
most unfortunate if this source of ethnic ex
pertise continues to go untapped."
When the reactions to the admissions and
financial aid report of various University
personalities are weighed, William Clebsch's
comments on the possible alumni reaction to
the report stands out. Clebsch said, "If I were
an alumnus, I would be very reluctant to see
change down on the farm. Change is not easy to
live with, but it is worse to live without it. In
the last analysis, change is life."
The recommendations of the Committee on
Admissions and Financial Aid of the Study of
Education at Stanford (SES) have been greeted
with guarded approval.
The report issued yesterday represents two
years of work by a committee chaired by
William Clebsch, head of the Humanities
Special Programs. In an interview with The
Daily Clebsch stressed the fact that "the report
is in no sense my report."
In discussing the purpose behind his sub
committee's efforts, Clebsch said the sub
committee was asked to make the sort of rec
ommendations that would be flexible and that
would create diversity within the University
student body.
"I think we have done what we were asked
to do," Clebsch said. "There are many ways of
going about admissions policies. We have pre
sented one way. Admittedly it is not the only
way."
Won't 'Tie Hands'
According to Clebsch, the recommendations
are not intended to tie the hands of the ad
missions staff. Instead they are intended to set
up certain established registers of admissions
standards. These registers would be formulated
by a faculty-student committee working under
the guidance of the admissions staff.
Clebsch went on to discuss a specific seg
ment of the recommendations that promises to
be one of the more controversial proposals.
Under this proposal, 10 percent of the entering
class of students would be selected "from the
random competition" for entrance.
This proposal "is, as a start, the only statis
tical way possible to set up a control group

which tests the validity of the admissions
policy. Without a control group, we can't know
if we are getting the diversity we want in the
applicant group," Clebsch noted.

When questioned about Rixford Snyder, the
Director of Admissions who announced his re
tirement from that post last quarter, Clebsch
had strong words of priase for Snyder.

the concerned areas of the University approve
them."
Norton Batkin 111 is one of the three stu
dents on the nine-member SES Steering Com
mittee. He also sat on the sub-committee on
admissions and financial aid.
Commenting on the committee's report,
Batkin said, "We have done our best to approxi
mate what we felt was neededâ€”to bring Stan
ford closer to the ideal of what a university
should be."
Batkin feels that much of the criticism
directed aginst the SES reports so far would

have been more accurate if Stanford were a
liberal arts college. Given the fact that it is a
university, Batkin feels SES has done as well as
it could.
"I don't know if the report emphasized a
drift that was already present," Batkin said. "A
better way to phrase it is that we have tried to
put into the administrative process an explicit
statement of what kind of entering students the
faculty and students need and want in terms of
specific talents."
Denis Hayes, ASSU President, who is well
versed on the many ramifications of the SES
reports said, "I am delighted with many aspects
of the Clebsch Committee's draft," Hayes
noted, "and my only major disappointment is
with the report's approach to minority ad
missions."
Hayes fells that "Black, Chicano and other
minority students have an invaluable role to
play in evaluating the applications the recruit
ing drive elicits. Minority group members are
able to evaluate their peers from a much more
valid point of view than can even the most
highly-trained, white, middle-class admissions
officer."
Hayes focused on the fact that "it will be
most unfortunate if this source of ethnic ex
pertise continues to go untapped."
When the reactions to the admissions and
financial aid report of various University
personalities are weighed, William Clebsch's
comments on the possible alumni reaction to
the report stands out. Clebsch said, "If I were
an alumnus, I would be very reluctant to see
change down on the farm. Change is not easy to
live with, but it is worse to live without it. In
the last analysis, change is life."
The recommendations of the Committee on
Admissions and Financial Aid of the Study of
Education at Stanford (SES) have been greeted
with guarded approval.
The report issued yesterday represents two
years of work by a committee chaired by
William Clebsch, head of the Humanities
Special Programs. In an interview with The
Daily Clebsch stressed the fact that "the report
is in no sense my report."
In discussing the purpose behind his sub
committee's efforts, Clebsch said the sub
committee was asked to make the sort of rec
ommendations that would be flexible and that
would create diversity within the University
student body.
"I think we have done what we were asked
to do," Clebsch said. "There are many ways of
going about admissions policies. We have pre
sented one way. Admittedly it is not the only
way."
Won't 'Tie Hands'
According to Clebsch, the recommendations
are not intended to tie the hands of the ad
missions staff. Instead they are intended to set
up certain established registers of admissions
standards. These registers would be formulated
by a faculty-student committee working under
the guidance of the admissions staff.
Clebsch went on to discuss a specific seg
ment of the recommendations that promises to
be one of the more controversial proposals.
Under this proposal, 10 percent of the entering
class of students would be selected "from the
random competition" for entrance.
This proposal "is, as a start, the only statis
tical way possible to set up a control group

which tests the validity of the admissions
policy. Without a control group, we can't know
if we are getting the diversity we want in the
applicant group," Clebsch noted.
Praise for Sr.yder
When questioned about Rixford Snyder, the
Director of Admissions who announced his re
tirement from that post last quarter, Clebsch
had strong words of priase for Snyder.
"As much as anyone at Stanford, Dean
Snyder is to be credited for the improvement of
the academic excellence of this University. I
personally regret that Snyder has chosen to
change the area of his devoted service to the
University."
Discussing the fact that the Academic Senate
must pass on the SES recommendations,
Clebsch said, "The Senate is a body in whom I
have great confidence as to its willingness to
change things that should be changed."
Admissions Officer
Sterling Huntley, as Director of Transfer
Admissions and Associate Director of the
Admissions Office, commented yesterday on
the latest SES report.
Huntley stated, "I want to emphasize that I
am personally favorable to the general intent of
the report, and my only objection is with some
of the report's proposed techniques."
Huntley maintains that the recommenda
tions concerning admissions and financial aid
represent a philosophy "that already exists or is
developing" within the University.
Reforms 'Not Radical'
"The important thing is that the philosophy
of these reforms is not radical and is developing
in the right direction," Huntley said.
Speaking of the proposal that minority re

cruiting be extended more extensively outside
of the state of California, Huntley noted, "Here
we come up against the practical limitations of
financial aid. Given greater financial aid re
sources, I'd certainly support increased recruit
ing outside of the state.
"Then we could crank up a more exciting,
imaginative recruiting program. For example,
we would get a Mexican-American student from
Arizona to do recruiting work for Stanford
among Mexican-Americans in Arizona."
Recommendations 'Supportive'
Robert Huff, the Director of Financial Aid,
echoed Huntley's opinion that the recommen
dations "are supportive of the direction in
which we have been attempting to go."
Huff said, "no drastic changes have been
proposed. The report is helpful because it
brings into clear focus some of the areas we
have been particularly concerned with."
"From my standpoint," Huff concluded,
"these are all basically good recommendations
that need to be looked at carefully by all parts
of the University. I don't see any great problem
in implementing these recommendations if all
the concerned areas of the University approve
them."
