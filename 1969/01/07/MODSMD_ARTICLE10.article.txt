## Harvard Leftists Continue ROTC Protest 
### 
With the long awaited Stanford
Committee Report on ROTC to
be released by February 15,
ROTC programs on university
campuses across the country were
under fire this month at such
geographically diverse institutions
as Harvard, Pennsylvania and the
University of California at Santa
Barbara.

The situation has become most
serious at Harvard where more
than a hundred students refused
to leave the school's Paine Hall
Dec. 13 causing the cancellation
of a special faculty meeting to
discuss what Harvard should do
about the campus ROTC program.
The fate of ROTC has been in
question, as one student put it,
because of its aid to the U.S.
military. He continued that "they
(the faculty) are unwilling to
challenge ROTC's function
because in fact they support that
function."
The cancelled meeting which
had been called to consider the
role of ROTC on campus, and any
possible change which should be
made because of this role, has not
been rescheduled.
However the topic is expected
to be reconsidered today at a
regularly scheduled faculty
meeting.
The students, numbering nearly
150, all face disciplinary action
that could result in their severance
from the University.
The SED-led open meeting
which resulted in the sit-in pressed
four separate arguments in their
decision to take action against the
program.
The students maintained that:
•The faculty refuses to con
sider that the presence of the
program at Harvard signified the
University's support of the war in
Vietnam and other imperialist
actions in the U.S. armed forces.
•That there was no right to re
ceive training for warfare on the
University campus.
•That the faculty had no right
to make decisions concerning stu
dents without students being pres
ent.
•That if having gone this far
the group backed down under Ad
ministration pressure, radicals at
Harvard would be discredited and
the momentum built up in the
SDS anti-ROTC campaign would
be lost.

As a result of the sit-in the Ad
ministrative Board will be consid
ering the cases of the students
who are charged with "an offense
against law and order at the time
of a public disturbance."
Action has already been taken
at the University of Pennsylvania
where the school's undergraduate
College of Arts and Sciences has
withdrawn academic credit from
courses given by military science
departments.

ROTC's contract with univer
sities requires only "appropriate
academic credit be given." Under
the 'Track B' ROTC program 25
per cent of the courses counted in
the ROTC program are regular
faculty offerings. According to a
Pentagon spokesman this consti
tutes "Appropriate academic
credit."
Neither Pennsylvania or Har
vard at this time have a Track B
program. But ROTC presumably

has the option of instituting a
Track B program at Penn.
The faculty's decision to drop
credit is similar to the one stu
dents seek the faculty to come to
at Harvard.
The University of California at
Santa Barbara was the scene of
the most recent unrest with
$1,200 worth of damage having
been done to the headquarters of
the ROTC units.

With the long awaited Stanford
Committee Report on ROTC to
be released by February 15,
ROTC programs on university
campuses across the country were
under fire this month at such
geographically diverse institutions
as Harvard, Pennsylvania and the
University of California at Santa
Barbara.

The situation has become most
serious at Harvard where more
than a hundred students refused
to leave the school's Paine Hall
Dec. 13 causing the cancellation
of a special faculty meeting to
discuss what Harvard should do
about the campus ROTC program.
The fate of ROTC has been in
question, as one student put it,
because of its aid to the U.S.
military. He continued that "they
(the faculty) are unwilling to
challenge ROTC's function
because in fact they support that
function."
The cancelled meeting which
had been called to consider the
role of ROTC on campus, and any
possible change which should be
made because of this role, has not
been rescheduled.
However the topic is expected
to be reconsidered today at a
regularly scheduled faculty
meeting.
The students, numbering nearly
150, all face disciplinary action
that could result in their severance
from the University.
The SED-led open meeting
which resulted in the sit-in pressed
four separate arguments in their
decision to take action against the
program.
The students maintained that:
•The faculty refuses to con
sider that the presence of the
program at Harvard signified the
University's support of the war in
Vietnam and other imperialist
actions in the U.S. armed forces.
•That there was no right to re
ceive training for warfare on the
University campus.
•That the faculty had no right
to make decisions concerning stu
dents without students being pres
ent.
•That if having gone this far
the group backed down under Ad
ministration pressure, radicals at
Harvard would be discredited and
the momentum built up in the
SDS anti-ROTC campaign would
be lost.

As a result of the sit-in the Ad
ministrative Board will be consid
ering the cases of the students
who are charged with "an offense
against law and order at the time
of a public disturbance."
Action has already been taken
at the University of Pennsylvania
where the school's undergraduate
College of Arts and Sciences has
withdrawn academic credit from
courses given by military science
departments.

ROTC's contract with univer
sities requires only "appropriate
academic credit be given." Under
the 'Track B' ROTC program 25
per cent of the courses counted in
the ROTC program are regular
faculty offerings. According to a
Pentagon spokesman this consti
tutes "Appropriate academic
credit."
Neither Pennsylvania or Har
vard at this time have a Track B
program. But ROTC presumably

has the option of instituting a
Track B program at Penn.
The faculty's decision to drop
credit is similar to the one stu
dents seek the faculty to come to
at Harvard.
The University of California at
Santa Barbara was the scene of
the most recent unrest with
$1,200 worth of damage having
been done to the headquarters of
the ROTC units.
