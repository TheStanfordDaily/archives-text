# Brown Calls U.S. Reaction To Encyclical Encouraging
## 
### 
Roman Catholic reaction to
the Pope's anti-birth control en
cyclical is both surprising and en
couraging, according to Prof.
Robert McAfee Brown of Stan
ford.
The encyclical "will not prove
nearly as disastrous to world pop
ulation control as initially might
have been feared," he says."I was
very surprised and encouraged at
the degree of widespread ques
tioning of it within the Roman
Catholic Church.
"I had feared that most Roman
Catholics would lapse into quiet
despair but say nothing and do
nothing against it. I couldn't have
been more wrong."
Brown an ordained Presbyter
ian minister and professor of relig
ion at Stanford, is a well known
figure working to bring together
the world's Catholic and Protes
tant churches.
Few Lend Support
Although American Catholic
bishops expressed support of the
Pope's edict, they were the only
major national hierarchy to do so,
Prof. Brown notes. Many other
national episcopal conferences felt
that a Catholic couple using con
traceptives could do so "in good
conscience" and still remain good
Catholics.
"What is tragic is that where
birth control is so desperately
needed, as in Latin America, the
encyclical makes it so difficult to
reach the people," he adds.
The world's great social dil
emma, Prof. Brown told a Los
Angeles forum early this week, is
not between communism and
anti-communism, but between the
"have" and "have-not" nations.
The world's most advanced
nations, which are mostly white,
live "in lavish plenty," while the
underdeveloped nations, which
are mostly colored, live in desper
ate want.
Situation Worsening
If this imbalance is not correc
ted, it will lead to mass starvation,
hopeless despair and consequently
uncontrollable violence, he told
the meeting. And no matter what
we have done in the past decade,
the situation seems to be getting
worse instead of better, he ob
serves.
Ecumenism today, Prof. Brown
says, is not only concerned with

"intramural matters, but with the
whole family of man." These
problems cannot be met by
religious bodies individually but
require cooperation "across the
boardâ€”Protestants, Catholics,
Jews, and all men of good will."

"The churches have got to get
into the battle to bring political
pressure to bear on these prob
lems. One of these is the obliga
tion of the rich nations to help
the poor, to create opportunities
for them to help themselves.
