# Mexican-American
## New Administrator Sought 
### 
President Kenneth Pitzer dis
closed that students, faculty, and
administrators will jointly seek a
qualified Mexican-American to
join the provost's staff.
His disclosure followed private
discussions with leaders of the
Mexican-American Student Con
federation (MASC) and is part of
an effort to double enrollment of
students from minority groups
over a two-year period.
In November, MASC "strongly
requested" the University to ad
mit 100 new Mexican-Americans
during 1969-70. The confedera
tion includes 37 of Stanford's 57
Mexican-American students.
In their discussions with Pitzer,
Provost Richard Lyman, and
other University officers, Confed
eration Chairman Luis Nogales (a
third-year law student from Cal
exico) and other MASC represen
tatives agreed that the administra
tive appointment should be made
first because the person chosen
would be well placed in the Uni
versity to help in areas of critical
need, such as admissions. They
pointed out, however, that a
single individual cannot meet all
of the University's needs.
Mexican-American students al
ready are involved in admissions

work on a part-time basis, as are
members of the Stanford Black
Student Union (BSU). Their
efforts contributed significantly
to an increase in minority student
enrollment from an estimated 175
last year to 291 this fall.
According to James Simmons,
assistant provost for inter-group
relations, the tone of the meeting
was one of "mutual respect and
cordiality."
While details of the new admin
istrative position have not been
finally determined, the individual
selected will help provide policy

guidance in admissions, counsel
ing, and other relevant areas.
Following a student-faculty ad
missions study and Martin Luther
King's assassination last spring,
Stanford announced it would try
to double minority student enroll
ment to about 350 by 1969-70.
Nogales noted that "Mexican-
Americans are unlikely to identify
with the legal order and feel part
of the social institutions of the
whole society so long as (their)
participation ... in these institu
tions is so small as to be almost
invisible."
