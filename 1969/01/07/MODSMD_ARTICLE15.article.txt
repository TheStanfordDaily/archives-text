# Campbell Raps Liberals
## Profs Blamed For Disorders 
### 
The "single most important
problem" facing American higher
education today is "faculty
imbalance," according to Dr. W.
Glenn Campbell, director of the
Hoover Institution at Stanford.
A member of the University of
California Board of Regents,
Campbell feels that the dis
proportionate number of pro
fessors of what is sometimes
called the "liberal" persuasion has

helped to breed today's wide
spread campus disorder.
This includes both a small
minority of faculty who give
"active encouragement and or
ganizational aid" to radical
disrupters and to a larger group in
which there is "widespread
passivity and condonement of im
proper activity." Hoover
Institution director cautions that
he does not accuse all "liberals"
of aiding academic
insurrection.And he makes clear
his conviction that a good many
student grievances are fully
legiti m a t e —rang in g from
"depersonalization" of campus at
mosphere to the frequent absence
of star professors from the class
room.
Campbell notes that the answer
often given alumni who criticize
ideological imbalance on faculties
is to point to the alleged "cons
ervatism" of engineering and busi
ness departments. But the
faculties of the social sciences and
humanities are where the real
"indoctrination" is occurring, he
replies.
It is in these latter depart
ments, Campbell believes, that
"we need to have the case for
private enterprise and limited
government stated with the same
vigor as the case for big
government"

Campbell believes that the uni
versity belongs in the real world
and should not try to withdraw
from it. But, he suggests, it is the
individuals of the academic
world—not the institutions them
selves—who should be involved in
direct "social action programs."
If the universities insert them
selves too vigorously into the
processes of social change,
Campbell declares, they get stuck
"hip-deep in politics and are fair
game."
The Institution's director, a
regent for nearly a year, feels the
defeat of the $250 million state
higher educational bond issue at
the polls in November can be
attributed in large measure to a
majority's feeling that the Board
had not acted decisively enough
on the Eldridge Cleaver issue.
