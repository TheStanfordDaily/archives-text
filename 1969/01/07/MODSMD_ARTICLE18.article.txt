# Minority Program Begins
## 
### 
"Proven technical success" on
their jobs in industry in lieu of a
college bachelor's degree will en
able a limited number of young
minority group workers to enter
Stanford for study toward an ad
vanced degree in electrical
engineering.
Several promising young
candidates will be enrolled this
quarter to work for master's
degrees, it was announced by
Prof. John Linvill, chairman of
the Electrical Engineering Depart
ment.
Prof. James Gibbons, well
known solid state devices expert,
originated and organized the
experimental plan. Those enrolled
will continue in regular jobs with
time off for classes under the
"Gibbons Plan,'' as the
experiment is called. Their studies
will thus be part—time, allowing
them to take six units per quarter
instead of the normal 15 of
full—time students.
The plan is patterned after the
well established Honors Co

operative Program (HCP) in
engineering, under which more
than 600 working engineers now
take graduate instruction for
advanced degrees. As under HCP,
the employer will finance the
minority student's tuition and
costs to the University.
To facilitate the transition
from work to school, the
University also will provide special
tutors for the minority
students— up to 25 hours each per
week. And they also will receive
academic counseling from faculty
advisers.
The Gibbons Plan was
conceived after discussions by
electrical engineering faculty
members as to how the depart
ment's primary strength at the
graduate level could be applied to
a minority group program. A
departmental committee
composed of Gibbons, Dr. Alfred

Braun, and chaired by Prof.
Anthony Siegman has been
formed to recommend and
administer the educational
programs lor minority group
students.
"Graduate education, to at
least the master's degree level, is
the basic passpprt to responsible
technical positions and a
challenging professional career. If
our experimental program for
minority students in electrical en
gineering succeeds, it is my hope
that it may be extended into
other disciplines as well," said
Gibbons.
If the minority students were
accepted for graduate work at
Stanford, they would have to
meet the same high standards as
everyone else and maintain a "B"
average, Gibbons declared. Their
tutors and faculty advisers would
try to help them do this.

our experimental program for
minority students in electrical en

If the minority students were
accepted for graduate work at
Stanford, they would have to
meet the same high standards as
everyone else and maintain a "B"
average, Gibbons declared. Their
tutors and faculty advisers would
try to help them do this.
