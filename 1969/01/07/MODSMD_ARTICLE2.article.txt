# SF State Campus Reopens To Strike, Low Attendance
## 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO—CIasses re
opened at troubled San Francisco
State College yesterday in the face
of a strike by the school's local of
the American Federation of Teac
hers (AFT), with attendance
sharply below normal.
The strike, illegal early in the
day, received official sanction
from the executive board of the
San Francisco Labor Council in
the afternoon.
About 1,000 pickets, including
many students from other Bay
Area colleges, marched at all six
entrances to the school. Small
groups also moved on campus and
picketed most buildings, in viola
tion of an edict issued Sunday by
college president Samuel I. Haya
kawa.
No Major Incidents
Police and pickets faced each
other othe corner of 19th Street
and Holloway throughout the day
but, unlike previous confronta
tions, no major incidents
occurred.
Hayakawa decried the faculty
strike action. "A militant minor
ity of the faculty has hitch-hiked
onto the militant students' vio
lence-ridden strike for a vicious
power grab," he declared at an
afternoon press conference.
He was optimistic about the
campus situation, noting that this

was the first day since he took
over on December 2 that classes
proceeded without violence.
Attendance, which was low in
the morning, showed a steady in
crease throughout the day as more
students came back to school,
prompted by the relatively calm
atmosphere.
Pickets Not Disturbed
Hayakawa, wearing the blue
armband originally adopted by his
supporters, noted that he had not
taken any action against on
campus pickets because they re
mained quiet, and felt it would be
better not to disturb the tenuous
peace.
But despite the lack of trouble
yesterday, San Francisco State
may be facing bigger problems
than ever before now that the
AFT strike has been sanctioned.
When news of the approval
reached campus, cafeteria employ
ees-who are unionized—
immediately walked off their jobs.
And it is likely that truckers will
refuse to make any deliveries to
the beleaguered institution.
Keep School Open
"I don't know how I am going
to stop them from closing the
school," Hayakawa said, "but I
am going to try. I am not going to
accept it closed by anybody."

When asked what students
would do without food services,
the noted semanticist commented,
"They can bring sandwiches the
way I did."
Hayakawa refused to comment
on what may happen today,
adopting a wait and see attitude.
But he does have plans for certain
situations.
One problem he has prepared
for is the possibility that a large
number of professors will refuse
to cross the AFT's picket line
today now that the strike is legal.
Hayakawa claims to have about
50 professional people from the
community, all with advanced de
grees, willing to teach classes
should the need arise.

"I may have to call on them
today," he noted.
Those professors who go on
strike may be facing severe pun
ishment. Hayakawa declared his
willingness to enforce a state law
which states that unauthorized
absence by a teacher for five days
constitutes an automatic resigna
tion. State College Chancellor
Glenn Dumke supported such a
move.
"The resolve of the Board of
Trustees to keep San Francisco
State open remains unchanged,"
Dumke said. "The freedom of the
majority of the students to learn
and of the majority of the faculty
to teach must and will be pre
served."

SAN FRANCISCO—CIasses re
opened at troubled San Francisco
State College yesterday in the face
of a strike by the school's local of
the American Federation of Teac
hers (AFT), with attendance
sharply below normal.
The strike, illegal early in the
day, received official sanction
from the executive board of the
San Francisco Labor Council in
the afternoon.
About 1,000 pickets, including
many students from other Bay
Area colleges, marched at all six
entrances to the school. Small
groups also moved on campus and
picketed most buildings, in viola
tion of an edict issued Sunday by
college president Samuel I. Haya
kawa.
No Major Incidents
Police and pickets faced each
other othe corner of 19th Street
and Holloway throughout the day
but, unlike previous confronta
tions, no major incidents
occurred.
Hayakawa decried the faculty
strike action. "A militant minor
ity of the faculty has hitch-hiked
onto the militant students' vio
lence-ridden strike for a vicious
power grab," he declared at an
afternoon press conference.
He was optimistic about the
campus situation, noting that this

was the first day since he took
over on December 2 that classes
proceeded without violence.
Attendance, which was low in
the morning, showed a steady in
crease throughout the day as more
students came back to school,
prompted by the relatively calm
atmosphere.
Pickets Not Disturbed
Hayakawa, wearing the blue
armband originally adopted by his
supporters, noted that he had not
taken any action against on
campus pickets because they re
mained quiet, and felt it would be
better not to disturb the tenuous
peace.
But despite the lack of trouble
yesterday, San Francisco State
may be facing bigger problems
than ever before now that the
AFT strike has been sanctioned.
When news of the approval
reached campus, cafeteria employ
ees-who are unionized—
immediately walked off their jobs.
And it is likely that truckers will
refuse to make any deliveries to
the beleaguered institution.
Keep School Open
"I don't know how I am going
to stop them from closing the
school," Hayakawa said, "but I
am going to try. I am not going to
accept it closed by anybody."

When asked what students
would do without food services,
the noted semanticist commented,
"They can bring sandwiches the
way I did."
Hayakawa refused to comment
on what may happen today,
adopting a wait and see attitude.
But he does have plans for certain
situations.
One problem he has prepared
for is the possibility that a large
number of professors will refuse
to cross the AFT's picket line
today now that the strike is legal.
Hayakawa claims to have about
50 professional people from the
community, all with advanced de
grees, willing to teach classes
should the need arise.

"I may have to call on them
today," he noted.
Those professors who go on
strike may be facing severe pun
ishment. Hayakawa declared his
willingness to enforce a state law
which states that unauthorized
absence by a teacher for five days
constitutes an automatic resigna
tion. State College Chancellor
Glenn Dumke supported such a
move.
"The resolve of the Board of
Trustees to keep San Francisco
State open remains unchanged,"
Dumke said. "The freedom of the
majority of the students to learn
and of the majority of the faculty
to teach must and will be pre
served."
