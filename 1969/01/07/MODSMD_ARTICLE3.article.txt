# Fiji Coed Plan Rejected
## 
### MARSHALL KILDUFF 
Phi Gamma Delta (Fiji)
fraternity was denied permission
to house six coeds on an
"experimental basis" by Dean of
Students Joel Smith three weeks
ago.
In explaining the denial, Dean
of Fraternities Dan Williams said,
"The Fiji plan wasn't coed
enough." Yet the fact that the
fraternity would even consider
coed living has so alienated some
members that ten have moved off.
Fiji president Jim Greer said a
number of considerations had led
up to the fraternity's decision.
"Financially, it was a good idea.
We were short of people, and a lot
more were going to move off."
One member had complained that
"Life was pretty dull around here,
and the coed living might improve
the situation a lot."
Greer said that "coed living
would be interesting for every
one," and he pointed out that the
house was brand-new and very
comfortable.
Defeat
Discussion during the fall
ended in a defeat for the motion
to admit girls as boarders by a
narrow 18 to 17 defeat. "Many
felt that coed living would violate
basic principles of fraternity life,"
summarized Greer.
But two weeks later many
members had changed their

minds, and a second vote was
taken. This time the motion
passed 27 to 11.
Greer wrote a letter to the
Fiji's national headquarters ex
plaining that the girls would not
be members—only boarders—and
could not vote on major,
long-ranged plans of the
fraternity. He pointed out that
the plan was an experiment for
only the Winter Quarter, and the
house would vote on whether to
continue coed living at the end of
this term.
No Approval
The national did not approve
the idea, and said that the
Stanford chapter would be
dropped from affiliation if they
admitted girls.
Greer ignored the threat, and
took his plan to Smith. Williams
and faculty resident Robert
Freelund investigated the
situation and discussed coed living
with members of the fraternity.
After they studied the matter,
Smith decided not to allow coeds
to move in.
In backing up the decision,
Williams pointed out, "Coed living
is not a panacea for all ills." He
did not feel that adding girls to
the fraternity would auto
matically or necessarily liven up
its atmosphere. In addition, "they
were talking in terms of Lambda
Nu, and six girls isn't really coed,"
Williams mentioned. "The
members weren't at the time pre
pared to grant them their rights."

Freelund, though agreeing with
Smith's decision, declared, "This
attempt represents an attitude.
They are taking a look at their
situation and proposing a
solution." A faculty resident last
year in coed Serra House, he said,
"this means they are moving
closer to the mainstream."
Before Smith denied per
mission for coed living, many
Fiji's were disillusioned with the
sentiments in the fraternity. Ten
moved off, and three more would
have joined them except for
financial reasons. Scott Reynolds,
19, a sophomore, said the
majority in favor of a coed
arrangement "didn't take us into
consideration. The majority just
forced their will over on us."
Reynolds felt the Fiji's "were
changing away from a fraternity.
If things don't start looking up, I
may join the guys who left."
President Greer does not think
that idea of coed living in
fraternity is a novel one any
longer. "Every single one of them
is thinking of it." However, a
random phone survey of half the
fraternities showed that while
some had considered coed living
none had taken substantial steps
in that direction.
Both Kappa Alpha and Sigma
Alpha Epsilon had studied the
possibility of including girls, but
both finally decided against it.
Jim Brown, SAE president, noted,
"Many of our members have lived
in coed dorms overseas, and
they're tired of it.

Phi Gamma Delta (Fiji)
fraternity was denied permission
to house six coeds on an
"experimental basis" by Dean of
Students Joel Smith three weeks
ago.
In explaining the denial, Dean
of Fraternities Dan Williams said,
"The Fiji plan wasn't coed
enough." Yet the fact that the
fraternity would even consider
coed living has so alienated some
members that ten have moved off.
Fiji president Jim Greer said a
number of considerations had led
up to the fraternity's decision.
"Financially, it was a good idea.
We were short of people, and a lot
more were going to move off."
One member had complained that
"Life was pretty dull around here,
and the coed living might improve
the situation a lot."
Greer said that "coed living
would be interesting for every
one," and he pointed out that the
house was brand-new and very
comfortable.
Defeat
Discussion during the fall
ended in a defeat for the motion
to admit girls as boarders by a
narrow 18 to 17 defeat. "Many
felt that coed living would violate
basic principles of fraternity life,"
summarized Greer.
But two weeks later many
members had changed their

minds, and a second vote was
taken. This time the motion
passed 27 to 11.
Greer wrote a letter to the
Fiji's national headquarters ex
plaining that the girls would not
be members—only boarders—and
could not vote on major,
long-ranged plans of the
fraternity. He pointed out that
the plan was an experiment for
only the Winter Quarter, and the
house would vote on whether to
continue coed living at the end of
this term.
No Approval
The national did not approve
the idea, and said that the
Stanford chapter would be
dropped from affiliation if they
admitted girls.
Greer ignored the threat, and
took his plan to Smith. Williams
and faculty resident Robert
Freelund investigated the
situation and discussed coed living
with members of the fraternity.
After they studied the matter,
Smith decided not to allow coeds
to move in.
In backing up the decision,
Williams pointed out, "Coed living
is not a panacea for all ills." He
did not feel that adding girls to
the fraternity would auto
matically or necessarily liven up
its atmosphere. In addition, "they
were talking in terms of Lambda
Nu, and six girls isn't really coed,"
Williams mentioned. "The
members weren't at the time pre
pared to grant them their rights."

Freelund, though agreeing with
Smith's decision, declared, "This
attempt represents an attitude.
They are taking a look at their
situation and proposing a
solution." A faculty resident last
year in coed Serra House, he said,
"this means they are moving
closer to the mainstream."
Before Smith denied per
mission for coed living, many
Fiji's were disillusioned with the
sentiments in the fraternity. Ten
moved off, and three more would
have joined them except for
financial reasons. Scott Reynolds,
19, a sophomore, said the
majority in favor of a coed
arrangement "didn't take us into
consideration. The majority just
forced their will over on us."
Reynolds felt the Fiji's "were
changing away from a fraternity.
If things don't start looking up, I
may join the guys who left."
President Greer does not think
that idea of coed living in
fraternity is a novel one any
longer. "Every single one of them
is thinking of it." However, a
random phone survey of half the
fraternities showed that while
some had considered coed living
none had taken substantial steps
in that direction.
Both Kappa Alpha and Sigma
Alpha Epsilon had studied the
possibility of including girls, but
