SAN MATEO (AP)-Three men,
two of them students, were ar
rested on assault warrants Monday
as they tried to cross police check
points and enter the College of
San Mateo campus.

Officers said the three were
arrested separately on warrants
issued after pre-Christmas demon
strations at the college.
The two students, Vincent
Mannino, 24, of San Mateo and

John Brandon, 33, of San
Francisco, and nonstudent Willie
Wilkerson, 27, of San Mateo, were
booked on suspicion of assault.
No bond has been set.
Authorities said the three men
were wanted in connection with
assaults on college faculty
members and other students
during a Dec. 13 rampage by
Negroes that left 12 persons in
jured and caused damage estima
ted at $8,000.
Meanwhile, classes resumed
without incident as 8,000 stu
dents at the racially troubled
junior college returned from a
two-week holiday recess.
About 75 uniformed police
men manned the college's two
gates, admitting only students and
those with "legitimate business."
The officers were called in by
college President Robert Ewig
leben to deal with possible new
outbreaks.
At issue is Ewigleben's an
nouncement that he will expand
the tutorial system of the College
Readiness Program to include
whites as well as Negroes. A major
point of contention is the reas
signment of the program's direc
tor, Robert Hoover.
Over the weekend, police main
tained a watch at the homes of
college trustees. Last week five
bullets were fired into a house for
merly occupied by trustee Carl W.
Ward in San Mateo, possibly in
the belief he still lived there,
police said.
