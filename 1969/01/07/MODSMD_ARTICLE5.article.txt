# Meets Monday
## SCLC Chosen 
### 
For the first time at Stanford,
students and faculty members will
share primary responsibility for
developing their own campus dis
ciplinary rules, when the newly
organized Student Conduct Legis
lative Council (SCLC) meets next
week.
The Council has been described
as "one of the most significant
shifts in power in the history of
the University" by Prof. Hubert
Marshall, political science, who
headed the 15-man student
faculty-administration committee
which proposed the new group
last spring.
"It is no longer feasible or de
sirable to exclude students from
participating in drafting the regu
lations under which they are to
live," Prof. Marshall notes.
Formally ratified by all three
groups, the SCLC includes Stu
dent Body President Denis Hayes,
Student Legislature Speaker Yale
Braunstein, and three other stu
dents chosen in fall quarter elec
tions: Jeffrey Kane, W. Richard
Such, and Philip Taubman.
At the request of President
Kenneth Pitzer, its members will
recommend a chairman from
among six professors on the
Council: James Adams, mechani
cal engineering; Richard Atkinson,
psychology and education; Robert
Girard, law; Robert Horn, poli
tical science; Paul Seaver, history;
and F. Eugene Yates, physiology.
Dean of Students Joel Smith
will serve as an ex-officio member
of the Council, without vote.
The new Council stems from
nearly four years controversy,
conflict, and negotiation, trig
gered by publication in February
1965 of the so-called Crow-
Halverson report, a highly critical
analysis of the administration's in
volvement in student judicial
matters written by students active
in the judicial system.
In a report to the faculty, pub
lished this fall. Prof. Marshall said:
"In recommending that the Presi
dent and Trustees delegate the
rule-making function to the SCLC

and in providing for student selec
tion of student members, we are
proposing one of the most signifi
cant shifts in power in the history
of the University. . . .
"We began thinking about the
SCLC by accepting the premise
that all three constituencies (stu
dents, faculty and administration)
are affected by student conduct
and have a genuine interest in
maintaining an orderly and open
campus on which all can pursue
their educational goals."
While the charter creating the
Council and a separate enforce
ment body, the Stanford Judicial
Council, gives the President power
to name the chairman of both
groups, Dr. Pitzer has asked the
SCLC members to recommend a
chairman from the faculty mem
bers of their group. Its first meet
ing is scheduled for 4 p.m. Mon
day in the conference room at the
Old Union.
