## Pearson Views War Crisis In Middle East 
### DREW PEARSON 
Thanks to the changing of
horses in Washington's mid
stream, another full-scale war
could well break in the Near East.
If so, the proximity of the Amer
ican and Russian fleet makes the
area as dangerous as a pack mule
strapped with dynamite wander
ing loose in a mine field.
However, the Johnson adminis
tration has only two weeks in
which to carry out any policy it
starts, while the Nixon administra
tion sits on the sidelines waiting
to take over.
Earlier, attempts at coopera
tion between the two men were
polite but not too satisfactory.
When the President discussed with
Nixon a summit meeting with
Premier Kosygin of Russia, the
President-elect threw cold water
on the idea. Later, to make sure
that Johnson did not go ahead
with the summit meeting anyway,
Nixon sent secret word to the
Russians that he was against the
meeting. So rather than get off on
the wrong foot with the new ad
ministration, the Russians politely
sidetracked Johnson's feelers.
More recently, the President
elect yielded to the pressure of
Max Fisher of Detroit, one of his
biggest campaign contributors,
and made an exception to his no
foreign-talks rule by seeing Gen.

Moshe Dayan, the one-eyed Israeli
Minister of Defense. This put
Amir Abbass Hoveyda, Prime Min
ister of Iran, a much bigger coun
try and one extremely friendly to
the United States, in an embarras
sing position in the Moslem world.
He had asked for an interview
with Nixon and been turned
down.
All this came at a time when
the rapidly eroding situation in
the Near East is likely to explode
into war.
An "Imposed" Peace
Most Near East experts, includ
ing American, Soviet and Arab,
believe that war can only be
averted by an "imposed" peace.
In other words, the two big
powers must force Israel and the
Arab belligerents to the confer
ence table.
Significantly, Arab leaders have
conveyed private word to the

United States and Russia that
they would welcome an imposed
peace. Their own populations
have become too volatile and too
bitter, especially after the Israeli
raid on the Beirut airport, to enter
a peace discussion without being
forced into it by the two major
powers—Russia which supplies
arms to the UAR, and the United
States which has just agreed to sell
50 Phantom jets to Israel.
However, the Israelis remember
the UN peace terms imposed upon
them at Eisenhower's initiative
after the 1956 war, and are suspic
ious of a repeat performance.
Eisenhower picked up the trans-
Atlantic telephone and in
barrack-room language told Prime
Minister Anthony Eden that he
had to get British troops out of
Suez. He was so tough that Eden
became ill, and resigned shortly
thereafter. Ike was almost as
tough with the French.
Compared to Eisenhower, Pres
ident Johnson has been like an in
dulgent father slapping a wayward
child on the wrist. He has used no
tough tactics on either the Israelis
or the Arabs.
Meanwhile, the situation daily
drifts closer to war.

Following the raid on the
Beirut airport, the Israelis are
forced to reinforce their Lebanon
border. Previously this was not a
military worry. Lebanon had used
its own Army to arrest terrorists
trying to disrupt Lebanese-Israeli
relations. The border between
Lebanon and Syria is wild and
mountainous, somewhat like the
border between South Vietnam
and its neighbors. Syrian terrorists
constantly sneak across. Previous
ly, however, the Lebanese Army
did its best to prevent infiltration.
Last week, on the other hand,
Soviet-built rocket launchers were
being fired by terrorists from
Lebanese soil, into nearby Israeli
towns. They had never before
been permitted to use Lebanese
bases.
Things are sure to get worse.
The Arab Popular Front whose
terrorists attacked the El A 1 air
plane in Athens, is holding a stra
tegy meeting in Cairo Jan. 17,
three days before Nixon takes
office, to decide on further retali
ation for Israel's raid on Beirut.
Isolating The USA
What the United States faces in
the Near East is a very significant
two-way move by Israel and
Soviet diplomats toward isolating
the United States from Arabs. It
is:
1. A push by the Russians to
keep the United States from re
suming diplomatic relations with
Egypt and other Arab nations.
2. A move by Israeli diplomats
to push the Arab nations further
toward Russia, apparently with
the idea that this tightens the
bond between Washington and
Jerusalem.
Push No. 1 is reported to be
why Foreign Minister Andrei
Gromyko was in Cairo last month.
He took with him Deputy Foreign

Minister Vladimir Semyonov, an
expert on American affairs, to
help persuade President Nasser he
should be in no hurry to resume
diplomatic relations with Presi
dent Nixon. Nixon had visited
Cairo in 1963, had a friendly talk
with Nasser; and it's reported
Nasser leans toward patching up
relations with the Nixon adminis
tration.
The Russians, however, don't
want the United States to win
back any influence in the Arab
world. At present, and since the
June 1967 war, we are without
ambassadors in six Arab nations.
Meanwhile, in push No. 2,
Israel has ordered its ambassador
in Washington, the able Yitzhak
Rabin, to try to sidetrack any re
sumption of American-Egyptian
relations.
This is not a unanimous Israeli
viewpoint, however. It is not
shared by ,Gen. Moshe Dayan,
who feels that Nixon might have a
moderating influence on Nasser.
Nevertheless, the general Israeli
push to harden relations between
the United States and Russia con
tinues.
These are some of the com
plexities of the Near East im
broglio. It's extremely compli
cated and much too dangerous to
allow to drift.
