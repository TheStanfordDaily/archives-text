# Would You Believe
## Divorce Is The Only Way 
### ART BUCHWALD 
Peter Ustinov, the British
actor and playwright, was in Paris
and I happened to discuss differ
ent methods of presenting a
divorce problem to an English, a
French and an American theater
audience.
To give an example, let's make
up a scene from a play as the
English would do it:
GEORGE: Jessie.
JESSIE: Mmm'm.
GEORGE: There's something
I've been meaning to ask you for
some time (about two and a half
acts in fact).
JESSIE: (hard) Yes, George.
GEORGE: I . . . that is ... I
don't know how you're quite
going to take this.
JESSIE: I think I know what
you're going to say.
GEORGE: How uncanny.
JESSIE: But it's too late now.
GEORGE: I suppose it is.
Whisky?
JESSIE: I don't mind if I do.
GEORGE: I imagine it was my
fault in a way.
JESSIE: Don't blame yourself,
George.

GEORGE: Soda?
JESSIE: Just a dash.
GEORGE: How's that? (hold
ing up a glass.)
JESSIE: Dear George. That's
fine.
GEORGE: You never did like
it with ice.
JESSIE: Never.
GEORGE: Well, thank God for
that.
JESSIE: Why do you say that?
GEORGE: There is no more
ice. (Sits down heavily.) No more
anything.
* * *
"The French, on the other
hand, would play the scene differ
ently," said Mr. Ustinov.
GEORGE: Cherie.
JESSIE: Oui, mon petit chou.
GEORGE: I have something to
tell you. I have a mistress.
JESSIE: You are only telling
me something I have know for
two years.
GEORGE: No, I mean a new
mistress.
JESSIE: But what will happen
to Maria?
GEORGE: I don't know.

JESSIE: The poor thing. I'll
take her to the collections.
GEORGE: (reproachfully)
Please do. You never were very
nice to her.
JESSIE: (more reproachfully)
You never brought her around.
GEORGE: I suppose you are
right.
JESSIE: Is she much prettier
than I am?
GEORGE: Much prettier.
JESSIE: I'm glad. Otherwise, I
would have been jealous.
GEORGE: Where are you go
ing?
JESSIE: I'll see you next week.
GEORGE: Is Pierre in town?
JESSIE: I don't know, but
Leon is.
GEORGE: Who's Leon?
JESSIE: My, how possessive
you've become.

"The Americans, on the other
hand, are more for the stark real
ism of the thing," said Mr.
Ustinov. "A saxophone must be
playing nine blocks away and a
kid is crying across the road."
GEORGE: Jessie, I have some
thing to tell you.
JESSIE: I want a divorce.
GEORGE: But you haven't
heard what I've got to say.
JESSIE: Oh, for heaven's
sakes, we're grown-up people.
Let's not behave like children.
GEORGE: But for crying out
loud . . .
JESSIE: Mother said it would
happen this way.
GEORGE: But . . .
JESSIE: Let's not discuss it.
It's vulgar and I'm not interested
in the details.
GEORGE: Will you shut
up . . .
JESSIE: Don't raise your
voice, George.
GEORGE: I just wanted to
say . ..
JESSIE: Whatever it is, I'm
sure the lawyers will be able to
settle it.

To give an example, let's make
up a scene from a play as the
English would do it:
GEORGE: Jessie.
JESSIE: Mmm'm.
GEORGE: There's something
I've been meaning to ask you for
some time (about two and a half
acts in fact).
JESSIE: (hard) Yes, George.
GEORGE: I . . . that is ... I
don't know how you're quite
going to take this.
JESSIE: I think I know what
you're going to say.
GEORGE: How uncanny.
JESSIE: But it's too late now.
GEORGE: I suppose it is.
Whisky?
JESSIE: I don't mind if I do.
GEORGE: I imagine it was my
fault in a way.
JESSIE: Don't blame yourself,
George.

GEORGE: Soda?
JESSIE: Just a dash.
GEORGE: How's that? (hold
ing up a glass.)
JESSIE: Dear George. That's
fine.
GEORGE: You never did like
it with ice.
JESSIE: Never.
GEORGE: Well, thank God for
that.
JESSIE: Why do you say that?
GEORGE: There is no more
ice. (Sits down heavily.) No more
anything.
* * *
"The French, on the other
hand, would play the scene differ
ently," said Mr. Ustinov.
GEORGE: Cherie.
JESSIE: Oui, mon petit chou.
GEORGE: I have something to
tell you. I have a mistress.
JESSIE: You are only telling
me something I have know for
two years.
GEORGE: No, I mean a new
mistress.
JESSIE: But what will happen
to Maria?
GEORGE: I don't know.

JESSIE: The poor thing. I'll
take her to the collections.
GEORGE: (reproachfully)
Please do. You never were very
nice to her.
JESSIE: (more reproachfully)
You never brought her around.
GEORGE: I suppose you are
right.
JESSIE: Is she much prettier
than I am?
GEORGE: Much prettier.
JESSIE: I'm glad. Otherwise, I
would have been jealous.
GEORGE: Where are you go
ing?
JESSIE: I'll see you next week.
GEORGE: Is Pierre in town?
JESSIE: I don't know, but
Leon is.
GEORGE: Who's Leon?
JESSIE: My, how possessive
you've become.

"The Americans, on the other
hand, are more for the stark real
ism of the thing," said Mr.
Ustinov. "A saxophone must be
playing nine blocks away and a
kid is crying across the road."
GEORGE: Jessie, I have some
thing to tell you.
JESSIE: I want a divorce.
GEORGE: But you haven't
heard what I've got to say.
JESSIE: Oh, for heaven's
sakes, we're grown-up people.
Let's not behave like children.
GEORGE: But for crying out
loud . . .
JESSIE: Mother said it would
happen this way.
GEORGE: But . . .
JESSIE: Let's not discuss it.
It's vulgar and I'm not interested
in the details.
GEORGE: Will you shut
up . . .
JESSIE: Don't raise your
voice, George.
GEORGE: I just wanted to
say . ..
JESSIE: Whatever it is, I'm
sure the lawyers will be able to
settle it.
Peter Ustinov, the British
actor and playwright, was in Paris
and I happened to discuss differ
ent methods of presenting a
divorce problem to an English, a
French and an American theater
audience.
