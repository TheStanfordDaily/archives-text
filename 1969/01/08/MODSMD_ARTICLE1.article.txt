# Scientists Attack Pope's Birth Stand
## 
### BARBARA RITZ 
More than 2700 scientists, in
cluding Stanford University pro
fessors, have placed their names
on a statement criticizing Pope
Paul's recent encyclical on birth
control.
The statement, drafted by Paul
Ehrlich, professor of biology at
Stanford, and two other scientists
states in part that:
"More than half the world is
hungry, and our environment is
deteriorating rapidly and perhaps
irreversibly . . . Population pres
sures are contributing to political
tensions and increasing the proba
bility of biological or thermo
nuclear warfare.
"Any action which impedes
efforts to half world population
growth perpetuates the misery in
which millions now live and pro
motes death by starvation of
millions this year and many more
millions in the next few dec
ades ... It is high time, therefore,
that we make our stand on the
birth control encyclical perfectly
clear. We pledge that we will no
longer be impressed by pleas for
world peace or compassion for the
poor from a man whose deeds
help to promote war and make
poverty inevitable."
Value of Life
Pope Paul, however, may never
get the opportunity to read the
statement, commented Dr. Ehr
lich. The "Scientists' Statement
on Birth Control Encyclical" is

more of an expressed concern for
the value of life than it is an at
tempt to villify the Pope.
"I am well aware of the fact
that people will control any in
crease in the size of their families
regardless of any religious dicta.
So you ask, 'Why the fuss about
the encyclical if the birth rages
aren't going to jump'?"
Dr. Ehrlich feels that the
Pope's encyclical may create
enough political interference to
hinder attempts to lower the birth
rate. He also commented that any
papal dictum creates problems for
a large segment of the educated
Catholic community, who may
follow their own consciences in
stead of the Pope's.
Thermopylae
The Pope is trying to recreate
the battle of Thermopylae, Ehr
lich commented. "They shall not
pass."
The signatories who include
Catholic and non-Catholic signers,
four Nobel laureates and more
than 20 members of the National
Academy of Science, were co
llected over a period of several
weeks beginning in the middle of
November. The statement was
then presented at the December
29 meeting of the American As
sociation for the Advancement of
Science in Dallas, Texas, and re
leased to the press.
John Thomas, lecturer in bio
logical sciences, and Ehrlich are
now investigating ways of getting

the statement and its signatures to
the Pope. Thomas commented
that they may ask Archbishop
McGucken of the archdiocese of
San Francisco to forward the
statement to the Pope.
Isolated Himself
"With his decision the Pope has
isolated himself completely out of
context from the rest of the world
without any regard for the popu
lation explosion," Thomas com
mented.
Many of us feel that the papal
ruling is as close to a criminal act
than anything else comparable to
its destructive effects on man, he
said.
Today more than one billion
human beings are either under
nourished or malnourished, and
the human population is growing
at a rate of 2 percent per year —

approximately 70 million people,
Ehrlich said.
Redirecting
Ehrlich feels that there are
ways of not looking at the prob
lem, such as the Pope's encyclical,
or ways of redirecting the popula
tion problem into other channels
like proposed fede-al expenditures
for agro-industrial complexes.
There is a tendency among the
public to believe that science has
the population situation well in
hand—that farming the sea and
the tropics, irrigating the deserts,
and generating cheap nuclear
power in abundance hold the key
to overnight solution of the prob
lem, he said.
And some people tend not to
believe that a population problem
exists at all, he said. Yet, we will
need $500 biliion to feed the in

crease of people in the next ten
years, weighed with the fact that
only 6 percent of the world's
population are Americans, and
that Americans now consume over
one half of the world's resources.
Ehrlich said that Stanford's
Ford Foundation Grant for
$470,000 is for investigating the
population problems, including
studies on the effect of densities
on population and the effect on
human behavior in various kinds
of societies.
Most Americans cannot visual
ize what it's like to be in India
and encoutering the living condi
tions there, he commented.
He feels that it is necessary to
change people's attitudes toward
reproduction, to have them regard
the population crisis as a social
responsibility rather than let the
other person worry about it.

Dr. Ehrlich feels that the
Pope's encyclical may create
enough political interference to
hinder attempts to lower the birth
rate. He also commented that any
papal dictum creates problems for
a large segment of the educated
Catholic community, who may
follow their own consciences in
stead of the Pope's.
Thermopylae
The Pope is trying to recreate
the battle of Thermopylae, Ehr
lich commented. "They shall not
pass."
The signatories who include
Catholic and non-Catholic signers,
four Nobel laureates and more
than 20 members of the National
Academy of Science, were co
llected over a period of several
weeks beginning in the middle of
November. The statement was
then presented at the December
29 meeting of the American As
sociation for the Advancement of
Science in Dallas, Texas, and re
leased to the press.
John Thomas, lecturer in bio
logical sciences, and Ehrlich are
now investigating ways of getting

the statement and its signatures to
the Pope. Thomas commented
that they may ask Archbishop
McGucken of the archdiocese of
San Francisco to forward the
statement to the Pope.
Isolated Himself
"With his decision the Pope has
isolated himself completely out of
context from the rest of the world
without any regard for the popu
lation explosion," Thomas com
mented.
Many of us feel that the papal
ruling is as close to a criminal act
than anything else comparable to
its destructive effects on man, he
said.
Today more than one billion
human beings are either under
nourished or malnourished, and
the human population is growing
at a rate of 2 percent per year —

approximately 70 million people,
Ehrlich said.
Redirecting
Ehrlich feels that there are
ways of not looking at the prob
lem, such as the Pope's encyclical,
or ways of redirecting the popula
tion problem into other channels
like proposed fede-al expenditures
for agro-industrial complexes.
There is a tendency among the
public to believe that science has
the population situation well in
hand—that farming the sea and
the tropics, irrigating the deserts,
and generating cheap nuclear
power in abundance hold the key
to overnight solution of the prob
lem, he said.
And some people tend not to
believe that a population problem
exists at all, he said. Yet, we will
need $500 biliion to feed the in

crease of people in the next ten
years, weighed with the fact that
only 6 percent of the world's
population are Americans, and
that Americans now consume over
one half of the world's resources.
Ehrlich said that Stanford's
Ford Foundation Grant for
$470,000 is for investigating the
population problems, including
studies on the effect of densities
on population and the effect on
human behavior in various kinds
of societies.
Most Americans cannot visual
ize what it's like to be in India
and encoutering the living condi
tions there, he commented.
He feels that it is necessary to
change people's attitudes toward
reproduction, to have them regard
the population crisis as a social
responsibility rather than let the
other person worry about it.


IN THE FIELD— Biology Prof. Paul Ehrlich, author of the statement
condemning the Pope's anti-birth control encyclical, studies butter
flies with a student. The Stanford population biologist has been in the
forefront of the movement for population control.
More than 2700 scientists, in
cluding Stanford University pro
fessors, have placed their names
on a statement criticizing Pope
Paul's recent encyclical on birth
control.
The statement, drafted by Paul
Ehrlich, professor of biology at
Stanford, and two other scientists
states in part that:
"More than half the world is
hungry, and our environment is
deteriorating rapidly and perhaps
irreversibly . . . Population pres
sures are contributing to political
tensions and increasing the proba
bility of biological or thermo
nuclear warfare.
"Any action which impedes
efforts to half world population
growth perpetuates the misery in
which millions now live and pro
motes death by starvation of
millions this year and many more
millions in the next few dec
ades ... It is high time, therefore,
that we make our stand on the
birth control encyclical perfectly
clear. We pledge that we will no
longer be impressed by pleas for
world peace or compassion for the
poor from a man whose deeds
help to promote war and make
poverty inevitable."
Value of Life
Pope Paul, however, may never
get the opportunity to read the
statement, commented Dr. Ehr
lich. The "Scientists' Statement
on Birth Control Encyclical" is

more of an expressed concern for
the value of life than it is an at
tempt to villify the Pope.
"I am well aware of the fact
that people will control any in
crease in the size of their families
regardless of any religious dicta.
So you ask, 'Why the fuss about
the encyclical if the birth rages
aren't going to jump'?"

approximately 70 million people,
Ehrlich said.
Redirecting
Ehrlich feels that there are
ways of not looking at the prob
lem, such as the Pope's encyclical,
or ways of redirecting the popula
tion problem into other channels
like proposed fede-al expenditures
for agro-industrial complexes.
There is a tendency among the
public to believe that science has
the population situation well in
hand—that farming the sea and
the tropics, irrigating the deserts,
and generating cheap nuclear
power in abundance hold the key
to overnight solution of the prob
lem, he said.
And some people tend not to
believe that a population problem
exists at all, he said. Yet, we will
need $500 biliion to feed the in

crease of people in the next ten
years, weighed with the fact that
only 6 percent of the world's
population are Americans, and
that Americans now consume over
one half of the world's resources.
Ehrlich said that Stanford's
Ford Foundation Grant for
$470,000 is for investigating the
population problems, including
studies on the effect of densities
on population and the effect on
human behavior in various kinds
of societies.
Most Americans cannot visual
ize what it's like to be in India
and encoutering the living condi
tions there, he commented.
He feels that it is necessary to
change people's attitudes toward
reproduction, to have them regard
the population crisis as a social
responsibility rather than let the
other person worry about it.


IN THE FIELD— Biology Prof. Paul Ehrlich, author of the statement
condemning the Pope's anti-birth control encyclical, studies butter
flies with a student. The Stanford population biologist has been in the
forefront of the movement for population control.
More than 2700 scientists, in
cluding Stanford University pro
fessors, have placed their names
on a statement criticizing Pope
Paul's recent encyclical on birth
control.
The statement, drafted by Paul
Ehrlich, professor of biology at
Stanford, and two other scientists
states in part that:
"More than half the world is
hungry, and our environment is
deteriorating rapidly and perhaps
irreversibly . . . Population pres
sures are contributing to political
tensions and increasing the proba
bility of biological or thermo
nuclear warfare.
"Any action which impedes
efforts to half world population
growth perpetuates the misery in
which millions now live and pro
motes death by starvation of
millions this year and many more
millions in the next few dec
ades ... It is high time, therefore,
that we make our stand on the
birth control encyclical perfectly
clear. We pledge that we will no
longer be impressed by pleas for
world peace or compassion for the
poor from a man whose deeds
help to promote war and make
poverty inevitable."
Value of Life
Pope Paul, however, may never
get the opportunity to read the
statement, commented Dr. Ehr
lich. The "Scientists' Statement
on Birth Control Encyclical" is

more of an expressed concern for
the value of life than it is an at
tempt to villify the Pope.
"I am well aware of the fact
that people will control any in
crease in the size of their families
regardless of any religious dicta.
So you ask, 'Why the fuss about
the encyclical if the birth rages
aren't going to jump'?"
Dr. Ehrlich feels that the
Pope's encyclical may create
enough political interference to
hinder attempts to lower the birth
rate. He also commented that any
papal dictum creates problems for
a large segment of the educated
Catholic community, who may
follow their own consciences in
stead of the Pope's.
Thermopylae
The Pope is trying to recreate
the battle of Thermopylae, Ehr
lich commented. "They shall not
pass."
The signatories who include
Catholic and non-Catholic signers,
four Nobel laureates and more
than 20 members of the National
Academy of Science, were co
llected over a period of several
weeks beginning in the middle of
November. The statement was
then presented at the December
29 meeting of the American As
sociation for the Advancement of
Science in Dallas, Texas, and re
leased to the press.
John Thomas, lecturer in bio
logical sciences, and Ehrlich are
now investigating ways of getting

the statement and its signatures to
the Pope. Thomas commented
that they may ask Archbishop
McGucken of the archdiocese of
San Francisco to forward the
statement to the Pope.
Isolated Himself
"With his decision the Pope has
isolated himself completely out of
context from the rest of the world
without any regard for the popu
lation explosion," Thomas com
mented.
Many of us feel that the papal
ruling is as close to a criminal act
than anything else comparable to
its destructive effects on man, he
said.
Today more than one billion
human beings are either under
nourished or malnourished, and
the human population is growing
at a rate of 2 percent per year —

approximately 70 million people,
Ehrlich said.
