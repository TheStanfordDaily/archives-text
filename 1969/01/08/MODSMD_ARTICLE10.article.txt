## Honeybunch's Religious Crisis 
### CISSIE BONINI 
It was during Honeybunch
Dornhoffer's first Western Civ
exam, while she was answering the
question: "Suppose Jesus, Eld
ridge Cleaver, Karl Marx, Soren
Kierkegaard, Pat Paulson, Pope
Paul VI, and you are sitting
around a table in Grove House dis
cussing the desirability of re
pealing inhibition . . that she
realized with a start that—al
though a quarter of the way
through her freshman year—she
had not had a religious crisis.
Recognizing that religion and
sex are inextricably intertwined,
she assumed that her religious
cricis had its roots in sexual hang
ups.
With typical fortitude and
courage, she plunged into the
problem, body and soul. Going
over to the God House to see her
campus minister, Geoffrey St.
Paul Ames-Clerkly, she found him
conversing on two of his four
telephones; dictating his weekly
supplement column, "God is NOT
Dead!"; and counselling a
sophomore attempting suicide
during their conversation.
He arose from his littered desk,
greeting her warmly with kisses on
both cheeks and the neck. "What
may God and I do for you, my
daughter;"
What's Your Religious Crisis?
"I think it's a pretty ordinary
freshman 'R.C.'," said Honey
bunch. "But I deviate from the
norm in one worrisome aspect: I
have not shocked my parents
and—worse—l have no urge to do
so."
"Don't worry, my dear," said j
Rev. Ames-Clerkly, squeezing her j
knee reassuringly, "nothing is j
hopeless. No matter how serious
the case, God and the United
Campus Ministry can wrest you
out of the jaws of heck."
"You're so comforting," said
Honeybunch as she nestled in
Rev. Ames-C's lap. "I feel that I
do everything backwards. For
example, I smoke marajuana to
cover up the smell of incense in
my room."
"Well, my dear, in my experi- \
ence, most R.C.'s boil down to a
choice between, 'Am I an honest
atheist or a hypocritical agnos
tic'?"
"My Angel Is Watching"
"Oh, that's not my problem,"
said Honeybunch. "I KNOW
there's a God and that my

guardian angel is with me every
moment here at Tanmore."
Dr. Ames-Clerkly stopped
stroking her arm and looked
apprehensively around the office.
"Where is she?" he asked.
"Who?"
"Your angel."
"Always very near," said
Honeybunch.
"This is serious," said Dr.
Ames-Clerkly. "My recent book,
God is On Sabbatical, specifically
ruled out the possibility of His
being at Tanmore. I think you are
deluding yourself. My first sugges
tion is that you complete one year
of Western Civ. and steep yourself
in Sartre. We'll work from there.
And take a copy of my pamphlet,
"Guardian Angels: An Invasion of
Privacy?"
