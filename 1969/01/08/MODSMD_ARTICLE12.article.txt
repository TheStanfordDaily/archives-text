# IT'S NO JOKE

### DICK GREGORY 
The ancient Chinese lunar
calendar designates 1968 as "The
Year of the Monkey." The animal
category next year is "Fowl" and
it will be known as "The Year of
the Chicken." Though we may be
in for a foul year, domestic and
world events suggest that 1968
was really "The Year of the
Youth." Youth the world over
determinedly applied themselves
to the hard business of trying to
change social systems.
The irony—though perhaps the
hope—is that the youth of the
world conducted their business
n on-violently, while respected
world leaders spanned the herni

spheres trying to decide where
military force should be used
next.
Such force was mustered again
and again to quell the actions of
youth, but still young people did
not protest with guns, cannons,
tanks and nuclear bombs. Such
weaponry belongs to the Estab
lishment and represents its power.
Youth rely on moral power—the
justice of their cause and the truth
they represent.
Youth—DeGaulle's Problem
In France, De Gaulle was faced
with the first real threat to his
stable and seemingly satisfied
autocratic rule, when French
youth took to the streets to

launch an attack on modern
French society, demanding De
Gaulle's ouster and an end to cap
italism. Stimulated by the courage
and enthusiasm of the youth,
thousands of French workers
brought French industry to a
virtual halt as they downed their
tools, staged wildcat strikes,
seized some factories, and issued
demands for higher wages and
shorter work weeks.
In America, young people
dominated the news as never be
fore in history. The moral protest
of America's youth against the
war in Vietnam created a climate
which even LB J conceded was not
favorable to his seeking re-elec

tion.
In 1968, young people the
world over led the fight for
human rights as opposed to civil
rights. And herein lies the hope
for America. I am personally
pleased to see the struggle lifted
to the high moral level of human
rights, for when the struggle is
over I am assured that my Indian,
Mexican, Puerto Rican and Jewish
brothers will have their fair share
of human dignity.
And 1968 was also a year of
campus reform. It was a year
when students proclaimed loud
and clear that they did not intend
to go to college to learn how to
make a living, but rather to learn
how to live. And certainly that is
the real task of education. College
administrations were faced with a
decisive choice when confronted
with student demands. Either
they had to give in to the legiti
mate demands of the protesters or
bring the forces of "law and
order" to put down student un
rest, thereby disrupting the educa
tional process and being them
selves responsible for a breakdown
in education.
Unfortunately, 1968 must also
be known as the year when
America outraged the civilized
world with her senseless killing
and violence. The world was
shocked to hear that its greatest
apostle of nonviolence, Dr. Martin
Luther King, Jr., was violently cut
down in his own home country.
The world cringed as a United

States Senator seeking to lead his
country in the nation's highest
office, Robert Kennedy, the
second Kennedy murdered by his
country, was killed on an evening
of victory. After the killing of Dr.
King, violence erupted in cities
throughout the country and the
world looked on aghast as
machine guns were placed on the
Capitol steps in Washington, D.C.
and tanks rolled onto the White
House lawn.
The Year of the Youth is the
first time in my memory when
young people the world over
united to conduct a non-violent
revolution. Morality was truly on
the move in 1968. If we older
folks could only learn to behave
as non-violently as the youth of
the world did in 1968, a new day
could finally be ushered in—a day
marked by man's learning how to
live rather than learning how to
overkill and putting that know
ledge to work.
