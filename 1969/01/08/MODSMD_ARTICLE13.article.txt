## 'Low Cost Housing Harmful' 
### JULIA HARVEY

I am opposed to low cost
housing.
Low cost housing has always
meant segregated housing. In the
past years low cost housing has
gathered within its fold all fami
lies of low income from a wide
extended area and concentrated
them in a small area now called
the ghetto. Thus the low income
families who have jobs must share
and pay for their own services as
well as for those poor who have
no jobs.
The country too has placed
additional burdens on the com
munity by concentrating welfare
families. And so the taxes of East
Palo Alto climb to $11.31/$ lOO
while the wealthy areas such as
Hillsborough pay only $8.40. It is
understandable why members of
the East Palo Alto Municipal
Council voice strong objections to
building new low cost housing in
East Palo Alto.
The more affluent whites
around the slums or ghettos built
barriers to protect themselves
from the ugliness of the ghettos
and perhaps from the people who
live there. In some places the
barrier is a railroad track. In this
area the economic barrier is a
massive concrete wall on the
ground—the Bayshore Freeway
from Redwood City thru the City
of San Jose.
Stanford, too, is generously
contributing to the WELFARE of
the poor. We take a few, a se
lected few, mostly black and
young, and train them in school
or on the job so that they can join

the middle class and enjoy its
material comforts.
As the ghetto extends, the
white workers and lower middle
class feel threatened; they fear en
closure within the ghetto and all
its attendant problems, and they
fight back. Who stands ready to
condemn them? The middle and
upper classes who have never had
contact? Perhaps the former resi
dents of the area who now judge
from the security of their dis
tance? Perhaps the students who
temporarily live there, who judge
from the security of their parents'
economic protection and who
have yet to meet the responsibili
ties of adulthood?
It is now possible, perhaps, to
redistribute the families of low in
come. This can be done with the
help of the Federal rental subsidy
and interest subsidy for purchas
ing homes. Are the people of Palo
Alto and other surrounding areas
ready to accept them, nay,
actually welcome them—not for a
day or week —but for a lifetime?
Are others ready to move into
East Palo Alto really a very con
venient place to live which can
easily be made into a garden spot
with some money?
Stanford, too, has heard the
cry for low cost housing. It has
just set up a committee to study
low cost housing on the campus.
The committee includes represen
tatives of the faculty, the blacks,
and the students. I note no repre
sentative of the workers—the
Stanford Employees Association
(CSEA).
As a member of the Stanford
Employees Association, I rec
ommend to the Association that

we oppose low cost housing; that
we advocate a program for build
ing economically integrated
housing, for building an econom
ically integrated community so
that we can have economically in
tegrated schools and economically
integrated health care for the en
tire community.
Destroy white as well as black
segregated communities.
Destroy them by building
economically integrated housing
at Stanford that will serve as a
model for other communities to
emulate.
