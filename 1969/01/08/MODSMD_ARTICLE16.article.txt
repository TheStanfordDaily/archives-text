THE STANFORD COMMITTEE FOR BIANFRAN/NIGERIAN
RELIEF has been formed in order to raise relief funds within the
Stanford community. Although seeking to avoid political implications
in the nature and channeling of relief, the Committee will also be
responsible for a few informational programs organized to stimulate a
greater awareness of the nature of the problems of the conflict. Those
interested will meet at the lower lounge of the Clubhouse on
Thursday at 4:15.
The Stanford VOLLEYBALL CLUB will hold its first meeting of
the quarter at 4:00 p.m. today in the Encina gym, followed by a
practice. For the remainder of the quarter, practices will be from 4 to
6 on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. All interested males may par
ticipate.
SEASON TICKETS are now on sale at the Department of Athletics
for home basketball games. Tickets for students, faculty, and staff are
$7.50 and will be on sale through Friday. Individual game tickets will
be on sale on the night of the games for $1.00 each, when available.
