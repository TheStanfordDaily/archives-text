# Drugs, Transplants Explored
## Legal Course Offered by Med School 
### 
A new course, designed to make
future doctors aware of the legal
issues and procedures in their
field, will be offered by the
School of Medicine during winter
quarter.
The course, titled
"370â€”Seminar in Medical Juris
prudence," will be offered as an
elective for credit to interested
medical students by members of
the Santa Clara County Bar
Association.
Ten lectures will be given
Tuesday at 7:30 p.m. in Room
Ml 12 at the medical school.
Faculty, Stanford hospital pro
fessional personnel, and
community physicians may also
audit the lectures, according to
Dr. Bernard W. Nelson, associate
dean. The sessions, however, will
be focused on the student par
ticipants.
The seminar is under the dir
ection of Charles G. Schulz, a Palo
Alto attorney and member of the
Santa Clara Bar Association's
Medical-Legal Liaison Committee.

Subjects for discussion will
range from problems of medical
care over the patient's objection
to "hangups" of poverty medical
care, psychiatry and the law, the
role of the doctor in court drugs
and society, and legal problems of
tissue transplantation.
It was the Medical-Legal
Liaison Committee, according to
Schulz, which provided the
impetus for the new course while

searching for ways in which
doctors might gain a better under
standing of the law and lawyers.
"We recognized," he said,
"that most practicing physicians
are so busy they would not take
the time to attend a series of
meetings. It seemed desirable to
reach the doctors at an earlier
stage of their training."
Dr. Nelson said the faculty is
enthusiastic about the new course
taught by practicing lawyers. He

feels medical students are inade
quately prepared on legal aspects
of medicine. Extra-curricular
lectures on this subject in the past
have not been sufficient to meet
the need, he said.
"One of the functions of the
course is to consider how legal de
cisions are made," Schulz said.
"Hopefully, the physicians will
then appreciate some of the
limitations inherent in the legal
system and why specific answers
cannot be given.
