# Hayes Forms Advisory Cabinet
## 
### MICHAEL KUHL 
ASSU President Denis Hayes
has asked several leaders in grad
uate student and undergraduate
groups to participate in a unique
forum for discussion of important
issues.
The advisory cabinet will not
only "broaden the base of the
ASSU presidency" says Hayes,
but will also allow student govern
ment to arrive at "some sort of
consensual outlook" which
LASSU has not been able to pro
vide.
"It will hopefully be a sound
ing board, idea mill, and coordina
ting group for the Stanford stu
dent body," Hayes says. In selec
ting members to the ASSU Cab
inet, Hayes sought a group which
would "bring a broad number of
student perspectives to bear on an
issue."
The Legislature, in the three
meetings held last quarter, was
widely criticized by students for
failing to unite a majority of the
students behind specific issues.
One student leader recently sug
gested that the body's prime
function was to disperse ASSU
funds.
Hayes further points out that
officers "have too often found
themselves drowning in their
duties a"nd in the inescapable
busy-work of administration . . .
At times the formal workings of
the ASSU have represented the
efforts and ideas of one, two, or
three people."
LASSU Speaker Yale Braun
stein, who has been appointed to
the cabinet, indicated yesterday
discussion of recently released
SES proposals and the accom
panying issue of student participa
tion in Academic Senate delibera
tions represent the "dominant
issue for students at this time."
The group will meet weekly to
discuss any issue suggested by
group members.
During the past quarter stu
dents were named to 36 joint
committees with administrators
and faculty members. Most of
these are new within the past two

years or have only recently been
opened up to student membeis.
Student response to these com
mittees had been widespread, with
the number of applicants out
running positions available four to
one.

Stanford Hospital yesterday
issued a plea for blood donors be
cause of a "critical shortage" due
to flu cases and a decrease in don
ations during the holidays.
Dr. Paul L. Wolf, director of
the clinical laboratory at the hos
pital, reported "we are experi
encing an average shortage of 50
units (pints) a day, particularly in
the A positive, A negative and O
negative blood types."
He said some elective surgical
procedures have had to be can
celed because Stanford is "barely
able to keep up with emergency
needs."
