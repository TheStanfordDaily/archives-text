# SES Coalition To Meet
## 
### 
The issue of a student voice in
the formulation of his own educa
tion will be aired tonight at
Branner Hall in an open meeting
at 8 p.m. as the coalition of stu
dents moves to gain student repre
sentaion on the Academic Senate.
The purpose of the coalition is
to gain a student voice and vote
on the Academic Senate by the
time consideration on the Study
of Education at Stanford (SES)
proposals are made at the Senate's
biweekly meeting Feb. 13.
Late yesterday the group met
in Tresidder Memorial Union to
formulate a plan of action.
In outlining the two-fold pur
pose of the group Pat Shea, one of
the coalition leaders, noted that
"first, the students should have

the right to speak in the Academic
Senate and secondly, the students
should have the right to vote in
the Academic Senate although not
necessarily with a vote equal to
the faculty's."
Earlier former LASSU Speaker
Mike Weinstein remarked, "We're
not looking for 50 percent of the
membership—but we do want stu
dent representation."
"Pitzer is against it," Weinstein
said. "He said that he didn't like
the idea of telling a faculty what
to teach. They should teach what
they like to teach."
But at this moment the stu
dents must work quickly if they
are to gain some form of voice by
the Feb. 13 date for considera
tion.

According to H. Donald
Winbigler, the academic secretary
to the University who mailed out
agendas for Thursdays meeting
earlier this week, the idea of in
cluding students in the senate "is
currently under consideration by
a special Senate Committee . . .
the Committee on Relations with
Student Government."
The committee is not sched
uled to report at Thursday's
meeting, and according to Win
bigler no date has been set.
Last night at a specially called
meeting of coalition leaders the
decision was made to contact each
faculty member of the Academic
Senate in an attempt to gain
support for the proposals.
