## Reagan Scores Unrest 
### 
SACRAMENTO (AP) - Legis
lators applauded Gov. Reagan's
call Tuesday for help in putting
down the "criminal anarchists and
latter-day fascists. . . who seek to
close down the campuses of our
universities, state colleges and
even high schools. . "
The lawmakers sat virtually
silent during most of the Re
publican governor's annual "state
of the state" message, but broke
into applause four times when he
called for tougher actions against
those involved in campus dis
turbances.
Pointedly emphasizing his
words, California's 33rd chief ex
ecutive declared: "With whatever
it takes, I will protect those
students who want to learn, and
those faculty who want to teach."
That drew a round of approval,
as did his final words to a joint
session of the Senate and
Assembly:
"Legislators of California —
join me in this commitment!"
Reagan's remarks on campus un
rest were the center of attention
among spectators and lawmakers.
The rest of the speech dealt in
general terms with other state
problems such as transportation,
natural resources protection,
welfare and crime.

For the first time since he took
office, Reagan was addressing a
legislature dominated by Re
publicans.
Black Director Accepts Post
SAN MATEO (AP)-Robert
Hoover, whose removal as director
of the College Readiness Program
sparked violence at College of San
Mateo, accepted Tuesday night a
position with the junior college
district as assistant for minority
programs.
Trustees of the district, meet
ing to find a way to halt what
they called an "escalation of
violence" after a school official's
home was firebombed, are ex
pected to approve Hoover's
appointment Wednesday night.
Hoover, 36, a black, appeared
at a news conference with Clifford
Erickson, chancellor of the dist
rict, and said his "fair treatment"
should forestall a threatened walk
out by the 500 minority students
in the program and their 75 white
tutors.
"I'm completely satisfied that I
will be given enough authority
over minority programs and can
stay in contact with the stu
dents," Hoover said.
"Im glad we're beginning to
approach a workable solution."

No salary has been discussed,
Erickson and Hoover said. Hoover
will have essentially the same job
but will be concerned with min
ority programs at Skyline Junior
College in San Bruno and Canada
Junior College in Redwood City
as well.
After their closed
-door-meeting, the trustees said a
committee of concerned citizens
will post a rev/ard for information
leading to the arrest of anyone
involved in campus violence.
Early Tuesday a firebomb was
thrown into the garage of Phil
Garlington's home. Garlington,
now the president of Skyline
Junior College in San Bruno, was
dean of instruction at San Mateo
at the height of campus
disturbances last month.
The firebomb caused heavy
damage to the garage and de
stroyed two automobiles.
Garlington estimated damage at
$20,000. Neither he nor his wife,
sleeping just above the garage, was
innured.
Less than 30 minutes later,
college President Robert
Ewigleben was awakened by what
he called a "threatening"
telephone call.
And last week, five bullets
were fired into the former home
of a college trustee, but no one
was injured. Vandals also over
turned shrubbery urns in the yard
of another trustees.
•Mid East Peace Plan
In a move to cool the Middle
East crisis, the Soviet Union was
reported Tuesday night advancing
a plan to have the U.N. Security
Council post a new peace-keeping
force on the Arab-Israeli borders.
Diplomatic sources at U.N.
headquarters in New York gave
these emerging details of the yet
unpublished plan:
—Israel would withdraw from
all the territory it took from
Egypt, Jordan and Syria in the
war of June 5-10, 1967.
—Old Jerusalem would be in
ternationalized under U.N. trus
teeship. Other territory would re
vert to original owners through
negotiation.
—The withdrawal would be
carried out in stages co-ordinated
with reciprocal actions by Arab
countries.
