SAN FRANCISCO—PoIice
cleared demonstrators from the
strife-torn San Francisco State
College campus yesterday, the
second day of an American Feder
ation of Teachers (AFT) strike
against the school.
Class attendance continued
well below normal. College Presi
dent S. I. Hayakawa claimed 68
percent attendance for Monday,
as opposed to a 20 percent esti
mate put out by the AFT.
Reports from students who
were attending class put the true
figure somewhere between the
two.
Students Join Pickets
Students joined AFT members
on the picket line at college en
trances yesterday, but AFT picket
captains soon lost control of
them. They began marching to the
Administration Building, sending
the picket line off in a new direc
tion.
This move on campus was in
direct violation of an edict issued
Sunday by Hayakawa. He allowed
small groups of pickets to come
on campus Monday since they re
mained quiet and orderly.
Assembly Declared Unlawful
But yesterday the the demon
strators soon became boisterous,
chanting slogans and making work
in the neighboring buildings im
possible.
At 1:30 in the afternoon, a
police lieutenant announced to
the crowd that he was declaring
their gathering an unlawful
assembly, and ordered them to
disperse. He was greeted with jeers
and curses. But when several
squads of police appeared, the

marchers began retreating to 19th
Street, which borders the campus.
Police Intervene
Police followed, and eventually
cleared all picketers to the side
walk.
Before the police moved in,
AFT local leaders cleared as many
AFT picketers and all AFT signs
from the group marching on cam
pus.
"The most significant develop
ment in the AFT strike today was
not the teachers' failure to disrupt
the college, but the defiant action
of student demonstrators who
know now that their teacher
friends have deserted them," Hay
akawa told newsmem later in the
day.
Day's Actions 'Inevitable'
"In view of the fact the AFT
has achieved what power it has by
riding on the coattails of Black
Student Union and Third World
Liberation Front demands, what
happened today was inevitable,"
he continued.
"Although the AFT tried to
picket peacefully on the perimeter
of the campus in keeping with
AFL-CIO traditions, they could
not prevent student strikers from
joining them. Student strikers
therefore crowded the picket
lines; they pushed and jostled and
tripped some of those that tried
to enter the campus. They effec
tively blocked freedom of entry
to the campus for part of the
time, violating the rules laid down
by strike leaders themselves."

But, Hayakawa's claims to
contrary, AFT local president
Gary Hawkins declared that this
group would remain on strike
until all their demands were met.

SAN FRANCISCO—PoIice
cleared demonstrators from the
strife-torn San Francisco State
College campus yesterday, the
second day of an American Feder
ation of Teachers (AFT) strike
against the school.
Class attendance continued
well below normal. College Presi
dent S. I. Hayakawa claimed 68
percent attendance for Monday,
as opposed to a 20 percent esti
mate put out by the AFT.
Reports from students who
were attending class put the true
figure somewhere between the
two.
Students Join Pickets
Students joined AFT members
on the picket line at college en
trances yesterday, but AFT picket
captains soon lost control of
them. They began marching to the
Administration Building, sending
the picket line off in a new direc
tion.
This move on campus was in
direct violation of an edict issued
Sunday by Hayakawa. He allowed
small groups of pickets to come
on campus Monday since they re
mained quiet and orderly.
Assembly Declared Unlawful
But yesterday the the demon
strators soon became boisterous,
chanting slogans and making work
in the neighboring buildings im
possible.
At 1:30 in the afternoon, a
police lieutenant announced to
the crowd that he was declaring
their gathering an unlawful
assembly, and ordered them to
disperse. He was greeted with jeers
and curses. But when several
squads of police appeared, the

marchers began retreating to 19th
Street, which borders the campus.
Police Intervene
Police followed, and eventually
cleared all picketers to the side
walk.
Before the police moved in,
AFT local leaders cleared as many
AFT picketers and all AFT signs
from the group marching on cam
pus.
"The most significant develop
ment in the AFT strike today was
not the teachers' failure to disrupt
the college, but the defiant action
of student demonstrators who
know now that their teacher
friends have deserted them," Hay
akawa told newsmem later in the
day.
Day's Actions 'Inevitable'
"In view of the fact the AFT
has achieved what power it has by
riding on the coattails of Black
Student Union and Third World
Liberation Front demands, what
happened today was inevitable,"
he continued.
"Although the AFT tried to
picket peacefully on the perimeter
of the campus in keeping with
AFL-CIO traditions, they could
not prevent student strikers from
joining them. Student strikers
therefore crowded the picket
lines; they pushed and jostled and
tripped some of those that tried
to enter the campus. They effec
tively blocked freedom of entry
to the campus for part of the
time, violating the rules laid down
by strike leaders themselves."
Strike Effects Spread
But, Hayakawa's claims to
contrary, AFT local president
Gary Hawkins declared that this
group would remain on strike
until all their demands were met.
