# Mother Fights Selective Service
## 
### DIARMUID McGUIRE 
Evelyn Whitehorn is the kind
of woman who is usually des
cribed as "an attractive mother of
four." Her home is "comfortable"
and "ranch-style," one of many
on the Ford-and-lawn-sprinkler
-1 ined streets of southern Palo
A 1 to.
The younger of her sons may
have longish hair and bell
bottomed trousers, but so do a lot
of kids in that kind of place.
The difference between Evelyn
Whitehorn and her middle-class
neighbors is that she has grasped,
firmly, one of the soft parts of the
American constitutional system.
She won't let go. The federal
government is getting very uncom
fortable.
It seems that the Selective
Service System requires each male
to register his name within five
days of his eighteenth birthday—
the first step in determining his
eligibility for the draft. It also
seems that at the age of 18 a
person has no independent legal
rights.
Third Son
Evelyn's third son, Eric, turned
18 on Oct. 19 last year.
Eric has a long, slightly
hollow-cheeked face, eyes that
seem to see things, a flip sense of
humor and moments of deadly
seriousness. One of the things that
he is serious about is the draft.

Selective service first became
an issue for Eric during Stop the
Draft week in the fall of 1967. He
went down to Oakland and got
arrested with his pockets full of
other people's cigarette butts and
gum wrappers. A kind of Alice's
restaurant in reverse.
Didn't Coincide
"The first time I really thought
about it I realized I wasn't going
to register," Eric says."I decided
what I was and who I wanted to
be, and discovered that it didn't
coincide with the government's
idea of who they thought I was
and who they thought I should
be."
Particularly since their separa
tion from the boys' father three
years ago, the Whitehorns have
done things together. Last August
they sat down to discuss Eric's
decision and hit upon the appar
ent contradiction between a
parent's responsibility for the
actions of her child and the gov
ernment's use of that child for
waging war.
Their strategy became clear:
Evelyn would not permit Eric to
register with the Selective Service
System. Logically it would seem
that she would then be the one to
face prosecution. At least the case
would have to be tested.
The Whitehorns also obtained
the services of Aubrey Grossman,
a well-known liberal attorney, and

took care to inform the press of
their actions.
Apple Pie
This sounds as American as
apple pie, anfl that is exactly how
Evelyn Whitehorn sees herself. "In
a wierd way we're in love with our
constitution and the way our
country started out to be," she
says. "Eut what's wrong with this
stupid government? Sometimes I
have a hard time thinking of it as
mine."
Once the decision to resist was
taken, things started to happen.
On October 21 the family ap
peared before local board No. 62
in San Jose. Evelyn stated that she
would not permit her son to reg
ister, and Eric said that he would
obey his mother. Two days later
another son, Robert, 21, refused
to report for induction.
On Holloween the FBI paid a
visit. The agents made a point of
informing Evelyn that, if she
pursued her case, she could be
charged with conspiracy.
"The conspiracy I won't be
guilty of will be cooperation with
the government to make a crim
inal out of my son," Evelyn says.
(If Eric refused to register on his
own behalf, he would be charged
with and almost certainly con
victed of a felony.)
Scare
"They're trying to scare me
and scare everyone who is sup

porting us," she continues. She
points out some striking parallels
to the Dreyfus case, when a
"scared, panicky government"
threw its legal tradition to the
winds in trying to defend an un
tenable position.
The government took the case
seriously enough to issue a bench
warrant for Eric's arrest Nov.
19—lightning fast in comparison
to the usual speed of the federal
bureaucracy. The news of this
warrant gave Evelyn her worst
moment so far.
Meanwhile Aubrey Grossman
was well into the complex legal
chess match that will eventually
force the federal courts to make a
decision and set a precedent.
Vietnam Central
Of course it is Vietnam that is
at the heart of the Whitehorns'
stand. The strain that she is under
begins to surface in Evelyn White
horn's voice as she remembers the
way the war was repudiated by
the voting public and later esca
lated without benefit of legal or
constitutional process.
"This is a war that nobody but
pride wanted," she says. "Already
they have sent back 30,000
people in plastic bags."
Eric acuses his mother of man
ufacturing a quote and a moment
of tension is past. But the legal
battle is only beginning for the
Whitehorns. Jan. 3 they had their

first hearing in court. The federal
district attorney's office failed to
submit a written brief, and the
case was continued.
On the same day Robert, who
is a junior at San Francisco State,
was indicated for refusing induc
tion, much sooner than could
have been expected if his name
were not Whitehorn.


MOTHER AND SON—Eric Whitehorn and his mother Mrs. Evelyn
Whitehorn face federal prosecution because Mrs. Whitehorn has as
serted her right to refuse to allow her son to register for the draft after
his eighteenth birthday as the law requires.
