## Disaster Coming? 
### 
Editor, THE DAILY:
Both the exhibit by the Con
servation Club in White Plaza, and
Stewart Udall's speech "Is There a
Population Problem?" bring out
the over-whelmingly bad con
sequences of over-population for
the United States.
However it should be em
phasized that the consequences of
over-population for the world as a
whole are even more disastrous.
The following facts are well
documented in either Dr. Paul R.
Ehrlich's The Population Bomb or
in William and Paul Paddock's
Famine —1975! (both of these
books—paperback—are in the
Stanford Bookstore):
(1) Until 1958 food produc
tion in the world was keeping up
with the increasing population of
the world.
(2) However, in 1958 "the
stork passed the plow," to use an
expression of the Paddocks, and
since that time (10 years ago) the
per capita food supply in the

world has been decreasing.
(3) The Paddock brothers
predict that in 1975, and the
more optimistic U.S. Department
of Agriculture predicts that in
1984, food production per capita
in the world will be below the
subsistence level.
(4) It is generally agreed that
nothing can be done to prevent
this population/food crisis-both
population control programs and
agricultural research take time.
However, there is time to learn
from this coming disaster, and to
work to prevent future occur
rences. The U.S. government must
take a greater role in both (1)
supporting birth-control within
the U.S. and throughout the rest
of the world, and (2) greatly in
creasing support for agricultural
research in the tropical climates
(research in this area is practically
non-existent; and the results of
research obtained in the temper
ate climates is generally not appli
cable to tropical areas). Further
more the private citizen must take
the responsibility of limiting his
own family to not more than two
children. In no other way will his
own children and the children of
others have a chance for a life free
from hunger.
