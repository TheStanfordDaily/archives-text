SOPH., JR., SR. and
GRADUATE STUDENTS
Even though you have not taken ROTC training in your first two years of college, you may still
earn both a degree and an Army officer's commission through the Army ROTC TWO-YEAR
PROGRAM!
Through the TWO-YEAR PROGRAM, you can be commissioned as a Second Lieutenant after
taking two years of Army ROTC training while you complete your studies for your college degree.
You can qualify for this program by attending a special six-week summer camp to be held this
summer and then completing the ROTC Advanced Course in your junior and senior years of
college or graduate school.
Here's what ROTC training and an officer's commission will do for you:
It will qualify you to fulfill your military obligation as an officer.
You will learn to organize, motivate, and lead others.
You will receive $50 per month during the two years of the Advanced Course, plus pay and
mileage for summer training.
The training and experience you will receive through the Army ROTC will pay off for the rest
of your life. A decision to take advantage of this new program could be one of the most important
you will ever make.
You owe it to yourself to investigate this important opportunity.
For complete information on the new Army ROTC TWO-YEAR PROGRAM contact the
Professor of Military Science, located on the second floor of the BAC or call 321-2300 Ext. 2554.
