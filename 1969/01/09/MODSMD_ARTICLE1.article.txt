# Coalition Votes To Request Equal Voice On SES
## 
### MARSHALL SCHWARTZ 
The Academic Senate will be
asked today to delegate its power
to pass on recommendations made
by the Study of Education at
Stanford (SES) to a joint student
faculty body.
The recently-formed coalition
of students concerned with the
Study voted late last night to ask
the Senate to set up a separate
body consisting of all members of
the Senate plus an equal number
of students to deliberate on the
proposals.

In a radical turn, the group re
jected a proposal drawn up earlier
in the day by LASSU Speaker
Yale Braunstein which would have
asked the Senate to establish an
advisory committee made up of
all Senators, half that number of
students, and five junior faculty
members who presently are not
represented on the Senate.
Approval Not Expected
Leaders of the Coalition feel
the plan they will submit has little
chance of being approved.

Urged on by the arguments of
Chick Fitts, Grove House tutor
and member of the SES Resi
dences Committee, Mike Wein
stein, former LASSU speaker, and
Myron Filene, a junior in philoso
phy, the group rejected what was
called a "liberal compromise" for
the more militant position by a 90
percent vote.
The Coalition has already laid
down plans of action if, as expec
ted, their proposal is rejected this
afternoon. A leaflet describing the
Senate meeting, scheduled for

3:15, will be prepared and distri
buted to as many students as
possible at dinner.
Another meeting of the group
will also be at 8 p.m. in the
Branner dining room, to discuss
future action.
The full text of the Coalition's
proposal:
Amend the procedures for the
consideration of the SES recom
mendations (item 11.4.C. on the
agenda) as follows:
1. Omitting the Final sentence of
part d. and
2. Adding the following section:
h. A Committee on the Study
of Education at Stanford
shall be established. This
committee shall supersede
the Academic Senate for
the purpose of considering
the SES proposals. The
membership of this commit
tee shall be of two groups:
1) the full membership of
the Academic Senate, and
2) students, their number
to be equal to the number
of voting members of the
Academic Senate.
h. The student members shall
be selected in the same man
ner that students have been
selected for committees of
the Academic Senate or the
University President. Special
effort shall be made to in
clude students who have
worked on the SES reports,
University and Academic
Senate committees, and
concerned members of the
student body.
j. The Committee on SES
shall be the deliberative
body to which floor man
agement committee reports
and other evidence shall be
directed. Its members shall
each have one vote and full
floor privileges.
As of last night, the Coalition
had no faculty member to put
their motion on the floor. Several
Senate members had expressed
willingness to propose the earlier
plan, but it is assumed few of
them would want to support the
revised plan.

MUSICAL SAW SOLOIST—Saw music came to Stanford yesterday as seventy year old Tom Schribner
a retired self-taught musician from Bend, Oregon entertained the local community with songs from the
Oregon backwoods. Schribner, a lumberjack for 57 years, taught himself the ancient but nearly
extinct art 20 years ago after he severed the second finger in his left hand and was no longer able to
play the fiddle. Since that time he has become an expert at his art and has been playing in coffee
houses up and down the coast. He is currently residing in Santa Cruz where he teaches a course at the
free university.

membership of this commit
tee shall be of two groups:
1) the full membership of
the Academic Senate, and
2) students, their number
to be equal to the number
of voting members of the
Academic Senate.
h. The student members shall
be selected in the same man
ner that students have been
selected for committees of
the Academic Senate or the
University President. Special
effort shall be made to in
clude students who have
worked on the SES reports,
University and Academic
Senate committees, and
concerned members of the
student body.
j. The Committee on SES
shall be the deliberative
body to which floor man
agement committee reports
and other evidence shall be
directed. Its members shall
each have one vote and full
floor privileges.
As of last night, the Coalition
had no faculty member to put
their motion on the floor. Several
Senate members had expressed
willingness to propose the earlier
plan, but it is assumed few of
them would want to support the
revised plan.

MUSICAL SAW SOLOIST—Saw music came to Stanford yesterday as seventy year old Tom Schribner
a retired self-taught musician from Bend, Oregon entertained the local community with songs from the
Oregon backwoods. Schribner, a lumberjack for 57 years, taught himself the ancient but nearly
extinct art 20 years ago after he severed the second finger in his left hand and was no longer able to
play the fiddle. Since that time he has become an expert at his art and has been playing in coffee
houses up and down the coast. He is currently residing in Santa Cruz where he teaches a course at the
free university.
The Academic Senate will be
asked today to delegate its power
to pass on recommendations made
by the Study of Education at
Stanford (SES) to a joint student
faculty body.
The recently-formed coalition
of students concerned with the
Study voted late last night to ask
the Senate to set up a separate
body consisting of all members of
the Senate plus an equal number
of students to deliberate on the
proposals.

In a radical turn, the group re
jected a proposal drawn up earlier
in the day by LASSU Speaker
Yale Braunstein which would have
asked the Senate to establish an
advisory committee made up of
all Senators, half that number of
students, and five junior faculty
members who presently are not
represented on the Senate.
Approval Not Expected
Leaders of the Coalition feel
the plan they will submit has little
chance of being approved.

Urged on by the arguments of
Chick Fitts, Grove House tutor
and member of the SES Resi
dences Committee, Mike Wein
stein, former LASSU speaker, and
Myron Filene, a junior in philoso
phy, the group rejected what was
called a "liberal compromise" for
the more militant position by a 90
percent vote.
The Coalition has already laid
down plans of action if, as expec
ted, their proposal is rejected this
afternoon. A leaflet describing the
Senate meeting, scheduled for

3:15, will be prepared and distri
buted to as many students as
possible at dinner.
Another meeting of the group
will also be at 8 p.m. in the
Branner dining room, to discuss
future action.
The full text of the Coalition's
proposal:
Amend the procedures for the
consideration of the SES recom
mendations (item 11.4.C. on the
agenda) as follows:
1. Omitting the Final sentence of
part d. and
2. Adding the following section:
h. A Committee on the Study
of Education at Stanford
shall be established. This
committee shall supersede
the Academic Senate for
the purpose of considering
the SES proposals. The
membership of this commit
tee shall be of two groups:
1) the full membership of
the Academic Senate, and
2) students, their number
