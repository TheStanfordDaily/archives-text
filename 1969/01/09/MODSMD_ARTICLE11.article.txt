## Report On Nixon And Students 
### MARTA MAHONEY 
It is not generally known, but
the appointments of David Pack
ard and Richard Allen to posts in
the Nixon administration are part
of a presidential project that re
quires close co-operation between
Stanford and the Nixon cabinet.
The truth was overheard in a con
versation bewteen Nixon and an
unidentifiable aide.
"What's on my agenda for this
morning?" asked Mr. Nixon.
"Sir, we have a progress report
on our investigation of your
rapport with the college students
of the nation. Pending your
approval, we have organized our
finds into Top Secret Project No.
591790."
"Go ahead."
"Well, sir, our data indicates
that the principal reason for your
estrangement from college
generation is your image. You
have a tendency to remind them
of their fathers, and your having a
daughter and son-in-law in college
doesn't help this any. We propose
to overcome this handicap by a
gradual liberalization of your
image, among the students."
"What are your plans?"
"Sir, I am proud to report that
Whittier was the first to volunteer
to work with you. Unfortunately
it is located in Southern Calif
ornia, and due to a tie-up on the
freeway, will be inaccessible until
1971. We all feel that liberaliza
tion, if it is to come at all, must
occur at once. Stanford has re
commended a two-phase program:
a liberalization of your actual
image, or appearance, and a liber
alization of your actions, which
would involve the use of campus
facilities."
"What do I have to do?"
"The best way to achieve
instant liberalization of your
appearance is to have you photo

graphed in San Francisco with
flowers in your hair."
"I'm trying to make this an
economic administration. Can't
we do it on the White House lawn
with a scale model of the Golden
Gate Bridge in the background?"
"I'm afraid that's impossible,
sir. Mrs. Johnson is taking all the
flowers with her when she leaves.
She's going to beautify the state
of Texas. You will also have to be
photographed during the first
month you are in office, or you
won't have any hair left for us to
put the flowers in. Now, as for the
second part of the project, you
will begin with a rally at Stanford
where you will address the stu
dent body while standing in the
fountain known as Mem Claw."
"What do I say?"
"Our surveys show that the
favorite liberal college words are
as follows: anachronistic, author
ity, capitalist, communication,
complex, confrontation, deplore,
dialogue, education, establish
ment, flexibility, institutions,
meaningful, peace, relevant, re
vitalization, revolution, society,
stagnation, and system. We have
combined these with a list of your
favorite words—America, govern
ment, great, individual, mutual,
politics, private, prosperity, Re
publican, responsibility, and
unity—to produce this special all
purpose liberal college press state
ment: 'I deplore the anachronistic
educational system of . The unity
of America depends upon a revo
lution in the meaningful confron
tation of our great government
and the relevant private indi
vidual. Peace and prosperity in
politics is always the result of a
communication of the revitaliza
tion of the mutual dialogue be
tween the stagnant establishment
complex of society and the re
sponsible, flexible, capitalist auth
ority and institutions of my own

Republican party.' At Stanford
you add, 'An the party of Stan
ford's great son, Herbert Hoover.'
"It's a great plan. But there's
one catch. What if my association
with Stanford, instead of making
me seem more liberal, makes Stan
ford seem more conservative?"

"In that case we must take
drastic measures and—forgive me,
sir—you will have to sign the
graffiti on Hoover Tower."
"We'll meet that crisis when we
come to it,"the President-elect
said grimly. "Now, where did you
put those flowers?"
