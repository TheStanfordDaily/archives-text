# The 						Washington Merry-Go-Round
## Eskimo Against Hickel 
### DREW PEARSON 
An Eskimo named Charlie
Edwardsen, wearing a shirt out,
no jacket, has been calling on
Senators about the new Secretary
of the Interior, Walter J. Hickel,
now governor of Alaska. Edward
sen wears a shirt because he finds
it hot in Washington offices, and
of course the 30-degree weather
here is a lot warmer than the
50-below weather at Point Barrow
where he lives.
Point Barrow is the Alaskan
town nearest to the North Pole.
"It was named for Sir James
Barrow of Lancaster, England,
who financed an expedition to
Alaska in 1818," Charlie explains.
"Actually I live at Utkavik, a fish
ing village near Barrow."
Charlie Edwardsen is in Wash
ington to protect Eskimo land
from the encroachment of oil
companies and to challenge the
confirmation of Wally Hickel as
Secretary of the Interior.
Edwardsen doesn't think
Hickel, an oil and gas man him
self, will be impartial regarding
Eskimo land. Already Hickel has
announced that he would remove
the freeze which Secretary of the
Interior Stewart Udall has put on
the distribution of land until
Congress can act. Hickel indicated

in Seattle last month that he
would unfreeze government land
right away without waiting for
Congress.
"The north slope of Alaska is
58 million acres—about the size of
Pennsylvania," explained Edward
sen. "It contains some of the rich
est oil lands in the world. Gov.
Hickel has estimated the present
oil strike at five to ten billion
barrels, but other estimates of the
surrounding area go up to 40
billion barrels.
"The Eskimo has been hunting
and fishing on this land for
hundreds of years," continued
Edwarsen. "Then the white man
comes along and wants to take it
because of oil. All the white man
thinks about is oil. It was the
Eskimo who showed the white
man oil seeps in 1923, and after
that the Navy set aside an oil re
serve.
"The state of Alaska has 103
million acres given it by the
federal government under state
hood. And the state selected a
block of land at Point Lay, down
here," Edwardsen pointed to the
map. "It's the best polar bear
hunting in the world and also has
excellent coal deposits —about 80
billion tons of coal in about
200,000 acres along the coast."

Polar bears, Charlie said, are
getting scarcer in Alaska. "You
hunt them by airplane," he ex
plained. "So you can't lose. You
fly around until you see a bear. If
you're a bad shot, your guide will
shoot it for you. It costs you
about $2,500 per bear. The
Alaskan big game guides make
about $30,000 to $40,000 a year
through this kind of hunting.
"Let Hickel have his oil," said
Edwardsen, "but we want to
collect a royalty on it when it's
taken from our hunting lands.
They'll take oil the way they took
gold and there'll be nothing left.
The white man makes a killing,
and then he leaves. In Nome,
there were 45,000 inhabitants in
1910. Now there are 2,500. It's
one of the worst slums in the
Arctic.
"There is only one white man
on the entire north slope," ex
plained Charlie. "He has a liquor
store at Mead River, where he
makes money selling whiskey to
the Eskimos.
"How long must we sit by
while creeping wolves sneak away
our territory?" Charlie asked. "We
have fought for Americans in
foreign wars. It was an Eskimo
who first raised the flag on Iwo
Jima.

the freeze which Secretary of the
Interior Stewart Udall has put on
the distribution of land until
Congress can act. Hickel indicated

in Seattle last month that he
would unfreeze government land
right away without waiting for
Congress.
"The north slope of Alaska is
58 million acres—about the size of
Pennsylvania," explained Edward
sen. "It contains some of the rich
est oil lands in the world. Gov.
Hickel has estimated the present
oil strike at five to ten billion
barrels, but other estimates of the
surrounding area go up to 40
billion barrels.
"The Eskimo has been hunting
and fishing on this land for
hundreds of years," continued
Edwarsen. "Then the white man
comes along and wants to take it
because of oil. All the white man
thinks about is oil. It was the
Eskimo who showed the white
man oil seeps in 1923, and after
that the Navy set aside an oil re
serve.
"The state of Alaska has 103
million acres given it by the
federal government under state
hood. And the state selected a
block of land at Point Lay, down
here," Edwardsen pointed to the
map. "It's the best polar bear
hunting in the world and also has
excellent coal deposits —about 80
billion tons of coal in about
200,000 acres along the coast."

Polar bears, Charlie said, are
getting scarcer in Alaska. "You
hunt them by airplane," he ex
plained. "So you can't lose. You
fly around until you see a bear. If
you're a bad shot, your guide will
shoot it for you. It costs you
about $2,500 per bear. The
Alaskan big game guides make
about $30,000 to $40,000 a year
through this kind of hunting.
"Let Hickel have his oil," said
Edwardsen, "but we want to
collect a royalty on it when it's
taken from our hunting lands.
They'll take oil the way they took
gold and there'll be nothing left.
The white man makes a killing,
and then he leaves. In Nome,
there were 45,000 inhabitants in
1910. Now there are 2,500. It's
one of the worst slums in the
Arctic.
"There is only one white man
on the entire north slope," ex
plained Charlie. "He has a liquor
store at Mead River, where he
makes money selling whiskey to
the Eskimos.
"How long must we sit by
while creeping wolves sneak away
our territory?" Charlie asked. "We
have fought for Americans in
foreign wars. It was an Eskimo

An Eskimo named Charlie
Edwardsen, wearing a shirt out,

Senators about the new Secretary
of the Interior, Walter J. Hickel,
now governor of Alaska. Edward
sen wears a shirt because he finds
it hot in Washington offices, and
of course the 30-degree weather
here is a lot warmer than the
50-below weather at Point Barrow
where he lives.
Point Barrow is the Alaskan
town nearest to the North Pole.
"It was named for Sir James
Barrow of Lancaster, England,
who financed an expedition to
Alaska in 1818," Charlie explains.

companies and to challenge the

Edwardsen doesn't think
Hickel, an oil and gas man him
self, will be impartial regarding
Eskimo land. Already Hickel has
announced that he would remove
the freeze which Secretary of the

the distribution of land until
