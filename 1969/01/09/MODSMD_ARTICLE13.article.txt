•Better Jail Than Draft
Editor, THE DAILY:
"How can you be effective in
prison? Wouldn't you be more ef
fective working inside the system
to change it?"

I would like to talk about how
effective I'm going to be in federal
prison while serving time for turn
ing in my draft cards.
This is not going to be a Resis
tance manifesto. I've tried to
understand my actions and their
implications, and I think the im
plications extend beyond resist
ance. I am discussing resistance
solely for need of something solid
to discuss.
These questions assume that
effectiveness should be the first
measure of my act. No. The first
measure should be morality. The
choice I make should be the most
moral one, regardless of "effec
tiveness."
By doing the wrong of being
part of Selective Service, by ac
quiescing in my escape from kill
ing, I say that Selective Service is
a legitimate and proper part of
government. It is not. Selective
Service is an immoral system that
degrades the registrant and the
state. If I am to act from my
beliefs, I am bound to act to end
Selective Service. The most com
plete way I can do this is to say
with my whole self that Selective
Service is immoral, wrong, illegiti
mate. If I say that I feel Selective
Service is wrong, but I accept my
personal exemption from killing, I
am contradicting and betraying
myself.
Effectiveness in changing
people is very uncertain, some
thing like handling cotton
candy—There's not much solid to
hang on to. Because it is so hard
to judge changing other people, I
would question the value of de
pending on ''effectiveness^—

changing men or society. The
world will not have significantly
changed because of my actions by
the time I die. The only person
whose condition I can be fairly
sure of is myself, and it is my
actions that I must be concerned
with.
I have spent a lot of words dis
cussing this matter because it is
usually inadequate to simply say
the center of my stance—that I am
making the most of the one life I
have any control over.

•Years Gone By
Editor, THE DAILY:
Without sounding like the
parent who walked four miles to
school and cherished the paddling,
may I suggest something worth
while about Stanford aside from a
part in its policy.
I remember that the establish
ment was good enough to let me
sit at the feet of David Starr Jor
dan, hear the high pitched but
authentic words of Professor Cub
berly, gain pearls of wisdom from
Dr. Thorndike, be enriched by
quiet suggestions of Elizabeth Lee
Buckingham, be entertained and
enlightened by Margaret Baily,
have conversation with Professors
Emerson, Bassett, and Anderson,
worship the charm of Shakespeare
from the recently deceased Hardin
Craig, chat in the commons with
other great souls, get a glimpse of
Herbert Hoover, welcome the visit
of Japan's Kagawa, and be in
fluenced by others of immeasur
able strength.
