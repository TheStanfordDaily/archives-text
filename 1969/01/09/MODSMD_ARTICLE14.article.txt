### TIM HAIGHT 
"A liberal man named McPhail
Turned all his Resistance
friends pale
With rationalizations
Phony congratulations,
And tales of the gay crowd in
jail."
Which is pretty much what's
been happening to me since I sent
in the card, in case you wanted to
know. That's groovy. Different
strokes for different folks. Of
course, they're still giving the war
and people are still showing up. . .
Peter Ustinov said a pretty
funny thing in the recent issue of
The Center Magazine, something
like: "The difference between a
people's democracy and a normal
democracy is that in a people's
democracy free speech is suppres
sed and therefore goes unheeded,
while in a normal democracy, like
those in the West, free speech is
permitted and therefore goes un
heeded."
He continued, quoting a Polish
diplomat, who said, "Under capi
talism, some people exploit other
people. Here, it's just the other
way around. . . ."
Caught "Hair" in L. A. over
the holidays (funny, sounds like
"caught crabs.") You know, the
hippie folk-rock-love-tribe
musical. Yeah. It's the kind of
thing I always wanted to do for
Gaieties, a cross between a college
musical, the Fillmore (auditorium,
not district), and street theater.
It's pretty good, but not enlight
ening. The kids in the street are
living it while "Hair" sells seats at
$7.50 a throw. Filthy beatniks
out to make it rich. . .
Much more worth the time was
Godart's "Weekend," which was
at that festival at the Surf and is
God knows where now. Really
good. Couple starts out, driving
through France, talking about
how they wish their (his? her?)
parents would die in an auto ac
cident and leave them the money.
All the way down to see the
parents, accident after accident,
which is a cardinal worry in

France right now—about the same
accident rate as the U.S., but
three times the fatalities. More,
walk through woods, see a girl
dressed like little Bo Peep, reading
Flaubert or someone: "The woods
were on fire" with the color of
something-or-other. So they set
her on fire. The medium is the
message, but can it, any more
than the accidents, pierce our
calm?
The film ends up with the
Seine-et-Oise Liberation Front
doing their things in the woods,
with guerrilla uniforms looking
like they were styled by Cardin
with materials from Goodwill.
Menlo Park in a couple of years.
Eight in the middle of the woods,
some cat with a set of drums.
The moral of the story has
something to do with how we cast
our little bit of oil and shark re
pellent around us and forget
about the moon and tides of
violence. Plonk! Critics are so
down. They'll take a piece of
Janis Joplin's heart, pump it with
embalming fluid, and dissect it for
the operating room audience.
Speaking of critics, the Beatles
are sure as hell driving them crazy.
Expecially those "with-it" cats
who are trying to apply rock to
the youth revolution or whatever

they call it (you know, people like
Tim Haight).
Have they finally sold out the
street people with "Revolution"
leaving only the Stones' "Street
Fighting Man" to see us through?
Is that cryptic grunt after "count
me out" really "in" or just
"unnh"? Was it a put-on, like
everything else on that album?
How many Beatles can dance on
the head of a pin? Sexy sadists,
ooh, what have they done?
Heard on KYA or some AM
station about how Clearisil or one
of these acne-preparations now
comes in four skin tones. Four
shades of white, I bet. Put that
along with Band—Aid flesh
colored strips and "flesh" paint in
model airplane kits as the pop-art
of institutional racism.
Meanwhile, SDS circulates
position papers to find something
to do with themselves, the Depart -

ment of Defense takes a Packard,
after Ford and GM, the gas station
attendant in Pismo Beach asks me,
"Is it true the Panthers are about
to riot in San Francisco?" And

Country Joe and the Fish are
giving their farewell concert at the
Fillmore this weekend.
Goodnight, Eldridge Cleaver,
wherever you are.
