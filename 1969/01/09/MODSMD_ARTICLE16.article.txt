## Compromise Reached On New Administrator 
### JACK KAPLAN 
The decision to hire a Mexican-
American administrator in the
provost's office was a compromise
that emerged from a Dead Week

student-faculty-administration
meeting, according to Luis
Nogales, Chairman of the Mexi
can-American Student Confeder
ation (MASC).
MASC had earlier requested
three administrators, including
one in the admissions office and a
Mexican-American counselor in
addition to a member of the pro
vost's office.
The administration had appar
ently met prior to the meeting
with MASC and decided scarce
resources would prevent the im
mediate hiring of more than one

Mexican-American administrator,
according to Nogales.
Attending the meeting were
five members of the faculty and
administration, including Presi
dent Pitzer, Provost Lyman and
Assistant Provost, James Sim
mons, and five Mexican-American
students. Pitzer began the meeting
by informing the students that the
administration was willing to hire
one administrator immediately,
adding that more could be hired
later. The students dcided what
position that administrator would
hold.
A committee was formed to
search for the new administrator.
Not Anti-White
Nogales characterized MASC,
which was formed last September,
as a pro-Mexican-American organi
zation which is not anti-white or
anti-anything. About two-thirds
of Stanford's Mexican-Americans
belong. The other third generally
agree with the organization's ob

jectives but are reluctant to be
identified with the group, accord
ing to Nogales.
MASC, which meets every Sun
day, will choose officers this
week. Letters were sent, last fall,
to all students who identified
themselves as Mexican-Americans.
Because of a mix-up, some letters
did not arrive, according to
Nogales, and new efforts are
planned to reach those Mexican-
Americans who have not joined.

Nogales, a third year law stu
dent, has been speaking with ad
ministrators about the low per
centage of Mexican-American
students at Stanford since 1966.
He says that he encountered no
response until after last spring's
Black Student Union demands, at
which time he began receiving
phone calls from administrators
requesting him to participate in
committees dealing with the prob
lem.
