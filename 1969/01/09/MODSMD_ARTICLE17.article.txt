# Faculty Satisfaction Related To Status
## 
### 
A professor's satisfaction with
his job relates less to his salary
than it does to the status of his
department and the esteem of his
colleageues, a Stanford survey has
discovered. Further, in the faculty
itself lies the greatest potential for
institutional change, but it has
been little used.
The survey was made for a
doctoral degree in education by
Robert R. Hind, staff director of
the Study of Education at
Stanford (SES) and associate dean
of undergraduate education.
He interviewed 100
randomly-selected members of the
Stanford faculty in the School of
Humanities and Sciences, evenly
divided bewteen senior and junior
members, and found in general
that:
Faculty will tend to do those
things that they perceive will be
rewarded and
They will ascribe authority to
those perceived as taking part in
the evaluation process.
"High Status"
Membership in "high status"
departments, the esteem of their
colleagues in their department and
the profession at large (rather
than administrators or other
university colleagues) were the
greatest sources of job
satisfaction, Hind discovered.
"Faculty members were found
to perceive that research and
scholarship are far more
influential in the evaluation
reward process than is teaching,"

Hind's survey revealed, "but
would like to see the difference
reduced to virtual equality.
Younger men and those in the
sciences see research and
scholarship as greater in influence
than do their counterparts,"
suggesting that "research is more
easily judged in the sciences, and
is seen as the route to
advancement by the younger
men."
Evaluation of a man's teaching
ability is done best by his
colleagues in the same field, both
within and without the
institution, indicating, Hind
found, that there was more
identification with the profession
than to the institution. Student
evaluation was regarded as
valuable, he found, but many
observed that student appraisal
was "influential but not reliable."
Creates Tension
Hind found that the emphasis
on research and scholarship
vis-a-vis teaching created a tension
which the faculty itself felt should
be reduced. Respondents
suggested a "slight reduction" in
the need for scholarship and
research ("publish or perish") and
a "large increase" in evaluation of
teaching ability as a reward
criterion. Since the power to
change this lies within the faculty
itself, "failure to do so is no
doubt rooted in a complex of
inertial factors, not the least of
which is ignorance of the system
and of the faculty's collective
power."

than to the institution. Student
evaluation was regarded as
valuable, he found, but many
observed that student appraisal
was "influential but not reliable."
Creates Tension
Hind found that the emphasis
on research and scholarship
vis-a-vis teaching created a tension
which the faculty itself felt should
be reduced. Respondents
suggested a "slight reduction" in
the need for scholarship and
research ("publish or perish") and
a "large increase" in evaluation of
teaching ability as a reward
criterion. Since the power to
change this lies within the faculty
itself, "failure to do so is no
doubt rooted in a complex of
inertial factors, not the least of
which is ignorance of the system
and of the faculty's collective
power."
A professor's satisfaction with
his job relates less to his salary
than it does to the status of his
department and the esteem of his
colleageues, a Stanford survey has
discovered. Further, in the faculty
itself lies the greatest potential for
institutional change, but it has
been little used.
The survey was made for a
doctoral degree in education by
Robert R. Hind, staff director of
the Study of Education at
Stanford (SES) and associate dean
of undergraduate education.
He interviewed 100
randomly-selected members of the
Stanford faculty in the School of
Humanities and Sciences, evenly
divided bewteen senior and junior
members, and found in general
that:
Faculty will tend to do those
things that they perceive will be
rewarded and
They will ascribe authority to
those perceived as taking part in
the evaluation process.
"High Status"
Membership in "high status"
departments, the esteem of their
colleagues in their department and
the profession at large (rather
than administrators or other
university colleagues) were the
greatest sources of job
satisfaction, Hind discovered.
"Faculty members were found
to perceive that research and
scholarship are far more
influential in the evaluation
reward process than is teaching,"

Hind's survey revealed, "but
would like to see the difference
reduced to virtual equality.
Younger men and those in the
sciences see research and
scholarship as greater in influence
than do their counterparts,"
suggesting that "research is more
easily judged in the sciences, and
is seen as the route to
advancement by the younger
men."
Evaluation of a man's teaching
ability is done best by his
colleagues in the same field, both
within and without the
institution, indicating, Hind
found, that there was more
identification with the profession
than to the institution. Student
evaluation was regarded as
valuable, he found, but many
observed that student appraisal
was "influential but not reliable."
