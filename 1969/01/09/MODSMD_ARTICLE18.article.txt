It may be only a few days old, but '69 already looks like a weird
year. j
Yesterday we were lucky enough to receive our first copy of
"Foosnews" in the mail. The New York Times could take a few lessons
from Foosnews, "news by Foosers for Fossers . . . lrom across the
nation."
Foosball (not to be confused with football) is the "newest sport in
America today" according to Foosnews, published by the National
Foosball Association (no kidding). A Wisconsin franchiser wrote in to
complain that people were associating Foosball machines with pinball
machines and refusing to allow them to be installed in public premises.
But the kindly editor of Foosnews was good enough to explain that
"Foosball is not coin operated. Only the balls with which to play are
released upon coin insertion. Foosball is a sport game with head to
head' competition. People playing other people and not against a
machine."
Foosnews, the fastest growing monthly newspaper in America, goes
on to explain: "In Foosball, the person pays for his balls by inserting
the 20 cents to rent a set of balls. The skill that a person can acquire
playing Foosball is another sure sign that this is definitely a sport. Many
Foosers develop tricky shots and have given names to their shots, just
like in bowling. At all times, the players have control over the ball.
Manual dexterity is the key requirement in Foosball- not lady luck!"
Graced by exciting photographs, Foosnews is attractive enough to
make any other publication green with envy. One such photo showed
the architecturally flawless Student Center at Montana State College.
The caption reads: "Through the portals of the Student Union Building
pass the Foosers that are making Foosball history for Montana State."
The legendary Montana State Foosers will undoubtably go down in
sporting history alongside other famous names like Abner Doubleday,
Dr. James Naismith, and Mrs. Maggie Crackie (inventor of the ricky
ticky-stickies which grace so many Volkswagens on West Coast
freeways).
Another photojournalistic first, seen only in Foosnews, showed a
suave, dashing, athletic-looking collegian with his blond, beautiful, cur
vaceous date. The attractive twosome were (you guessed it) playing
Foosball. The clever caption reads: "Why don't some of you Foosers
introduce your best gal to Foosball teach her to play the sport. This
fellow did â€”and from the looks of it, things are working out just fine.
The human interest angle is not ignored by the astute journalistic
minds which create the monthly Foosnews. Witness the following
caption under a picture of a clean-cut, Ail-American family playing
their favorite game: "Mr. Frank Poliner, Controller at Patterson Inter
national Corporation, is a true Foosball enthusiast. He has a Foosball
game in his home which sees action day and night. Mr. Poliner s
younger son, Jeffrey, who will soon be five, plays while standing on
fruit juice cans with a board across the tops. His older boy, Louis, eight
and a half, is also an ardent Fooser. Janice, Mr. Poliner's wife, loves the
game, too." Heartwarming.
