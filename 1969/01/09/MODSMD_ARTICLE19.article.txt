Daily Sports Editor Gary
Cavalli talked with varsity basket
ball coach Howie Dallmar yester
day. Here is their conversation:
Q. Have you been pleased or
disappointed with the
team's overall performance
so far this year?
There have been a lot of dis
appointments and a lot of sur
prises. They've played a real tough
schedule and lost a couple of real
close games. We've had fine per
formances from Griffin, McElwain
and Palmer. The team has done a
real good job on the boards —
that's a pleasant surprise from our
standpoint.
Q. What have been your
major problems?
We've lost several games at the
free throw line. In four of our
seven losses we've had more field
goals than the other team, and
still lost the game. Another prob
lem was when 12 of our players
went through the flu in De
cember.
Q. It goes without saying
that you've been happy
with Don Griffin's perfor-

mance this year, but is there
anyone else whose play has
particularly impressed you?
Griffin, of course, has been
outstanding. Bill Palmer gets
better with each game. It's a
shame he missed most of last year
with that leg injury. He plays a
little bigger than 6-7, and size is
awfully important in this confer
ence. He's getting more experi
ence, so we'll be looking to him
more offensively in the future.
Q. Two sophomores—Mike
Michel and Dennis O'Neill
have seen a great deal of
action. Have they come
along more rapidly than you
anticipated?
Both of them have been de
veloping quickly. O'Neill starts
now, but he's still inexperienced,
so Bill Halligan relieves a lot. Bill's
a good steady player, and he
comes in to give us experience
when we need it. Michel had his
best game Saturday, but we need
more consistency at that forward
position. Both he and junior Bill
Barber have been improving
steadily, however.

Q. How much of a blow to
the team was the loss of
Chuck Moore for the sea
son?
That's the one spot where
we've been using a lot of players.

Chuck was the top defensive for
ward we had, so our problem will
be holding down the opposition's
high-scoring forwards. Besides
Michel and Barber, we've used
Halligan at that spot, and another
sophomore, Fred Green.

Q. Ballhandling, an apparent
weakness in several prior
games, was the difference in
Saturday's win. Any special
reason for the sudden im
provement?
Our ballhandling was all right
in our first two games, but very
poor in the first half against
Cincinnati, Kansas, and Columbia.
I think the improvement last
weekend was another indication
that players like Michel, O'Neill,
Palmer, and Barber are gaining the
needed experience.
Q. How significant of a win
was Saturday's victory over
BYU, in view of upcoming
conference play?
It was a real important win for
us, because we've lost some real
tough games this year. They're a
good, physical team, and beating
them gave us some needed con
fidence before the beginning of
the Pacific-8 season. We're going
to shake up a lot of people.
Q. What are some of the
players' reactions and your
own reactions to the new
Roscoe Maples Pavilion?
We just think it's the greatest
basketball facility we've ever run
into. From both the player's
standpoint and the spectator's
standpoint, you can't ask for any
thing more. It's spacious, yet
people feel they're part of the
game because of the seating ar
rangements.

WORDS OF WISDOM—Coach Howie Dallmar discusses strategy with
his team during a timeout in Saturday's 94-78 Stanford victory over
BYU.
Daily Sports Editor Gary
Cavalli talked with varsity basket
ball coach Howie Dallmar yester
day. Here is their conversation:
Q. Have you been pleased or
disappointed with the
team's overall performance
so far this year?
There have been a lot of dis
appointments and a lot of sur
prises. They've played a real tough
schedule and lost a couple of real
close games. We've had fine per
formances from Griffin, McElwain
and Palmer. The team has done a
real good job on the boards —
that's a pleasant surprise from our
standpoint.
Q. What have been your
major problems?
We've lost several games at the
free throw line. In four of our
seven losses we've had more field
goals than the other team, and
still lost the game. Another prob
lem was when 12 of our players
went through the flu in De
cember.
Q. It goes without saying
that you've been happy
with Don Griffin's perfor-

mance this year, but is there
anyone else whose play has
particularly impressed you?
Griffin, of course, has been
outstanding. Bill Palmer gets
better with each game. It's a
shame he missed most of last year
with that leg injury. He plays a
little bigger than 6-7, and size is
awfully important in this confer
ence. He's getting more experi
ence, so we'll be looking to him
more offensively in the future.
Q. Two sophomores—Mike
Michel and Dennis O'Neill
have seen a great deal of
action. Have they come
along more rapidly than you
anticipated?
Both of them have been de
veloping quickly. O'Neill starts
now, but he's still inexperienced,
so Bill Halligan relieves a lot. Bill's
a good steady player, and he
comes in to give us experience
when we need it. Michel had his
best game Saturday, but we need
more consistency at that forward
position. Both he and junior Bill
Barber have been improving
steadily, however.

Q. How much of a blow to
the team was the loss of
Chuck Moore for the sea
son?
That's the one spot where
we've been using a lot of players.

Chuck was the top defensive for
ward we had, so our problem will
be holding down the opposition's
high-scoring forwards. Besides
Michel and Barber, we've used
Halligan at that spot, and another
sophomore, Fred Green.

Q. Ballhandling, an apparent
weakness in several prior
games, was the difference in
Saturday's win. Any special
reason for the sudden im
provement?
Our ballhandling was all right
in our first two games, but very
poor in the first half against
Cincinnati, Kansas, and Columbia.
I think the improvement last
weekend was another indication
that players like Michel, O'Neill,
Palmer, and Barber are gaining the
needed experience.
Q. How significant of a win
was Saturday's victory over
BYU, in view of upcoming
conference play?
It was a real important win for
us, because we've lost some real
tough games this year. They're a
good, physical team, and beating
them gave us some needed con
fidence before the beginning of
the Pacific-8 season. We're going
to shake up a lot of people.
Q. What are some of the
players' reactions and your
own reactions to the new
Roscoe Maples Pavilion?
We just think it's the greatest
basketball facility we've ever run
into. From both the player's
standpoint and the spectator's
standpoint, you can't ask for any
thing more. It's spacious, yet
people feel they're part of the
game because of the seating ar
rangements.
