# Forget your image, business... Overhaul yourself
## 
### 
Dear Mr. Doan :
Business has cast itself in the
role of the doting parent,
scratching its corporate head
and asking: Now where have I
gone wrong? We on the other
side of the aptly-named
generation gap can readily
answer your question. The
question we can't answer —and
the one you must answer—is
more difficult: What does, and
what will, business do right?
The image that the corporate
world has created in the
academic world is a highly
negative one. Business, which
has sold us everything from
living space to living bras, has
been unable to sell itself.
Hopefully, our dialogue will
help dispel the "business
myth" —although all myths
are based on varying degrees
of truth.
And what exactly is this image?
It's that of a potential vehicle
for social change overcome by
its own inertia. Business has an
immense social power which is
exceeded only by its inadequate
social commitment. This
is not to deny that many major
corporations are involved in
health research, agricultural
improvement, etc. But what we
question is whether business
is really carrying —or plans to
carry- its share of the
social burden.
A psychologist's association
test, for instance, would
yield such verbal gems as
"business" and "air pollution,"
"business" and "war
profiteering," "business" and
"planned obsolescence."
You yourself know only too
well the two-syllable
associative response generated
by "Dow Chemical." It is hard
for us to applaud a new
measles vaccine juxtaposed
with such immoralities.
Thus, many of the qualities we
associate with business are
contrary to our very way of life.
We have awakened from the
sleepy fifties and have begun
to challenge both political and
social tenets. Yet, while we
question our involvement in a
more-than-questionable war,
business apparently closes its
eyes and fills its wallets.
This is what troubles us.
As corny as it sounds, we do
hope to change the world.
Business, meanwhile, is trying
to change its image. But
in so doing, it is merely
creating a battle of antithetical
stereotypes.
Thus unless it decides to give
itself -and not merely its image
— a major overhaul, business
can continue to write off a
growing segment of college
youth. Perhaps our dialogue will
help give the corporate world
the rectal kick it so desperately
needs.

Dear Mr. Chess:
I agree with you that business
has done a wretched job of
selling itself. We tend to feel
that our role in developing the
highest living standards in the
world is self-explanatory, and
doesn't need much selling ; and
we are so busy, and engrossed,
in what we're doing that we
don't really have time to "sell"
what we do.
Simple explanations of why a
company is producing a product
in the national interest don't
provide the answer to "selling"
business, as we at Dow are all
too well aware. The fact that
in the judgment of our military
leaders the tactical use of
napalm is effectively saving lives
of our troops, and serves an
indispensible need in accelerat
ing the end of a dirty and
unpopular war . . . the fact
that there simply is no truth to
reports of massive casualties
among Vietnamese women and
children resulting from napalm
. . . the fact that hundreds of
American doctors who have
volunteered their services in
Vietnamese hospitals report not
having a single civilian napalm
burn case, all are documented
facts blandly ignored by those
not responsive to reason. But
I have yet to hear criticism of
napalm from any returning
combat veteran.
Doesn't this really mean that
judgments should be made on
the basis of objective inquiry
and not unfounded opinion?
Honest differences will always
arise. But a better understand
ing of viewpoints and motives
will follow from objective
discussions. Business must sell
"itself", not an image of itself.
It is from this perspective that
I think we should examine your
central question of "whether
business is really carrying —or
plans to carry —its share of the
social burden."
You are of course aware of
business' direct involvement in
contemporary community
affairs through such programs
as those dealing with hard-core
unemployment, blight-area
housing, civil rights, traffic
congestion, and pollution
problems.To me these programs
are evidence that business today
is assuming a much more active
social role. But this does not
answer two questions funda
mental to your inquiry: to what
extent should business an
economic vehicle whose primary
commitment to the community
lies in its economic functions
assume social burdens ; and
how can these social respon-

sibilities be discharged most
effectively?
Obviously all of society's
institutions must assume some
share of the burden ; there is
no sole responsibility. Can you
visualize a solution in which
only one segment of society
provides equal opportunity for
Negroes?
I believe maximum long-term
profit growth is consistent
with, and in fact cannot be
achieved without, maximum
service to society. Maximum
service to society can be
achieved only through maximum
development of, and release of,
the ability of individuals.
And maximum release of
individual abilities brings about
maximum profit-growth.
Further, in my view, service
cannot be delivered best by
deliberately trying to be of
servicc. Service can more often
be achieved by indirection
than by any direct attempt to
be of service.
Business does so many things
right that I don't really see this
as an issue. We have developed
a system that the rest of the
world is frantically trying to
copy. It is the worst system
going except for all those other
systems. Business can't do
everything for everyone, of
course; it wasn't designed for
that. Like all of us, it should be
doing what it does best. As an
economic instrument, it can
best fulfill its social commitment
by excelling in that respect.
Our nation is going through a
period of transition to new
policies and new philosophies.
Your generation on the campus
is doing us a real service by
questioning our assumptions,
and by making us aware of
hypocrisies and outmoded
parts of our systems and
institutions. You want to do
away with outmoded ideologies,
and so do i. As new values are
accepted which emphasize the
role of the individual in society
today, and new relationships
develop between the public and
private sector of society, then
more realistic answers will be
found as to how business, in
harness with government and
education, can share the social
burden by providing real
rather than illusory service.

plans to carry —its share of the
social burden."
You are of course aware of
business' direct involvement in
contemporary community
affairs through such programs
as those dealing with hard-core
unemployment, blight-area
housing, civil rights, traffic
congestion, and pollution
problems.To me these programs
are evidence that business today
is assuming a much more active
social role. But this does not
answer two questions funda
mental to your inquiry: to what
extent should business an
economic vehicle whose primary
commitment to the community
lies in its economic functions
assume social burdens ; and
how can these social respon-

sibilities be discharged most
effectively?
Obviously all of society's
institutions must assume some
share of the burden ; there is
no sole responsibility. Can you
visualize a solution in which
only one segment of society
provides equal opportunity for
Negroes?
I believe maximum long-term
profit growth is consistent
with, and in fact cannot be
achieved without, maximum
service to society. Maximum
service to society can be
achieved only through maximum
development of, and release of,
the ability of individuals.
And maximum release of
individual abilities brings about
maximum profit-growth.
Further, in my view, service
cannot be delivered best by
deliberately trying to be of
servicc. Service can more often
be achieved by indirection
than by any direct attempt to
be of service.
Business does so many things
right that I don't really see this
as an issue. We have developed
a system that the rest of the
world is frantically trying to
copy. It is the worst system
going except for all those other
systems. Business can't do
everything for everyone, of
course; it wasn't designed for
that. Like all of us, it should be
doing what it does best. As an
economic instrument, it can
best fulfill its social commitment
by excelling in that respect.
Our nation is going through a
period of transition to new
policies and new philosophies.
Your generation on the campus
is doing us a real service by
questioning our assumptions,
and by making us aware of
hypocrisies and outmoded
parts of our systems and
institutions. You want to do
away with outmoded ideologies,
and so do i. As new values are
accepted which emphasize the
role of the individual in society
today, and new relationships
develop between the public and
private sector of society, then
more realistic answers will be
found as to how business, in
harness with government and
education, can share the social
burden by providing real
rather than illusory service.

Dear Mr. Doan :
Business has cast itself in the
role of the doting parent,
scratching its corporate head
and asking: Now where have I
gone wrong? We on the other
side of the aptly-named
generation gap can readily
answer your question. The
question we can't answer —and
the one you must answer—is
more difficult: What does, and
what will, business do right?
The image that the corporate
world has created in the
academic world is a highly
negative one. Business, which
has sold us everything from
living space to living bras, has
been unable to sell itself.
Hopefully, our dialogue will
help dispel the "business
myth" —although all myths
are based on varying degrees
of truth.
And what exactly is this image?
It's that of a potential vehicle
for social change overcome by
its own inertia. Business has an
immense social power which is
exceeded only by its inadequate
social commitment. This
is not to deny that many major
corporations are involved in
health research, agricultural
improvement, etc. But what we
question is whether business
is really carrying —or plans to
carry- its share of the
social burden.
A psychologist's association
test, for instance, would
yield such verbal gems as
"business" and "air pollution,"
"business" and "war
profiteering," "business" and
"planned obsolescence."
You yourself know only too
well the two-syllable
associative response generated
by "Dow Chemical." It is hard
for us to applaud a new
measles vaccine juxtaposed
with such immoralities.
Thus, many of the qualities we
associate with business are
contrary to our very way of life.
We have awakened from the
sleepy fifties and have begun
to challenge both political and
social tenets. Yet, while we
question our involvement in a
more-than-questionable war,
business apparently closes its
eyes and fills its wallets.
This is what troubles us.
As corny as it sounds, we do
hope to change the world.
Business, meanwhile, is trying
to change its image. But
in so doing, it is merely
creating a battle of antithetical
stereotypes.
Thus unless it decides to give
itself -and not merely its image
— a major overhaul, business
can continue to write off a
growing segment of college
youth. Perhaps our dialogue will
help give the corporate world
the rectal kick it so desperately
needs.

Dear Mr. Chess:
I agree with you that business
has done a wretched job of
selling itself. We tend to feel
that our role in developing the
highest living standards in the
world is self-explanatory, and
doesn't need much selling ; and
we are so busy, and engrossed,
in what we're doing that we
don't really have time to "sell"
what we do.
Simple explanations of why a
company is producing a product
in the national interest don't
provide the answer to "selling"
business, as we at Dow are all
too well aware. The fact that
in the judgment of our military
leaders the tactical use of
napalm is effectively saving lives
of our troops, and serves an
indispensible need in accelerat
ing the end of a dirty and
unpopular war . . . the fact
that there simply is no truth to
reports of massive casualties
among Vietnamese women and
children resulting from napalm
. . . the fact that hundreds of
American doctors who have
volunteered their services in
Vietnamese hospitals report not
having a single civilian napalm
burn case, all are documented
facts blandly ignored by those
not responsive to reason. But
I have yet to hear criticism of
napalm from any returning
combat veteran.
Doesn't this really mean that
judgments should be made on
the basis of objective inquiry
and not unfounded opinion?
Honest differences will always
arise. But a better understand
ing of viewpoints and motives
will follow from objective
discussions. Business must sell
"itself", not an image of itself.
It is from this perspective that
I think we should examine your
central question of "whether

measles vaccine juxtaposed

Thus, many of the qualities we
associate with business are
contrary to our very way of life.
We have awakened from the

Business, meanwhile, is trying

in so doing, it is merely

Thus unless it decides to give
itself -and not merely its image

can continue to write off a

help give the corporate world

Dear Mr. Chess:
I agree with you that business
has done a wretched job of
selling itself. We tend to feel
that our role in developing the
highest living standards in the
world is self-explanatory, and
doesn't need much selling ; and
we are so busy, and engrossed,
in what we're doing that we
don't really have time to "sell"
what we do.
Simple explanations of why a
company is producing a product
in the national interest don't
provide the answer to "selling"
business, as we at Dow are all
too well aware. The fact that
in the judgment of our military
leaders the tactical use of
napalm is effectively saving lives
of our troops, and serves an
indispensible need in accelerat
ing the end of a dirty and
unpopular war . . . the fact
that there simply is no truth to
reports of massive casualties
among Vietnamese women and
children resulting from napalm
. . . the fact that hundreds of
American doctors who have
volunteered their services in
Vietnamese hospitals report not
having a single civilian napalm
burn case, all are documented
facts blandly ignored by those
not responsive to reason. But
I have yet to hear criticism of
napalm from any returning
combat veteran.
Doesn't this really mean that
judgments should be made on
the basis of objective inquiry
and not unfounded opinion?
Honest differences will always
arise. But a better understand
ing of viewpoints and motives
will follow from objective
discussions. Business must sell
"itself", not an image of itself.
It is from this perspective that
I think we should examine your
central question of "whether
business is really carrying —or
plans to carry —its share of the
social burden."
You are of course aware of
business' direct involvement in
contemporary community
affairs through such programs
as those dealing with hard-core
unemployment, blight-area
housing, civil rights, traffic
congestion, and pollution
problems.To me these programs
are evidence that business today
is assuming a much more active
social role. But this does not
answer two questions funda
mental to your inquiry: to what
extent should business an
economic vehicle whose primary
commitment to the community
lies in its economic functions
assume social burdens ; and
how can these social respon-

sibilities be discharged most
effectively?
Obviously all of society's
institutions must assume some
share of the burden ; there is
no sole responsibility. Can you
visualize a solution in which
only one segment of society
provides equal opportunity for
Negroes?
I believe maximum long-term
profit growth is consistent
with, and in fact cannot be
achieved without, maximum
service to society. Maximum
service to society can be
achieved only through maximum
development of, and release of,
the ability of individuals.
And maximum release of
individual abilities brings about
maximum profit-growth.
Further, in my view, service
cannot be delivered best by
deliberately trying to be of
servicc. Service can more often
be achieved by indirection
than by any direct attempt to
be of service.
Business does so many things
right that I don't really see this
as an issue. We have developed
a system that the rest of the
world is frantically trying to
copy. It is the worst system
going except for all those other
systems. Business can't do
everything for everyone, of
course; it wasn't designed for
that. Like all of us, it should be
doing what it does best. As an
economic instrument, it can
best fulfill its social commitment
by excelling in that respect.
Our nation is going through a
period of transition to new
policies and new philosophies.
Your generation on the campus
is doing us a real service by
questioning our assumptions,
and by making us aware of
hypocrisies and outmoded
parts of our systems and
institutions. You want to do
away with outmoded ideologies,
and so do i. As new values are
accepted which emphasize the
role of the individual in society
today, and new relationships
develop between the public and
private sector of society, then
more realistic answers will be
found as to how business, in
harness with government and
education, can share the social
burden by providing real
rather than illusory service.

Dear Mr. Doan :
Business has cast itself in the
role of the doting parent,
scratching its corporate head
and asking: Now where have I
gone wrong? We on the other
side of the aptly-named
generation gap can readily
answer your question. The
question we can't answer —and
the one you must answer—is
more difficult: What does, and
what will, business do right?
The image that the corporate
world has created in the
academic world is a highly
negative one. Business, which
has sold us everything from
living space to living bras, has
been unable to sell itself.
Hopefully, our dialogue will
help dispel the "business
myth" —although all myths
are based on varying degrees
of truth.
And what exactly is this image?
It's that of a potential vehicle
for social change overcome by
its own inertia. Business has an
immense social power which is
exceeded only by its inadequate
social commitment. This
is not to deny that many major
corporations are involved in
health research, agricultural
improvement, etc. But what we
question is whether business
is really carrying —or plans to
carry- its share of the
social burden.
A psychologist's association
test, for instance, would
yield such verbal gems as
"business" and "air pollution,"
"business" and "war
profiteering," "business" and
"planned obsolescence."
You yourself know only too
well the two-syllable
associative response generated
by "Dow Chemical." It is hard
for us to applaud a new
measles vaccine juxtaposed
with such immoralities.
Thus, many of the qualities we
associate with business are

copy. It is the worst system
going except for all those other
systems. Business can't do
everything for everyone, of
course; it wasn't designed for
that. Like all of us, it should be
doing what it does best. As an
economic instrument, it can
best fulfill its social commitment
by excelling in that respect.
Our nation is going through a
period of transition to new
policies and new philosophies.
Your generation on the campus
is doing us a real service by
questioning our assumptions,
and by making us aware of
hypocrisies and outmoded
parts of our systems and
institutions. You want to do
away with outmoded ideologies,
and so do i. As new values are
accepted which emphasize the
role of the individual in society
today, and new relationships
develop between the public and
private sector of society, then
more realistic answers will be
found as to how business, in
harness with government and
education, can share the social
burden by providing real
rather than illusory service.
Cordially, „
H. D. Doan, President,
