# Faculty To Grow, Too
## Enrollment Increase Seen In Future 
### 
Looking a decade ahead, Stan
ford anticipates a 20 to 30 per
cent increase in faculty size, with
enrollment rising from 11,500 to
about 12,800.
Reflecting higher personal in
come, tuition may rise from next
year's rate of $2145 to $3330 by
1977-78.
Even so, projected income may
fall short of minimum expendi
ture levels by $2 million annually
by 1971 and $4 million annually
by 1978.
These trends highlight the Uni
versity's annual financial report
for 1967-68, written by Vice Pres
ident Kenneth M. Cuthbertson
and distributed to all faculty
members this week.
The report shows University
operating expenditures totaled
$115 million last year, excluding
nearly $26 million for the Stan
ford Linear Accelerator Center
(SL AC)~nearly twice the $68
million spent five years ago.
Support Varies
"Dollars are important means
to university ends but are a poor
yardstick for educational achieve
ment," Cuthbertson notes. Where
one professor may supervise sev
eral million dollars in research
projects in the physical sciences,
for example, another may spend
only a few hundred for classical
studies.
"We have come thorugh an
extraordinary period of rapidly in
creasing expenditure," Cuthbert
son says of Stanford. "Although
we don't expect the rate of in
crease to continue, the dollar
amounts of necessary future in
creases and the uncertainty of in
come are alarming."

Total expenditures more than
quadrupled in the past decade but
are expected to double in the next
10 years to a level of $250 million
or more.
Drawing on studies by Prince
ton University Provost William G.
Bowen, Cuthbertson notes that
"over many decades, the educa
tional cost per student has risen at
a rate much greater than the
national economy.
"This rising cost per student is
not due to any lack of budget
pressures or lack of technological
innovations.
New, But Costly
"The best universities, under
financial pressures, have devel
oped advanced systems and pro
cedures for their business and
service operations, for library
activities, and for teaching aids."
While university costs have
risen at a higher rate than the
national economy, education has
important social benefits. Studies
published by the Carnegie Cor
poration attribute nearly half
(40%) of the increase in total

national income to advances in
knowledge and rising skill levels in
the work force.
During the post-World War II
period, Cuthbertson notes, "Stan
ford's academic leadership saw to
it that the University made maxi
mum use of government support
wherever it fit Stanford's objec
tives."
This, in turn, allowed a rela
tively higher allocation of other
funds to academic fields not
heavily supported by the govern
ment. Thus the overall progress of
the University was enhanced by
the focus of federal support on
quality contributions in research
and graduate training . . .
Important Asset
"(Now) certain political forces
are competing with the notion
that the very best universities are
critically important assets to the
strength of the nation.
"We have an important job still
undoneâ€”to convince Congress as
well as the Executive branch of
government that it is as important
that the best get better as it is for
the good to multiply."

A pioneer in long-range fin
ancial forecasting among univer
sities, Stanford now anticipates an
increasingly higher rate of return
on its $210 million endowment,
"a continuing upward trend in
government support for student
aid and libraries, and a sustained
volume of ederally sponsored re
search."
Adoption of recent proposals
for low interest rate student loans
to be repaid from additions to
personal income taxes "could
allow a further increase in tuition
income, with student fees as
suming a larger proportion of the
University's full costs," Cuthbert
son notes.
"(But) we doubt that changes
in federal policy or plans to
spread the students' cost (over a
greater time span) are going to
solve Stanford's income problem
in the next 10 years."
Instead, the University will
have to rely on increased recogni
tion of Stanford's position as a
"peak of excellence" in the West
and "translate this into even more
extraordinary gift support."
