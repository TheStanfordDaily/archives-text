# Male Grad Student Enrollment Decline
## 
### 
Student Registration for the
first two days of winter quarter at
Stanford in virtually unchanged
from a year ago, but graduate
male enrollment has dropped
more than 300 since last quarter
Registrar Harvey Hall reported
yesterday.
Whether this is due to in
creased draft calls or because stud
ents are staying out of school in
anticipation of being drafted still
cannot be determined.

In all, 4076 graduate men en
rolled during the first two days of
winter quarter. This compares
with a total of 4271 at the same
time a year ago and a final enrol
lment figure of 4,383 for the fall
quarter, which ended in Dec
ember.
Fall quarter enrollment total
led 11,300 at the close of registra
tion. Total enrollment at this
point shows 10,680 students,
compared with 10,692 at the
same time last year.
