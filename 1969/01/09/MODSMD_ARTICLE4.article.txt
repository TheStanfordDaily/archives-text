# Seminars Demanded, Major-Changing Threat
## 
### DENNIS PERLUSS 
Petitions demanding credit by
next week for five student
-initiated, graduate student-led
courses were approved by more
than 60 disaffected Political
Science undergraduates and TA's
at a stormy meeting yesterday
afternoon.
The students intend to with
draw from the department if ap
proval is not obtained. The peti
tions set a deadline of Thursday,
January 16, for action by the Pol
itical Science faculty on the pro
posed courses.
The students also voted to re
quest group directed reading from
various members of the depart
ment using reading lists prepared
with the aid of TA's.

Although most students felt
that this action would only pro
vide a temporary solution, they
decided that all established
methods of change should be util
ized before more drastic measures
are attempted.
First Response
The meeting and the petitions
were the first response to the re
fusal of the Political Science de
partment to allow 11 courses
designed for this quarter as an
alternative to the present offerings
of the department.
More than 100 undergraduate
and graduate students had drawn
up the lsit of courses in early
December as their answer to what
they termed irrelevancy and is
sue-orientation in their depart
ment's courses.
The department responded on
December 12 with an interim pol
icy memorandum requiring sub
mission of reading lists and course
outlines by December 23, along
with faculty sponsorship.
Insufficient Notice
The course organizers claimed
at yesterday's meeting that the
faculty had not given them suffic
ient notice of these requirements.
Many of those interested in direc
ting the courses had already left
for Christmas vacation by
December 12.
As a result only three courses
were submitted for approval
under these guidelines. For
various reasons none emerged suc
cessfully.
Professor Raymond Wolfinger,
who serves on the faculty plans
and policv committee, attended

yesterday's meeting and explained
that part of the reason the eourse
on black politics was not
approved was that a comparable
course will be offered Spring quar
ter.
Approval Withdrawn?
Wolfinger further stated that
his committee understood that
the faculty sponsors of the other
two courses, Profs. Robert North
and Joe Paff, had withdrawn their
approval; no further consideration
was deemed necessary.
Paff, who was also present yes
terday, was unable to attend the
meeting which determined the
fate of his sponsored course be
cause of the flu. He denied, how
ever, that he had told a colleague
that he had withdrawn his sup
port.
After the virtual shouting
match which followed Paff's state
ment, Wolfinger apologized for
the misunderstanding and said the
committee would reconsider the
proposed course.
Wolfinger vehemently declared,
however, that no further consider
ation would be given to the other
courses demanded by the peti
tioning students. A regularly
scheduled faculty meeting is
planned for the day before the
deadline, however, and depart
ment head Richard Fagen said last
night that the demands would
"undoubtedly" be discussed.
Strike Suggested
David Pugh, undergraduate pol
itical science student, read the
petition which was the product of
a small meeting held Tuesday.

Pugh declared that this group fav
ored a strike by undergraduates if
the petition and withdrawal
proved ineffectual.
SDS leader Fred Cohen, noting
similar attempts to establish left
ist-oriented courses in other de
partments, proposed that the
group demand the establishment
of a Department of Left Studies
by next fall.
Neither this proposal nor
Pugh's suggestion for a strike and
possible disruption of department
courses were brought to a vote.
Government Involvement
TA Frank Cassidy voiced his
opinion that the current dissatis
faction with courses was due to
the pro-establishment oreintation
of professors, many of whom he
claimed involved in government
and military research projects.
Cohen continued that the call
for these new courses indicates a
rejection of the basic approach of
the department, and the channel
ing of graduate student talents.
In a frequently-interrupted at
tempt to answer these charges,
Wolfinger dscribed as nonsense
any characterization of a profes
sor's political philosophy on the
basis of whether or not he receives
research grants from the federal
government.
No Monolith
Wolfinger further declared that
Stanford's Political Science de
partment is far from being a
monolith and that many of the
complaints voiced at the meeting
were similar to those raised by
faculty members.

tions set a deadline of Thursday,
January 16, for action by the Pol
itical Science faculty on the pro
posed courses.
The students also voted to re
quest group directed reading from
various members of the depart
ment using reading lists prepared
with the aid of TA's.

Although most students felt
that this action would only pro
vide a temporary solution, they
decided that all established
methods of change should be util
ized before more drastic measures
are attempted.
First Response
The meeting and the petitions
were the first response to the re
fusal of the Political Science de
partment to allow 11 courses
designed for this quarter as an
alternative to the present offerings
of the department.
More than 100 undergraduate
and graduate students had drawn
up the lsit of courses in early
December as their answer to what
they termed irrelevancy and is
sue-orientation in their depart
ment's courses.
The department responded on
December 12 with an interim pol
icy memorandum requiring sub
mission of reading lists and course
outlines by December 23, along
with faculty sponsorship.
Insufficient Notice
The course organizers claimed
at yesterday's meeting that the
faculty had not given them suffic
ient notice of these requirements.
Many of those interested in direc
ting the courses had already left
for Christmas vacation by
December 12.
As a result only three courses
were submitted for approval
under these guidelines. For
various reasons none emerged suc
cessfully.
Professor Raymond Wolfinger,
who serves on the faculty plans
and policv committee, attended

yesterday's meeting and explained
that part of the reason the eourse
on black politics was not
approved was that a comparable
course will be offered Spring quar
ter.
Approval Withdrawn?
Wolfinger further stated that
his committee understood that
the faculty sponsors of the other
two courses, Profs. Robert North
and Joe Paff, had withdrawn their
approval; no further consideration
was deemed necessary.
Paff, who was also present yes
terday, was unable to attend the
meeting which determined the
fate of his sponsored course be
cause of the flu. He denied, how
ever, that he had told a colleague
that he had withdrawn his sup
port.
After the virtual shouting
match which followed Paff's state
ment, Wolfinger apologized for
the misunderstanding and said the
committee would reconsider the
proposed course.
Wolfinger vehemently declared,
however, that no further consider
ation would be given to the other
courses demanded by the peti
tioning students. A regularly
scheduled faculty meeting is
planned for the day before the
deadline, however, and depart
ment head Richard Fagen said last
night that the demands would
"undoubtedly" be discussed.
Strike Suggested
David Pugh, undergraduate pol
itical science student, read the
petition which was the product of
a small meeting held Tuesday.

Pugh declared that this group fav
ored a strike by undergraduates if
the petition and withdrawal
proved ineffectual.
SDS leader Fred Cohen, noting
similar attempts to establish left
ist-oriented courses in other de
partments, proposed that the
group demand the establishment
of a Department of Left Studies
by next fall.
Neither this proposal nor
Pugh's suggestion for a strike and
possible disruption of department
courses were brought to a vote.
Government Involvement
TA Frank Cassidy voiced his
opinion that the current dissatis
faction with courses was due to
the pro-establishment oreintation
of professors, many of whom he
claimed involved in government
and military research projects.
Cohen continued that the call
for these new courses indicates a
rejection of the basic approach of
the department, and the channel
ing of graduate student talents.
In a frequently-interrupted at
tempt to answer these charges,
Wolfinger dscribed as nonsense
any characterization of a profes
sor's political philosophy on the
basis of whether or not he receives
research grants from the federal
government.
No Monolith
Wolfinger further declared that
Stanford's Political Science de
partment is far from being a
monolith and that many of the
complaints voiced at the meeting
were similar to those raised by
faculty members.
Petitions demanding credit by
next week for five student
-initiated, graduate student-led
courses were approved by more
than 60 disaffected Political
Science undergraduates and TA's
at a stormy meeting yesterday
afternoon.
The students intend to with
draw from the department if ap
proval is not obtained. The peti
tions set a deadline of Thursday,
January 16, for action by the Pol
