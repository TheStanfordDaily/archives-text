# Striking Students, Teachers Battle Police At SF State
## 
### ASSOCIATED PRESS 
Striking students and teachers,
hurling fireworks, sticks and
stones, battled police in a wild dis
order in front of San Francisco
State College yesterday.
One striker was knocked down
and injured by a street car and a
television reporter suffered head
injuries from thrown objects.
Nine persons were arrested as
100 police, including a score of
horsemen, broke up the sudden
outbreak by about 1,000 pickets
at the main entrance.
Split into two groups, the
demonstrators continued to
march and scream curses at police
and students who sought to go to
classes.
Long Series
The disorder was the lastest in
a series since the Black Students
Union and the Third World Lib
eration Front began a violent
strike November 6.
A majority of students and in
structors at the 18,000 student
college continued to attend classes
and passed through small, peace
ful picket lines during the morn
ing.
The picket line grew to about
1,000 in the afternoon and threat
ened campus-bound pedestrians.

A dozen police moved in and
ordered them to open a corridor.
A shoving match enused. The
crowd split and spilled into 19th
Avenue, a busy thoroughfare.
The crowd threw rocks, bottles
and two-by-four lumber at the
police.
The divided crowd hurled a
cherry bomb and large fire
crackers at police.
Mounted policemen galloped
up and down alongside the two
groups on opposite sides of the
street.
Obscenities
There was a constant scream of
curses and obscenities at the of
ficers.
Periodically police dashed in
and made arrests of strike leaders.
The striking American Federa
tion of Teachers came under
heavy verbal fire from many
quarters for having gotten mixed
up in the minority student strike,
especially from Governor Ronald
Reagan.
In Sacramento, the Governor
urged that "society take a stand
against this barbaric force."
San Fernando Valley
At San Fernando Valley State
College yesterday 100 policemen
armed with batons charged into
about 1,000 student demon
strators trying to force their way

into the administration building.
The clash came after a noon rally
to discuss Negro student demands.
The demonstrators, marching
in columns eight abreast, were dis
persed quickly.
Four persons were reported in
jured, including a coed and two
city of Los Angeles policemen
who police said were hospitalized
after being kicked.
Arrests
At least 14 demonstrators were
arrested on charges ranging from
obstructing lawful business to
destructing of property—throwing
a rock through a window.
Those arrested were jailed in
nearby Van Nuys. As rumors
spread that students planned a
march on the jail, shotgun car
rying police were stationed out
side it and nine City of Los
Angeles police divisions were
placed on alert.
The first day of a teachers'
strike passed peacefully at San
Jose State yesterday as about 150
teachers and some students
picketed the 19,000 student cam
pus. The only incident—a cherry
bomb thrown from a high-rise
dormitory exploded at the feet of
a picketing professor, without
causing injury. Police stayed off
the campus except for a few plain
clothesmen.

persed quickly.
Four persons were reported in
jured, including a coed and two
city of Los Angeles policemen
who police said were hospitalized
after being kicked.
Arrests
At least 14 demonstrators were
arrested on charges ranging from
obstructing lawful business to
destructing of property—throwing
a rock through a window.
Those arrested were jailed in
nearby Van Nuys. As rumors
spread that students planned a
march on the jail, shotgun car
rying police were stationed out
side it and nine City of Los
Angeles police divisions were
placed on alert.
The first day of a teachers'
strike passed peacefully at San
Jose State yesterday as about 150
teachers and some students
picketed the 19,000 student cam
pus. The only incident—a cherry
bomb thrown from a high-rise
dormitory exploded at the feet of
a picketing professor, without
causing injury. Police stayed off
the campus except for a few plain
clothesmen.
Striking students and teachers,
hurling fireworks, sticks and
stones, battled police in a wild dis
order in front of San Francisco
State College yesterday.
One striker was knocked down
and injured by a street car and a
television reporter suffered head
injuries from thrown objects.
Nine persons were arrested as
100 police, including a score of
horsemen, broke up the sudden
outbreak by about 1,000 pickets
at the main entrance.
Split into two groups, the
demonstrators continued to
march and scream curses at police
and students who sought to go to
classes.
Long Series
The disorder was the lastest in
a series since the Black Students
Union and the Third World Lib
eration Front began a violent
strike November 6.
A majority of students and in
structors at the 18,000 student
college continued to attend classes
and passed through small, peace
ful picket lines during the morn
ing.
The picket line grew to about
1,000 in the afternoon and threat
ened campus-bound pedestrians.

A dozen police moved in and
ordered them to open a corridor.
A shoving match enused. The
crowd split and spilled into 19th
Avenue, a busy thoroughfare.
The crowd threw rocks, bottles
and two-by-four lumber at the
police.
The divided crowd hurled a
cherry bomb and large fire
crackers at police.
Mounted policemen galloped
up and down alongside the two
groups on opposite sides of the
street.
Obscenities
There was a constant scream of
curses and obscenities at the of
ficers.
Periodically police dashed in
and made arrests of strike leaders.
The striking American Federa
tion of Teachers came under
heavy verbal fire from many
quarters for having gotten mixed
up in the minority student strike,
especially from Governor Ronald
Reagan.
In Sacramento, the Governor
urged that "society take a stand
against this barbaric force."
