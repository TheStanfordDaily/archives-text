# Counseling Center: 'The Students' Friend'
## 
### Susan Sward 
The Counseling and Testing Center is "the
student's friend," says John D. Black, director.
In an interview with The Daily earlier this week,
Black spoke of the past history of the Center.
"It was established in 1950," said Black, who has
directed the Center ever since then. "It was set up as
a centralized agency where a student could come in
and find somebody to talk to."
The Counseling and Testing Center, which is
contained administratively within the Dean of
Students Office, sets as its major concern the whole
student—his intellectual and personal development.
Personal Hang-ups
"Over the years we see about forty-five percent
of the undergraduates for some kind of help," Black
continued. "A lot of students' problems have to do
with the typical personal hang-ups—parents, boy
friends or roommates."
Black emphasized that the staff of 10 psychol
ogists at the Center, not all of whom are full-time,
have found students' problems increasingly revolve
around value questions. The common question a
student perturbed about values will ask, according
to Black, is, "Is all this stuff worthwhile, anyway?"
Speaking of the various services Counseling and
Testing performs for the student body, Black men
tioned individual interviews with trained personnel,
encounter groups, aptitude testing, vocational and

placement advising, faculty advising, research, teach
ing and student skills programs such as speed read
courses.
Encounter Groups
When asked about the value of encounter groups
at Stanford, Black replied, "For certain kinds of
problems, the encounter groups can be better than
individual counseling.
"The encounter group movement has so mush
roomed that everybody is in on the act, "Black
noted. "When we sponsor any group, we like to
have professional persons running them. The
presence of the professional person tends to give
people confidence because they feel he will step in
and facilitate the directive process of the group."
While discussing the relationship between the
administration and the Counseling and Testing
Center, Black admitted that the relationship has not
always been a smooth one.
"We try to prod the administration into seeing
students as human beings rather than as intellectual
animals. The Center has been somewhat auton
omous with confidential records to which the Dean
of Students himself does not have access."
Center Psychiatrists
During the interview Black touched upon the
Center's current connection with Health Center
psychiatrists. Dr. David Dorosin, head of psychiatry
at the Health Center, expanded upon that rela
tionship.

"I am not certain what people think is the de
marcation between the two operations," Dorosin
said. "The major difference is the people staffing
the two organizations. I don't know if that's the
way it should be, but that's the way it is."
Dorosin also discussed one of the forth-coming
Study of Education at Stanford (SES) proposals
which recommends that the psychiatry and Counsel
ing and Testing units be merged into one operation.
"I see nothing fundamentally wrong in principle
with pooling the efforts of the two operations,"
Dorosin said. "One practical problem would be
space. Where would the combined operation be
located?"
Dr. Edwin Good, Chairman of the SES Commit
tee which has studied advising and counseling at
Stanford, also had some observations to make for
the Daily on, role of the Counseling and Testing
Center at Stanford.
Good feels that basically the Center provides a
very valuable function for the University. He did list
some criticisms, however.
"I think the Center could be a little more aggres
sive in getting business," Good commented, "but
this is really only a minor criticism.
Inadequate Funds
Black admitted that the criticism was a valid one
and spoke of the problem the Center faces in trying

to adequately meet the demands it already faces
because of lack of adequate staff and funds.
Good did go on the mention one area where he
feels more extensive criticism in necessary: the area
of research done by members of the Counseling and
Testing staff.
"The problem is that the sort of research the
Counseling and Testing staff has done has not been
particularly related to University policy at the time.
When their research recommendations have been re
jected by the administration, the recommendations
have been rejected on the grounds that they were
not a valid interpretation of the data presented."
Too Liberal
Good rejected the possibility that the administra
tion had turned down some of the Center research
proposals because the Center's interpretation of the
data was too liberal for the administration.
The Chairman of the SES Committee on Ad
vising and Counseling concluded that, "Nobody is
saying that Counseling and Testing is no good. We're
trying to make it better."
When the opinions of persons who are concerned
with the role of Counseling and Testing at Stanford
are viewed, there seems to be no violent controversy
ragin over the Center's function. There exists, how
ever, a great diversity of opinion as to precisely how
that role should be maintained, expanded or revised.


JOHN D. BLACK, Director of
the Counseling and Testing
Center, considers the center "the
students' friend." Dr. Edwin
Good, Chairman of the SES com
mittee which has studies the
center believes "the Center could
be a little more aggressive in get
ting business . . "
