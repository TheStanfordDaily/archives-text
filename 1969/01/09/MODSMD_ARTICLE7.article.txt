# The 						Holy War

### 
Political and economic wars are bad enough, but the
bitterest and most destructive conflict is the holy war. Holy
war is what we have at San Francisco State.
"Colleges today are very much what,the medieval C hurch
was-all of that to which the hopes of human salvation are
entrusted," says acting president S. I. (Don) Hayakawa. I
am seen as a man set out to protect this sacred institution.
Hayakawa's vision coincides with that of diplomat and
establishment scholar George Kennan. In a kind ol
Gregorian chant transcribed by January's Readers Digest,
Kennan describes the ideal environment tor "learning. It is
based on "a certain remoteness from the contemporary
scene-a certain detachment and seclusion, a voluntary
withdrawal and renunciation ol participation in
contemporary life in the interests of the achievement ol a
better perspective when the period ot withdrawal is over.
Hayakawa and Kennan both assume that the role of
institutions within a society should remain more or less the
same over the years. Thus if universities and monestaries
served to preserve our "intellectual treasure (to quote a
local administrator) during Europe's dark ages, there is no
reason why they should not do the Sctme thing today.
In fact there have been several advances in the science of
information storage and retrieval during the past 1500
years.

It would seem that the role of educational institutions
might change in response to new technology alone. But,
surprisingly enough, society itself has also changed in the
past 1 5 centuries.
Not many people had time for scholarship during the
middle ages. They were involved with things like finding
food, making clothes, getting sick and going on crusades.
Today in this country more than half of all young people
pursue their education after completing the basic 12-year
course. In California, which is noted for its large public
college and university systems, the percentage is probably
higher.
In an age when many important things were preserved in
the heads of a few individuals, perhaps there was more
reason for a "voluntary withdrawal and renunciation of
participation in contemporary 1ife...." Today the
academic ideal seems to be an excuse for disenfranchising,
not to mention castrating, large numbers of energetic,
socially concerned people.
Finally there is the fact that, in the eyes of many
students, the society of which they are a part is engaging in
criminal acts. It is killing people in the name of some
ideological and economic system. In order to eliminate
dissenters from the American dream, our nation is diverting
resources from the needs of those who want to share that
dream.
In response to this kind of observation, Kennan deplores
the certainty of student leftists that they are "correct."
"Such convictions seem particularly out of place at just this
time," he says. It is a complex business. Study it.he tells us.
But it is because we in the universities must study the
world to understand it and to change it that the university
has got to be involved in the communities around it and
aware of their problems. To be sure a balance may have to
be struck between involvement and detachment. But in the
past, universities have too strenuously clung to detachment
and the people and problems they ignored are forcing their
way through the gates of the ivory tower.
Kennan calls it arrogance. For Hayakawa it is
"anti-intellectualism." "Why is it that students and people
in the liberal arts are so quickâ€”quote- to lay their bodies
on the line-unquote-rather than engage in strenuous
intellectual discussion? Why is it that at Berkeley and San
Francisco State College, for example, a person who supports
the draft or sees a reason to support the war in Vietnam gets
shouted down?" he asks.
Can anyone tell him?
Probably not. How many holy wars have been settled by
negotiation?
