## Who Controls The System At State? 
### Andrew Moss 
Up at San Francisco State
College you can get the best edu
cational experience currently
available in the Bay Area, an edu
cation in what education itself is
all about in the great state of
; California.
It's also a foretaste of what a
police state will be like, and every
body who ever used that phrase
should go up and see it in opera
tion: once you see the police act
ing as an occupying army you'll
feel differently about your rights.
Anybody whose confidence in
the police survived the Walker re
port should go and watch the
tactical squad breaking up a dem
onstration: watch for the ones
with personalized clubs, hand
carved and notched for maximum
effectiveness.
Important as it is for middle
class white students to see the
police acting as a political force,
it's more important to understand
what the battle is about. It's
about having control over one of
the most important parts of your
own life—your education.
The BSU and Third World
Liberation Front at State are try
ing to take control of the educa
tion of black and minority stu
dents, attacking the teaching of a

bourgeois white culture to stu
dents to whom it is largely irrele
vant. Not only is it irrelevant, it
doesn't even get to most of them,
and the BSU is attacking that too.
Lack of Funds
Public education in this society
is starved of funds. The students
at State are refusing to accept the
imperatives of a society that, be
cause it puts no money into pub
lic education, deprives most black
kids of college, and are refusing to
accept the justifying myth of
Reagan and the educational
primitives, that education is a
privilege not a right.
Against this principle the BSU
is making a revolutionary demand,
revolutionary because it overturns
the values of the society, that all
black students wanting education
should be admitted to State.
The society demands that stu
dents, once they get into college,
know their place, which means
accept what they are given. But
much of the education at State is
useless and misleading to the
black students, so the BSU de
mands control over the Black
Studies program. Another revolu
tionary demand, that students
control their own education.
Finally, the BSU maintains
that its demands are not negoti

able, though of course the Trus
tees take the same line. The de
mands are not negotiable because
the BSU is demanding not a quan
titative change in the amount of
education offered but a qualita
tive change in the way the educa
tional system is run.
They are demanding that the
control over the education of
black students currently in the
hands of a white business olig
archy be turned over to the black
students, representatives of the
black community. You can't com
promise on a change in kind.
AFT Adds Demands
Now the AFT has joined the
strike, adding its own demands to
those of the BSU and Third World
students and confusing everybody
further. The teachers are hesitant,
not as militant or as united or
specific in their demands as the
students.
Basically, they are striking over
the same issue—control over their
jobs. They have the same enemy.
The teachers can amalgamate their
demands on control over the job
situation, union recognition and
shorter hours with the student
demands because both groups are
fighting for the same change in
control over the educational pri
orities of the state.
The teachers at State, who
teach a twelve hour load against a
national average of under nine
(Stanford's is more like six) are
fighting for shorter hours. This,
like the BSU fight for more black
students is a demand for more
money for education and an
attack on the educational policy,
i The fight for recognition and con
trol parallels the BSU fight for an
autonomous black studies pro
gram. The teachers won't accept
an educational system which gives
them no control over how they
j teach, at least the four hundred in
the AFT won't.

Meeting the teacher demands,
like meeting theBSU demands,
means changing the imperatives
under which the State College
system operates. Both are accept
ing a public educational system
which functions not to educate
everybody but to produce enough
technicians to keep the economy
running.
The change they are de
manding is a change in the ration
ale, not a change in amounts,
though not all the teachers realize
it and certainly the Labor Council
doesn't. The Trustees and Ronald
Reagan do and they are equally
intransigent: "education is a priv
ilege, not a right."
Mony of the white students at
State have not got involved,
though thousands have been
picketing. In spite of Hayakawa's
propaganda there is little active
opposition to the strike. It wiil be
interesting to see what happens
when they realize that their own
education is threatened by the
system, like black cultural auton
omy and teachers' control over
what they teach. Reagan, after all,
wants to cut public expenditure,
not merely maintain it at an in
sufficient level.
Stanford students, safe in their
federally financed private fortress,
haven't had to get involved in
public education. That's why
everybody should go to the picket
line, to see what it's like to fight
for your education.
