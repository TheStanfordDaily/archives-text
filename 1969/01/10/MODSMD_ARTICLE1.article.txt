# Equal Student Vote Denied On SES Recommendations
## 
### JACK KAPLAN 
The Academic Senate yester
day repudiated student attempts
to gain equal voting rights with
the faculty senate on Study of Ed
ucation (SES) proposals. The sen
ate did, however, vote unani
mously to allow students to ex
press their views directly to fac
ulty representatives before any
action is taken on SES recom
mendations.
Last night, a meeting of more
than 200 students voted to reject
the senate resolution. The vote,
taken in the crowded Branner
dining room, was 46 in favor of
accepting the resolution and 129
against.
The Senate called for student
government to "identify or cre
ate" a representative student
group which could vote to send a
previously passed resolution back
to the Senate to be reconsidered.
The group would also select stu
dents to participate in the Senate
debate on SES proposals.
The resolution was a modified
version of a Senate Steering Com
mittee proposal giving students
power to require a two-thirds Sen
ate vote for passage of such rec
ommendations.
By a vote of 31 to 6, the Sen
ate rejected a student-initiated
plan, formally presented to the
Senate by Statistics Assoc. Prof.
Bradley Efron, calling for a joint
student-faculty body with equal
voting privileges.
After the first vote, the stu
dents meeting in Branner voted by
more than 3 to 1 to resubmit to
the senate the resolution calling
for equal voting privileges. The
Academic Senate's next scheduled
meeting is January 30.
Several faculty members were
present at last night's student
meeting including Senate chair
man Leonard Schiff, engineering
professor Hubert Heffner, soci
ology professor Bernard Cohen
and Humanities and Sciences dean
Halsey Royden.
All faculty members present
spoke in favor of the senate's res
olution and were joined by several
students who said they felt the
faculty was better qualified to set
academic requirements than stu
dents.
The Branner meeting lasted
more than two-and-a-half hours
with most of the time taken up
with speeches by students op
posed to the senate resolution.
Chaired by junior Pat Shea, the
meeting was orderly with only
occasional cries of protest or
scattered applause.
Members of the student "coali
tion" which sponsored last night's
meeting as well as Wednesday
night's said they were very pleased
by the large turnout for the
second meeting. Another meeting
has been slated for 7:30 Monday
night in the Branner dining room.
Several speakers urged those
present to make a concerted
effort to go into the living groups
to explain the SES proposals and
the role of students in their imple
mentation.

The exact text of the resolu
tion rejected by the meeting is:
"The senate asks the Student
Government to identify or create
a representative student group to
which the Senate may turn for
advice or for concurrent delibera
tion on matters of educational
policy arising from the SES rec
ommendations.
"This student group shall have
the right to name the student
members of the floor management
committees of the Senate for SES
proposals and students shall enter
into Senate debates on such pro
posals.
"A contrary vote on any (SES)
matter by this student group
would require reconsideration by
the Senate.
"In the event of such a con
trary vote, the Steering Commit
tee shall invite several representa
tives (from the students) to the
Senate meeting for the purpose of
explaining the contrary vote."
The plan for a student-faculty
body originated at Wednesday's
meeting of a newly-formed volun
tary student coalition. It called

for a committee composed of the
Academic Senate members and an
equal number of students ap
pointed by Student Body Presi
dent Denis Hayes to vote on SES
matters.
Profs. Lawrence Altman, Paul
Berg, John Chowning, Bradley
Efron, Anne Kastelanetz and
Robert Polhemus voted in favor
of the student plan.
The action followed discus
sions involving eight students who
had attended Wednesday's coali
tion meeting. The students were
invited to attend the meeting after
a 40-minute Senate debate ques
tioning whether the eight were
representative of the student body
as a whole.
The debate centered on
whether the students were coali
tion members and whether the
coalition was representative of the
student body.
The coalition has no formal
membership list, but considers it
self a broad-based group of stu
dents concerned about enactment
of SES proposals. All eight stu
dents had attended Wednesday's
coalition meeting, but most had

not signed a coalition statement
presented to all students in this
quarter's registration packet.
The eight students included
LASSU Speaker Yale Braunstein,
a graduate student, and seven
undergraduates: Terry Barnett,
senior history major; Julia Holm,
freshman philosophy major;
Debbie Moranville, freshman in
general studies; George Reinhardt,
junior political science major;
George Schlesenger, sophomore
German major; Pat Shea, junior
political science major; and Phil
Taubman, junior history major.

The three-hour senate session
was the longest in the Senate's six
month history.
