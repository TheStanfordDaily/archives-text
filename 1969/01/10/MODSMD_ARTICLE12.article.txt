## DDT: The Good And Evil 
### JOSHUA LEDERBERG 
The Nobel Prize in medicine
for 1948 was awarded to the
Swiss chemist Paul H. Mueller for
his discovery of the remarkable
new insecticide dichloro-diphenyl
-trichloromethylmethane, or
DDT.
Few scientific discoveries have
been applied so quickly for large
scale humanitarian benefit as
DDT, whose insecticidal potency
was first reported in 1940.
Typhus Treatment
The Nobel Prize citation re
counted that in October of 1943,
a heavy outbreak of typhus oc
curred in Naples. When customary
relief measures proved inadequate,
DDT treatment was introduced
(for the eradication of typhus
bearing lice). In January, 1944,
1.3 million people were treated,
the citation noted, "and in a per
iod of three weeks the typhus epi
demic was completely mastered.
Thus for the first time in history a
typhus outbreak was brought un
der control in winter."
After World War 11, DDT was
deployed worldwide as one of the
main weapons against malarial
mosquitoes and many other
disease-bearing insects. It has un
questionably saved many millions
of human lives and brought many
more out of the deadly lethargy
of chronic pestilence. DDT has
also played a vital part in the pro
tection of food crops against in
sect attack.
Not Fully Understood
At the occasion of his prize
award, Dr. Mueller took pains to
point out that we did not suffi
ciently understand the biological
action of DDT on insects, and by
implication the scope of potential

side effects on other species of
animals and on m;m. Two decades
iater, we still sufi'er from having
only a fragmentary understanding
of its basic effects on cells. But we
are beginning to realize that DDT
is a two-edged sword whose long
term dangers may even rival its
unarguable human benefits during
and since World War 11.
DDT has a remarkable capacity
to persist in the environment, its
residues passing from soil to in
sects to birds and fish and the ani
mals that eat them. The chemi
cal's persistence is a positive ad
vantage in crude public health
work â€”a few applications a year
can hold down the mosquito pro
duction of a malarial swamp. But
DDT has been accumulating in the
terrestrial environment to the
point that significant traces can be
found in Antarctic birds, thou
sands of miles away from the orig
inal sources of application. DDT
can be called the first qualitatively
new compound to be spread
throughout the world by human
activity.
DDT in Birds
In some wild species of birds,
DDT has accumulated in body tis
sues to the point of causing ser
ious disturbances in the metabol
ism of sex hormones. These are
manifested by a serious thinning
of the calcium carbonate shells of
the birds' eggs and interference in
breeding. Many biologists now
warn that several species of birds
of prey, notably the preegrine fal
con, are in danger or early extinc
tion.
Man comes first, we may say,
but we must at least perceive the
lesson of how we may be fouling
our own nest. The falcon may be

doomed, and we may not be able
to afford to give us DDT for its
more crucial life-preserving appli
cations. At the very least, we have
to redouble our efforts to investi
gate what is in store for our own
species in an environment of
which DDT is now an established
component.
Liver Capability
DDT is only one of many drugs
that cause changes in the meta
bolic capability of the liver. These
changes are relatively nonspecific,
and the rapid destruction of ster
oid hormones appears to be a co
incidental byproduct of the liver
cells' adaptation to DDT. The in
dividual exposed to DDT can
therefore be expected to show a
changed reaction to a number of
other chemicals and drugs, even
under conditions where the DDT
alone shows little toxic effects.
The long-term effects of such
combinations are poorly under
stood.
These effects are closely bound
up with the deepest questions of
the functioning of DNA and RNA
in the systhesis of proteins. Ap
propriate research is making a fit
ful start today. We can find no
more striking example of the un
mistakable relevance of molecular
biology for global survival.
