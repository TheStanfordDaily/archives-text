# Would You Believe?
## The 						Show Must Go On 
### ART BUCHWALD 
I know people aren't going to
believe this, but my wife thinks
that the 1968 football season is
over just because it's 1969. This
shows how out of touch some
American women are.
Last Saturday, for example, I
was watching a postseason game
from Nome, Alaska, brought in by
satellite, when my wife came in
the room and said, "I thought the
football season officially ended
on New Year's Day."
"It's true the official college
season ended on New Year's Day
with the postseason bowl games,
but there are still a lot of post
postseason games that have to be
played."
"Have to be played?" she
asked.
"Of course. For example, there
has to be a game between the
Northeastern All-Stars and the
Southwestern All-Stars at Sandy
Hook, L. I."
"What for?"
"That's a stupid question," I
said. "To play the winner of the
Southeastern All-Stars and North
western All-Stars game in Chey
enne, Wyoming."

"And what will that decide,
that the Rose Bowl, Orange Bowl,
Cotton Bowl, and Sugar Bowl
haven't decided already? " she
asked.
"It will decide what teams will
play against each other on
Lincoln's birthday in Springfield,
Illinois."
My wife leaned on her broom.
"Don't get me wrong. I enjoy foot
ball as much as any wife who lives
alone, but it seems to me that the
1968 football season should end
in 1968, for neatness if nothing
else."
"You can't end the 1968 foot
ball season in 1968," I said ang
rily, "There are still too many
games that have to be played."
"For example?" she asked.
"Well, you have the Blue and
the Gray game between the North
and the South,and then you have
the Red and the White game, be
tween Anglo-Saxons and those of
Indian blood. Then there is the
Black Power All-Stars against the
Uncle Toms, and I haven't told
you who's playing tomorrow."
"Don't tell me the professional
football season isn't over either?"

"It's hardly beginning. Haven't
you ever heard of the Super
Bowl?"
"I know you'll hate me if I say
I haven't."
"Well, there's the Super Bowl,
and there is the East-West Pro
Bowl, and then there's the
Runner-Up Bowl, and there's the
Coaches' All-Star Bowl, not to
mention a special Midnight Bowl
which is going to be played in
South Korea as part of Armed
Forces Week festivities."
"Could you give me a guess, a
wild guess if you like, as to when
the last whistle of the last game of
1968 officially will be blown?"
I took out a pencil an; started
calculating. Finally I said, "Taking
in everything, including post
season, all-star, all-pro, all
coaches, high school, college and
professional football, I would say
that the 1968 football season will
officially end on June 16, 1969."
My wife signed. "It seems like
only yesterday when they didn't
even know if O. J. Simpson would
make the Women's Wear Daily
Ail-American team."
