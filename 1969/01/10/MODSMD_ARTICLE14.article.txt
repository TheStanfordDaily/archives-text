# S.F. State Crisis
## A 						Three-Sided Coin 
### LEONARD SIEGEL 
The Strike at San Francisco
State College, in addition to
focusing upon critical issues in ed
ucation and black liberation, is
testing three dominant ideologies.
Liberal, Conservative, and Radical
means of problem-solving and de
cision-making are set against each
other.
While there are, of course, var
ious grades between these ideolog
ical poles, as well as inconsis
tencies in the politics of many of
those involved, the Conservatism
of Reagan, Liberalism of Alioto,
and the Radicalism of the stu
dents represent three strategies for
solution of the crisis, and the
problems which precipitated it.
Foot In The Door
Governor Reagan, as well as
many other "responsible leaders,"
is strongly resisting the Strike.
Quite correctly, he sees a Move
ment success at State as a foot in
the door to radical or revolution
ary social change. Consequently,
he wants to slam the door. Stu
dents, and black and other Third
World community groups, are a
real threat to the people the
governor represents.
Although Reagan claims to
serve the people of California, and
his rhetoric speaks to the middle
class, his policies (e.g. Public Util
ities appointments, regressive tax
legislation) are in the immediate
interests of Big Business.
Reagan and the business com
munity support elitist programs
which give money—usually in the
form of tax incentives — to the
corporations, in the stated hope
that it will eventually filter down
to the poorer folks.
Self-determination for black
and Third World People would
not only reduce the power of the
business elite, but it could elimi
nate much of its material profit.
Reagan's strategy is to vigorously
maintain the power relationships—
to attempt to scare the problems
away. While this may serve his im
mediate interests, it adds to the
pressure which may eventually
bring him and his system down.
Alioto's Policy
Perhaps a more clever policy is
that of Mayor Alioto, whose polit
ical career is blossoming on his
competence as a mediator, as well
as his apparent energy. As a medi
ator, the mayor, including his rep
resentatives and (excluding his
police) attempts to soften con
flicts of interests, creating comp
romise solutions.
Alioto would like us to believe
that crisis situations arise out of
failures to communicate. He pre
tends to ignore that many crises
result from actual conflicts of in
terests, in which the conflicting
parties communicate most clearly
through struggle. At San
Francisco State, where the nature
of decision-making relationships —
power—is the major issue, media
tion between the students and the
Board of Trustees cannot work.
The powers in the government
cannot afford to concede power
to the students, and power is the
central aim of the students. One

can see that in most areas such as
this, compromise is increasingly
no solution.
Such liberalism, if successful,
maintains, for a time, a stable,
peaceful—though oppressive for
some —environment, unlike the
stable, tense situation of complete
repression. It, too, shall fail, how
ever, for it denies the fundamental
contradiction between the rulers
and the ruled.
Physical Power
The physical power wielded by
the student strikers at San
Francisco State, together with
their non-negotiable demands for
self-determination, have created u
political movement which cannot
easily be repressed by the Conser
vatives or confused by the liberals.
After years of programs estab
lished by elites, conservative as
well as liberal, ostensibly to liber
ate "minorities," many black,
brown, and yellow people are re
jecting the Moynihans, Humph
reys, Packards, and even Robert
Weavers. "How," they ask, "can
Third World people be released
from oppression by the institu

tions, or men, that are benefitting
from their oppressions?"
While the ghetto uprisings
brought action by the elites, care
ful analysis of this action shows
that corporate leaders are at
tempting to integrate the develop
ment of the ghettos into a domes
tic form of Neo-Colonialism,
serving corporate interests.
To radically improve their
lives, Third World people are dis
covering that they must control
the decisions which affect their
environment. This means that
they, like Reagan, will not com
promise.
Thus we see three basic ap
proaches to the student strike at
State. The more conservative
members of the ruling class will
increase repression, their fear re
inforced by failure at State. Lib
erals will use more sophisticated
plans to co-opt rebels and isolate
leaders.
And the radicals, ourselves, to
build a new society, must become
stronger—to resist repression—and
more certain of our path. The
struggle has barely begun.
