DEAR MOM,
Whenever someone compli
ment s me, I feel embarrassed. For
example, when they say, "You are
the most wonderful person I have
ever met," I feel it is conde
scending to say, "I'm really not"
and prideful to say, "Yes, I am."
Whal. should I do?
BEWILDERED
DEA R BEWILDERED,
You are aiming for true
humility tinged with charity.
Therefore, always respond to a
compliment by saying "How per
ceptive of you" which is, in turn,
payiing the giver a compliment.
Example: "You look beautiful in
that blue dress." (Humble Re
sponse:) "How perceptive of
you. '
PERCEPTIVELY,
MOM
