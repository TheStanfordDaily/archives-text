# Computer System Aids Bay Schools

An experimental computer network linking five Bay Area schools
with Stanford University's time-sharing computer, an IBM 360/1 dodel
67, has met an enthusiastic reception in its first few months of <[>pera
tion.
Four higher education institutions—Mills College, San Francisco
State, California State at Hayward, and the University of San Francis
co—plus Gunn High School in Palo Alto, are participating in edu
cational pilot study.
Each communicates with the Stanford Computation Center via two
typewriter terminals connected by leased telephone lines. Because the
computer computes a million to ten million times faster than humans,
many students and faculty members can use it simultaneously. Yet it
seems to each user that the computer is working for him alone.
The pilot network was set up late last summer under National
Science Foundation sponsorship by Stanford Prof. Edward Fieigen
baum, director of the Computation Center, and his staff. Grants total
ing $243,000, plus cost sharing by participants including Stafford,
will finance the nearly $300,000 cost of the 13-month experiment.
The objective is to gain experience in "satisfying the needs of
computer users economically via use of a large central facility as op
posed to a host of small stand-alone systems," said Prof. Feigenbaum.
"Today, the relative quality of service and cost effectiveness be
tween large central versus small stand-alone facilities is an open ques
tion," he said. "The pilot network experiment has been designed to
provide some answers which are urgently needed."
The computer network is used largely by students taking instruc
tion in computers or in mathematics and the physical sciences. Inter
est in applying it for less obvious purposes—in sociology, biology , and
even physical education—also has been indicated.
The terminals are being used in approximately 36 courses at the
various schools, and nearly 60 faculty members have become involved
in remote computing. Each of the schools expects to increase its use
of the terminals five or 10-fold by next spring.
After spending most of their time during the first few montlhs on
training, the participating schools unanimously reported enthusiastic
expectations of wide use by the end of the 13-month period. Consid
erable numbers of faculty and students are taking courses in computer
languages to enable them to work with the system.
