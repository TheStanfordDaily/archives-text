# Prehistoric Whale Bones
## Ancient Skull Discovered 
### 
The skull of a prehistoric
whale, about five feet long and
judged to be approximately 15
million years old, has been dis
covered in the bank of San Fran
cisquito Creek where it meanders
through the foothills behind the
Stanford campus.
Paleontologist Dr. Charles Re
penning of the U.S. Geological
Survey in Menlo Park, one of its

discoverers, said the skull a]ppears
to date from the Middle M iocene
Epoch. It was apparently an an
cestor of the modern baleen whale
and a member of the ' 'Ceto
theridae" family of whahbs, he
added.
Larry Barnes, paleontolo ?y stu
dent at the University of Califor
nia in Berkeley, shared the (discov
ery with Dr. Repenning. Barnes'

will head a student team that will
carefully excavate the fossil skull
this afternoon.
The skull is embedded in soft
sandstone in an area off Alpine
Road known as the Webb Ranch.
After its removal it will be taken
to Berkeley's Museum of Paleont
ology for cleaning and preparation.
Dr. Repenning recalled that the
whale skull is located not far from
the Stanford Linear Accelerator
Center site where a unique fossil
marine mammal, called "paleo
paradoxia," was unearthed four
years ago. It was considered one
of the most significant finds ever
made on the North American con
tinent.
In the Middle Miocene Epoch,
geologists say, there were many
local shallow seas, and the conti
nents were in the process of
emerging. Central California was
radically different then, and the
Coast Range of mountains did not
exist.
