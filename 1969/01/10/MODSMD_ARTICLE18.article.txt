# New Ph.D. Program
## Religious Studies Soar 
### 
From high schools through col
leges and universities, the past
eight years have seen an explosion
in the objective study of religion
unmatched in the history of
American education, according to
Prof. William Clebsch, professor
of religion and humanities.
"What two decades ago was a
necessity is now a commonplace,"
he notes. "The study of religions
for the sake of understanding and
tolerating a diverse dimension of
human existence is distinct from
teaching religion for the sake of
extending loyalty to institutional
and doctrinal expressions of reli
gion."
This change in direction of
religious studies, together with
mushrooming demand, pose a chal
lenge "not whether many good
teachers will be needed to man
these programs, but whether uni
versity-trained specialists in reli
gious study can be furnished in
sufficient quantity and quality to
expose and ameliorate mediocrity
in the teaching of religion,"
Clebsch notes.
With approval from the Senate
of the Academic Council, Stan
ford next year will inaugurate a
new Ph.D. program in the human
istic study of religion. About five
students will be enrolled annually,
with the total group numbering
about 20 to 25 at any one time
during the next decade.

During the past year, 150 re
quests were made by students for
graduate study in religion at Stan
ford, even though no such pro
gram existed.
Stanford's present eight-man
faculty in religious studies will
provide the principal staff for the

new Ph.D. program. Besides
Clebsch, who serves as chairman
of the Humanities Special Pro
grams, the faculty includes:
Lqwrence Berman, Robert
McAfee Brown, Edwin Good,
Jerry Irish, Alan Miller, B. Davie
Napier, and Lee Yearly.
