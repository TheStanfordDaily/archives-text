# Grads Face Draft
## Industry Safer Than School 
### SUSAN SWARD 
Few graduate divisions at Stan
ford seem to know precisely how
much the draft is encroaching
upon their male graduate enroll
ment.
Department heads generally ad
mit, however, that they are not
breathing any easier simply be
cause the Paris peace talks are in
session. As Lauress Wise, Asso
ciate Dean of Engineering, said in
an interview with The Daily yes
terday:
"We haven't seen the light at
the end of the tunnel yet, even
though our enrollment is only
slightly down from last year. We
are watching the draft like a hawk
and trying to do all we can for the
students here in school now."
Wise went on to note that the
engineering school lost 60 to 100
students who wrote and said they
would rather take jobs in indus
try—the implication being that in
dustry positions would be safer in
terms of the draft than graduate
school.
Harvey Hall, the registrar,
echoes Wise's interpretation that
many potential graduate students
have gone elsewhere to positions
where they felt they had a better
chance of deferment.
Down 300
"This fall quarter our male
graduate enrollment was down
300 from last year's fall quarter
level. The winter quarter's enroll
ment is also down 300 from last
winter quarter's level," Hall said.
Bill Leland, a draft advisor
within the Dean of Students Of

fice, believes that the draft call
rate is going to pick up. He listed
three reasons for The Daily which
lead him to have that opinion.
"Many graduate students are
exhausting their possibilities of
appeal," he said. "Also, draft calls
are going to be higher now than in
the first months of the school
year. And finally, almost all
boards have reclassified the males
that fall under their jurisdiction."
Grads Called Up
Leland estimates that the draft
call will stay up in the low
30,000's through June. He makes
a prediction that, "By June,
roughly 50 percent of all men
called will have been in first and
second year graduate school posi
tions."
Speaking of the issue of the
draft as a whole, Leland said,
"Too often graduate schools have
taken parochial points of view and
have argued only for their own
students. Instead, the fact that
graduate students are being called
up is a symptom of the whole
draft system."
Arthur Schawlow, Executive
Head of Physics, said that 5 out of
27 graduate students in physics
wrote to say they were doing
things which kept them "safer
from the draft" than graduate
school.
"So far this year no one has
had an induction notice. However,
practically all of our first year
group are eligible and could go,"
Schawlow observed.
English Problem
lan Watt, Executive Head of
English, noted three factors that

the draft is disturbing within his
department.
"It is having some effect on the
number of students, the morale
and the difficulty in planning any
thing," Watt said.
Thomas Robinson, assistant
dean of the law school, admitted
that the law school is in no real
position to estimate the effect of
the draft on its enrollment at this
point. Because the law school is
on the semester system, Robinson
expects that there will be a sub
stantial loss in enrollment due to
the draft when the next semester
begins in March.
Draft Study
Virgil Whitaker, Dean of the
Graduate Division, told The Daily
that a study has just been com
piled on the draft's effect on male
graduate enrollment.
"The basic finding," Whitaker
stated, "is that the draft hasn't so
far created the inroads expected
previously, probably because the
boards have been slow in reclassi
fying. Also, as everyone knows,
the call was low in the autumn
and is picking up now."
If an over-view is taken of var
ious university personalities' opin
ions concerning the draft, there
appears to be little room for op
timism in many of these individu
als' minds. Harvey Hall was one of
the few who registered any hope
for a draft call decrease in the
near future. And even Hall ad
mitted,
"It comes down to whether
you're an optimist or a pessimist
in the end."

exhausting their possibilities of
appeal," he said. "Also, draft calls
are going to be higher now than in
the first months of the school
year. And finally, almost all
boards have reclassified the males
that fall under their jurisdiction."
Grads Called Up
Leland estimates that the draft
call will stay up in the low
30,000's through June. He makes
a prediction that, "By June,
roughly 50 percent of all men
called will have been in first and
second year graduate school posi
tions."
Speaking of the issue of the
draft as a whole, Leland said,
"Too often graduate schools have
taken parochial points of view and
have argued only for their own
students. Instead, the fact that
graduate students are being called
up is a symptom of the whole
draft system."
Arthur Schawlow, Executive
Head of Physics, said that 5 out of
27 graduate students in physics
wrote to say they were doing
things which kept them "safer
from the draft" than graduate
school.
"So far this year no one has
had an induction notice. However,
practically all of our first year
group are eligible and could go,"
Schawlow observed.
English Problem
lan Watt, Executive Head of
English, noted three factors that

the draft is disturbing within his
department.
"It is having some effect on the
number of students, the morale
and the difficulty in planning any
thing," Watt said.
Thomas Robinson, assistant
dean of the law school, admitted
that the law school is in no real
position to estimate the effect of
the draft on its enrollment at this
point. Because the law school is
on the semester system, Robinson
expects that there will be a sub
stantial loss in enrollment due to
the draft when the next semester
begins in March.
Draft Study
Virgil Whitaker, Dean of the
Graduate Division, told The Daily
that a study has just been com
piled on the draft's effect on male
graduate enrollment.
"The basic finding," Whitaker
stated, "is that the draft hasn't so
far created the inroads expected
previously, probably because the
boards have been slow in reclassi
fying. Also, as everyone knows,
the call was low in the autumn
and is picking up now."
If an over-view is taken of var
ious university personalities' opin
ions concerning the draft, there
appears to be little room for op
timism in many of these individu
als' minds. Harvey Hall was one of
the few who registered any hope
for a draft call decrease in the
near future. And even Hall ad
mitted,
"It comes down to whether
you're an optimist or a pessimist
in the end."
Few graduate divisions at Stan
ford seem to know precisely how
much the draft is encroaching
upon their male graduate enroll
ment.
Department heads generally ad
mit, however, that they are not
breathing any easier simply be
cause the Paris peace talks are in
session. As Lauress Wise, Asso
ciate Dean of Engineering, said in
an interview with The Daily yes
terday:
"We haven't seen the light at
the end of the tunnel yet, even
though our enrollment is only
slightly down from last year. We
are watching the draft like a hawk
and trying to do all we can for the
students here in school now."
Wise went on to note that the
engineering school lost 60 to 100
students who wrote and said they
would rather take jobs in indus
try—the implication being that in
dustry positions would be safer in
terms of the draft than graduate
school.
Harvey Hall, the registrar,
echoes Wise's interpretation that
many potential graduate students
have gone elsewhere to positions
where they felt they had a better
chance of deferment.
Down 300
"This fall quarter our male
graduate enrollment was down
300 from last year's fall quarter
level. The winter quarter's enroll
