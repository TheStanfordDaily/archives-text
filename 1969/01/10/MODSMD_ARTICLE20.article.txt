# Cagers Host Washington Fives
## Tribe Tips Off Pac-8 Season 
### GARY CAVALLI 
Stanford's Indians peel the
wrapping paper off the 1969
Pacific-8 basketball season this
weekend when they host the
Washington Huskies and the
Washington State Cougars. Tipoff
time for both contests in the
Tribe's new Roscoe Maples Pav
ilion is 8:00 p.m.
Coach Howie Dallmar's quin
tet, the only team in the confer
ence with a losing record (4-7) in
non-league play, will be slight un
derdogs in both encounters. Wash
ington ended pre-season action
with a 5-4 mark, while the Cou
gars finished 6-5.
The Huskies will bring a tall,
experienced club into Maples Pav
ilion tonight. Four of the club's
five starters are back from last
year, as only 6-3 forward Fred
Carr departed last June.

Forward Ueorge Irvine has
been the big gun offensively for
Coach Tex Winter's quintet,
averaging just under 15 points per
game. A 6-bVi junior, Irvine is also
a fine rebounder, teaming with
6-9 junior center Jay Bond and
6-5 forward Pat Woolcock to give
the Huskies excellent board
strength.
"Washington is coming off a
real good win over nationally
ranked Ohio State in Columbus
last week," Stanford's Dallmar
commented in sizing up the
Huskies. "They have the nucleus
of last year's club back. Irvine is
one of the top forwards in the
conference. They have a good
center in Bond and a fine ball
handler in (Rafael) Stone."
Winter, in his first year at
Washington, is carrying several
sophomores on his traveling
squad. One of them, 6-0 Dave
Willenborg, has supplanted vet
eran Dave West as the starting
guard opposite the 5-9 Stone.
Soph Sparks WSU
Saturday night coach Marv
Harshman will bring an improving,
well-balanced WSU five into
Maples Pavilion. The Cougars,
paced by sophmore Dennis Hogg,
have won three of their last four,
with a two-point loss to Oregon
the only reversal.
Hogg, a 6-5 forward from Fre
mont High School in Oakland, is
"one of the best sophomores in
the league," according to Dallmar.
An outstanding leaper with a fine
touch from the outside, Hogg is
averaging 17.3 points and 8 re
bounds per game.
Seniors Ted Wierman (6-9) and
Gary Elliot (6-6) complete the

strong WSU front line, while the
back court tandem consists of
junior Rick Erickson and senior
Lenny Allen.
Wierman, who moved into the
pivot when 6-10 star Jim McKean
graduated, is the team's leading re
bounder (11.3 per game) and
second leading scorer (13.0).
Elliot and Erickson are also hit
ting in two digits, both averaging
just over 12 points a contest.
Erickson played very well in the
Far West Classic last week and was
named to the All-Tournament
team.
Stanford, faced with perhaps
the toughest pre-season schedule
of any Pacific-8 team and
troubled by poor free throw
shooting, finally seemed to put it
all together in last Saturday's
94-78 win over Brigham Young.
Senior guard Don Griffin,
averaging nearly 23 points per
game, buried 33 points and
grabbed 10 rebounds to pace the
Tribe effort. Junior pivotman Bill
Palmer, improving with each
game, was a vacuum cleaner on
the boards, corralling 1 5 rebounds
and scoring well inside.
Sophomores Mike Michel an
Dennis O'Neill have come on
strongly in recent games and
should continue to develop as the
season progresses.
O'Neill will start tomorrow at
guard opposite Griffin, while at
press time Dallmar was undecided
as to whether Michel or junior Bill
Barber would start at one of the
forward spots. Senior Mai
McElwain, averaging 12.8 points
and 6 rebounds per game, is
solidly entrenched at the other
forward.

Coach Paul Neumann's frosh
squad, inactive since December 2,
returns to action this weekend.
Tonight the Papooses host the
Stanford Braves, while tomorrow
night they entertain the San Jose
State frosh.
Neumann's quintet routed
Merced 91-68 in their opener
November 30, then dropped a
70-61 verdict to City College of
San Francisco.
Forwards Brad Lind and Bob
Dews currently lead the Papooses

in scoring, averaging 18.0 and
1 5.5 points per game, respec
tively. Center Bob Bond is the
squad's top rebounder, with 16,
while Lind and Dews have 14
apiece. Guards Claude Terry (12.5
ppg) and Chuck Bauer round out
Stanford's starting five.
The Spartababes are paced by
high-scoring center David Dockery
and forward Mike Webb. Forward
Gordon Ciochon, guard Larry
barker and guard Bill Walker
round out the SJS quintet.


COUGAR STANDOUTSâ€”6-9 center Ted Wierman (left) and 6-5 for
ward Dennis Hogg, an Oakland product, are the primary offensive
weapons for the Washington State Cougars this year. Stanford hosts
the WSU five in the Maples Pavilion Saturday night.
