# Stanford Relays Tomorrow
## Gaughran Optimistic, But... Daily Sport 
### FRED MANN 
in 1967, Stanford won the
NCAA Swimming championships
and rewrote the record books.
Last year the varsity swimmers
were rated fourth in the nation
and set even more records.
If, at that time, you had asked
Stanford's outstanding swimming
coach Jim Gaughran about the
chances for the 1969 Indians he
undoubtedly would have Hashed
his confident grin and predicted
great victories pn all horizons.
With such a talented team for
the' 69 season, he could not have
been wrong.
But ask him again today, on
the eve of the Stanford Relays
and the opening of this campaign,
and Gaughran will act a bit differ
ently. The confidence will still be
there, but the grin will be slightly
smaller and perhaps a little doubt
will be written on his face. Due to
transfers and grades, the Tribe
suddenly finds itself missing
nearly half a dozen key men, two
of whom are record-setters them
selves.
Dick Roth and Mitch Ivy are
both gone and leave a gap which
would be unfillable on most any

other college swim team. But
Coach Gaughran, who has per
sonally built the Indians into a
swimming powerhouse, has
created a tremendous backlog of
aquatic talent to more than ade
quately plug the holes. In fact,
even with such fine swimmers not
returning, the varsity is rated third
in the nation in pre-season polls,
behind only defending NCAA
champion Indiana and rugged
USC. Yale, which finished second
last year, has slipped to fourth.
Top Talent Assembles
Tomorrow at 2:00 p.m. the
Encina Pools will host the top
swimming talent in Northern Cali
fornia, or just about anyplace else,
when four visiting teams, the
Stanford frosh, and the varsity
meet. Returning to the event are
the always-tough Santa Clara
Swim Club, the Foothill Aquatic
Club, and the California varsity. A
new addition is the Arden Hills
Swim Club, which has turned out
gold medal winners Debbie Meyer
and Mike Burton.
Stanford sent eight swimmers
to the Olympics this year, more
than any other school in the
country. John Ferris, who re

turned from Mexico City with
two bronze medals, and Captain
Pete Siebert, who placed second
in the nationals last year in two
events, will lead the Indians
against their rivals tomorrow.
The Tribe hopes to be strong in
the 400 freestyle, 800 medley re
lays and in the sprints on the
strength of Rick Eagleston. Brent
Berk will carry the load in the
longer freestyle events along with
Ferris. Siebert should win for the
Cards in the backstroke events.
Fred Haywood, collegiate
champion in the backstroke two
years ago, is returning to aid
Siebert.
Soph-Studded Squad
With only four seniors and one
junior on the 18 man varsity,
Coach Gaughran feels the team
will improve as the season pro
gresses and the sophomores gain
experience. They must keep im
proving to last out the extremely
difficult dual meet schedule that
Stanford faces.
The team will travel to Canada
and Washington before returning
home for the showdown meet
with USC on February 15. They
then go back to New Haven,
Connecticut, for a meet with
powerful Yale before the NCAA
Championships in Indiana.
Outstanding freshmen such as
sprinter Mark Shelley and breast
stroker Dave Shilling may lend a
hand on the varsity before the
season is out.
Over the past three years, Jim
Gaughran's swimmers have posted
a 26-3-1 record, and 1969 should
prove to be more of the same.

strength of Rick Eagleston. Brent
Berk will carry the load in the
longer freestyle events along with
Ferris. Siebert should win for the
Cards in the backstroke events.
Fred Haywood, collegiate
champion in the backstroke two
years ago, is returning to aid
Siebert.
Soph-Studded Squad
With only four seniors and one
junior on the 18 man varsity,
Coach Gaughran feels the team
will improve as the season pro
gresses and the sophomores gain
experience. They must keep im
proving to last out the extremely
difficult dual meet schedule that
Stanford faces.
The team will travel to Canada
and Washington before returning
home for the showdown meet
with USC on February 15. They
then go back to New Haven,
Connecticut, for a meet with
powerful Yale before the NCAA
Championships in Indiana.
Outstanding freshmen such as
sprinter Mark Shelley and breast
stroker Dave Shilling may lend a
hand on the varsity before the
season is out.
Over the past three years, Jim
Gaughran's swimmers have posted
a 26-3-1 record, and 1969 should
prove to be more of the same.
in 1967, Stanford won the
NCAA Swimming championships
and rewrote the record books.
Last year the varsity swimmers
were rated fourth in the nation
and set even more records.
If, at that time, you had asked
Stanford's outstanding swimming
coach Jim Gaughran about the
chances for the 1969 Indians he
undoubtedly would have Hashed
his confident grin and predicted
great victories pn all horizons.
With such a talented team for
the' 69 season, he could not have
been wrong.
But ask him again today, on
the eve of the Stanford Relays
and the opening of this campaign,
and Gaughran will act a bit differ
ently. The confidence will still be
there, but the grin will be slightly
smaller and perhaps a little doubt
will be written on his face. Due to
transfers and grades, the Tribe
suddenly finds itself missing
nearly half a dozen key men, two
of whom are record-setters them
selves.
Dick Roth and Mitch Ivy are
both gone and leave a gap which
would be unfillable on most any

other college swim team. But
Coach Gaughran, who has per
sonally built the Indians into a
swimming powerhouse, has
created a tremendous backlog of
aquatic talent to more than ade
quately plug the holes. In fact,
even with such fine swimmers not
returning, the varsity is rated third
in the nation in pre-season polls,
behind only defending NCAA
champion Indiana and rugged
USC. Yale, which finished second
last year, has slipped to fourth.
Top Talent Assembles
Tomorrow at 2:00 p.m. the
Encina Pools will host the top
swimming talent in Northern Cali
fornia, or just about anyplace else,
when four visiting teams, the
Stanford frosh, and the varsity
meet. Returning to the event are
the always-tough Santa Clara
Swim Club, the Foothill Aquatic
Club, and the California varsity. A
new addition is the Arden Hills
Swim Club, which has turned out
gold medal winners Debbie Meyer
and Mike Burton.
Stanford sent eight swimmers
to the Olympics this year, more
than any other school in the
country. John Ferris, who re

turned from Mexico City with
two bronze medals, and Captain
Pete Siebert, who placed second
in the nationals last year in two
events, will lead the Indians
against their rivals tomorrow.
The Tribe hopes to be strong in
the 400 freestyle, 800 medley re
lays and in the sprints on the
strength of Rick Eagleston. Brent
Berk will carry the load in the
longer freestyle events along with
Ferris. Siebert should win for the
Cards in the backstroke events.
