# Stanford Buys Tuna Clipper
## 
### 
A 96-foot tuna clipper is being
purchased by Stanford University
to replace the sailing schooner Te
Vega in the biological oceano
graphic teaching and research
program conducted by Stanford's
Hopkins Marine Station at Pacific
Grove.
The National Science Founda
tion (NSF) will support the pro
gram in operations of the new re
search vessel—to be named the
"Proteus" after the Greek sea god.
The Proteus will accommodate
nine oceanographers and a crew of
seven, while the Te Vega carried
15 of each.
The new vessel is better suited
for investigations in biological
oceanography than the TeVega. It
will provide the same speed and
range of operation combined with
better working space.
The new program will recruit
qualified faculty and students in
biological oceanography from
within the University rather than
nationally and internationally as
before. Two courses already have
been planned for teaching aboard
the ship.
At least one major oceano
graphic expedition of three
months or more into foreign
waters will be scheduled each
year, said Professor Malvern
Gilmartin, the program's director.
