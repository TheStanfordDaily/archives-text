# Dean Hind To Take Eastern Post
## 
### PATRICK McMAHON 
Associate Dean of Undergraduate
Education Robert Hind, 46, is leaving
Stanford next month to head the Edu
cation Development Center (EDC), it
was announced yesterday.
The center, located in Newton,
Massachusetts, is a non profit institu
tion involved in curriculum develop
ment and operates the New England
Regional Educational Laboratory.
EDC Board Chairman Franklin Lind
say made the announcement that Hind
would be the new president of the or
ganization.
Regarded by students as a sympa
thetic, enlightened administrator, Hind
has been staff director of the Study of
Education at Stanford (SES) since its
inception two years ago and is respon
sible for many of its proposed reforms.
The prematurely gray-haired admin
istrator taught for several years an un
dergraduate special seminar on higher
education and was integral to the for
mation of the undergraduate special
program, the meal ticket transfer pro
gram, coeducational living arrange
ments, and other progressive Univer
sity projects.
Good Co-Worker
Lewis Spitz, professor of history
and chairman of the SES subcommittee
on Residences said last night, "I'm
very sorry to hear Mr. Hind is leaving.
In working on SES, he was a very good
co-worker. I wish he were staying on
at Stanford. '*
Hind, who comes from an all-
Stanford family, graduated from Stan

ford in engineering in 1947 and re
turned to the Universityin 1960 after a
successful career with Pope and Tal
bott, Inc., a shipping concern. He also
was a chicken farmer near the Alpine
Beer Gardens.
Hind, originally came to Stanford,
to work on the PACE fund-raising
project. Kenneth Cuthbertson, Vice
President for Finance, who recruited
him remembered, "He was just an ab
solutely great right arm to have."
His duties were "to communicate
to prospective donors and the public
what the University was all about," ac
cording to Cuthbertson. Among his ac
complishments is a film on Stanford
"On the Edge of Greatness" which is
the origin of that infamous phrase.
Wert's Assistant
When the PACE program came to a
close, Hind moved over to the then
newly-created Office of the Dean of
Undergraduate Education as assistant
dean under Robert Wert, who is now
president of Mills College. At (he same
time, Hind began work on a Ph.D. in
higher education. He completed it this
fall.
Students were very much Hind's
concern. One summer,then-Student
Body President David Harris and sev
eral other students were interns in his
office in order for the students to get a
better idea of University processes.
Hind even loaned one of the students
money to buy a sport coat so faculty
members would be more receptive to
him in committee meetings.
Hind has helped students find facul
ty members to sponsor courses they
want in the undergraduate special pro

gram and was head of the Martin
Luther King Scholarship Fund Drive
last spring.
His work on SES has been to gather
a staff for research to work with the
Steering Committee, to write many of
the reports and proposals, to keep the
University community informed about
SES, and to prepare the final reports
for publication.
Very Sympathetic
With the last of the SES being
printed this quarter, Hind's SES work
is completed. Norton Batkin, the un
dergraduate on the SES steering com
mittee, commented that Hind has been
"very sympathetic to student inter
ests."
Hind's concern for students and
good teaching was reflected in his doc
toral thesis as well. He studied the fac
ulty's concerns about teaching and re
search and found that the pressure to
publish should be reduced and evalua
tion of teaching increased.
Among his hobbies are tennis and
construction. Hind frequents the ten
nis courts at luunchtime and has built
himself an A-frame cabin on Fallen
Leaf Lake in the California Sierras.
The Education Development Cen
ter, to which Hind is going, was
formed in January 1967 by the merger
of Educational Services, Inc. (ESI) and
the Institute of Educational Innova
tion (IEI). Through the merger, EDC
inherited over 10 projects in curricu
lum development, ranging from pre
school through university levels.
EDC's major projects in the U. S.
include programs in elementary and
secondary science, mathematics, and

social studies. Among international
programs operated by EDC are the
AFrican education study, which has
developed curricula in both mathe
matics and science for English
speaking countries of Africa, a Peace
Corps training program, and in institu
tional development program in India
and Afghanistan.
EDC's film and television studio has
produced numerous research and in
structional films. In addition to films
in support of school curriculum pro
grams, major film projects have been
undertaken in areas of undergraduate
and graduate science and engineering.
EDC also serves as the New England
Regional Educational Laboratory, as
part of the national program estab
lished under Title IV of the 1965 Ele
mentary and Secondary Education
Act.
