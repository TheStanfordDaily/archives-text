NORTH RIDGE, Calif.
(AP) â€”Police arrested 293 students
Thursday in a second day of con
frontation at San Fernando Valley

State College, troubled by contro
versy over demands of Negro mili
tants.
The San Fernando arrests came
after students met for a "teach
in" in defiance of a state of emer
gency declared early Thursday,
banning gatherings and permitting
only faculty, students and staff
members on campus.
Elsewhere there were these
troubles:
At newly opened Southwest
College, 18 persons were arrested
after daylong series of incidents.
They were booked on suspicion of
interfering with school business.
Pickets were reported to have
blocked a driveway for a time and
a small fire was set in a trash can.
At East Los Angeles College
students for a time reportedly
took over two buildings, one the
student center. Ninety-five sher
iff's deputies restored order. One
classroom was reported damaged
slightly.
At El Camino College, 45 dep
uties responded after Negro stu
dents burned a policeman in effi
gy and said they would march on
administration offices. Officers
dispersed the crowd after making
16 arrests.
The Negroes moved in on the
three-story building Wednesday,
demanding establishment of an
Afro-American Center, more
scholarships for Negroes and re
cruitment drives for Negro stu
dents and Negro professors.
Abnormal Quiet At SFS
SAN FRANCISCO (AP)-A day
of abnormal quiet at strike-be
sieged San Francisco State College
was shattered Thursday afternoon
by a new clash between pickets
and police.
Five student pickets were ar
rested, and police pushed the mill
ing crowd of about 500 into 19th
Avenue across from the college
entrance.
Cans and some rocks were
thrown at police, who gradually
restored order.
The disorder was touched off

by arrest of pickets for interfering
with students bound to classes.
The striking American Federa
tion of Teachers had defied a
court order and resumed picketing
late in the morning but kept clear
of the student strikers.
At San Jose State College, sec
ond largest in the state system of
colleges, went through the second
day of picketing Thursday, but
the administration said campus
operations ran smoothly.

Brandeis Blacks Hold Hall
WALTHAM, Mass. (AP)-A
band of Negro students remained
in control of the Brandeis Univer
sity communication system Thurs
day night after their demands
were rejected in a series of meet
ings with the school president,
Morris B. Abram.
Abram, showing strains of the
crisis, repeated his refusal to
"Negotiate under duress." He told
newsmen that "possible grave con
sequences" could follow if the Ne
groes refused to abandon their oc
cupation.
Backed by the faculty, Abram
said he would grant amnesty to
the demonstrators if they aban
doned Ford Hall which houses the
university switchboard.
