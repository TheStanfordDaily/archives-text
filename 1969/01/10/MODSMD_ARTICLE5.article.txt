# Poly Sci Imbroglio: Attitudes Of Profs
## 
### CRAIG WILSON 
With the current turmoil in the
political science department, the
attitude of a large number of de
partment professors seems to be
one of a need for greater clarifica
tion and communication.
The situation developed into a
hotbed of controversy after all
but one student-initiated course
was rejected by the department
during the fall-winter break. That
course is still pending with the
quarter nearly a week old.
An estimated 60 political sci
ence undergraduates threpted to
withdraw from the department if
the student-initiated courses are
not approved.
Professor Robert Packenham
said the situation "requires com
munication in both directions.
This is not occurring at the pres
ent time except in a rather inef
fective fashion. We need to set
ourselves up so we can communi
cate better.
"I'm willing to hear grievances
and my colleagues recognize that
the curriculum constantly stands
in need of revision. The students
are an important source of infor
mation and recommendation of
changes that might be made."
Acting Assistant Professor
Edward Greenberg said, "In gen
eral, things have been pretty
mixed up."
He called for better planning in
course structure but said in princi
ple he was in favor of the graduate
student courses introduced.
Assistant Professor Joseph
Paff, a backer of one of the
courses rejected said he felt the
mood was definitely "one of re
evaluation." He said that the rea
son the courses were rejected was
because there were "too many de
mands too fast and the depart
ment decided to set up checks."
Most professors said that the
possibility of graduate students
drawing students away from
courses they offered was in no
way a threat to them.
Department head Richard
Fagen felt students had but one
legitimate grievance, saying that
there was a "lack of course offer
ings due to professors on leave
overseas and on sabbaticals."
He said, however, that this was
being remedied and will not hap
pen again.
He said further "The under
graduate program needs very
serious attention of departmental
energies."
Harold Quinley, a lecturer in
the department, stated that one of
the largest problems is that in the

main the "large prestigious col
leges hire professors to do re
search many professors just don't
have time for teaching."
He said that he was in favor of
some sort of system in which any
course a student wished to take
would be taught.
It was apparent a number of
professors were reluctant to com
ment, feeling that the situation
might be further inflamed.
Today the TA's are expected
to meet. The meeting has been
somewhat secretive but according
to Quinley the situation may be
settled this afternoon when he un
veils a plan on which he has been
working.
