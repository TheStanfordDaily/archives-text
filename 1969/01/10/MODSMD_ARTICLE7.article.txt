Editor, THE DAILY:
This letter is occasioned by
Mrs. Harvey's Guest Column in
yesterday's Daily on the subject
of low cost housing. My purpose
in writing is particularly to convey
two things: first, that the Univer
sity's Committee on Low Cost
Housing is giving full
consideration to Mrs. Harvey's
views, having received them some
weeks ago; and second, that the
Committee welcomes views on the
subject of low cost housing from
anyone who may wii>h to register
them. I will be pleased to see that
any relevant communication ad
dressed to the Committee is given
distribution either to the full com
mittee or its appropriate sub
committee.
