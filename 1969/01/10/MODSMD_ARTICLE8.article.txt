# SENATE AND STUDENTS
## 
### 
The Academic Senate meeting yesterday makes it elear
that the Stanford faculty cares only about its own interests
and will not think seriously about community government
on campus until they wake up some morning and discover
3000 students armed to battle for a change ot attitude. Our
advice to the faculty is simple: save yourself and this Uni
versity a lot of trouble by rapidly moving toward accep
tanee of Coalition calls for a more democratic governance
system at Stanford.
Coalition requests for equal participation with faculty on
SES adoption-rejection procedures were reasonable and
negotiable, and the faculty senators exhibited little political
acumen by rejecting the Coalition recommendation and
proceeding to water down even their own Academic Senate
steering committee suggestions for increasing student in
volvement in SES proceedings.
The faculty took several steps backward. They exposed
their negative feelings on community government and sent
Coalition members off to their large meeting in Branner last
night with little choice but to move ahead with increasing
militancy toward some sort of confrontation with the
faculty. The Coalition justifiably rejected the mediocre
plans of the faculty.
Confrontations may lead down dangerous paths as was
well documented at Columbia last April. Because many stu
dents will accept nothing less, community government is
coming to Stanford. And the faculty shouldn't sleep on it.
