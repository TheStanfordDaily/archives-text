# ITS No Joke

### DICK GREGORY 
If the new administration is
really serious about bringing
Americans together, a good calen
dar of creative achievement could
be developed from the major
events of the old year. The trage
dy of the strife and starvation in
Viafra and the majesty of Amer
ica's Apollo flight to the moon
wore both marks of 1968. The
combination should suggest to the
new administration that the world
could be fed if America worked as
hard to combat world hunger as
she works to get to the moon.
Americans are constantly bom
barded by reminders of this coun
try's commitment to the space
race. Kiddie cartoons on television
and toy counters all over the
country emphasize the space
theme.
Think what could happen if
Americans were so constantly re
minded of the problem of world
hunger. The President himself
could ask all Americans to give up
a meal each week and send the
money saved to the federal gov
ernment for foreign-aid food pur
chase. Restaurants could be asked
to have containers to collect mon
ey which will be picked up period
ically by postal agents. Supermar
kets could have large containers
into which shoppers can drop
canned food and staple items to
be sent overseas.
Penny-A-Week Campaign
Elementary school children
could begin early to experience
the joy and dignity of human ser
areas of the world, devoting
knowledge and research toward
the elimination of rare diseases

vice, and they woula be a vital
and active force in combating
world starvation. A Penny-a-Week
Campaign could be initiated in the
public schools (when they are in
session): a weekly collection de
liberately low to avoid competi
tion between rich and poor stu
dents.
Nation-wide statistics for 1966
show an elementary and secon
dary school enrollment of
43,055,055. Average daily atten
dance was 39,366,000. A Penny
a-Week Campaign would have col
lected almost $400,000 weekly to
help eliminate world hunger.
One of the major events of
1968 was a national epidemic of
Hong Kong flu. That reminder
should focus the attention of the
new administration on the prob
lem of disease—both in America
and worldwide. A new foreign aid
emphasis should encourage a new
image for America; an image not
of the world's strongest or richest
country, but rather the world's
most humane country.
America's preoccupation with
sharing her resources should be
come so evident that people the
world over will know that if
American resources are not flow
ing into their nation, it is because
their own leaders refuse to accept
them. Let America wage war upon
the infant mortality rate the
world over instead of encouraging
preparation for war through the
delivery of guns and tanks. Let
America provide skilled medical
personnel in the most remote
unknown on the North American
continent.
The shocking brutality at the

qualified young men will be at
tracted to the career of law en
forcement.
The family of any cop or fire
man killed in the line of duty
should receive $10,000. Scholar
ship funds should be established
for the orphan children of cops
and firemen killed in action. The
cop must be treated, trained and
paid as a professional. The cop's
image must be changed from that
of an overseer of wrongs to an ad
vocate of rights. Every effort
should be made at the federal 'cv
el to bring justice to the police
men of America, so that they can
be expected to bring justice to the
American people.
What is true of the cop is also
true of the fireman, the hospital
worker, the teacher, and all other
essential personnel in our society.
We are fond of describing some
jobs as "necessary for defense."
We should begin to concern
ourselves with those jobs whic>
are necessary for survival, arid lor
the encouragement of growth to
full human potential of every
American citizen.
Income Tax
A new federal
must work to wipe out all forms
of injustice in American society.
Let it develop a new way of col
lecting income tax where the rich
share as much of the burden of
payment as the poor. Let the ;ew
administration extend federal
loans to all needy kids who want
to go to college but cannot afford
the cost—every one of them.
Let the federal government "ire
the guiding light for other institu
tions in our society, so that, the

Church, for example, will becorr.e
sincerely involved in solving the
problems of man without worry
ing about the possible reper
cussions in the collection box.
If the Establishment in Amer
ica can honestly sit down >ud
make the kinds of basic changes
the youth of America have been
demanding, perhaps there is a
glimmer of hope for survivj 1 of
both young and old, black, white,
Mexican, Puerto Rican, Indian, in
deed America itself.
Encourage Legislation
A new federal administration
should encourage legislation re
quiring the starting salary for cops
in large cities to be a minimum of
$10,000 per year. Such legislation
would go a long way toward
establishing a new image for the
cop.
He will be more dedicated to
his job, because he will be paid in
proportion to the responsibility
required of him. For the first time
in America, the cop will have the
dignity and respect he needs to
begin to meet social problems
rather than suppress them. Better
Democratic Convention which
marred the 1968 calendar should
encourage the new administration
to take seriously the legitimate
needs of our nation's law enforce
ment officers. One of the most
important issues in creating safe
city streets is dealing fairly and
justly with those who have the job
of stopping crime in the streets;
namely the cops.
