Much has been said, and much has been pub
lished, about today's "alienated" youth and
society. But to some extent, two important ques
tions remain unanswered: Is this, indeed, a special
kind of younger generation? If so, what will be its
impact on U.S. life over the next decade?
To find the answers to these questions, Fortune
has devoted most of its January issue to Youth and
Its View of America. Here, in a single issue of
Fortune, is perhaps the most thorough and search
ing analysis of the topic ever presented by a
magazine. Some of the areas on which this special
study focuses:
■ Why student activists demand reforms
■ The revolution on the square campus
■ Youth and the pop culture cult
■ Parents of the Forties
■ What blue-collar youth thinks
■ A new style of campus living
■ How youth is reforming business
Don't miss this special, single-subject January
issue of Fortune. It's on sale now!
