# Architect Polishes New Library Plans
## 
### MARGIE WOLF 
Plans for an addition to the
main library are presently being
polished. The $20.2 million struc
ture complete with roof gardens
and space for more than two
million books, will extend behind
the main library between Meyer
library and Hoover Tower.

Director of libraries Ruther
ford Rogers said the new library is
aimed at four needs—more space
for graduate collections, more and
better seating for graduates and
advanced undergraduates, a place
for faculty studies, and room for
the library staff to work.
Rogers said a university com
mittee of architects had placed
certain restrictions on the new
structure's appearance—it could
not detract from neighboring
Meyer library and Hoover Tower.
In order to "understate" the
new library, much of it will be
built below ground level. The
fourth of five floors will connect
with the ground floor of the main
library. Each floor will be some
what smaller than the one below
it to minimize the appearance of
the 200,000 square-foot building.
Excavating will provide sunlight
to "humanize" the lower floors.
The Stanford library system
now includes 38 differenct lib
raries, Rogers said, and ranks

eighth in the country in number
of books with more than three
million.
But the collections are "very
uneven," he pointed out. He rated
the graduate school of business,
medicine and education as strong
areas, and law, economics, and
literature as relatively weak. The
main library was outgrown last
summer, he explained, and stacks
have been constructed in the
Meyer Library basement. This
temporary solution will suffice
until early 1973. The addition
would be completed during the
summer of 1973 at the earliest.
The rate of book acquisition
has been doubled in the last four
years. Rogers reported. "We need
more staff to order and catalogue
the new books and they need
space to work," he said.
NO STUDIES
Rogers also mentioned that
there are now no faculty studies
in the main library. "This is really
a sad state of affairs," he said. A

professor in humanities needs the
library like a scientist needs a
physical laboratory. Really good
libraries have two to four hundred
faculty studies."
The library system has already
been changed in some respects,
however. The budget has doubled
in the last four years, and last year
exceeded $4.7 million for all lib
raries. Percentage increases over
the previous year's spending
reached as high as 26 percent in
1965-66, but Rogers explained
the budget can't be expected to
maintain such a high increase rate
when the entire university budget
averages about an 8 percent in
crease.
Also because expansion is ap
proaching the limit of present
space, spending will reach a pla
teau, Rogers said. He set the ideal
budget at 20 percent higher than
the present.
Preliminary stages of the fund
raising drive for the new library
have already begun with glances at

possible government grants.
Rogers noted that places like the
universities of Chicago and In
diana received $3 or $4 million,
but that the federal expenditure
squeeze has hit library improve
ment, too. "We don't know what
we'll get, but it will probably be
substantially below" the $4
million mark, he said.
CONSTRUCTION BIDS
If money is available, constru
ction bids will be received in the
summer of 1970 and the structure
may be occupied by the summer
of 1973. Architects will soon con
centrate on working drawings, or
very detailed plans, and should
complete these by early in 1970.
A preliminary survey of library
needs actually began shortly after
Rogers came to Stanford from the
Library of Congress in 1964. The
final program resulted from a co
operative effort involving Assist
ant Director David Weber and
others, and was not completed un
til November 196^


ARCHITECT'S MODEL —Stanford's proposed new $20.2 million
annex to the Main Library will have extensive roof garden covering
the 200,000-square-foot building.
