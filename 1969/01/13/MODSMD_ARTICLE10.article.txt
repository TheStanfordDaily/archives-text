# To Choose A Trustee
## 
### 
As the Board of Trustees meets on campus today and
tomorrow to consider long-range budget plans, it can hardly
fail to notice the empty chair that signifies the departure of
David Packard for his new post as Nixon's deputy defense
secretary.
Unfortunately, however, the meeting agenda is firmly
finalized and does not include discussion of selecting a suc
cessor to Packard. Such formal discussion will wait until
February, but an agenda surely cannot gag informal consid
eration of the selection question. It would be no small
mistake for Trustees to spend twenty-four hours on campus
without exploring the issue with students, faculty, and ad
ministrators.
Packard's departure opens the entire topic of Trustee
function, membership, and selection. For far too long the
Board has failed to review its activities in reference to
changing times and needs in the University. A group of
elderly businessmen overseeing Stanford may have sufficed
a quarter century or even a decade ago. Today it is an
anachronism. Hither the Board should cease to consider any
thing but long-term budget plans or it should open its mem
bership to students, faculty members, educators, and
churchmen, without selecting those who are white and over
50.
Some argue that student or faculty membership on the
Board will only increase the quantity of issues the Trustees
will only increase the quantity of issues the Trustees will
control, issues presently decided below the Trustee level.
This would be reasonable if the Board did not already rule
on numerous questions that rightfully should never reach
the Board.
It is traditional for example, that Stanford Trustees exer
cise control over changes in the residence system. Adoption
and expansion of co-educational housing is their concern.
The success of Grove House in its first year left the Trustees
with little choice but to expand the program. It might be
noted, however, that the Board was less than enthusiastic
about coed housing, and some few members still believe
Stanford now has a brothel in every living compex.
It is next to impossible t : force the Board to relinquish
control over most campus affairs. There will be times when,
despite some hesitation, Trustees will find events too power
ful to influence, the case with coed housing. At other times,
however, the Board may well exert a potent but negative
power. The most practical prevention to that possibility is
shifting the make-up of the Board to include all constitu
encies on campus. Rather than fearing the decisions the
Board may make, the University ought to look to the Board
for consistently progressive and creative policy-making.
Stanford suffers from an epidemic of committee
making. There are at least five committees responsible for
formulating every University policy. Some are student,
others faculty, and most a combination. Trustees have their
own overlapping committees and now may establish a stu
dent-faculty-Trustee committee. It is amazing, in fact, that
Stanford did not long ago strangle itself with committees.
Would it not be better to have one enlightened body with
representative from the major campus constituencies?
It is therefore exceedingly important for the Trustees to
include student and faculty participation, with voting
power, in the search for a new Trustee. The Trustees, fur
thermore, ought to find a student or faculty member, not
necessarily from Stanford, as the new Trustee. Finally, the
Board must continue to appoint young and progressive
people as Trustees until they sit in equal number with tradi
tional Board members.
Even an anachronism can save itself, but it has to change
rapidly and with serious intent.

representative from the major campus constituencies?
It is therefore exceedingly important for the Trustees to
include student and faculty participation, with voting
power, in the search for a new Trustee. The Trustees, fur
thermore, ought to find a student or faculty member, not
necessarily from Stanford, as the new Trustee. Finally, the
Board must continue to appoint young and progressive
people as Trustees until they sit in equal number with tradi
tional Board members.
Even an anachronism can save itself, but it has to change
rapidly and with serious intent.
As the Board of Trustees meets on campus today and
tomorrow to consider long-range budget plans, it can hardly
fail to notice the empty chair that signifies the departure of
David Packard for his new post as Nixon's deputy defense
secretary.
Unfortunately, however, the meeting agenda is firmly
finalized and does not include discussion of selecting a suc
cessor to Packard. Such formal discussion will wait until
February, but an agenda surely cannot gag informal consid
eration of the selection question. It would be no small
mistake for Trustees to spend twenty-four hours on campus
without exploring the issue with students, faculty, and ad
ministrators.
Packard's departure opens the entire topic of Trustee
function, membership, and selection. For far too long the
Board has failed to review its activities in reference to
changing times and needs in the University. A group of
elderly businessmen overseeing Stanford may have sufficed
a quarter century or even a decade ago. Today it is an
anachronism. Hither the Board should cease to consider any
thing but long-term budget plans or it should open its mem
bership to students, faculty members, educators, and
churchmen, without selecting those who are white and over
50.
Some argue that student or faculty membership on the
Board will only increase the quantity of issues the Trustees
will only increase the quantity of issues the Trustees will
control, issues presently decided below the Trustee level.
This would be reasonable if the Board did not already rule
on numerous questions that rightfully should never reach
the Board.
It is traditional for example, that Stanford Trustees exer
cise control over changes in the residence system. Adoption
and expansion of co-educational housing is their concern.
The success of Grove House in its first year left the Trustees
with little choice but to expand the program. It might be
noted, however, that the Board was less than enthusiastic
about coed housing, and some few members still believe
Stanford now has a brothel in every living compex.
It is next to impossible t : force the Board to relinquish
control over most campus affairs. There will be times when,
despite some hesitation, Trustees will find events too power
ful to influence, the case with coed housing. At other times,
however, the Board may well exert a potent but negative
power. The most practical prevention to that possibility is
shifting the make-up of the Board to include all constitu
encies on campus. Rather than fearing the decisions the
Board may make, the University ought to look to the Board
for consistently progressive and creative policy-making.
Stanford suffers from an epidemic of committee
making. There are at least five committees responsible for
formulating every University policy. Some are student,
others faculty, and most a combination. Trustees have their
own overlapping committees and now may establish a stu
dent-faculty-Trustee committee. It is amazing, in fact, that
Stanford did not long ago strangle itself with committees.
Would it not be better to have one enlightened body with
representative from the major campus constituencies?
