## Students And Community Government 
### ROBERT BEYERS 
(Mr. Beyers is director of the Uni
versity's News Service, and also
serves as the Academic Senate's
information officer, the official
reporter of the senate's activities —
Ed.)
During the past eight years at
Stanford, one of the little noticed
changes has been the growth —
both in size and influence —of
those students who are genuinely
concerned with problems affec
ting the welfare of the entire Uni
versity and have the competence
to make their views carry weight
within its complex system of
governance.
As a rough estimate, these stu
dents may have grown in number
from a dozen or so in the early
1960's to two or three times as
many today. Their significance ex
tends far beyond their size, how
ever, because they are able to ar
ticulate concerns which are far
more widely held among segments
of the University.
Their ability to effect change
has been based on competence
rather than numbers. It has reflec
ted both their willingness to
master the subject matter of a par
ticular change (i.e., sectarian wor
ship on campus) and their persis
tence in presenting their argu
ments to faculty, administrators,
and others whose support is essen
tial to implement change.
This activity lacks the drama of
a confrontation at the Old Union
or a sit-in at the President's
Office. So far as public recogni
tion goes, in fact, students have
received far less than their share
of acclaim. Most have been more
interested in change than credit.
Religious Interests
In the early 1960'5, for ex
ample, a handful of students felt
their religious interests and con
cerns might be more fully pressed
if sectarian worship was permitted
on campus. They studies the
rationale of existing University
policy, developed counter
arguments, enlisted support from
a few faculty and several religious
counselors, and pursued their goal
both in The Daily and in
committee.
Thanks to a private donor, sub
stantial funds were available for
strengthening campus religious
programs. Through faculty
suggestions and presidential per
suasion, the present deart of the
chapel was lured from Yale to
Stanford. Permitted on a trial

basis by the trustees, sectarian
worship on campus clearly has
proven successful, fulfilling the
initial student concerns for
improving our institution.
In 1965, several students felt
campus residential living might be
significantly improved. Student
government organized a housing
commission, a few faculty and
staff joined the study, and a series
of surveys was initiated. The dis
ciplinary suspension of a frater
nity gave students and faculty a
quick chance to introduce their
concepts on a trial basis ai. the
Grove Project. This and subse
quent modifications in campus
living units (coeducation, integra
ted classes, etc.) has substantially
i'lcreased the demand for housing
on campus. Students have played
n major role in helping Stanford
lineup to its stated ideals as a resi
dential university.
SES REPORTS
In the past few weeks, the
campus has begun to receive a
series of reports from the Steering
Committee of the Study of Edu
cation at Stanford. This nine-man
group includes three students,
chosen on the basis of applica
tions and interviews who have
spent two years reviewing Stan
ford's educational and extra
curricular programs. The original
draft of the Steering Committee
report on undergraduate edu
cation —the one with greatest
potential impact on students
was written by an undergraduate.
Since the first of these reports
appeared, concern for their sub
stance has been subordinated to
debate over the policies of their
acceptance or rejection. Initially,
this concern focused on intra
mural faculty policies, more re
cently it has focused on the stu
dent coalition's interest in ob
taining equal voting power with
the faculty on the SES
recommendations.
The student coalition's call for
voting power parity with the Sen
ate of the Academic Council on
SES recommendations is funda
mentally a demand for a basic
change to community government
at Stanford. As such, it has little
hope of prompt adoption and
could well splinter existing sup
port for educational reform at this
university.
LASSU INCOMPETENT
Leaders of the coalition and of
student government freely admit
that the Student Legislature

would not be competent to con
sider SES recommendations. Ef
forts to reform the legislative
branch have been repeatedly frus
trated by slightly more than one
third of the students voting in
ASSU elections.
The faculty took nearly two
years to organize an effective, rep
resentative body, the Senate.
Their action last week, inviting
student government to "Identify
or create" a representative body
of students to participate in dis
cussions of the SES recommenda
tions, suggests that students can
do this same job within a few
weeks.
This act of faith probably was
based on an awareness among
many faculty representatives of
the substantial work done by
Denis Hayes and several other stu
dent leaders in securing a cross
section of students to participate
in the myriad of Senate, Presi
dential, and other campus com
mittees.
This faculty confidence was
not reinforced, to say the least, by
last Thursday's events. For lack of
time, Hayes had to act alone in
selecting eight students to appear
before the Senate, all of whom
came from Humanities and
Sciences and reflected a rather
narrow range of disciplines (2

history majors, 2 political science,
and one each from economies,
German, philosophy and general
studies).
The coalition of any other stu
dent group will command faculty
respect to the extent that its
members demonstrate their
competence in discussing educa
tional issued and, secondarily
based to the extent that it can be
shown that their views reflect
broad student concerns.
Given the apparent lack of an
effective student legislative body
and the need for prompt action,
student competence and concern
might best be demonstrated to the
faculty through the organization
of task forces on specific SES rec
ommendations.
One task force, for example,
could be created on admissions,
drawing together those who have
worked on university committees
in this field, SES students staff
members, and younger students
who are interested in helping
recruit a more diverse student
body.
Similar groups could be created
for governance, finance, resi
dences, teacher evaluation, off
campus education, graduate edu
cation, etc. Even with only a
handful or two of student, these
groups could I) evaluate SES rec

ommendations, 2) offer alterna
tives, 3) solicit faculty views in
public forrums, and 4) organize
student programs to implement
SES recommendations (a recruit
ing council, for example).
Together, the task forces might
comprise the representative body
sought by the Senate.

weeks.
This act of faith probably was
based on an awareness among
many faculty representatives of
the substantial work done by
Denis Hayes and several other stu
dent leaders in securing a cross
section of students to participate
in the myriad of Senate, Presi
dential, and other campus com
mittees.
This faculty confidence was
not reinforced, to say the least, by
last Thursday's events. For lack of
time, Hayes had to act alone in
selecting eight students to appear
before the Senate, all of whom
came from Humanities and
Sciences and reflected a rather
narrow range of disciplines (2

history majors, 2 political science,
and one each from economies,
German, philosophy and general
studies).
The coalition of any other stu
dent group will command faculty
respect to the extent that its
members demonstrate their
competence in discussing educa
tional issued and, secondarily
based to the extent that it can be
shown that their views reflect
broad student concerns.
Given the apparent lack of an
effective student legislative body
and the need for prompt action,
student competence and concern
might best be demonstrated to the
faculty through the organization
of task forces on specific SES rec
ommendations.
One task force, for example,
could be created on admissions,
drawing together those who have
worked on university committees
in this field, SES students staff
members, and younger students
who are interested in helping
recruit a more diverse student
body.
Similar groups could be created
for governance, finance, resi
dences, teacher evaluation, off
campus education, graduate edu
cation, etc. Even with only a
handful or two of student, these
groups could I) evaluate SES rec

ommendations, 2) offer alterna
tives, 3) solicit faculty views in
public forrums, and 4) organize
student programs to implement
SES recommendations (a recruit
ing council, for example).
Together, the task forces might
comprise the representative body
sought by the Senate.

During the past eight years at
Stanford, one of the little noticed
changes has been the growth —
both in size and influence —of
those students who are genuinely
concerned with problems affec
ting the welfare of the entire Uni
versity and have the competence
to make their views carry weight
within its complex system of
governance.
As a rough estimate, these stu
dents may have grown in number
from a dozen or so in the early
1960's to two or three times as
many today. Their significance ex
tends far beyond their size, how
ever, because they are able to ar
ticulate concerns which are far
more widely held among segments
of the University.
Their ability to effect change
has been based on competence
rather than numbers. It has reflec
ted both their willingness to
master the subject matter of a par
ticular change (i.e., sectarian wor
ship on campus) and their persis
tence in presenting their argu
ments to faculty, administrators,
and others whose support is essen
tial to implement change.
This activity lacks the drama of
a confrontation at the Old Union
or a sit-in at the President's
Office. So far as public recogni
tion goes, in fact, students have
received far less than their share
of acclaim. Most have been more
interested in change than credit.
Religious Interests
In the early 1960'5, for ex
ample, a handful of students felt
their religious interests and con
cerns might be more fully pressed
if sectarian worship was permitted
on campus. They studies the
rationale of existing University
policy, developed counter
arguments, enlisted support from
a few faculty and several religious
counselors, and pursued their goal
both in The Daily and in
committee.
Thanks to a private donor, sub
stantial funds were available for
strengthening campus religious
programs. Through faculty
suggestions and presidential per
suasion, the present deart of the
chapel was lured from Yale to
Stanford. Permitted on a trial

basis by the trustees, sectarian
worship on campus clearly has
proven successful, fulfilling the
initial student concerns for
improving our institution.
In 1965, several students felt
campus residential living might be
significantly improved. Student
government organized a housing
commission, a few faculty and
staff joined the study, and a series
of surveys was initiated. The dis
ciplinary suspension of a frater
nity gave students and faculty a
quick chance to introduce their
concepts on a trial basis ai. the
Grove Project. This and subse
quent modifications in campus
living units (coeducation, integra
ted classes, etc.) has substantially
i'lcreased the demand for housing
on campus. Students have played
n major role in helping Stanford
lineup to its stated ideals as a resi
dential university.
SES REPORTS
In the past few weeks, the
campus has begun to receive a
series of reports from the Steering
Committee of the Study of Edu
cation at Stanford. This nine-man
group includes three students,
chosen on the basis of applica
tions and interviews who have
spent two years reviewing Stan
ford's educational and extra
curricular programs. The original
draft of the Steering Committee
report on undergraduate edu
cation —the one with greatest
potential impact on students
was written by an undergraduate.
Since the first of these reports
appeared, concern for their sub
stance has been subordinated to
debate over the policies of their
acceptance or rejection. Initially,
this concern focused on intra
mural faculty policies, more re
cently it has focused on the stu
dent coalition's interest in ob
taining equal voting power with
the faculty on the SES
recommendations.
The student coalition's call for
voting power parity with the Sen
ate of the Academic Council on
SES recommendations is funda
mentally a demand for a basic
change to community government
at Stanford. As such, it has little
hope of prompt adoption and
could well splinter existing sup
port for educational reform at this
university.
LASSU INCOMPETENT
Leaders of the coalition and of
student government freely admit
that the Student Legislature

would not be competent to con
sider SES recommendations. Ef
forts to reform the legislative
branch have been repeatedly frus
trated by slightly more than one
third of the students voting in
ASSU elections.
The faculty took nearly two
years to organize an effective, rep
resentative body, the Senate.
Their action last week, inviting
student government to "Identify
or create" a representative body
of students to participate in dis
cussions of the SES recommenda
tions, suggests that students can
do this same job within a few
weeks.

i'lcreased the demand for housing
on campus. Students have played
n major role in helping Stanford
lineup to its stated ideals as a resi
dential university.
SES REPORTS
In the past few weeks, the
campus has begun to receive a
series of reports from the Steering
Committee of the Study of Edu
cation at Stanford. This nine-man
group includes three students,
chosen on the basis of applica
tions and interviews who have
spent two years reviewing Stan
ford's educational and extra
curricular programs. The original
draft of the Steering Committee
report on undergraduate edu
cation —the one with greatest
potential impact on students
was written by an undergraduate.
Since the first of these reports
appeared, concern for their sub
stance has been subordinated to
debate over the policies of their
acceptance or rejection. Initially,
this concern focused on intra
mural faculty policies, more re
cently it has focused on the stu
dent coalition's interest in ob
taining equal voting power with
the faculty on the SES
recommendations.
The student coalition's call for
voting power parity with the Sen
ate of the Academic Council on
SES recommendations is funda
mentally a demand for a basic
change to community government
at Stanford. As such, it has little
hope of prompt adoption and
could well splinter existing sup
port for educational reform at this
university.
LASSU INCOMPETENT
Leaders of the coalition and of
student government freely admit
that the Student Legislature

would not be competent to con
sider SES recommendations. Ef
forts to reform the legislative
branch have been repeatedly frus
trated by slightly more than one
third of the students voting in
ASSU elections.
The faculty took nearly two
years to organize an effective, rep
resentative body, the Senate.
Their action last week, inviting
student government to "Identify
or create" a representative body
of students to participate in dis
cussions of the SES recommenda
tions, suggests that students can
do this same job within a few
weeks.
This act of faith probably was
based on an awareness among
many faculty representatives of
the substantial work done by
Denis Hayes and several other stu
dent leaders in securing a cross
section of students to participate
in the myriad of Senate, Presi
dential, and other campus com
mittees.
This faculty confidence was
not reinforced, to say the least, by
last Thursday's events. For lack of
time, Hayes had to act alone in
selecting eight students to appear
before the Senate, all of whom
came from Humanities and
Sciences and reflected a rather
narrow range of disciplines (2

history majors, 2 political science,
and one each from economies,
German, philosophy and general
studies).
The coalition of any other stu
dent group will command faculty
respect to the extent that its
members demonstrate their
competence in discussing educa
tional issued and, secondarily
based to the extent that it can be
shown that their views reflect
broad student concerns.
Given the apparent lack of an
effective student legislative body
and the need for prompt action,
student competence and concern
might best be demonstrated to the
faculty through the organization
of task forces on specific SES rec
ommendations.
One task force, for example,
could be created on admissions,
drawing together those who have
worked on university committees
in this field, SES students staff
members, and younger students
who are interested in helping
recruit a more diverse student
body.
Similar groups could be created
for governance, finance, resi
dences, teacher evaluation, off
campus education, graduate edu
cation, etc. Even with only a
handful or two of student, these
groups could I) evaluate SES rec

ommendations, 2) offer alterna
tives, 3) solicit faculty views in
public forrums, and 4) organize
student programs to implement
SES recommendations (a recruit
ing council, for example).
Together, the task forces might
comprise the representative body
sought by the Senate.
(Mr. Beyers is director of the Uni
versity's News Service, and also
serves as the Academic Senate's
information officer, the official
reporter of the senate's activities —
Ed.)
During the past eight years at
Stanford, one of the little noticed
changes has been the growth —
both in size and influence —of
those students who are genuinely
concerned with problems affec
ting the welfare of the entire Uni
versity and have the competence
to make their views carry weight
within its complex system of
governance.
As a rough estimate, these stu
dents may have grown in number
from a dozen or so in the early
1960's to two or three times as
many today. Their significance ex
tends far beyond their size, how
ever, because they are able to ar
ticulate concerns which are far
more widely held among segments
of the University.
Their ability to effect change
has been based on competence
rather than numbers. It has reflec
ted both their willingness to
master the subject matter of a par
ticular change (i.e., sectarian wor
ship on campus) and their persis
tence in presenting their argu
ments to faculty, administrators,
and others whose support is essen
tial to implement change.
This activity lacks the drama of
a confrontation at the Old Union
or a sit-in at the President's
Office. So far as public recogni
tion goes, in fact, students have
received far less than their share
of acclaim. Most have been more
interested in change than credit.
Religious Interests
In the early 1960'5, for ex
ample, a handful of students felt
their religious interests and con
cerns might be more fully pressed
if sectarian worship was permitted
on campus. They studies the
rationale of existing University
policy, developed counter
arguments, enlisted support from
a few faculty and several religious
counselors, and pursued their goal
both in The Daily and in
committee.
Thanks to a private donor, sub
stantial funds were available for
strengthening campus religious
programs. Through faculty
suggestions and presidential per
suasion, the present deart of the
chapel was lured from Yale to
Stanford. Permitted on a trial

basis by the trustees, sectarian
worship on campus clearly has
proven successful, fulfilling the
initial student concerns for
improving our institution.
In 1965, several students felt
campus residential living might be
significantly improved. Student
government organized a housing
commission, a few faculty and
staff joined the study, and a series
of surveys was initiated. The dis
ciplinary suspension of a frater
nity gave students and faculty a
quick chance to introduce their
concepts on a trial basis ai. the
Grove Project. This and subse
quent modifications in campus
living units (coeducation, integra

i'lcreased the demand for housing
on campus. Students have played
