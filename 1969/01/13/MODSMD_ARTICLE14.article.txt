# Would You Believe?
## Power Moves On 
### ART BUCHWALD 
Power, the opiate of the people
who live in Washington, is starting
to slip through the hands of the
odl Administration and is being
grabbed by the new. There are
signs of the switch taking place
every day. For example, Tuesday
I was at the Sans Souci restaurant,
the place where the White House
power structure usually has lunch.
One of President Johnson's
aides came in and was escorted to
his usual table. He sat there for
two hours, alone. The person he
was suppose to have lunch with
never showed up.
The man I was eating with,
who has lived through several ad
ministration changeovers in Wash
ington, shook his head sadly and
said, "The poor 5.0.8. They're
trying to tell him something."
"Is that how they usually do
it?" I asked.
"Sometimes they cancel his
table before he arrives. That way
nobody knows he was stood up
fpr lunch. This way, everybody
knows. It will be all over town in
an hour."
"But suppose the person who
was to have lunch with him just
couldn't make it 3 /4"
"You don't understand. If
you've got the power, the person
makes it. Sombody else gets stood
up. But if you don't have the
power any m-Jie. then you get
stood up. He's looking over here
and smiling at us. Whatever you
do, don't smile back."
"But he's my friend," 1 pro
tested. "If he smiles at me, I'll
have to smile back."
"He doesn't want you just to
smile back. He wants you to invite

him to sit with us so it doesn't
look as if he's been stood up. We
can't afford that."
"Are you trying to tell me that
the new guys wouldn't trust us if
we bought an old Administration
guy a cup of coffee?"
"I'm trying to tell you that
everyone in this restaurant is
aware of what is going on. Sure, it
would be a nice, brave, gutty
thing to wave and say, 'Come over
for a brandy.' And there are
probably a few people in the res
taurant who would admire us for
it. But most of the people in this
restaurant feel exacty as I do.
They guy came in here alone. Let
him leave alone.
"It seems so cruel."
''Government is cruel," my
friend said. "But he'll be all right.
He'll probably get $100,000 a year
when he gets out of the White
House, not to mention an advance
of half a million dollars on a
book, plus lecture fees. He's not
going to starve to death."
"But the thought of nobody
ever eating lunch with him ..." I
said.
"Couldn't I just go over to his
table and say goodbye?" I asked.
"I wouldn't chance it. Herb
Klein just came in." My friend
waved widly at Klein, Richard
Nixon's new communications
chief.
in the excitment, my friend
from the White House got up
from the table and left the restau
rant. No one else in the Sans
Souci noticed he was gone.
