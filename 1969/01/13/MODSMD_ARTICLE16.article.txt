## 'Things Fit' At Fillmore 
### PETER THOMPSON 
I hope you got back to school early. So
you could go to the Fillmore two weeks ago.
It was a magnificent show, probably the
single best collection of artists appearing
here in the last nine or ten months. Blood,
Sweat and Tears. The Grateful Dead. Spirit.
They sound like life styles, which they
are. But they're also, along with the Airplane
and the band from Big Pink, the epitome of
white American contemporary music.
The three groups seem remarkably similar
at first, and it's difficult to absorb all of
them in a single evening. Still, you've got to
give Graham credit for the programming:
Blood, Sweat and Tears, leading to the Dead,
followed by Spirit. That's pretty eerie.
All three are loosely based in white
blues-rock-etc., yet all give a definite jazz
texture to their music, which is often set in a
fairly rigid classical framework.
IMPROVISATION
The improvisations and solos (and each
musician in these groups is capable of sus
taining interest and excitment throughout
his individual riffs) are vased upon, and must
appear within, the general themes and direc
tion of the group's music. Things fit.
Yet the conspicuous building and tension
within each song—and the set as a whole
—rarely becomes formal. The continual re
directing prevents sterility, without ever
lapsing into random diddling; the changes
work because of these groups' immense
talent and obvious familiarity with each
other.
The last time I saw Spirit, they were play
ing a lot of Coltrane, self-consciously yet
quite impressively. They have evolved, have
developed their own forms, yet still play

with far more freedom than most groups.
They remain a highly eclectic group while
continually giving greater importance to
electronics. Randy California's guitar is sup
pose to be from a Sears catalogue, but all its
adapters, amps and assorted freaky gadgets
are definitely home-grown.
BLOOD SWEAT AND TEARS
Blood, Sweat and Tears began as the A 1
Kooper Experience. Their first album is
quite nice, but Kooper's presence becomes a
bit stifling. It was obvious then that there
was a great deal more to the group than this
guit a r is t-gone-organist-gone-producer who
never could sing, but he had appeared on
both Highway 61 Revisited and "Who Wears
Short Shorts", which is something.
Kooper left to the Columbia Complex
(his first solo record for the is modestly
titled "I Stand Alone"), a few changes were
made in the horn section, David Clayton-
Thomas was brought down from Canada to
sing, and Altoist Fred Lipsius assumed the
role of quasi-leader.
They're really a bitch now. Jim Fielder's
striking bass, Clayton Thomas' Bobby
Bland-like voice, and Dick Halligan's flute
and keyboard work usually stand out. The
horns are beautiful; there is no other rock
group using so many horns so well.
Some of the BS&T songs are grossly over
arranged. But even when they are such as
with Steve Winwood and Jim Capaldi's
"Smiling Phrases", they manage to bring it
off as a comical pardoy of Broadway show
music or as a necessary part of their polished
big band performance.

GREATFUL DEAD
Rumors of the break-up of the Grateful
Dead have been floating around for over a
year, but the group just keeps adding mus
icians. First a second drummer, now a full
time organist so Pig Pen can concentrate on
his harp and vocals.
They still seem much the same sprawling,
joyous family. The music of the Dead is
really San Francisco's down-home sound; it
grows increasingly complex, but it still gives
off Trips Festival vibrations.
They seem to have recently re-discovered
their first album, and last weekend did the
always-moving "Morning Dew" and always
boring "Good Morning Little School Girl".
The rest of the set was a delightful build
from "Dark Starr" to "Turn on Your Love
light," interspersed with lots of nice transi
tions, new tunes, and changing arrange
ments.
Bob Wier still jumps up and down, grin
ning like a perennial 17 year-old, Pig Pen
seems to be interested in singing again, and
Garcia, Lesh and the two drummers, remain,
along with the Airplane the finest lead-bass
drum nucleus in the country.
No, don't worry about the Dead. They're
playing better than ever. They want to give
their next record away. Free. If the physical
separation of its members ever does come,
their music wil just go on playing itself for
months afterward.
An awesome evening, yet so immediately
compelling that many people were dancing
again. By the way, Spirit's from L.A., BS&T
from New York and the Dead from 910-A
Ashbury Street. That's the real difference.

his harp and vocals.
They still seem much the same sprawling,
joyous family. The music of the Dead is
really San Francisco's down-home sound; it
grows increasingly complex, but it still gives
off Trips Festival vibrations.
They seem to have recently re-discovered
their first album, and last weekend did the
always-moving "Morning Dew" and always
boring "Good Morning Little School Girl".
The rest of the set was a delightful build
from "Dark Starr" to "Turn on Your Love
light," interspersed with lots of nice transi
tions, new tunes, and changing arrange
ments.
Bob Wier still jumps up and down, grin
ning like a perennial 17 year-old, Pig Pen
seems to be interested in singing again, and
Garcia, Lesh and the two drummers, remain,
along with the Airplane the finest lead-bass
drum nucleus in the country.
No, don't worry about the Dead. They're
playing better than ever. They want to give
their next record away. Free. If the physical
separation of its members ever does come,
their music wil just go on playing itself for
months afterward.
An awesome evening, yet so immediately
compelling that many people were dancing
again. By the way, Spirit's from L.A., BS&T
from New York and the Dead from 910-A
Ashbury Street. That's the real difference.
I hope you got back to school early. So
you could go to the Fillmore two weeks ago.
It was a magnificent show, probably the
single best collection of artists appearing
here in the last nine or ten months. Blood,
Sweat and Tears. The Grateful Dead. Spirit.
They sound like life styles, which they
are. But they're also, along with the Airplane
and the band from Big Pink, the epitome of
white American contemporary music.
The three groups seem remarkably similar
at first, and it's difficult to absorb all of
them in a single evening. Still, you've got to
give Graham credit for the programming:
Blood, Sweat and Tears, leading to the Dead,
followed by Spirit. That's pretty eerie.
All three are loosely based in white
blues-rock-etc., yet all give a definite jazz
texture to their music, which is often set in a
fairly rigid classical framework.
IMPROVISATION
The improvisations and solos (and each
musician in these groups is capable of sus
taining interest and excitment throughout
his individual riffs) are vased upon, and must
appear within, the general themes and direc
tion of the group's music. Things fit.
Yet the conspicuous building and tension
within each song—and the set as a whole
—rarely becomes formal. The continual re
directing prevents sterility, without ever
lapsing into random diddling; the changes
work because of these groups' immense
talent and obvious familiarity with each
other.
The last time I saw Spirit, they were play
ing a lot of Coltrane, self-consciously yet
quite impressively. They have evolved, have
developed their own forms, yet still play

with far more freedom than most groups.
They remain a highly eclectic group while
continually giving greater importance to
electronics. Randy California's guitar is sup
pose to be from a Sears catalogue, but all its
adapters, amps and assorted freaky gadgets
are definitely home-grown.
BLOOD SWEAT AND TEARS
Blood, Sweat and Tears began as the A 1
Kooper Experience. Their first album is
quite nice, but Kooper's presence becomes a
bit stifling. It was obvious then that there
was a great deal more to the group than this
guit a r is t-gone-organist-gone-producer who
never could sing, but he had appeared on
both Highway 61 Revisited and "Who Wears
Short Shorts", which is something.
Kooper left to the Columbia Complex
(his first solo record for the is modestly
titled "I Stand Alone"), a few changes were
made in the horn section, David Clayton-
Thomas was brought down from Canada to
sing, and Altoist Fred Lipsius assumed the
role of quasi-leader.
They're really a bitch now. Jim Fielder's
striking bass, Clayton Thomas' Bobby
Bland-like voice, and Dick Halligan's flute
and keyboard work usually stand out. The
horns are beautiful; there is no other rock
group using so many horns so well.
Some of the BS&T songs are grossly over
arranged. But even when they are such as
with Steve Winwood and Jim Capaldi's
"Smiling Phrases", they manage to bring it
off as a comical pardoy of Broadway show
music or as a necessary part of their polished
big band performance.

GREATFUL DEAD
Rumors of the break-up of the Grateful
Dead have been floating around for over a
year, but the group just keeps adding mus
icians. First a second drummer, now a full

bit stifling. It was obvious then that there
was a great deal more to the group than this
guit a r is t-gone-organist-gone-producer who
never could sing, but he had appeared on
both Highway 61 Revisited and "Who Wears
Short Shorts", which is something.
Kooper left to the Columbia Complex
(his first solo record for the is modestly
titled "I Stand Alone"), a few changes were
made in the horn section, David Clayton-
Thomas was brought down from Canada to
sing, and Altoist Fred Lipsius assumed the
role of quasi-leader.
They're really a bitch now. Jim Fielder's
striking bass, Clayton Thomas' Bobby
Bland-like voice, and Dick Halligan's flute
and keyboard work usually stand out. The
horns are beautiful; there is no other rock
group using so many horns so well.
Some of the BS&T songs are grossly over
arranged. But even when they are such as
with Steve Winwood and Jim Capaldi's
"Smiling Phrases", they manage to bring it
off as a comical pardoy of Broadway show
music or as a necessary part of their polished
big band performance.

GREATFUL DEAD
Rumors of the break-up of the Grateful
Dead have been floating around for over a
year, but the group just keeps adding mus
icians. First a second drummer, now a full
time organist so Pig Pen can concentrate on
his harp and vocals.
They still seem much the same sprawling,
joyous family. The music of the Dead is
really San Francisco's down-home sound; it
grows increasingly complex, but it still gives
off Trips Festival vibrations.
They seem to have recently re-discovered
their first album, and last weekend did the
always-moving "Morning Dew" and always
boring "Good Morning Little School Girl".
The rest of the set was a delightful build
from "Dark Starr" to "Turn on Your Love
light," interspersed with lots of nice transi
tions, new tunes, and changing arrange
ments.
Bob Wier still jumps up and down, grin
ning like a perennial 17 year-old, Pig Pen
seems to be interested in singing again, and
Garcia, Lesh and the two drummers, remain,
along with the Airplane the finest lead-bass
drum nucleus in the country.
No, don't worry about the Dead. They're
playing better than ever. They want to give
their next record away. Free. If the physical
separation of its members ever does come,
their music wil just go on playing itself for
months afterward.
An awesome evening, yet so immediately
compelling that many people were dancing
again. By the way, Spirit's from L.A., BS&T
from New York and the Dead from 910-A
Ashbury Street. That's the real difference.
