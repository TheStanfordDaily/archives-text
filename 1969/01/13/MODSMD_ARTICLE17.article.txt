# 'Colonialism Must End Despite War Outcome'
## 
### 
Regardless of the outcome of
the U. S. war in Vietnam, we must
stop meddling in the affairs of
Southeast Asia, says History Prof
Claude Buss.
Anti-colonialism is "far from
dead," he notes in a recent public
report, and the Asians see all their
problems—war, disease, poverty
and ignorance—as a direct out
growth of colonial exploitation by
the white man.
"And we can never be anything
but foreign in Asia," he empha
sizes, "no matter how much we
protest, we are always suspected
of selfish motives.
"Asians, in their own earthy
way, think that if we send Ameri
can boys to die by the thousands,
and spend money by coutless
billions, there must be something
in it for us.
"Neither the missionary spirit
nor the high role of idealism has
the same merit on most Asian
scales of value that they have on
ours."
Move to Nationalism
Buss, who is a consultant to
the State Department, has served
as a foreign service officer in
China, Japan and the Philippines
and written four major books on
Southeast Asia. He finds that
most Asian leaders are now mov
ing away from a negative anti
foreign stand toward a very solid
nationalism.

"If we give them aid, it must
be without strings; if we fight be
side them, they must have a voice
in command; if we make peace,
they must have the primary role,"
he declares.
Most stable Asian governments
are right-of-center, friendly to us
and neutral in the cold war. Thus
we are inclined to identify with
them and this unwittingly pits us
against the native political groups
who are usually leftist-oriented
and are for reform at a more ac
celerated pace, Buss points out.
So we are identified with the
least progressive elements in the
society, and are "tarred with the
same brush as they are" in the
minds of the populace.
"Asia" Means Little
"It is highly unrealistic to
think of Southeast Asia as homo
geneous," Buss says."The man in
the street doesn't identify himself
as an Asian—he thinks of himself
as a Filipino, a Thai or an Indo
nesian.
"Each state presents its own
peculiar challenge to American
policy, and each in its own way

underscores the warning that
there must be no more Viet
nams."
Leaders in Laos, Burma and
Indonesia have ail assured us th?t
they can settle their internal do
mestic problems without Ameri
can military aid, and though fu
ture possibilities might make it
necessary for us to live up to
SEATO treaty obligations, "for
most of these disputes, we have
neither the wisdom nor the power
to settle them and we would be
foolish to try."
"If Asians want revolution—or
modernization, or national liber
ation. . . badly enough to fight
for it," Prof. Buss concludes, "it is
neither in our power nor our in
terest to stop them."
We can give them spiritual and
economic help, we may even per
suade them that their future holds
greater promise under our way of
life than under communism, but
Asian nations cannot do more
than they are already doing and
won't be able to until they them
selves develop and mature, he be
lieves.
