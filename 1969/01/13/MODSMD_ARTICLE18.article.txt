## Nixon Choice Under Fire 
### 
Alaska Governor Walter J.
Hickel, President-elect Nixon's
choice for Secretary of the Inter
ior, is under fire from Stanford
biologists for his conservation pol
icies as stated in recent press re
ports.
In letters to California Senators
George Murphy and Alan Crans
ton, nearly the entire faculty of
the Biological Sciences Depart
ment urges "that the Senate give
more than routine scrutiny to Mr.
Hickel's qualifications for this im
portant position.
"If it is found that the state
ments reported in the press ac
curately depict his attitudes and
interests," the letters state, "he
should be denied confirmation as
Secretary."
Hickel has been quoted in

newspaper articles as being against
"conservation for conservation's
sake." He is reported to have said
that "just to withdraw a large area
fa- conservation purposes and
lock it up for no reason doesn't
have any merit." The Alaska
governor also was quoted as say
ing that setting water pollution
standards too high "might hinder
industrial development." "Judging
from these statements, it seems
obvious that Mr. Hickel neither
understands nor appreciates the
basic principales of conservation
or the need to preserve man's en
vironment from destruction by his
own carelessness,"said Pof. Paul
R. Ehrlich, noted Stanford popu
lation biologist, when asked for
further comment on the matter.
"My colleagues and I feel that
the population-environment crisis

is already so serious that the very
existence of mankind is in jeop
ardy," he added, "at this juncture
we need an administration which
is dedicated to ameliorating the
crisis, not to worsening it in the
name of short-term economic ad
vances."
Fifteen members of the biol
ogy faculty signed the letters,
copies of which also were sent to
Senator Henry Jackson, Chairman
of the Senate committee which
will conduct hearings on the
Nixon cabinet appointees.
