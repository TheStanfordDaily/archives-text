# Computer Linkup Instructs Students
## 
### 
Stanford's famed computer-assisted instruction (CAI) network
now includes 300 deaf children at the Kendall School, Washington,
D.C.
And starting today, the network wil begin drilling 600 freshmen at
Tennessee Agricultural and Industrial State University in Nashville in
introductory algebra.
The handicapped youngsters at Kendall are finishing their first
semester of drill and practice in mathematics at their respective grade
levels at three teletype machines connected to the Stanford Compu
tation Center.
Four or five more consoles are expected to be installed during the
remainder of the school year, reports Max Jerman, research associate
at the Stanford Institute for Mathematical Studies in the Social
Sciences (IMSSS), project coordinator.
Kendall School is a demonstration school integral with Gallaudet
College in Washington, D.C. Gallaudet, a coeducation institution
founded in 1864, is exclusively for the education of the deaf.
Earphones Amplified
The Kendall youngsters had CAI procedure explained to them last
fall by highly-amplified earphones. Since that time, they have success
fully used the same drill-and-practice lessons supplied to youngsters in
Palo Alto area schools, in McCorrb, Miss., and Eastern Kentucky.
It also marks the first transcontinental hookup of the CAI net
work, established at Stanford under the direction of Prof. Patrick
Suppes, director of IMSSS, nearly four years ago.
Their drill is programmed into the Stanford computer in the same
manner as all the others, and is furnished them daily as soon as each
student types his name and code number on the keyboard.
The programs increase in difficulty as skill and competence in
crease —all automatically in the flash of a micorsecond of computer
line.
The teletype connection at all-black Tennessee A&I is especially
designed for entering freshment who want to brush-up on their back
ground before entering regular college calculus courses
The program is designed in cooperation with Tennessee A&I facu
lty members for problem-solving . The computer offers problems at
five levels of difficulty. The student will begin on drill-and-practice
first. Later, he will be given problem-solving exercises. The 20 teletype
consoles have been installed in a portable classroom near the Math-
Physics building. Students practice for 20 minutes a day.
