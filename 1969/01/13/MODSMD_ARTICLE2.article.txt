# TA's, Profs Seek Compromise
## 
### 
Several alternative solutions to
recent problems over student
initiated, TA-directed courses
within the political science depart
ment were suggested over the
weekend by concerned partici
pants.
Political science graduate stu
dents outlined a proposed com
promise that they feel will meet
"the needs and values of all
sides."
That plan, presented by gradu
ate student Dick Winters at an
open meeting Friday afternoon,
calls for the creation of a commit
tee on experimental curriculum to
evaluate undergraduate course
proposals. The proposed commit
tee would be composed of three
faculty members, three undergrad
uates, and three graduate students
in political science
Response Mixed
Although there has been no
formal endorsement of the Win
ters plan by the graduate students,
Carter Weiss, president of the Poli
tical Science graduate Student As
sociation, said that the expected
virtually unanimous support.
Response from other quarters,
however, was not so enthusiastic.
Undergraduates reportedly felt
the proposal was too restrictive,
while most faculty members
seemed unwilling to compromise.
Despite a certain pessimism
over the plan's chances of accept
ance, the proposal will be pre
sented to the department early
this week.
Prof. Raymond Wolfinger,
chairman of the department's Un
dergraduate Curriculum Commit
tee, said that his committee of
five faculty members was cur
rently accepting applications for
two student positions.
Wolfinger expressed the hope
that student participation as equal
voting members of this commit
eee, together with an increase in a
direct and specific student com
ment, would solve some of the
communication problems that this
dispute has made obvious.
Wolfinger also outlined plans
for a series of informal meetings
to be held by the department to
help clear up misunderstandings
on a wide range of subjects.
Demands to Be Discussed
When directly asked about the
five student-led courses demanded
by a number of undergraduate
students,Wolfinger replied that his
committee will consider tomor
row the proposed Marxism course
which had been the center of a
misunderstanding at the time of
the original department decision.
Although Wolfinger acknowl
edged that the other demands will
undoubtedly be discussed at Wed

nesday's department meeting, he
expressed doubt that any of the
courses would be approved.
One of the other four courses
still lacks a sponsor; and the other
three, according to Wolfinger, are
similar to regular courses either
offered this quarter or proposed
for Spring quarter.
