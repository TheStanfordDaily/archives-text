# Double Defeat
## Tribe Clobbered 
### FRED MANN 
It looks like it may be a long
year for Coach Howie Dallmar's
Stanford basketball squad.
After a dismal pre-conference
season that left the Indians as the
only Pacific Eight team with a
losing record (4-7), they faced
Washington and Washington State
over this last weekend.
The results were far from en
couraging.
On Friday night, the Cards
were slaughtered by a quick and
young Washington five, 76-59.
The next evening, Stanford rallied
against the Cougars of Washington
State, but lost a thriller, 71-66.
Perhaps the high point of the
weekend in the new Roscoe
Maples Pavilion was the individual
effort of Co-captain Don Griffin.
Griff hit for 39 points in the two
games to push his career total to
1013. He is now tied for sixth with
Bill Bond ('SS-'SS) on the list of
top all-time Stanford scorers.
Huskie Surge
However Griffin's 20 points
against the Huskies was not
enough to save the Indians from a
loss. The home team held the
early lead in the contest, 11-6.
Washington, behind the shooting
of Dave Willenborg then ran off 14
points to Stanford's one to put
the visitors ahead to stay.
The potent combination of
6'9" Jay Bond and the extremely
quick guards, Willenborg, 6'o",
and Dave West, 6'o", was too
much for a weak Tribe defense.
Bond hit for 24 points from close
range, and when the Card defense
collapsed in to protect the middle,
Willenborg and West popped from
the outside.
West had 15 and Willenborg 13
for the Huskies who shot an amaz
ing 53 percent from the field.
Stanford was ice cold hitting only
32 percent.
Griffin was held to only four
points in the first half by the tight
man-to-man coverage. He only got

off five field goal attempts. After
intermission Griff started scoring,
but mainly on the strength of his
eight free throws.
Mai McElwain scored 11 points
and Mike Michel, eight, in the
losing effort.
The Indians simply could not
get untracked in the second half
and came no coser than 13 points.
On Saturday night, the Cardin
als faced a very similar team in
Washington State, and made a
much better show of it.
Featuring a big, rugged center
and two quick guards, the Cougars
faced tougher opposition than did
the Huskies the night before.
Again Stanford broke on top only
to lose that lead half way through
the first period. WSU led 40-31 at
half thanks to reserve guard Mike
Gomez who hit 66 per cent of his
shots. Just like the night before,
Griffin was bottled up early but
came back to ead a second half
Indian surge that gave Stanford
the lead with only 6:11 remaining
to play.
Super Sub Shines
Gomez continued to hit for the
visitors and led a Cougar stall late
in the game. The Tribe was within
one point of WSU with 43
seconds left, but lost the ball to
Dennis Hogg before they could
get a shot off.
A last ditch Stanford effort
ended in a swinging match be
tween Cougar center Ted Wierman
and four Stanford players, with
the only casualty being the referee
who was decked trying to end the
three second "fight". Wierman
had been hit by McElwain and
three others while going up for a
rebound with only 13 seconds left
to play, and came up off the
ground swinging for Griffin. No
blows were landed. Wierman hit
both free throws to end the ball
game and send Coach Dallmar's
club down to their ninth loss in 13
games.
