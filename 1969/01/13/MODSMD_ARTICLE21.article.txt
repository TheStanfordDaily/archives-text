# Cards Ruin Ramblers In Rough Rugby Play
## 
### 
Stanford's rubgy team opened
the defense of it's unofficial "No.
1" national ranking with a hard
fought 14-9 win over the Peninsula
Ramblers Rugby Club.
Sophomore football standout
Jim Kaufmann scored two tries
and Leon Hartvickson added a
third try, a conversion, and a
penalty kick to account for the
Tribe's scoring.
Coach Pete Kmetovic's backs
played a devastating game. Dick
"The Hock" Ragsdale, whose
spiffy attire created quite a stir
among the female spectators,
shook up the Rambler defenders
just as much with some excellent
kicking and passing.
Kaufmann, playing in his first
game, displayed the rugby in
stincts of a veteran. Twice, he cut
outside from his center three
quarters position to take passes
that led to tries.
Scrum half Jim Pulliam, faced
with the formidible task of re

placing last year's field general
Dave Evans, also turned in a good
performance.
Tribe Dominates
Stanford actually dominated
the game more than the 14-9 score
would indicate. The ball rarely
ventured out of the Rambler terri
tory in the second half. The nor
mally on-target Hartvickson
missed five penalty kicks in the
second half, and Jack Alustiza
misses a try and when he failed to
touch the ball down.
The Rambler's aggressive play
(some might call it "dirty")
threatened to turn the match
into a brawl at times, but there
were no major injuries or fiehts.
Second Win
The second team rolled over
the UC Santa Cruz varsity 13-0, as
Larry Mowell scored two tries.
The thirds, playing against the
Rambler "second" team, lost 13-6.
