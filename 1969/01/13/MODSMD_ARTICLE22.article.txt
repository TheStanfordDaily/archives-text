# Swim Hopes Soar
## Stanford Romps To Relay Triumph 
### GARY CAVALLI 
In a brilliant early season per
formance, Coach Jim Gaughran's
varsity swimmers waltzed to an
impressive victory in the six-team
Stanford Relays Saturday after
noon in the Tribe tank.
The final point spread was a
surprising 27 points, as the Indian
varsity chalked up 75 points to 48
for the runner-up Santa Clara
Swim Club. A poised Stanford
frosh team, led by Mark Shilling
and Dave Shelley, totalled 46
points for third place, while Uni
versity of California was fourth
with 43 and the fifth-place Foot
hill Aquatic Club checked in with
36 markers. The outclassed Arden
Hills Aquatic Club might as well
have stayed home, managing but
one fifth place for two points.
The Indians grabbed seven
firsts in the all-relay affair, setting
two meet records along the way.
In the 200 medley relay, Fred
Haywood, Tag Leonard, Luis
Nicolao and Bob Jamison erased
the former standard of 1:40.9 by
one half-second. Minutes later, the
Argentina-born Nicolao teamed
with captain Pete Siebert and
Olympic bronze medal-winner
John Ferris to shatter the existing
300 butterfly mark. Ferris, Sie
bert and Nicolao clocked 2:41.1,
breaking the old record by seven
tenths of a second.
Stanford's five other firsts
came in the 200, 400, and 800
freestyle relays, the 300 medley

relay and diving relay (two divers
representing each team).
Jeff Hammett, Rick Eagleston,
Morgan Manning, and Kim
Lintner got the Indians off to a
good start with an easy win in the
200 free, the meet's first event.
The Tribe tandem timed 1:28.2.
Foothill finished second in 1:30.1.
Sophs Sparkle
Sophomore Brent Berk,
another Olympic swimmer,
teamed with three sophs—Bert
Mason, Ray Collins and Jamie
Knoi —to bring home a \3Vi second
win in the 800 free. The varsity
quartet clocked 7 :14.6, while the
Indian frosh were a distant second
in 7:28.1.
Senior Hammett combined
with sophomores Janison, Eagles
ton and John Glaser to cover the
400 free in 3:15.6 for a six-second
victory over Foothill, while Sie
bert, Ferris and Knorr knifed
through the chill waters for a
winning time of 2:52.9 in the 300
medley.
Sophomores Ted Nichols and
N orris Heckel formed the tri
umphant diving duo for Stanford,
earning 424.65 points for an easy
first. Second-place Cal was far
back at 383.30.
Coach Gaughran was extremely
pleased with his team's perform
ance. "I thought they looked real
good, especially for this early in
the season," smiled Gaughran,
who has personally built Stanford

into a national power in swim
ming. "Our performance in the
sprints was quite amazing," he
continued. "The sophomores—like
Eagleston, Jamison and Knorr—
were just great. The 800 relay was
real pleasing to me. It was just a
fine time."
While Gaughran was undoubt
ably happy about the team's im
pressive effort, his enthusiasm had
to be somewhat dampened by the
loss of four of his most outstand
ing performers.
Sophomore Mitch Ivey, a silver
medalist in Mexico City, has trans
ferred to Long Beach State
College. Watching Ivey perform
Saturday for the Santa Clara
Swim Club, as he anchored the
winning 300 backstroke and 400
medley relays for the opposition,
Gaughran must have felt a deep
tinge of regret.
"We feel terrible about losing
Mitch," Gaughran readily ad
mitted Saturday. "It'll hurt the
team," he continued, "but Fred
Haywood's back and I'm sure he'll
do more than a good job in the
backstroke for us."
Gaughran also lost his top
diver, Bill Main, All-American
Dick Roth (200 backstroke, 200

and 400 IM), and All-American
Ken Hammer (50 free). Roth and
Hammer are sitting out of school
this term, while Main was a victim
of Fall quarter grades.
"I thought it (the loss of Ivey,
Main, Roth, and Hammer) would
demoralize the team, but it hasn't
affected them at all," the person
able Gaughran commented.
Frosh May Help
Perhaps softening the blow
somewhat was the recent Pacific-8
conference ruling to allow fresh
men to compete in regional and
NCAA swimming championships.
Frosh standouts Shilling, Shelley,
and Bob Bebb will be a great asset

to the Stanford varsity once the
dual meet season is completed.
Asked about the liklihood of
the Indians achieving the No. 3
national ranking which they've
been tabbed for on pre-season -
polls, Gaughran conceded it
would be difficult, but far from
impossible.
"We'll have a rough time get-"
ting it,"the Tribe chieftain said,
"But we should be real strong in "
our dual meets. And if we work —
real hard, we could challenge for
the NCAA Championship.
If Saturday's meet was any in
dication, Stanford may well be"
heard from on the national scene. '«,

Swim Club, as he anchored the
winning 300 backstroke and 400
medley relays for the opposition,
Gaughran must have felt a deep
tinge of regret.
"We feel terrible about losing
Mitch," Gaughran readily ad
mitted Saturday. "It'll hurt the
team," he continued, "but Fred
Haywood's back and I'm sure he'll
do more than a good job in the
backstroke for us."
Gaughran also lost his top
diver, Bill Main, All-American
Dick Roth (200 backstroke, 200

and 400 IM), and All-American
Ken Hammer (50 free). Roth and
Hammer are sitting out of school
this term, while Main was a victim
of Fall quarter grades.

Main, Roth, and Hammer) would
demoralize the team, but it hasn't

Frosh May Help
Perhaps softening the blow
somewhat was the recent Pacific-8
conference ruling to allow fresh
men to compete in regional and
NCAA swimming championships.
Frosh standouts Shilling, Shelley,
and Bob Bebb will be a great asset

to the Stanford varsity once the
dual meet season is completed.
Asked about the liklihood of
the Indians achieving the No. 3
national ranking which they've
been tabbed for on pre-season -
polls, Gaughran conceded it
would be difficult, but far from
impossible.
"We'll have a rough time get-"
ting it,"the Tribe chieftain said,
"But we should be real strong in "
our dual meets. And if we work —
real hard, we could challenge for
the NCAA Championship.

In a brilliant early season per
formance, Coach Jim Gaughran's
varsity swimmers waltzed to an
impressive victory in the six-team
Stanford Relays Saturday after
noon in the Tribe tank.
The final point spread was a
surprising 27 points, as the Indian
varsity chalked up 75 points to 48
for the runner-up Santa Clara
Swim Club. A poised Stanford
frosh team, led by Mark Shilling
and Dave Shelley, totalled 46
points for third place, while Uni
versity of California was fourth
with 43 and the fifth-place Foot
hill Aquatic Club checked in with
36 markers. The outclassed Arden
Hills Aquatic Club might as well
have stayed home, managing but
one fifth place for two points.
The Indians grabbed seven
firsts in the all-relay affair, setting
two meet records along the way.
In the 200 medley relay, Fred
Haywood, Tag Leonard, Luis
Nicolao and Bob Jamison erased
the former standard of 1:40.9 by
one half-second. Minutes later, the
Argentina-born Nicolao teamed
with captain Pete Siebert and
Olympic bronze medal-winner
John Ferris to shatter the existing
300 butterfly mark. Ferris, Sie
bert and Nicolao clocked 2:41.1,
breaking the old record by seven
tenths of a second.
Stanford's five other firsts
came in the 200, 400, and 800
freestyle relays, the 300 medley

relay and diving relay (two divers
representing each team).
Jeff Hammett, Rick Eagleston,
Morgan Manning, and Kim
Lintner got the Indians off to a
good start with an easy win in the
200 free, the meet's first event.
The Tribe tandem timed 1:28.2.
Foothill finished second in 1:30.1.
Sophs Sparkle
Sophomore Brent Berk,
another Olympic swimmer,
teamed with three sophs—Bert
Mason, Ray Collins and Jamie
Knoi —to bring home a \3Vi second
win in the 800 free. The varsity
quartet clocked 7 :14.6, while the
Indian frosh were a distant second
in 7:28.1.
Senior Hammett combined
with sophomores Janison, Eagles
ton and John Glaser to cover the
400 free in 3:15.6 for a six-second
victory over Foothill, while Sie
bert, Ferris and Knorr knifed
through the chill waters for a
winning time of 2:52.9 in the 300
medley.
Sophomores Ted Nichols and
N orris Heckel formed the tri
umphant diving duo for Stanford,
earning 424.65 points for an easy
first. Second-place Cal was far
back at 383.30.
Coach Gaughran was extremely
pleased with his team's perform
ance. "I thought they looked real
good, especially for this early in
the season," smiled Gaughran,
who has personally built Stanford

into a national power in swim
ming. "Our performance in the
sprints was quite amazing," he
continued. "The sophomores—like
Eagleston, Jamison and Knorr—
were just great. The 800 relay was
real pleasing to me. It was just a
fine time."
While Gaughran was undoubt
ably happy about the team's im
pressive effort, his enthusiasm had
to be somewhat dampened by the
loss of four of his most outstand

Sophomore Mitch Ivey, a silver
medalist in Mexico City, has trans

Sophomore Brent Berk,
another Olympic swimmer,
teamed with three sophs—Bert
Mason, Ray Collins and Jamie
Knoi —to bring home a \3Vi second
win in the 800 free. The varsity
quartet clocked 7 :14.6, while the
Indian frosh were a distant second
in 7:28.1.
Senior Hammett combined
with sophomores Janison, Eagles
ton and John Glaser to cover the
400 free in 3:15.6 for a six-second
victory over Foothill, while Sie
bert, Ferris and Knorr knifed
through the chill waters for a
winning time of 2:52.9 in the 300
medley.
Sophomores Ted Nichols and
N orris Heckel formed the tri
umphant diving duo for Stanford,
earning 424.65 points for an easy
first. Second-place Cal was far
back at 383.30.
Coach Gaughran was extremely
pleased with his team's perform
ance. "I thought they looked real
good, especially for this early in
the season," smiled Gaughran,
who has personally built Stanford

into a national power in swim
ming. "Our performance in the
sprints was quite amazing," he
continued. "The sophomores—like
Eagleston, Jamison and Knorr—
were just great. The 800 relay was
real pleasing to me. It was just a
fine time."
While Gaughran was undoubt
ably happy about the team's im
pressive effort, his enthusiasm had
to be somewhat dampened by the
loss of four of his most outstand
ing performers.
Sophomore Mitch Ivey, a silver
medalist in Mexico City, has trans
ferred to Long Beach State
College. Watching Ivey perform
Saturday for the Santa Clara
Swim Club, as he anchored the
winning 300 backstroke and 400
medley relays for the opposition,
Gaughran must have felt a deep
tinge of regret.
"We feel terrible about losing
Mitch," Gaughran readily ad
mitted Saturday. "It'll hurt the
team," he continued, "but Fred
Haywood's back and I'm sure he'll
do more than a good job in the
backstroke for us."
Gaughran also lost his top
diver, Bill Main, All-American
Dick Roth (200 backstroke, 200

and 400 IM), and All-American
Ken Hammer (50 free). Roth and
Hammer are sitting out of school
this term, while Main was a victim
of Fall quarter grades.
"I thought it (the loss of Ivey,
Main, Roth, and Hammer) would
demoralize the team, but it hasn't
affected them at all," the person
able Gaughran commented.
Frosh May Help
Perhaps softening the blow
somewhat was the recent Pacific-8
conference ruling to allow fresh
men to compete in regional and
NCAA swimming championships.
Frosh standouts Shilling, Shelley,
and Bob Bebb will be a great asset

to the Stanford varsity once the
dual meet season is completed.
Asked about the liklihood of
the Indians achieving the No. 3
national ranking which they've
been tabbed for on pre-season -
polls, Gaughran conceded it
would be difficult, but far from
impossible.
"We'll have a rough time get-"
ting it,"the Tribe chieftain said,
"But we should be real strong in "
our dual meets. And if we work —
real hard, we could challenge for
the NCAA Championship.
If Saturday's meet was any in
dication, Stanford may well be"
heard from on the national scene. '«,
In a brilliant early season per
formance, Coach Jim Gaughran's
varsity swimmers waltzed to an
impressive victory in the six-team
Stanford Relays Saturday after
noon in the Tribe tank.
The final point spread was a
surprising 27 points, as the Indian
varsity chalked up 75 points to 48
for the runner-up Santa Clara
Swim Club. A poised Stanford
frosh team, led by Mark Shilling
and Dave Shelley, totalled 46
points for third place, while Uni
versity of California was fourth
with 43 and the fifth-place Foot
hill Aquatic Club checked in with
36 markers. The outclassed Arden
Hills Aquatic Club might as well
have stayed home, managing but
one fifth place for two points.
The Indians grabbed seven
firsts in the all-relay affair, setting
two meet records along the way.
In the 200 medley relay, Fred
Haywood, Tag Leonard, Luis
Nicolao and Bob Jamison erased
the former standard of 1:40.9 by
one half-second. Minutes later, the
Argentina-born Nicolao teamed
with captain Pete Siebert and
Olympic bronze medal-winner
John Ferris to shatter the existing
300 butterfly mark. Ferris, Sie
bert and Nicolao clocked 2:41.1,
breaking the old record by seven
tenths of a second.
Stanford's five other firsts
came in the 200, 400, and 800
freestyle relays, the 300 medley

relay and diving relay (two divers
representing each team).
Jeff Hammett, Rick Eagleston,
Morgan Manning, and Kim
Lintner got the Indians off to a
good start with an easy win in the
200 free, the meet's first event.
The Tribe tandem timed 1:28.2.
Foothill finished second in 1:30.1.
