# Freshmen Win Twice
## 
### 
Stanford basketball prospects
for next year are looking better all
the time.
This year's Frosh team, led
by 6'5" Claude Terry, looks like it
will be a powerhouse. Over the
weekend, the young cagers de
feated the Stanford Braves, 86-81,
and then took the toll of the San
Jose State Frosh, 66-59.
Terry, who is listed as guard,
totaled 60 points in the two
games and set the Stanford Fresh
man single game scoring record
Friday night with 40 tallies.
He was an amazing 16 for 25
from the floor in that first con
test, and connected on 8 of 9 free
throws; Brad Lind tossed in 15 for

Coach Paul Neumann's squad; and
Bob Dews had 9.
In their first big encounter of
the season on Saturday evening,...
Terry continued to burn the nets
of the new Roscoe Maples Pavil- <<
ion by making 10 of 24 attempts..
He did not shoot any free throws. "
Lind added 18, and Greg
Snyder 8 for the Frosh who face a "
real test Friday night at Berkeley
against the California Freshman. '
Other starters on the team in-"'
elude Chuck Bauer and Bob Bond.
The Frosh meet Merced''
College on th > road Saturday
night before returning to The
barm to battle the USF Freshman
on January 24.
