# Blues-Folk Artist
## Richie Havens To Perform 
### 
Blues-folk singer and
guitarist Richie Havens will open
the Series '69 concert program
with two shows at 8 and 10 p.m.
Saturday night at Memorial Audi
torium.
The concert will be the first
of an ASSU-sponsored series that

tentatively includes Simon and
Garfunkel, Aretha Franklin, and
Judy Collins.
Havens, a contemporary of
Arlo Guthrie and Tim Hardin, got
his start on the Greenwich Village
coffee- house circuit.
Appearing with Havens will be

the Dillards, a folk-comedy group
that concert chairman Adam
Levin describes as "a four-man
Smothers Brothers."
Havens is a blues singer in the
classic tradition. He blends the
sweet and natural melancholy of
his ghetto childhood with the
primitive religiosity of the Negro
spiritual.
The financial success of the
Havens concert will to some ex
tent determine whether big names
such as Simon and Garfunkel will
be brought in this spring.
According to Levin, "we are
anxious to give students what
they want, but are having trouble
figuring out exactly what that is.
Last quarter, for instance, several
hundred tickets to Bill Cosby's
performance remained unsold."
Acoustical construction in the
new pavilion where future con
certs will be held at lower ticket
prices is not yet complete, so the
Havens concert will be in the
Memorial Auditorium. Tickets are
$2.25 and $3.25 at the Tresidder
Box Office.
