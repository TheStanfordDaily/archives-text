# Oil Expert To Lecture
## 
### 
A critic of increasing federal
control over supply and demand
in the petroleum and liquid fuels
industry will be the first speaker
in the 1969 Earth Sciences Lecture
Series.
Dr. Richard J. Gonzales,
widely known authority on pe
troleum economics and mineral
depletion and a former director of
Humble Oil and Refining Co. will
discuss "Federal Policies Domi
nating Energy Supplies" at 4
p.m. today in Room 320,
Geology Building.
Through research in energy
sources, regulation of petroleum
imports and gas prices, and by
leasing policies for energy re
sources on public lands, the
government exercises an indirect
but dramatic control in this field,
he contends.
Gonzales advocates more
opportunity for competitive
market forces among fuels, as in
the past.
