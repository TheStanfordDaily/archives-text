# Coalition Meets
## Faculty Counsels Patience 
### SUSAN SWARD 
Sunday afternoon the student
Coalition formed to gain more
student voice in the consideration
of the Study of Education re
ports, sponsored "discussions
within various living groups to
clarify the position of different
faculty members and the Coali
tion."
Attendance at most of the
discussion groups averaged about
thirty persons. At Storey House
where the fraternity and row resi
dents were to meet, approximate
ly five persons came to discuss the
Study of Education at Stanford
(SES) and the Coalition.
In Roble every room in the
dorm was leafletted about the up
coming discussion, and approxi
mately thirty persons attended.
There were two faculty mem
bers, Professor John Linvill of
electrical engineering and Associ
ate Professor Bradley Efron of
statistics, present at the Roble dis
cussion group Sunday.
Work In League
Linvill cautioned the group of
students not to "despair in defeat.
If you can find ways to purpose
something that doesn't pose an
impossible problem for the facul
ty, then you can work in league
with the faculty."
When questioned about a form
ula for possible student participa
tion in the decision making con
cerning the SES proposals, Linvill
responded, "When you get good
ideas that are supported well, that
is the way a significant change will
be brought about."
Linvill went on to admit, "If
you ask to share participation
with the faculty in the considera
tion of the SES proposals, you
pose for the faculty a very diffic
ult questions."
Efron spoke of the faculty's
fears about students' ability to
determine their own course curric
ulum
Faculty Fears
"The faculty fears that the stu
dents have bad taste and will opt
for all the fadish things like

courses in black power, " Efron
noted. "There has also been no
evidence of students' continuing
concern. Your position would
have been stronger if you'd had an
undergraduate committee formed
on SES a year ago."
Efron listed three ways in
which he felt students could in
crease their power base within the
University.
"Have money," he said. "Have
an on-going , permanent organiza
tion that will give students the
power to go out on their own. And
finally, know your faculty fears.
"It doesn't pay to come on
talking about a student voice
in tenure decision when you don't
have a real basis from which to
move," Efron cautioned.
Power Bases
Indscussing the different
power bases on the campus, Yale
Braunstein, speaker of the student
legislature, commented to the
group in the Roble lounge, "The
Academic Senate has the power to
make decisions and to make
everybody listen to them. The stu
dents have to find a way to effect
curriculum decisions in a positive
way."
While the various discussion
groups yesterday attempted to
put the SES proposals and the
Coalition into some kind of per
spective, a meeting tonight in
Branner Hall at 7:30 will discuss
five proposals relating to the con
sideration of the SES propos
als.
The Daily has learned that
they include: a coalition proposal,
an Academic Senate proposal, a
third and fourth proposal, and a
fifth proposal to vote on the other
four proposals in a campus-wide
referendum.
The original Coalition proposal
called for the formation of an in
dependent body consisting of the
Academic Senate and an equal
number of students appointed by
ASSU and approved by LASSU to
consider SES proposals.

Floor Management
The Academic Senate proposal
called for students to serve on
floor management committees to
argue before the senate each
group of SES recommendations.
Such students would have no
votes.
A third proposal is to have an
independent body consisting of
the Academic Senate and a smal
ler number of students represent
ing a variety of opinions. Every
one would have an equa vote and
floor privileges.
A fourth proposal calls for a
parallel student body to the
Academic Senate to be established
by the ASSU just to review the
SES proposals. If there were dis
agreement between the senate and
the student group on a recom
mendation, a joint committee
would be convened to resolve the
conflict. This committee's solu
tion would be final, and faculty
would have a five-ninths majority
on the committee.
Mike Herrero, a student chair
man of the Roble discussion
group, observed.
"I think there were more
people in Roble interested in SES
than the few that showed up at
the meeting."
Herrero was referring to the
resolution the Coalition submitted
to the Academic Senate last week
requesting that a committee
should be established to deliberate
on the SES proposals. This com
mittee was to consist of the Aca
demic Senate and an equal num
ber of students, all with equal
voting powers.
