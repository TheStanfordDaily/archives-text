cluded a substantial reduction in
total required course units for en
gineering undergraduates, greater
flexibility, and more inter-discip
linary programs. The Council also
will consider recommendations
from the Study of Education at
Stanford which affect the school's
undergraduates.
The Council will have broad
responsibilities in the entire field
of undergraduate engineering edu
cation at Stanford. Its decisions
may be appealed to the entire en
gineering I'acuty, which previous
ly had primary responsibility for
approving changes in undergradu
ate requirements and curricula, so
far as theses are set by the school
and its departments.
