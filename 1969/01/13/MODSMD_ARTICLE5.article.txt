## SFS Strikes Continue

• SF State
SAN FRANCISCO (AP)-San
Francisco State College faces a re
sumption Monday of strikes by
minority students and the Ameri
can Federation of Teachers amid
uncertainty over firing of instruc
tors who have missed five consec
utive class days.
Teachers who struck Jan. 6
have been warned by Gov. Ronald
Regan and the college's acting
president, Dr. S. I. Hayakawa,
that anyone absent five days in a
row is considered to have resigned
automatically, under state law.
Administration officials, how
ever, have said that proof will be
difficult in many cases.
Raoul Teilhet, statewide presi
dent of the AFT, has called for a
one-day walkout throughout the
state in sympathy with the San
Francisco State Teachers. He
claimed the move had support of
50 percent of the union's 12,000
members.
Gary Hawkins, president of the
San Francisco State local, claimed
about 500 of the college's 1,300
faculty members were involved in
the strike, but the administration
has said only 229 are AFT mem
bers.
The union has been picketing
in defiance of a Superior Court
order which is due for a hearing
Tuesday.
In Sacramento, Reagan told
reporters on returning from a
weekend in Los Agneles that the
teachers association, the State
Employees Association and the
Association of University Profes
sors "all have repudiated the AFT
and this strike. I think they con
stitute the vast majority."
Does that mean he believes the
strike will fail, Regan was asked.
"I hope so," he replied quite
tly. Reagan said the AFT had
compromised principle for expedi
ency by abandoning the students'

causes in the face of pressure from
the San Francisco Labor Council.
Reagan said that as a trustee he
would appose resumption of the
talks that had been under way
when the AFT strike began at San
Francisco.
Aside from the teachers' strike,
Hayakawa expressed guarded op
timism over possibilities of setting
the strike called by the Black Stu
dents Union last Nov. 6.
Hayakawa has ordered crea
tion, in time for the February
term, of a Black Studies Depart
ment, principal demand of the
strikers. He has refused to promise
a blanket amnesty for the violence
and sabotage that has shaken the
college for more than two
months.
"If the militants persist in pro
longing the strike," Hayakawa
said, "they are hurting themselves
and the thousands of others who
want the black studies program.
The basic issue has been
settled."
• San Fernando State
NORTHRIDGE (AP)-San Fer
nando Valley State College agreed
Sunday to estabish two ethnic
studies departments and make a
special effort to hire more minor
ity teachers.
The moves, at a meeting with
mlitant Negro and Mexican-
American students, were aimed at
halting the school's racial troub
les.
But spokesman for the Black
Student Union and the United
Mexican-American students said
they plan to boycott classes Mon
day because not all their demands
were met.
Chief unsatisfied demand is
that all students arrested Nov.
4—when Negro students seized a
building to dramtize their de
mands—be granted amnesty, along

with all students arrested since.
Agreement on the two ethnic
studies departments was worked
out by a newly formed advisory
committee which had endorsed
the amnesty demand.
Dr. Delmar T. Oviatt, acting
president of the College, said he
would be guided by the college's
Academic Senate which has sched
uled an emergency meeting Satur
day.
Archie Chatman, BSU chair
man, said his supporters would
continue the boycott until all de
mands are met. Both the minority
groups leaders called on students
to meet on the college's Open
Forum for a teach-in on their de
mands.
Oviatt said students registering
for the spring semester in Febru
ary will be able to declare a major
in either black studies or Mexican-
American studies. A bachelor's de
gree will be awarded after four
years study in that field.
"We have come a long way,"
Oviatt said. "We want this pro
gram for the nation. We may label
it black or Mexican-American
studies but we want to enroll as
may white people as possible."
•Paris Talks
PARIS (AP>—North Vietnam
said Sunday that two new U.S.
proposals aimed at breaking the
deadlock delaying the Paris peace
talks were "unacceptable."
The proposals were presented
earlier in a meeting called by U. S.
Ambassador Cyrus R. Vance, dep
uty chief of the U. S. delegation.
U. S. spokesmen said the propo
sals involved concessions on
speaking order and the sort of
table that might be used at ex
panded talks that woud include
the Sout Vietnamese and the
Communist National Liberation
Front.
The object was to get around
objections of six previous U. S.
proposals, all of which were re
jected by the North Vietnamese.
Soon after the meeting, the
North Vietnamese issued a state
ment denouncing the "obstinacy"
of the United States "which still
refuses to accept the reasonable
and logical propositions" ad
vanced by North Vietnam at a
Jan. 2 meeting, when the shape of
a conference table was discussed.
The two delegations met for
two hours to discuss the Vance
proposals. When it was over, Ha
Van Lau said the proposals were
"not acceptable" but agreed with
tfe Americans that each side
would present the proposals to its
ally: the Hanoi delegation to the

Viet Cong's Liberation Front and
the Americans to the Saigon ad
ministration.
• Princeton To Go Coed
PRINCETON (AP)-Princeton
University trustees announced
Sunday they had "approved in
principle" adding womenstudents
at the 222-year-old Ivy League
school. But they set no specific
starting date and said no action
would be taken on detailed steps
toward coeducation before April.
President Robert Goheen said
it was unlikely any "token coedu
cation" would begin this fall.
Students had expected Sun
day's announcement to contain
specific steps toward letting wo
men undergraduates join the
3,200 male Princetonians.
Plans are for one-fourth of the
enrollment eventually to be fe
male. That would be done by ex
panding the school's total enroll
ment to about 4,200.
The only women admitted to
Princeton now are 115 graduate
students.
• Super Bowl
MIAMI (AP)— Flamboyant Joe Na
math, the shaggey-haireds4oo,ooo
baby, led his New York Jets to a
jolting 16-7 upset of the National
Football League champion Balti
more Colts Sunday in the third
Super Bowl game just as he said
he would.
Gritty Matt Snell slashed,
pounded and bulled his way
through the Colts' vaunted de
fense, setting up the Jets ground
game that enabled Namath's pass
ing game to go.
It was the first victory for the
9-year-old American Football
League in this pro football cham
pionship and a real shocker—the
Colts were favored by a whopping
18 points.
