# Talk To Faculty
## Pitzer Asks For Research 
### 
Universities should help har
ness tehnology to serve human
needs and desires, President Ken
neth Pitzer told the faculty Fri
day.
A member of the President's
Science Advisory Committee,
Pitzer said:

"In our system of government
it is the responsibility of the Con
gress to establish policies which
will yield the results our people
desire. But in many cases a new
technology has already developed
to the point that strong, self-serv
ing pressure groups are created be-

fore most citizens or most Con
gressmen understand what has
happened, and then it is very dif
ficult to change the course of ev
ents.
A nationally prominent chem
ist who continued his research
while president of Rice Univer
sity, Pitzer said "I believe there
are true scholar-teachers who can
be both the very best teachers for
unusually able students and at the
same time the leaders of research
in their disciplines.
"Stanford has attracted to its
faculty a great many of these
scholar-teachers and...will con
tinue to so so. We need to give
greater emphasis to teaching at
the freshman level and more re
cognition to excellence in teach
ing at any undergraduate level.
"But these are matters of de
gree. I still believe in the com
bined role (of teaching and re
search) for the typical professor,
and I do not favor separate gradu
ate and undergraduate faculties."
Emphasizing the need for open
communications among all groups
on campus Pitzer said: "Students
need to talk informally about the
tensions and controversies that
trouble them, and it is important
that we really listen and under
stand them. But you are teachers
outside as well as inside the class
room, and you have an equal re
sponsibility to explain your views
on these problems!'
Pitzer said he will seek Trustee
approval of a new 16-man Univer
sity Advisory Committee com
posed of five students, five faculty
and five Trustees, with the Univer
sity president as chairman. This
group would include the elected
head of each group ex-officio.

with four additional members
chosen through the regular ap
pointment procedures of each
group. It would meet at regular in
tervals between Trustee meetings
to provide an opportunity for dis
cussion in depth on subjects of
mutual concern.
"The greatest benefit from this
committee will be improved un
derstands g by Trustees of
campus problems and of faculty
and student viewpoints, and vice
versa, improved understanding on
the campus of the problems which
the Trustees face in developing
support for the University in the
outside community."
The new committee would not
supersede present decision making
bodies on campus. Through the
president, it would be authorized
to make recommendations to the
Board of Trustees, the faculty,
student government or other ap
propriate groups.
Pitzer also announced forma
tion of a new Council of Deans to
provide a better opportunity for
various schools to participate in
the formulation of general univer
sity policies. He indicated faculty
and students would be involved in
search committees for a new di
rector of libraries, director of ad
missions, and other key positions
which will become open soon.
He indicated he had worked
with the chairmen of the faculty
Senate, Advisory Board, and Com
mittee on Committees, together
with former Acting President
Robert Glaser, and the president
and vice president of the student
body in reappraising Stanford's
executive organization and per
sonnel.

unusually able students and at the
same time the leaders of research
in their disciplines.
"Stanford has attracted to its
faculty a great many of these
scholar-teachers and...will con
tinue to so so. We need to give
greater emphasis to teaching at
the freshman level and more re
cognition to excellence in teach
ing at any undergraduate level.
"But these are matters of de
gree. I still believe in the com
bined role (of teaching and re
search) for the typical professor,
and I do not favor separate gradu
ate and undergraduate faculties."
Emphasizing the need for open
communications among all groups
on campus Pitzer said: "Students
need to talk informally about the
tensions and controversies that
trouble them, and it is important
that we really listen and under
stand them. But you are teachers
outside as well as inside the class
room, and you have an equal re
sponsibility to explain your views
on these problems!'
Pitzer said he will seek Trustee
approval of a new 16-man Univer
sity Advisory Committee com
posed of five students, five faculty
and five Trustees, with the Univer
sity president as chairman. This
group would include the elected
head of each group ex-officio.

with four additional members
chosen through the regular ap
pointment procedures of each
group. It would meet at regular in
tervals between Trustee meetings
to provide an opportunity for dis
cussion in depth on subjects of
mutual concern.
"The greatest benefit from this
committee will be improved un
derstands g by Trustees of
campus problems and of faculty
and student viewpoints, and vice
versa, improved understanding on
the campus of the problems which
the Trustees face in developing
support for the University in the
outside community."
The new committee would not
supersede present decision making
bodies on campus. Through the
president, it would be authorized
to make recommendations to the
Board of Trustees, the faculty,
student government or other ap
propriate groups.
Pitzer also announced forma
tion of a new Council of Deans to
provide a better opportunity for
various schools to participate in
the formulation of general univer
sity policies. He indicated faculty
and students would be involved in
search committees for a new di
rector of libraries, director of ad
missions, and other key positions
which will become open soon.
He indicated he had worked
with the chairmen of the faculty
Senate, Advisory Board, and Com
mittee on Committees, together
with former Acting President
Robert Glaser, and the president
and vice president of the student
body in reappraising Stanford's
executive organization and per
sonnel.
Universities should help har
ness tehnology to serve human
needs and desires, President Ken
neth Pitzer told the faculty Fri
day.
A member of the President's
Science Advisory Committee,
Pitzer said:

"In our system of government
it is the responsibility of the Con
gress to establish policies which
will yield the results our people
desire. But in many cases a new
technology has already developed
to the point that strong, self-serv
ing pressure groups are created be-

fore most citizens or most Con
gressmen understand what has
happened, and then it is very dif
ficult to change the course of ev
ents.
A nationally prominent chem
ist who continued his research
while president of Rice Univer
sity, Pitzer said "I believe there
are true scholar-teachers who can
be both the very best teachers for
unusually able students and at the
