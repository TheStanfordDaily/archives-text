# FIRE

### 
A fire of unknown origin
brought all "four Stanford fire
trucks to Roble Hall at 7:30 Sat
urday morning. But the fire dam
aged only a bed spread, electric
blanket, the mattress in which the
fire began, and a shoe.
Valerie Fisher, one of the two
occupants of the second floor
room, awoke about 7 a.m., dream
ing about burning rubber tires.
Unaware of the smoldering matt
ress upon which she had slept, she
went downstairs for a drink of
water. Upon returning to her
room, she found it filled with
smoke and roommate Jane Harri
son in the hall trying various
methods to breathe

Jane then ran downstairs to the
apartment of Roble directors
John and Nancy Palmer, who
called the fire department. An
alarm was also turned in at the
main desk by Janice Westfall.
The girls lauded Scott Silver
man as a hero when he entered
the smoke-clogged room to close
the window and determine the
cause of the fire.

And upstairs, someone played
"Light My Fire." unaware of the
activity below.
Many Roble res : icnts thought
the fire alarm was simply an alarm
clock in a near-by room, but after
I it continued, they recognized it as
a genuine fire alarm. (Four false
alarms were turned in Monday
from a first-floor Roble corridor.)
