## Honeybunch At The The Library 
### CISSIE BONINI 
(Being part of a continuing series
of trenchant social commentary
centering around Honeybunch
Dornhoffer, a freshman woman at
a university of high degree, whose
resemblance to anyone living or
dead is, Mrs. Bonini assures us, is
completely unintended and fan
tastically coincidental.—Ed.)
Honeybunch had only been at
Tanmore University a few days
when she realized that the real
enemy of the students was not the
administration, but the Library.
She knew that there never
could be amnesty between the
Library and the student because
they operated on diametrically
opposed courses. While the stu
dent wanted to use the materials
and books in the Library; the
Library, of course, viewed its
raison d'etre as "collecting."
Ideally, "collections" of books
would be kept locked in glass
cases and viewed by the student
population respectfully from be
hind velet ropes.
Consequently, the Library
found itself constantly fighting a
rear-guard action with people who
were trying to borrow the books.

Over a period of years, the Lib
rary had built up elaborate, if
paranoid, defenses against bor
rowers.
The two-hour book for ex
ample. Honeybunch had been as
signed "The Decline and Fall of
the Roman Empire" in a directed
reading course of which she and a
blind deaf-mute (who read only
Braille) were the sole members.
Naturally, the book was on a two
hour r (serve. Honejsunch
checked the volume out and an at
tendant with long canine teeth
and bullseye pupils stamped
"Due at 3:47" on the pocket.
At 3:48, Honeybunch was
reading in her fourth-foor carrel.
Suddenly, she felt an iron grip
round her ankles as someone
(crawling under the desks) seized

her. At the same moment an arm
encircled her from behind and a
sweet-smelling cloth was pressed
against her mouth and nostrils.
About an hour later, when
Honeybunch came to and was
able—with the aid of a sympath
etic senior—to loosen the ropes on
her ankles and wrists, she inquired
at the main desk to renew the
book but discovered that it had
been sent out for "rebinding."
(Library policy dictates that any
book which is frequently reques
ted must be retired for six months
at the bindery.)
Frisking
Honeybunch also objected to
being frisked when entering and
leaving Ugly. She didn't mind
turning her pockets inside out,
but maidenly modesty was of

fended by stripping to one's un
dergarments in the main check
-out. Also, during the winter quar
ter, the lobby was chilly. But
Honeybunch dare not object. She
had been the horrified witness
when a sophomore, who had in
advertently neglected to check
out a book, tried to pass the
check-out stall with it. Sirens and
red flares seemed to fill the build
ing. Police and fire engines shriek
ed to a halt by the main doors,
and the unfortunate victim, shiv
ering in his jockey shorts was flog
ged personally by the chief librar
ian into the paddy wagon.
Once there, his student body
card was ripped up before his eyes
and he was never mentioned at
Tanmore again. (His parents did
make two or three desultory at

tempts to locate him at Christmas
and during the Spring break. But
they gave up after receiving the
Library's standard form begin
ning, "We regret to inform you
that your son has been reported
missing in the stacks. . . .")
Library policy on over-due
books was more liberal. The gen
eral formula was: number of days
over-due times quarterly tuition.
Book fines were rarely put into
effect, however, because most stu
dents—realizing they had an over
-due book—took the easy way out
and transferred to Foothill.
(There, the books belonged to the
taxpayers and their library en
couraged coloring and tearing.)

Honeybunch had only been at
Tanmore University a few days
when she realized that the real
enemy of the students was not the
administration, but the Library.
She knew that there never
could be amnesty between the
Library and the student because
they operated on diametrically
opposed courses. While the stu
dent wanted to use the materials
and books in the Library; the
Library, of course, viewed its
raison d'etre as "collecting."
Ideally, "collections" of books
would be kept locked in glass
cases and viewed by the student
population respectfully from be
hind velet ropes.
Consequently, the Library
found itself constantly fighting a
rear-guard action with people who
were trying to borrow the books.

Over a period of years, the Lib
rary had built up elaborate, if
paranoid, defenses against bor
rowers.
The two-hour book for ex
ample. Honeybunch had been as
signed "The Decline and Fall of
the Roman Empire" in a directed
reading course of which she and a
blind deaf-mute (who read only
Braille) were the sole members.
Naturally, the book was on a two
hour r (serve. Honejsunch
checked the volume out and an at
tendant with long canine teeth
and bullseye pupils stamped
"Due at 3:47" on the pocket.
At 3:48, Honeybunch was
reading in her fourth-foor carrel.
Suddenly, she felt an iron grip
round her ankles as someone
(crawling under the desks) seized

her. At the same moment an arm
encircled her from behind and a
sweet-smelling cloth was pressed
against her mouth and nostrils.
About an hour later, when
Honeybunch came to and was
able—with the aid of a sympath
etic senior—to loosen the ropes on
her ankles and wrists, she inquired
at the main desk to renew the
book but discovered that it had
been sent out for "rebinding."
(Library policy dictates that any
book which is frequently reques
ted must be retired for six months
at the bindery.)
Frisking
Honeybunch also objected to
being frisked when entering and
leaving Ugly. She didn't mind
turning her pockets inside out,
but maidenly modesty was of

fended by stripping to one's un
dergarments in the main check
-out. Also, during the winter quar
ter, the lobby was chilly. But
Honeybunch dare not object. She
had been the horrified witness
when a sophomore, who had in
advertently neglected to check
out a book, tried to pass the
check-out stall with it. Sirens and
red flares seemed to fill the build
ing. Police and fire engines shriek
ed to a halt by the main doors,
and the unfortunate victim, shiv
ering in his jockey shorts was flog
ged personally by the chief librar
ian into the paddy wagon.
Once there, his student body
card was ripped up before his eyes
