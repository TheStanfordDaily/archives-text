• Senate Action
Editor, THE DAILY:
Friday's story on the Academic
Senate debate of procedures for
considering SES has a small error
that misstates the positions of six
faculty members. These six voted
to bring the student-initiated plan
to the floor for consideration.
Their vote was not a vote in favor
of the plan but was a vote in favor
of considering it. They did this as

a courtesy to the students present;
it is unfortunate that their actions
were incorrectly reported.

•PolySci Corrects Us
Editor, THE DAILY:
As an ex-member of the
communication and journalism
faculty at Stanford I am very

much aware of some of the costs
and difficulties of more than pas
sing importance, and I would like
to correct one which appeared in
Friday's story about the attitudes
of professors in the Department
of Political Science.
In that story it was said that
"Richard Fagen felt students had
but one legitimate grievance, say
ing that there was a 'lack of
course offerings due to professors
on leave overseas and on sabbat
icals'."
Although I did not tape-record
my late-in-the-afternoon conver
sation with the Daily reporter, I
said something like the folowing:
"From the Department's point of
view, the most immediate and
legitimate grievance is that our of
fereings in the Fall Quarter were
very thin, both at the graduate
and the undergraduate level owing
to leaves, overseas assignments,
and sabbaticals. . . In addition,
the entire undergraduate program
of the Department needs evalua
tion, and we are now giving it our
most serious departmental atten
tion." •
What I emphasized again and
again to the reporter was that dif
ferent department members per
ceived the legitimate grievances of
the undergraduates in quite dif
ferent ways and I would not pre
sume to speak for the department
as a whole on that matter. I
wanted to emphasize that ,at the
minimum we could all agree that
Fall quarter had been thin in the
extreme. I can assure you that my
personal critique of "what's
wrong with undergraduate educa
tion in Political Science at Stan
ford" would be much more com
plex than some simple-minded
statement about "but one legit
imate grievance."

Executive Head Department of
Political Science.

•SFS Problems
Editor, THE DAILY:
This is in response to A.
Mosses opinion piece in the Thurs
day
When one fights for his educa
tion, it must be difficult to know
exactly who or what one fights. It
appears that at S. F. State the
fight is primarily for large changes
in the curriculum for the blacks.
If this is the fight, then I'm not
particularly opposed. It seems,
however, that the goal of the
conflict has been lost in the con
flict itself.
And what if the fight is in
creased for the esoteric demands?
There is not some building on the
campus which contains money to
be allocated toward different pro
grams, the college is supported by
the public through taxes. What if
the people who pay taxes decide
that an education which does not
prepare the students for a position
in the economy is simple not
worth it? There goes the school.
There go the demands.
If the goal is really not changes
in the educational structure, but
rather an attempt at revolution,
then you can count me out.

•Solidarity On Campuses
Editor, THE DAILY:
The San Francisco State and
other California campus struggles
of students and faculty is "sym
bolic" in the sense that it is being
waged for the sake of social just
ice and intellectual relevance in
American higher education.
Would it not be appropriate, as
a political act and as an expression
of solidarity, for those of us in the
Stanford community who share
these goals to organize a march or
demonstration in support of our
San Francisco colleagues? And
would it not be desirable to stim
ulate similar expressions of soli
darity that might be joined into a
single "event" on other campuses
in the Bay Area, and, perhaps
even throughout the state? Is it
not a single kind of new con
sciousness that is moving the more
compassionate forces in academic
communities to rise up in anger to
protest against what is unjust, bar
ren, and irrelevent in their
educational experiences?
