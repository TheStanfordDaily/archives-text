### 
By MARSHALL KILDUFF
Santa Clara county sheriff's
deputies arrested John Lanthier,
20, a junior, as he tried to pick up
a briefcase full of marijuana from
his desk locker in Meyer Library
early yesterday afternoon.
The arrest brought up the
issue of outside police making ar
rests on campus. LASSU Speaker
Yale Braunstein criticized Lan
thier's arrest as an example of
"the University's two-faced atti
tude toward police."
The drug was discovered early
yesterday morning when Building
Superintendent Joseph Riley no
ticed a "pungent, disagreeable
odor" coming from a desk locker
in the second floor carrel room.
He removed the briefcase from
the locker, and reported it to As
sistant Director of Libraries Rob
ert Goiter.
Goiter notified Associate Dean
of Students Willard Wyman and
Daniel De Young, assistant to the
business manager charged with
handling University-police rela
tions. De Young then contacted
campus police, who along with of
ficers, from a Santa Clara County
unit, identified the substance as
marijuana.
Waiting Nearby
Two Santa Clara officers re
turned the briefcase to the desk
locker in the library and waited
nearby, hoping to arrest the own
er when he came to pick it up.
After waiting for an hour, the of
ficers decided to leave. Just as
they were leaving with the brief
case, they saw Lanthier enter the
carrel room and go to the locker.
He unlocked it and, finding
nothing, he started toward the
loan desk. Lanthier then noticed
the two officers. "He was quite
startled when he noticed the of
ficers and started to walk away
very quickly," said Stanford Pol
ice Chief Thomas Bell.
Lanthier said that one of the
officers told him "I have a gun. If
you try to run I'll shoot." They
led him down to the first floor
where they handcuffed him and
informed him that he was under
arrest on felony charges for pos
session of marijuana.

Lanthier was later charged with
possession of dangerous drugs
also. He was released early last
night on his own recognizance and
is due to appear in court on Jan.

4 Two-Face' Charge
Student Legislature Speaker
Braunstein declared that "this is a
hell of a thing to put in the hands
of the business office." In explain
ing his charge that the administra
tion is "two-faced" in its attitudes
toward the police, he said, "They
set laws on demonstrations and
protests, and they post signs that
this is private property, but when
they have trouble they call in the
police."
Chief Bell said that whenever a
felony is committed on campus,
Santa Clara police are automat
ically called in to investigate. If an
arrest seems imminent, then the
administration is notified. "In this
case when the Santa Clara officers
went back to the library to find
the guy, I tried to phone Mr. De
Young to tell him what was hap
pening. But I couldn't get in
touch with him until after lunch
and after the arrest was made."
De Young said that he didn't
know that the Santa Clara officers
had been brought on campus, and
as a matter of policy he usually is
consulted before the request for
assistance is made.
Associate Dean Wyman said
that "in an obvious crime" the po
lice department is allowed discre
tion. He added, "in fact we are
not a sanctuary, but in practice
we are somewhat."
Directed to Keough
Wyman said that his office had
directed Lanthier to William
Keough, former assistant dean of
the law school, for legal advice.
Keough is the same lawyer who
successfully defended two Break
ers eating club members, David
Menasian and Eric Miller, arrested
last May 15 on marijuana charges.
Lanthier said that he does not
have enough money to pay
Keough's fee at present.
Wyman pointed out that the
search of Lanthier's library locker
did not violate any laws. All car
rels and lockers are subject to in
spection.

Directed to Keough
Wyman said that his office had
directed Lanthier to William
Keough, former assistant dean of
the law school, for legal advice.
Keough is the same lawyer who
successfully defended two Break
ers eating club members, David
Menasian and Eric Miller, arrested
last May 15 on marijuana charges.
Lanthier said that he does not
have enough money to pay
Keough's fee at present.
Wyman pointed out that the
search of Lanthier's library locker
did not violate any laws. All car
rels and lockers are subject to in
spection.
By MARSHALL KILDUFF
Santa Clara county sheriff's
deputies arrested John Lanthier,
20, a junior, as he tried to pick up
a briefcase full of marijuana from
his desk locker in Meyer Library
early yesterday afternoon.
The arrest brought up the
issue of outside police making ar
rests on campus. LASSU Speaker
Yale Braunstein criticized Lan
thier's arrest as an example of
"the University's two-faced atti
tude toward police."
The drug was discovered early
yesterday morning when Building
Superintendent Joseph Riley no
ticed a "pungent, disagreeable
odor" coming from a desk locker
in the second floor carrel room.
He removed the briefcase from
the locker, and reported it to As
sistant Director of Libraries Rob
ert Goiter.
Goiter notified Associate Dean
of Students Willard Wyman and
Daniel De Young, assistant to the
business manager charged with
handling University-police rela
tions. De Young then contacted
campus police, who along with of
ficers, from a Santa Clara County
unit, identified the substance as
marijuana.
Waiting Nearby
Two Santa Clara officers re
turned the briefcase to the desk
locker in the library and waited
nearby, hoping to arrest the own
er when he came to pick it up.
After waiting for an hour, the of
ficers decided to leave. Just as
they were leaving with the brief
case, they saw Lanthier enter the
carrel room and go to the locker.
He unlocked it and, finding
nothing, he started toward the
loan desk. Lanthier then noticed
the two officers. "He was quite
startled when he noticed the of
ficers and started to walk away
very quickly," said Stanford Pol
ice Chief Thomas Bell.
Lanthier said that one of the
officers told him "I have a gun. If
you try to run I'll shoot." They
led him down to the first floor
where they handcuffed him and
informed him that he was under
arrest on felony charges for pos
session of marijuana.

Lanthier was later charged with
possession of dangerous drugs
also. He was released early last
night on his own recognizance and
is due to appear in court on Jan.

4 Two-Face' Charge
Student Legislature Speaker
Braunstein declared that "this is a
hell of a thing to put in the hands
of the business office." In explain
ing his charge that the administra
tion is "two-faced" in its attitudes
toward the police, he said, "They
set laws on demonstrations and
protests, and they post signs that
this is private property, but when
they have trouble they call in the
police."
Chief Bell said that whenever a
felony is committed on campus,
Santa Clara police are automat
ically called in to investigate. If an
arrest seems imminent, then the
administration is notified. "In this
case when the Santa Clara officers
went back to the library to find
the guy, I tried to phone Mr. De
Young to tell him what was hap
pening. But I couldn't get in
touch with him until after lunch
and after the arrest was made."
De Young said that he didn't
know that the Santa Clara officers
had been brought on campus, and
as a matter of policy he usually is
consulted before the request for
assistance is made.
Associate Dean Wyman said
that "in an obvious crime" the po
lice department is allowed discre
tion. He added, "in fact we are

we are somewhat."
