## Daily Missed Fact 
### 
Editor, THE DAILY:
When articles are based on
hearsay and not fact, they should
not be printed in a paper, espec

ially when the hearsay is blatantly
wrong. In today's article by Susan
Sward concerning the SES discus
sions it states that at Storey house
only five people were present.
I was a moderator at that dis
cussion and I would estimate that
the attendance was 30 people. If
Susan had been present maybe
she could have counted more ac
curately. In this instance by em
phasizing the low attendance at
the meeting for fraternity and row
house residents she has disparaged
these living groups and reinforced
the sentiment that The Daily is
biased against fraternities.
Knowing that this article has
alienated a considerable part of
the Stanford community from
believing The Daily, I hope that a
correction or apology will be
printed immediately. If not, The
Daily's reputation as a journalistic
joke will be strengthened, and
rightfully.

(Miss Sward obtained the incor
rect information about the atten
dance at Storey House's discussion
from a friend of hers in the house,
where Miss Sward herself used to
live. She meant no reproach by re
porting what she thought was the
attendance figure. But we admit
she could have checked out the at
tendance herself. We apologize to
those who were upset over this
misrepresentation. — Ed.)
