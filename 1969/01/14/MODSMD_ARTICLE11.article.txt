# Stanford Is Not Rice
## 
### 
At least one tiling must be clear to Kenneth Pitzer after a
month and a half in office as president: Stanford is not Rice.
From the beginning, it was clear that there would be no
period of grace while Pitzer eased into his new position. In
the first week alone, he fended off harrassment from the
Left, questions from The Stanford Daily, and the highly
critical eye of the mass media.
Since that first week, Pitzer has turned to more mundane
tasks such as moving into the presidential mansion, con
ferring with student and faculty groups, gently feeling out
his administrative staff, and calmly meeting a problem of
racial bias in athletics, his first potential crisis. Pitzer is
glancing cautiously at all sides.
Into this void of cautiousness have crept a Hurry of ru
mors. Some frankly worry us, such as the reported shakeups
in personnel in the provost's office, the dean of students
office, and the chapel. Some anger us, such as Pitzer's ad
vocacy of faculty governance power, at the exclusion of the
essential student perspective.
And some rumors continue to intrigue us, such as the
interest that still revolves around Pitzer the manâ€”chemist's
chemist, scholar, liberal president, and personal friend of the
business world that chose him Stanford president. He comes
off as ruggedly handsome and slightly dashing, but with few
public speaking graces. In the company of students, he
seems ill at ease, out of place, and even slightly scared.
However, these are not qualities that will make or break
Pitzer's success as Stanford president; he can certainly ac
quire the skills that a college like Rice never demanded.
Rather, more germane concerns such as Dr. Pitzer's qualifi
cations, values, abilities, attitudes, and circumstances of his
appointment remain as unsettled questions that must some
day soon be answered.
At the same time, we welcome at least one reported
direction of Pitzer's thoughts on the university. Breaking
from the traditional presidential mold, Pitzer has declared
both publicly and in small group conversations that he con
siders campus control by campus constituencies essential;
he, like us, seems to welcome a withering of the once-per
vasive power of business men-trustees over campus life.
While we might propose a different solution to the trustee
problem than Pitzer's, his recognition of the inevitable end
to trustee domination over a university such as Stanford is
commendable.
To replace Trustee-administration regulation of the uni
versity, Pitzer unfortunately reverts to an unacceptable
formula of faculty power. A community form of govern
ment with inclusion of students is the only direction that
this University can take; to leave questions like ROTC, the
Stanford Research Institute, and particularly the Study of
Education to only a limited sector of the community is
utterly incomprehensible and unacceptable to large portions
of the student body, faculty, and indeed the administration.
Kenneth Pitzer cannot afford to approach Stanford in the
same manner that he handled Rice several years ago; the
pressing problems of his staff, his relationship to campus
constituencies, and mainly a solution to the question of uni
versity governance, cannot wait.
Indeed, the directions taken and the decisions made over
the next few months will be the ones that show his worth.
We anxiously follow Kenneth Pitzer's development in Stan
ford's atmosphere.
