•SEA Writes Pitzer
Dr. Pitzer:
The membership of Stanford
Employees' Association (SEA)
consists largely of workers who
are often classified as lower mid
dle class. Many of us feel that
what the "liberal establishment"
and upper middle class really ad
vocate is social revolution at the
expense of the "lower middle
class." Therefore we are very sen
sitive to being totally ignored
when organizational processes are
set up to study and recommend
programs for housing, health,
human relations, educational and
job opportunities.
The SEA appointed one of its
members when the formation of a
housing committee for Stanford
was discussed. The appointee noti
fied Dr. Glaser's office and asked
to be included in the delibera
tions. Our representative was not
appointed. Apparently the admin
istration believes workers have
nothing to contribute towards sol
utions of their own problems. I
am reminded- Dr. Glaser did ap
point the SEA president to a com
mittee—the parking committee!
Representation to committees
from organizations such as SEA
have some definite advantages. To
exclude workers and lower middle
class from such organizational and

educational processes is a serious
misjudgement with far-reaching
social and political consequences.
The workers in SEA are part of
the social forces operating at Stan
ford. We are largely inarticulate
but we are developing. Don't un
derestimate us. Don't ignore us.
No social shifts can be peace
fully made nor can any major
social change be made without the
support of the American workers.
We urge you to include us in
studies affecting our interests.

• Czech Thanks Americans
Dear Friends:
Recently I lotated a small ar
ticle in one of our newspapers, in
forming us that a company called
"Americans for Czechoslovakia"
has been founded and a message
has been sent to our dear Mr.
Dubcek. And I simply must thank
you for your big support you have
shown by this action to our
people, which suffered so much
already during the past years
Please tell our thanks and ad
miration to all the students of the
Stanford University who support
our striving in public.
