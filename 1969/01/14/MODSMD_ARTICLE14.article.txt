# Faculty Rejects Poly Sci Seminars
## 
### 
Two of the five student-di
rected courses demanded by un
dergraduate political science ma
jors failed to gain approval at a
meeting of the department's Un
dergraduate Curriculum Commit
tee yesterday afternoon.
Pre-Socratic Thought, the
Bible and Marx, to be directed by
TA William Mor, was not accepted
because the five faculty-member
committee decided that Mor did
not have the competence needed
to direct the course at this time.
Mor was invited by the com
mittee to work on the course with
its faculty sponsor Prof. Joe Paff
and to resubmit it for Spring quar
ter.
A seminar on American imper
ialism, submitted for approval
only yesterday, was not consid
ered due to the lateness of it and
to the lack of a faculty sponsor.
Mor explained that the faculty
members felt that it was necessary
for him to have previously read all
of the books on his reading list.
He attributed this requirement to
a belief by the members of the
political science department that

knowledge can only be dispensed,
not gained together.
Jim Shoch, one of the leaders
of the demand movement, com
mented that most of the under
graduates to whom he had talked
were "pretty burned up" by the
decision, although he explained
that it had been anticipated by
many.
Shoch stated that no further
action will be taken by the under
graduates until after the faculty
meets Wednesday afternoon.
Two students will be allowed
to make a presentation at that
meeting. At that time, according
to Shoch, the undergraduate griev
ances will be expressed and a pro
posal will be offered.
Although unable to detail the
exact nature of the plan, Shoch
declared the students were consid
ering something along the lines of
the proposal recently put forward
by graduate students which called
for a committee of three profes
sors, three graduate students and
three undergraduates to pass on
experimental course suggestions.
