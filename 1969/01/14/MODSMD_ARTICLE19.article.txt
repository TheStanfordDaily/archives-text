# Campus Apartment
## Portions Of Corpse Found 
### 
Pieces of a male human body
were found in the attic of a Stan
ford campus apartment Sunday
night, the Santa Clara County
Sheriff's Office said.
Deputies believe the pieces
might have come from a cadaver,
but they have been turned over to
the coroner's office for further in
vestigation.
The pieces were found in the
attic of an apartment occupied by
Brenda Bollman, 624 Mayfield
Ave., Stanford. Her boyfriend,
Donald Judson of Pasadena, made
the grisly discovery.

Miss Bollman told deputies
that she and Judson were watch
ing television in her apartment at
7:30 p.m. when she asked him to
check the source of a foul odor
coming from the attic.
Judson climbed into the attic
from an opening in the ceiling and
discovered the pieces under a
piece of cloth on the attic floor.
The pieces included a right
outer ear, a scalp, several pieces of
flesh with hair attached, and male
genitals.
Judson immediately contacted
Stanford police, who in turn
called the sheriff's department.

Deputies responded quickly as
the call first came in to them as a
possible murder.
The human pieces appeared to
have been preserved in formal
dehyde, deputies said.
Miss Bollman told deputies she
had lived in the apartment since
October.
