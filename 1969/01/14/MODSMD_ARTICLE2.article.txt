# Union Store Prices Meet Competition
## 
### DENIIS PERLUSS 
Despite constant complaints
on campus about the prices
charged at the Tresidder Union
Store, a comparison of the
mark-ups on a randomly selected
list of popular staple items reveals
only a minor deviation from the
prices charged by comparable
drug and sundries stores in the
Stanford area.
Students concerned with
maintaining their supply of
aspirin, toothpaste, and razor
blades at the lowest possible cost,
however, would be well advised to
do their shopping at one of the
large discount drug houses.
The major factor determining
the difference between the prices
at the Union Store and other
similar small sundry stores and a
large store such as the Alec
Shopping Center is the ability to
buy in large quantities.
Because Alec's can purchase in
bulk and store in its own
warehouses, it is able to offer
savings of over 40 percent on
Contac, more than 20 percent on
purchases of a medium-sized
bottle of aspirin, and reductions
from 10 to 25 percent of the price
on items ranging from Right
Guard to Keenex.
The prices used at the Union
Store follow the usual mark-ups in
the retail trade. The profits from
the store's operation, however, are
below the rate of return normally
expected in such a business.
Of a total cash in-flow of just
under $300,000 in the year
ending August 31,1968, only 5.5
percent remained as profit. This
figure was nearly twice that of the
previous fiscal year. An operation
of this type normally has a profit
of about 8 percent according tp
Paul Hopkins, an accountant with
Tresidder Memorial Union.
This below-standard profit
ratio was attributed to the fact
that the store stays open for many
economically unprofitable hours
to maximize student convenience.
The Union Store is a
department of Tresidder Memorial
Union, and any profit from it is
used to help in the general
operating cost of the Union. The
store and the Cafeteria, in fact,
are the only two divisions of the*
Union that make a profit. The
balance of Union costs is paid
with the help of subsidies from
the University.

Another frequent complaint
about products offered at the
store cites the small sizes which
deprive the customer of the
savings that result from buying a
"giant, economy size."
Miss Frances Silvan, store
manager, said that limited floor
and shelf space coupled with a
large number (over 500) of
different items in the store
inventory prevented carrying
several sizes of many of the
products.
