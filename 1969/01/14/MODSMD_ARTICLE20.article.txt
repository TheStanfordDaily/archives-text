# Foreign Students
## Study Shows Decline In Enrollment 
### 
Total foreign student attend
ance at Stanford has leveled off
over the past two academic years,
a recent report from Dr. Kenneth
Cooper, associate dean for inter
national students and director of
the Bechtel International Center,
showed.

A drop was noticeable at the
undergraduate level, from a high
of 158 in 1966-67 to 95 for the
current academic year. Graduate
students, who are in the majority,
declined only five from 887 to
882 over the year just passed,
Cooper's report revealed.

The overall drop was from
1016 to an even 1000 over the
two-year period, after a climb
from 548 in 1961-62.
Cooper said no particular
reason could be ascribed to the
decline, which he described as
"quite minor and not significant"
without a national comparison.
This is made annually by the Insti
tute of International Education in
New York and their 1968-69
figures have not been reported
vet.
Many Are Men
The report disclosed thai
slightly over 88 percent of the
current foreign student popula
tion are graduates and that more
than 80 percent of these are men.
Nine and a half percent are un
dergraduates and of these, more
than 80 percent are men. The ma
jority of both are unmarried.
Nearly 46 percent are enrolled
in the School of Engineering and
nearly 28 percent aryin the

School of Humanities and Sci
ences, the report showed, and the
rest in descending order are en
rolled in the Graduate School of
Business, Farth Sciences, Educa
tion, Medicine, and Law.
As in the past, the largest
group of foreign students are from
Canada, followed by France, Na
tionalist China, England and
Wales, and India. In all, 70 coun
tries are represented, including
five "stateless persons."
Many In Engineering
The largest number is enrolled
in electrical engineering, followed
by business, civil engineering, in
dustrial and mechanical engineer
ing, and education.
Nearly 30 percent of total en
rollment is European; slightly
more than 30 percent claim Asia
and the South Pacific, including
Australia and New Zealand, as
home; nearly 18 percent come
from Latin America.
