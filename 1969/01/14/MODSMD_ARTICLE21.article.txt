# Largest VIA Group Planned
## 
### 
Volunteers in Asia, a private organization begun by a handful of
Stanford freshmen six years ago, will field its largest group yet of
volunteers in the coming year. More than sixty will be sent in response
to requests from eight Asian areas for terms of anywhere from a
summer to two years.
A program to introduce this year's assignments will be held tonight
at 7:30 in the small lounge of Tresidder.
In addition to continuing its summer programs in Hong Kong,
Macao, Philippines, Japan, and Korea, VIA will expand substantially
the six-month assignments begun this past year on a pilot basis.
Six-month volunteers can arrange to receive some academic credit so
that they do not fall behind academically and can maintain draft
deferments.
This past year, VIA sent volunteers to Indonesia and Nepal for the
first time. VIA was the first American volunteer group, in fact, to be
asked into Indonesia since the Peace Corps left that country 3'/2 years
ago. The organization expects a modest increase in its commitment of
six-month to two-year volunteers to Indonesia.
Most volunteers serve in English teaching roles but others have
taught mathematics, science, and political science. Medical and
pre-medical students are assigned to hospitals and clinics.
A summer program only at its inception, VIA has recently begun
to emphasize longer-term placements. A dozen longer-term volunteers
have been in the field since last year, many of them in positions not
available to summer-only assignment.
