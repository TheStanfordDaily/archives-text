# Hitler's Reign
## Private Photos On Display 
### 
Candid and private photo
graphs of Adolf Hitler and top
Nazi aides, taken as they negotia
ted with Stalin, Mussolini, and
others, now are on display in the
Tower lobby of Stanford's Hoover
Institution on War, Revolution,
and Peace.
The photos, most of them
never before exhibited or repro
duced, are part of a valuable
collection donated to the Institu
tion recently by Col. William R.
Philp (USA-ret.) of San Francisco
Among the items on view
through Feb. 28 are:
• Selections from two albums
of prints recording the Ger
man mission to Moscow in
August 1939, during which
the notorious Nazi-Soviet
no naggression pact was
signed.
• A thick and over-sized album
of photos depicting Hitler's
state visit to Mussolini's
Rome May 3-9, 1938— 0r, as
portentously stamped in gold
on the blue cover, "in the
16th year of the Fascist era."
Swastika flags fly over the
colosseum and other ancient
monuments.
•An album of pictures of the
state visit to Berlin in 1938 of
Nobufumi lto, a Japanese
special envoy. Not the least
interesting of these prints rec
ords for posterity the fastidi
ousness of some anonymous
German censor. Hermann
Georing's fat cigar is re
touched out of existence.
While the photos often are the

most graphic items in the Philp
collection at the Institution, they
are overshadowed in scholarly
value by the vast and detailed in
telligence documentation acquired
by the U.S. in Germany after the

war. Concerning Hitler alone,
are copies of his marriage license
his "private and political testa
ments," exhaustive medical anal
yses of his mind as well as his
body
