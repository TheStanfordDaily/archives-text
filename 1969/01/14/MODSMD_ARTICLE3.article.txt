• DC-8 Down Off LA
LOS ANGELES (AP)--Scandi
navian Airlines DC-8 plunged into
the sea offshore from International
Airport Monday night during a
rainstorm. The Coast Guard said it
had a report that no one appeared
to have been killed, but one pas
senger was listed as missing.
The airline said there were 36
passengers and nine crewmen on
the flight from Copenhagen, Den
mark, via Seattle to Los Angeles.
The Coast Guard, which first
estimated the scene as a mile and
a half off the Southern California
coast, later tabbed it as eight miles
out—and said planes, helicopters
and boats of all descriptions were
hunting for passengers.
One radio report said many
passengers were on life rafts and
some were being brought ashore
in good condition.
"Our report is that almost
everyone appears okay," said a
Coast Guard spokesman, "but we
hear four passengers were in
jured."
The Los Angeles County life
guards reported their boat, the
Bay Watch, had picked up eight
persons and was bringing them to
the small boat harbor at Marina
Del Ray, near the airport.
•SF State Quiet
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) Strik
ing teachers and students main
tained a small picket line outside
rain-drenched San Francisco State
College Monday on one of the
quietest days since the Black Stu
dents Union first struck Nov. 6.
The teachers, members of the
American Federation of Teachers
who struck Jan. 6, were defying a
temporary restrainer against strik
ing or picketing.
A Superior Court hearing is
scheduled Tuesday on whether to
issue a permanent injunction.
Meanwhile, classes went on,
but attendance was reduced by

the bad weather as well as the
strikes.
The Union teachers, who claim
a membership of more than 400
but are numbered at about 200 by
the administration, have been
threatened with automatic dismis
sal after being absent five days in
a row.
The administration has agreed
to their chief demand for a Black
Studies Department but none was
willing to say if the strike would
end in time for its scheduled Feb
ruary start.
•Peace March OK\l
WASHINGTON (AP)--Anti
-war groups whose peace demon
strations in Chicago blossomed
into violence claimed Monday
they have official sanction for a
"counterinaugural" parade down
Pennsylvania Avenue the day be
fore President-elect Nixon's in
auguration.
The word came from a leader
of one of the groups, David Del
linger, 52, head of the National
Mobilization Committee to End
the War in Vietnam.
"The government recognized
the force of the peoples feelings
while American soldiers and Viet
namese are dying in an imperial
istic war and that the anti-war
feelings of the American people
cannot be suspended during the
time it takes the government to
change hands.
"In recognition of the deter
mination of the people to halt the
war the government has recog
nized our right to march down
Pennsylvania Avenue on Sunday,
the day before Nixon takes of
fice."
•Court to Air Case
WASHINGTON (AP)-The
Supreme Court decided Monday
on a thorough airing of Adam
Clayton Powell's exclusion from
the House, a case that could put

the court on a collision course
with Congress.
The court late last year agreed
to hear Powell's charges that the
House acted unconstitutionally in
1967 when it denied him his seat
from New York's Harlem and
stripped him of 22 years' senior
ity. He has since been re-elected,
fined and seated.
Powell's expulsion followed
charges he misused some $40,000
in federal money, mainly travel
funds, and put his wife on the
payroll and collected her salary
himself.
Powell was re-elected in a spec
ial election but barred again from
his seat.
He won overwhelming re-elec
tion a second time last November
and after a five-hour debate the
House agreed at the opening of
this session to seat him if he ac
cepted loss of seniority and paid a
$25,000 fine.
Powell accepted the penalties
which cost him the powerful
chairmanship of the House Educa
tion and Labor Committee. But
he pressed ahead with his suit
against the House, amending it to
appeal the fine and the loss of
seniority.

MIAMI(APh~The 471 pass
engers danced, sipped drinks and
lounged on the sun-splashed decks
of the British cruise ship Carmania
Monday, not caring that the vessel
was stuck high and dry on a Ba
hamian reef.
At least, that's the way staff
officer Peter Ekson described the
situation aboard his 22,600-ton
ship, owned by the Cunard Lines.
"Everyone is carrying on the way
they usually do," Ekson said in a
ship-to-shore conversation.
"They're all very cheerful. We
have plenty of everything."
Just 18 hours after starting a
12-day Caribbean cruise from
Florida, the Carmania made a
landfall at roughly the same spot
Christopher Columbus did in
1492 when he thought he was in
the Orient.
The Carmania was aground
from bow to bridge five miles
south of Cockburn Town on San
Salvador Island, 375 miles south
east of Miami.

•Talks with USSR?
WASHINGTON (AP)-Secre
tary of Defense-designate Melvin
Laird said Monday he believed the
United States is moving away
from a period of confrontation
toward one of negotiation in
world affairs.
But at a news conference he
stressed that any negotiations
with the Soviet Union will require
extensive preparations.
These, he said, were more im
portant than the negotiations
themselves, adding he was "very
hopeful" in this area. At another
point, he said the United States
must negotiate from "a position
of strength."

House acted unconstitutionally in
1967 when it denied him his seat
from New York's Harlem and
stripped him of 22 years' senior
ity. He has since been re-elected,
fined and seated.
Powell's expulsion followed
charges he misused some $40,000
in federal money, mainly travel
funds, and put his wife on the
payroll and collected her salary
himself.
Powell was re-elected in a spec
ial election but barred again from
his seat.
He won overwhelming re-elec
tion a second time last November
and after a five-hour debate the
House agreed at the opening of
this session to seat him if he ac

$25,000 fine.
Powell accepted the penalties
which cost him the powerful
chairmanship of the House Educa
tion and Labor Committee. But
he pressed ahead with his suit
against the House, amending it to
appeal the fine and the loss of
seniority.

Monday, not caring that the vessel

At least, that's the way staff

The Carmania was aground

• DC-8 Down Off LA
LOS ANGELES (AP)--Scandi
navian Airlines DC-8 plunged into
the sea offshore from International
Airport Monday night during a
rainstorm. The Coast Guard said it
had a report that no one appeared
to have been killed, but one pas
senger was listed as missing.
The airline said there were 36
passengers and nine crewmen on
the flight from Copenhagen, Den
mark, via Seattle to Los Angeles.
The Coast Guard, which first
estimated the scene as a mile and
a half off the Southern California
coast, later tabbed it as eight miles
out—and said planes, helicopters
and boats of all descriptions were
hunting for passengers.
One radio report said many
passengers were on life rafts and
some were being brought ashore
in good condition.
"Our report is that almost
everyone appears okay," said a
Coast Guard spokesman, "but we
hear four passengers were in
jured."
The Los Angeles County life
guards reported their boat, the
Bay Watch, had picked up eight
persons and was bringing them to
the small boat harbor at Marina
Del Ray, near the airport.

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) Strik

rain-drenched San Francisco State

quietest days since the Black Stu

The teachers, members of the
American Federation of Teachers
who struck Jan. 6, were defying a
temporary restrainer against strik

A Superior Court hearing is
scheduled Tuesday on whether to
issue a permanent injunction.
Meanwhile, classes went on,

The Union teachers, who claim
a membership of more than 400

The administration has agreed

The word came from a leader

"The government recognized

•Court to Air Case
WASHINGTON (AP)-The
Supreme Court decided Monday
on a thorough airing of Adam
Clayton Powell's exclusion from
the House, a case that could put

the court on a collision course
with Congress.
The court late last year agreed
to hear Powell's charges that the
House acted unconstitutionally in
1967 when it denied him his seat
from New York's Harlem and
stripped him of 22 years' senior
ity. He has since been re-elected,
fined and seated.
Powell's expulsion followed
charges he misused some $40,000
in federal money, mainly travel
funds, and put his wife on the
payroll and collected her salary
himself.
Powell was re-elected in a spec
ial election but barred again from
his seat.
He won overwhelming re-elec
tion a second time last November
and after a five-hour debate the
House agreed at the opening of
this session to seat him if he ac
cepted loss of seniority and paid a
$25,000 fine.
Powell accepted the penalties
which cost him the powerful
chairmanship of the House Educa
tion and Labor Committee. But
he pressed ahead with his suit
against the House, amending it to
appeal the fine and the loss of
seniority.

•Court to Air Case
WASHINGTON (AP)-The
Supreme Court decided Monday
on a thorough airing of Adam
Clayton Powell's exclusion from
the House, a case that could put

the court on a collision course
with Congress.
The court late last year agreed
to hear Powell's charges that the
House acted unconstitutionally in
1967 when it denied him his seat
from New York's Harlem and
stripped him of 22 years' senior
ity. He has since been re-elected,
fined and seated.
Powell's expulsion followed
charges he misused some $40,000
in federal money, mainly travel
funds, and put his wife on the
payroll and collected her salary
himself.
Powell was re-elected in a spec
ial election but barred again from
his seat.
He won overwhelming re-elec
tion a second time last November
and after a five-hour debate the
House agreed at the opening of
this session to seat him if he ac
cepted loss of seniority and paid a
$25,000 fine.
Powell accepted the penalties
which cost him the powerful
chairmanship of the House Educa
tion and Labor Committee. But
he pressed ahead with his suit
against the House, amending it to
appeal the fine and the loss of
seniority.
• Liner Runs Aground
MIAMI(APh~The 471 pass
engers danced, sipped drinks and
lounged on the sun-splashed decks
of the British cruise ship Carmania
Monday, not caring that the vessel
was stuck high and dry on a Ba
hamian reef.
At least, that's the way staff
officer Peter Ekson described the
situation aboard his 22,600-ton
ship, owned by the Cunard Lines.
"Everyone is carrying on the way
they usually do," Ekson said in a
ship-to-shore conversation.
"They're all very cheerful. We
have plenty of everything."
Just 18 hours after starting a
12-day Caribbean cruise from
Florida, the Carmania made a
landfall at roughly the same spot
Christopher Columbus did in
1492 when he thought he was in
the Orient.
The Carmania was aground
from bow to bridge five miles
south of Cockburn Town on San
Salvador Island, 375 miles south
east of Miami.

•Talks with USSR?
WASHINGTON (AP)-Secre
tary of Defense-designate Melvin
Laird said Monday he believed the
United States is moving away
from a period of confrontation
toward one of negotiation in
world affairs.
But at a news conference he
stressed that any negotiations
with the Soviet Union will require
extensive preparations.
These, he said, were more im
portant than the negotiations
themselves, adding he was "very
hopeful" in this area. At another
point, he said the United States
must negotiate from "a position
of strength."
Cable Car Mishap
SAN FRANCISCO (AP)-Four

• $40,000 Waste
WASHINGTON (AP)-The De
fense Department issued a new
400-page telephone book Monday
that will be outdated almost im
mediately—at a cost of $40,000.
It contains the names of the
Johnson administration civilian
officials, many of whom will be
leaving office after Monday when
Richard M. Nixon becomes 37th
president of the UrA»,ed States.
• Bandits Obtain 30c
CAGLIARI, Sardinia (AP)-
Two masked bandits crept into
the house of Giovanna Piccioni,
85, during the night, woke her up
and demanded all her money. She
told them she had none. After
tearing up her house, they fled
after finding an envelope contain
ing the equivalent of 30 cents.
