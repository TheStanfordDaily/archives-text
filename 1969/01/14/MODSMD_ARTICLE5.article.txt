# Palo Alto Controversy
## Traffic Loop's Demise Aids Businesses 
### LANG ATWOOD 
Two-way traffic has returned
to downtown Palo Alto; and as a
result business in the downtown
area, which dropped sharply when
the one-way traffic "loop" was
instituted in October 1967, has
begun to increase.
The one-way traffice loop was
supposed to provide fast, orderly
traffic movement through the
downtown area with a minimum
of congestion. It was supported at
the time by the mayor, city
council, Palo Alto Times and
various developers who favor a
one-way loop system in their
plans to redevelop the downtown
area into a high-rise financial and
medical center.
Businessmen in the downtown
area experienced an immediate
drop in sales and customers after
the loop was put into effect but
were told by the city council to
"give it a chance".
In April, a petition was
presented to the city council
asking for a discontinuation of the
loop and a return to two-way
traffic. The petition carried the
signatures of 130 merchants as
well as 1 900 shoppers. The
council refused to abandon the
loop, and the businessmen
through the Central Business Area
Association of Palo Alto
(CBAA) began circulating
initiative petitions among
registered voters calling for a
referendum on the traffic loop.

A total of 4260 signatures
were acquired, one-quarter of the
registered voters in Palo Alto, but
city attorney James Hildebrand
ruled that the traffic loop fell
under the jurisdiction of the city
council and was not subject to an
initiative referendum.
At'ter receiving numerous

complaints the city council in a
closed meeting November 12
inquired as to the actual losses
that the firms had suffered during
the loop's operation.
In response, J. O. Mcßride,
president of the CBAA, submitted
a petition signed by 122 firms
along with loss sheets for 15

businesses asking for the
immediate discontinuation of the
loop. "Failure to do so will result
in bitterness, further losses, and
expense to the City as well as its
people," concluded the petition.
Faced with statements showing
losses ranging from 9 to 50
percent and averaging about 15

percent when compared to the
previous year with two-way
traffic, the council voted 6 - 5 to
end the loop system and return to
two-way traffic. Reportedly,
however several councilmen stated
at the time that the loop will be
back in several years.
Business Up
A random check of firms in
the downtown area indicates that
business has increased but has not
yet reached pre-loop levels. To
explain this, Mcßride said, "Once
people's shopping habits have
changed it's hard to get them
back. But I've heard nothing but
good comments regarding the end
of the loop. Nobody has come in
and said, 'I'm sorry the one-way
streets are gone.""
When the battle over the loop
began, one of the problems facing
the small businessmen was a lack
of news coverage regarding their
fight. The Palo Alto Times was
one of the prime backers of the
loop system and a story in The
Daily last spring presented and
analyzed both sides of the
controversy for the first time.
The end of the loop system is
generally regarded as a victory for
the "little people" in their efforts
to prevent the downtown area
from being turned into a high-rise
financial center. Of more
immediate concern to Mcßride
and the other businessmen is their
hope that the return to two-way
traffic will encourage new
customers to come to the
downtown area.


THE LOOP NOW UNLOOPED—This is the way it was until the Palo Alto City Council gave in to
community pressure and eliminated the one-way street pattern. At High Street and University (above)
autos are shown being diverted from two-way University onto the faster one-way side streets.

well as 1 900 shoppers. The
council refused to abandon the
loop, and the businessmen
through the Central Business Area
Association of Palo Alto
(CBAA) began circulating
initiative petitions among
registered voters calling for a
referendum on the traffic loop.

A total of 4260 signatures
were acquired, one-quarter of the
registered voters in Palo Alto, but
city attorney James Hildebrand
ruled that the traffic loop fell
under the jurisdiction of the city
council and was not subject to an
initiative referendum.
At'ter receiving numerous

complaints the city council in a
closed meeting November 12
inquired as to the actual losses
that the firms had suffered during
the loop's operation.
In response, J. O. Mcßride,
president of the CBAA, submitted
a petition signed by 122 firms
along with loss sheets for 15

businesses asking for the
immediate discontinuation of the
loop. "Failure to do so will result
in bitterness, further losses, and
expense to the City as well as its
people," concluded the petition.
Faced with statements showing
losses ranging from 9 to 50
percent and averaging about 15

percent when compared to the
previous year with two-way
traffic, the council voted 6 - 5 to
end the loop system and return to
two-way traffic. Reportedly,
however several councilmen stated
at the time that the loop will be
back in several years.
Business Up
A random check of firms in
the downtown area indicates that
business has increased but has not
yet reached pre-loop levels. To
explain this, Mcßride said, "Once
people's shopping habits have
changed it's hard to get them
back. But I've heard nothing but
good comments regarding the end
of the loop. Nobody has come in
and said, 'I'm sorry the one-way
streets are gone.""
When the battle over the loop
began, one of the problems facing
the small businessmen was a lack
of news coverage regarding their
fight. The Palo Alto Times was
one of the prime backers of the
loop system and a story in The
Daily last spring presented and
analyzed both sides of the
controversy for the first time.
The end of the loop system is
generally regarded as a victory for
the "little people" in their efforts
to prevent the downtown area
from being turned into a high-rise
financial center. Of more
immediate concern to Mcßride
and the other businessmen is their
hope that the return to two-way
traffic will encourage new
customers to come to the
downtown area.


THE LOOP NOW UNLOOPED—This is the way it was until the Palo Alto City Council gave in to
community pressure and eliminated the one-way street pattern. At High Street and University (above)
autos are shown being diverted from two-way University onto the faster one-way side streets.
Two-way traffic has returned
to downtown Palo Alto; and as a
result business in the downtown
area, which dropped sharply when
the one-way traffic "loop" was
instituted in October 1967, has
begun to increase.
The one-way traffice loop was
supposed to provide fast, orderly
traffic movement through the
downtown area with a minimum
of congestion. It was supported at
the time by the mayor, city
council, Palo Alto Times and
various developers who favor a
one-way loop system in their
plans to redevelop the downtown
area into a high-rise financial and
medical center.
Businessmen in the downtown
area experienced an immediate
drop in sales and customers after
the loop was put into effect but
were told by the city council to
"give it a chance".
In April, a petition was
presented to the city council
asking for a discontinuation of the
loop and a return to two-way
traffic. The petition carried the
signatures of 130 merchants as
well as 1 900 shoppers. The
council refused to abandon the
loop, and the businessmen
through the Central Business Area
