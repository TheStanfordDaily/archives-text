# Coalition Suggests Bipartite SES Unit
## 
### MARGIE WOLF 
In continuing efforts to insure
student participation in Study of
Education consideration, an SES
coalition meeting of about 150
students in Branner's dining hali
last night approved anothef
proposal to be submitted to the
Academic Senate Steering
Committee.
Like the coalition proposal al
ready before the Steering Com
mittee, the new motion asks equal
student-faculty representation for
consideration and voting on SES
reforms. As stated in last night's
motion, students would be duly
appointed by LASSU;they would
discuss and vote with the Aca
demic Senate acting as a commit
tee-of-the-whole.
Decisions of the student
faculty body would be final unless
reversed by a two-thirds majority
in one of the separate student or
faculty groups. A proposal passed
last Thursday asked for equal stu
dent-faculty say in consideration,
but did not stipulate the two
thirds reconsideration.
The coalition also approved a
list of eight students charged with
explaining this latest proposal to
appropriate Academic Senate
members. The Senate Steering
Committee must plan for debate
of coalition proposals in the Sen
ate, which is the body holding
traditional authority for consider
ing suggestions like SES.
Lobbyists
Proposed by student body
president Denis Hayes and ap
proved by those at the coalition
meeting, members of the student
lobbying group are: Michael Kuhl
(Young Republicans chairman),
Douglas Chandler (Interfraternity
Council president), John Hough
ton (Earth Sciences), Terry Bar
nett (History), Julia Holm (Gen
eral Studies), Mike Benefiel
(SDS) V Yale Braunstein (LASSU
speaker), and Hayes.
The coalition, meeting in the
Branner dining room, defeated a
motion which would have asked
the Committee of 15, a body des
igned to handle controversy be
tween students, faculty and ad
ministration, to set up student
faculty committees to consider
parts of SES.

Students passed and tnen res
cinded a motion to ask LASSU to
recognize the coalitionâ€”an at
tempt to establish greater cred
ence among the faculty.
Packing LASSU Cited
Speakers against seeking
LASSU recognition pointed to
that body's lack of credibility it
self and the ease with which it can
be "packed" with proponents of a
single viewpoint.
The coalition also wrestled
with objections made by faculty
members in several Sunday after
noon seminar sessions. Students
related facuty fears of creating
too large a body to be effective,
of the constitutionality of re-dele
gating the power given the Senate,
of the legitimacy of the coalition
as a representative body, and of
establishing a precedent in stu
dent-faculty equality.
Controversy over student par
ticipation flared somewhat last
week when the Academic Senate
defeated a coalition proposal for
equal student-faculty representa
tion in discussion and voting.
Previous Suggestion
The Senate also killed a Steer
ing Committee suggestion to have
student government establish a
parallel body f or SES considera
tion. If the student group should
disagree with an Academic Senate
decision, the decision should be
re-examined and would require a
two-thirds majority for passage.
About 300 coalition advocates
voted last Thursday to re-submit
the rejected equal representation
proposal to the Senate Steering
Committee. At last night's meet
ing, coalition members decided
not to counter the decision of
Thursday's larger group. Hence,
both proposals will go to the
Steering Committee.
Advocates of last night's coali
tion proposal explained it would
not set up parallel bodies, but
would provide students and fac
ulty with a residual check on de
cisions.
The Academic Senate is sched
uled to meet Jan. 30. The coali
tion will meet next Monday at
7:30 to evaluate the results of the
week's effort.
