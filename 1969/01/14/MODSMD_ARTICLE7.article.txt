# Farm Divorce Rate Not Above Average
## 
### BARBARA HYLAND 
What future is there for a mar
riage where both husband and
wife are Stanford students? Many
students on campus believe that
up to 80 percent end in divorce.
However there seems to be no evi
dence or study to confirm this be
lief.
To verify the divorce figures,
the Alumni Association was con
sulted. Melinda Howe, Assistant
to the director, explained that the
only information in the files is
what people send in. They have

never attempted to collate data
pertaining to divorces.
Tia Hatch, assistant director,
suggested "The rumor may have
started because of the general
trend in the country." Of 96,000
alumni, 33,000 live in the Bay
Area, which is notorious for high
divorce rates. These are still far
below the 80 percent figure.
One statistician, when asked if
the rate was 70 percent, replied,
"No, that's wrong. It's 71 per
cent-there was a divorce yester
day." He quickly added he was
amazed any student would believe
such "hogwash."
Yet the majority of the sopho
mores interviewed have heard the
rumor and about half have be
lieved it. Freshman and seniors
have not been exposed to it and
only a few juniors have heard it,
rumor has it.
One believer dogmatically
stated that when a Stanford boy
marries a Stanford girl, "80 per
cent of the marriages result in di
vorces." He explained, "The ratio
gives an unrealistic balance. Girls
are not used to the competition in
the real world and the boys are
not used to the choice in the real
world."
The unnatural atmosphere was
cited again by a girl who thought
marriages were ruined when the
couple left Stanford which is an
"ideal place."
Intelligence was often men
tioned as the crucial factor in dis
solving marriages. One senior, al
though he did not believe the high
divorce figures, criticized Stanford
girls fpr being "schizophrenic,
very smart, very self-concerned"
and unable to think of themselves
as wives.
One sophomore said that the
marriages fail when both partners
are not "in the same ballpark" in
intelligence. He added that some
times marrying an intelligent girl
is "initially a drawback," but that
it can eventually make the mar
riage more fulfilling.
Intelligence, competition, and
the ratio may be at the root of
divorces of Stanford couples, but
there is little truth in the 70-80
percent figures despite the strong
belief in the Divorce Stanford
style rumor.
One junior suggested that after
living together Stanford students
just can't accept institutionalized
marriages.

is "initially a drawback," but that
it can eventually make the mar
riage more fulfilling.
Intelligence, competition, and
the ratio may be at the root of
divorces of Stanford couples, but
there is little truth in the 70-80
percent figures despite the strong
belief in the Divorce Stanford
style rumor.
One junior suggested that after
living together Stanford students
just can't accept institutionalized
marriages.
What future is there for a mar
riage where both husband and
wife are Stanford students? Many
students on campus believe that
up to 80 percent end in divorce.
However there seems to be no evi
dence or study to confirm this be
lief.
To verify the divorce figures,
the Alumni Association was con
sulted. Melinda Howe, Assistant
to the director, explained that the
only information in the files is
what people send in. They have

never attempted to collate data
pertaining to divorces.
Tia Hatch, assistant director,
suggested "The rumor may have
started because of the general
trend in the country." Of 96,000
alumni, 33,000 live in the Bay
Area, which is notorious for high
divorce rates. These are still far
below the 80 percent figure.
One statistician, when asked if
the rate was 70 percent, replied,
"No, that's wrong. It's 71 per
cent-there was a divorce yester
day." He quickly added he was
amazed any student would believe
such "hogwash."
Yet the majority of the sopho
mores interviewed have heard the
rumor and about half have be
lieved it. Freshman and seniors
have not been exposed to it and
only a few juniors have heard it,
rumor has it.
One believer dogmatically
stated that when a Stanford boy
marries a Stanford girl, "80 per
cent of the marriages result in di
vorces." He explained, "The ratio
gives an unrealistic balance. Girls
are not used to the competition in
the real world and the boys are
not used to the choice in the real
world."
The unnatural atmosphere was
cited again by a girl who thought
marriages were ruined when the
couple left Stanford which is an
"ideal place."
Intelligence was often men
tioned as the crucial factor in dis
solving marriages. One senior, al
though he did not believe the high
divorce figures, criticized Stanford
girls fpr being "schizophrenic,
very smart, very self-concerned"
and unable to think of themselves
as wives.
One sophomore said that the
marriages fail when both partners
are not "in the same ballpark" in
intelligence. He added that some
times marrying an intelligent girl
is "initially a drawback," but that
it can eventually make the mar
riage more fulfilling.
