## Winter Rain Falls On Stanford 
### NICK SELBY 
These are the mornings we
float to consciousness, riding the
steady drip off the rainspouts into
an almost lurid recognition of the
academic cosmos.
We smash alarm clocks on the
floor and retreat beneath all the

assorted blankets and clothes we
can find to stay warm, prepared
to pass the entire day without
leaving the bed.
It is the season of interminable
rain, of bleak horizons and
ominous ceilings. The winter
comes upon Stanford as the dreams
which disappear in the morning.
Yet there is, for all the puddles
and bother with keeping books
dry, a certain charm to this
campus when it rains, there are
ways to walk about and glow at
the oppressed, dreary passers-by.
Slow Drizzle
Because if your hair is long
enough and if you've got an old
rainshirt, you can dance through
the slow Stanford drizzle,
impervious to the gloom,
impermeable to the damp.
If you walk about Quad during
classes, the colonnades are empty,
the giant rectangle is deserted.
The sandstone arches capture the

drip, and echo its ceaseless poetry.
As if left there weeks ago, a
motorscooter waits just beyond
the shelter of the portico. Puddles
sink into the seat and one feels
the motor shall nver again
function, but no one shares an
umbrella with the sorry machine.
In the quiet during classes,
unsuspected vistas open-one
huddles at the door of the Physics
tank and spies the Main Library,
the found in front turned off.
Hat Rack
Hoover Tower stands beside, a
lonely sentinel of the past, a hat
rack for thunderheads dousing the
solemn, dark palms. It will be a
short afternoon.
In front of Memorial Church,
one peers toward the marketplace,
the center of commerce bubbling
with junk and movie theatres.
Miniature cars disappear forever
into the mist over El Camino. To

the left, the bare steel girders of
the new Psychology building
silently begin to rust. Years from
now, like the students and
professors, they too shall be
replaced.
If your new Christmas loafers
don't slip or squeak on the wet
class tiles around Quad, you can
pass actual classes in session and
wonder why students listen, if
they do, and why professors
talk—the drizzle continues its free
music for all who care to listen.
You can leap off Quad at
History corner and fall into la'iy
swamps of winter grass, feel once
again mud slide between your
toes. Far off, up towards the Post
Office, the fountain adds its
steamy droplets to the day.
No Sprawling
No one sprawls on the concrete
benches, but those who brave the
rain pass quickly in scarves and

London Fogs. Intrepid coeds with
knee high boots and umbrellas
have an easier fo of it, but they
too hurry from the elements.
For years, I have heard friends
say how gloomy the winters here
make them. And indeed unless
you get out into the weather, it is
the most dismal season of all.
Never do you feel so forelorn as
when you look out a window with
nothing to do.
But all about, in the
Eucaluptus trees, in the hills to
the west, there is the simple joy of
water bringing life to a parched
earth, filled with promise for the
spring. Perhaps you have to risk
solitude and damp socks to feel it,
perhaps you have to stop and
listen.
These are the days when we
float to consciousness, riding the
special charm of a campus grey
and wet with January, waiting for
the sun.

These are the days when we
float to consciousness, riding the
special charm of a campus grey
and wet with January, waiting for
the sun.
These are the mornings we
float to consciousness, riding the
steady drip off the rainspouts into
an almost lurid recognition of the
academic cosmos.
We smash alarm clocks on the
floor and retreat beneath all the

assorted blankets and clothes we
can find to stay warm, prepared
to pass the entire day without
leaving the bed.
It is the season of interminable
rain, of bleak horizons and
ominous ceilings. The winter
comes upon Stanford as the dreams
which disappear in the morning.
Yet there is, for all the puddles
and bother with keeping books
dry, a certain charm to this
campus when it rains, there are
ways to walk about and glow at
the oppressed, dreary passers-by.
Slow Drizzle
Because if your hair is long
enough and if you've got an old
rainshirt, you can dance through
the slow Stanford drizzle,
impervious to the gloom,
impermeable to the damp.
If you walk about Quad during
classes, the colonnades are empty,
the giant rectangle is deserted.
The sandstone arches capture the

drip, and echo its ceaseless poetry.
As if left there weeks ago, a
motorscooter waits just beyond
the shelter of the portico. Puddles
sink into the seat and one feels
the motor shall nver again
function, but no one shares an
umbrella with the sorry machine.
In the quiet during classes,
unsuspected vistas open-one
huddles at the door of the Physics
tank and spies the Main Library,
the found in front turned off.
Hat Rack
Hoover Tower stands beside, a
lonely sentinel of the past, a hat
rack for thunderheads dousing the
solemn, dark palms. It will be a
short afternoon.
In front of Memorial Church,
one peers toward the marketplace,
the center of commerce bubbling
with junk and movie theatres.
Miniature cars disappear forever
into the mist over El Camino. To

the left, the bare steel girders of
the new Psychology building
silently begin to rust. Years from
now, like the students and
professors, they too shall be
replaced.
If your new Christmas loafers
don't slip or squeak on the wet
class tiles around Quad, you can
pass actual classes in session and
wonder why students listen, if
they do, and why professors
talk—the drizzle continues its free
music for all who care to listen.
You can leap off Quad at
History corner and fall into la'iy
swamps of winter grass, feel once
again mud slide between your
toes. Far off, up towards the Post
Office, the fountain adds its
steamy droplets to the day.
No Sprawling
No one sprawls on the concrete
benches, but those who brave the
rain pass quickly in scarves and

London Fogs. Intrepid coeds with
knee high boots and umbrellas
have an easier fo of it, but they
too hurry from the elements.
For years, I have heard friends
say how gloomy the winters here
make them. And indeed unless
you get out into the weather, it is
the most dismal season of all.
Never do you feel so forelorn as
when you look out a window with
nothing to do.
But all about, in the
Eucaluptus trees, in the hills to
the west, there is the simple joy of
water bringing life to a parched
earth, filled with promise for the
spring. Perhaps you have to risk
solitude and damp socks to feel it,
perhaps you have to stop and
listen.
