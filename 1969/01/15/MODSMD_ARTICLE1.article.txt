# Johnson Delivers Nostalgic Farewell
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP)—Presi
dent Johnson gave a nostalgic
farewell to Congress and the na
tion last night.
It was the first time in 169
years that an outgoing president
has delivered the State of the
Union message in person.
In a broad-ranging message on
the state of the union, the Presi
dent pointed to inflation as "our
number one economic challenge
today."
To cope with it and to balance
the budget, Johnson proposed a
one-year continuance of the 10
per cent income surtax.
Johnson said that increased
prospects for peace in Vietnam
are based on the fact that the U.S.
military situation there has im
proved and a structure for nego
tiations has been laid down in
Paris.
"The North Vietnamese know
that they cannot achieve their ag
gressive purposes by force. There
may be hard fighting before settle
ment is reached; but it will yield
no victory to the Communists."
Johnson said that in the inter
national field he believes the
United States should resume talks
with the Soviet Union about limit
ing offensive and defensive missile
systems. He called for Senate
action on the nuclear nonprolifer
ation treaty.
The President said that last
year Congress had cut the foreign
aid program "below the level of
safety for ourselves and humane
regard for our fellow man." He
said he was calling, in the budget,
for adequate funds.
He also said he was resub
mitting to Congress a proposal for
a "fair and impartial random sel
ection system for the draft," add
ing that he thinks it is an essential
reform.
• Carrier Explosion
PEARL HARBOR (AP)-Ex
plosions and fire set off by a
bomb which tumbled from a land
ing plane killed 13 men and in
jured 64 aboard the nuclear
powered U.S. aircraft carrier En
terprise on Tuesday.

The 85,000-ton carrier, the
world's biggest warship; limped in
to harbor with 200 feet of her
after section scorched and smoke
blackened.
A naval source said the bomb
was set off on the carrier deck.
The remains of two aircraft could
be seen amid the heaps of twisted
metal left by the explosions and
fire.
The giant warship's nuclear
power plant was not affected.
A spokesman at Tripler Army
Hospital said 47 injured men had
arrived, some by airlift from the
carrier, and that 17 others were
expected. The Enterprise has a
complement of 5,000.
The disaster struck the Enter
prise as she was taking part in
exercises in the Pacific about 75
miles southwest of Honolulu
Tuesday morning.
• Russian Space Flight
MOSCOW (AP)—Cosmonaut
Vladimir Shatalow rode the Soviet
Union's Soyuz 4 spaceship into
earth orbit Tuesday in what may
be the first phase of a space exper
iment involving other men.
A television broadcast from the
roomy cabin showed what ap
peared to be an empty seat beside
Shatalov. Soviet officials have in
dicated Soyuz-type craft, plauged
by trouble in the past, are de
signed ultimately to carry at least
three cosmonauts.
There was talk in Moscow, un
confirmed, that a second craft
would be sent aloft with two or
more men for an attempt to link
up with Soyuz 4 and transfer one

man to ride with Shatalov.
The Russians nave yet to
match Americas' repeated manned
linkups. Neither nation has
achieved a crew transfer in orbit.
• Cal to be Sold?
SACRAMENTO (AP)-Some
one wants to buy all the land and
buildings in the nine-campus Uni
versity of California and the
19-campus State College system.
Andrew R. Lolli, director of
the state general services depart
ment, declined Tuesday to say
who made the offer, but apparent
ly the investor's idea is to lease
the property back to the state.
The investor could benefit from
the arrangement under tax laws.
"As far as money was con
cerned there was no problem."
Lolli said. "They painted a very
rosy picture."
He added the offer is being
looked into on an exploratory
basis as an intriguing possibility.

WASHINGTON (AP)—Presi
dent Johnson gave a nostalgic
farewell to Congress and the na
tion last night.
It was the first time in 169
years that an outgoing president
has delivered the State of the
Union message in person.
In a broad-ranging message on
the state of the union, the Presi
dent pointed to inflation as "our
number one economic challenge
today."
To cope with it and to balance
the budget, Johnson proposed a
one-year continuance of the 10
per cent income surtax.
Johnson said that increased
prospects for peace in Vietnam
are based on the fact that the U.S.
military situation there has im
proved and a structure for nego
tiations has been laid down in
Paris.
"The North Vietnamese know
that they cannot achieve their ag
gressive purposes by force. There
may be hard fighting before settle
ment is reached; but it will yield
no victory to the Communists."
Johnson said that in the inter
national field he believes the
United States should resume talks
with the Soviet Union about limit
ing offensive and defensive missile
systems. He called for Senate
action on the nuclear nonprolifer
ation treaty.
The President said that last
year Congress had cut the foreign
aid program "below the level of
safety for ourselves and humane
regard for our fellow man." He
said he was calling, in the budget,
for adequate funds.
He also said he was resub
mitting to Congress a proposal for
a "fair and impartial random sel
ection system for the draft," add
ing that he thinks it is an essential
reform.
