# SDS And The Trustees
## 
### 
For a brief moment yesterday, one of the deep confliets
in our society was enacted, materially and dramatically. Stu
dents for a Democratic Society strained against the doors of
the faculty club. Inside Stanford's Trustees massed their
weight to keep them out.
As they trickled out the back way a while later, wearing
their trim grey suits, gun-metal haircuts and grim count
enances, it was clear that the Trustees did not enjoy theater
of the absurd.
One could not expect Trustees to appreciate the morbid
humor of the situation any more than one could seriously
ask them to discuss their involvement in this country's
Asian atrocities. But one can hope that thv rest of this
com mil nit y will recall the real issues behind yesterday's
tussel.
SDS maintains that United States' political, economic
and military involvement in Southeast Asia is immoral.
They want it ended. They believe that Stanford's Trustees
and powerful men of their ilk are responsible for this in
volvement, for the war that is part of it and for the deaths
of hundreds of thousands of human beings.
SDS is right.
The radical students wanted to talk to the Trustees yes
terday-to demand that they throw their weight against U.S.
imperialism rather than for it. Not surprisingly, the captains
of industry refused to hear them. Pushing, shouting, and
other socially unacceptable actions followed.
This community is composed largely of liberals. Liberals
do not like Vietnam, but they believe in the democratic
process, in moderation, in compromise, in taking the longer
view. They are likely to say things like: "The Trustees
should have listened, but that does not excuse the shocking
behavior of those students."
But liberals know as well as everyone else that the Trus
tees will probably never listen, and if they do it will just be
as a way of sapping the energy of their opposition. In fact,
morally concerned but passive students and professors criti
cize the noisy left as much to relieve their own frustration
as to be consistant with their middle class values.
It is not constructive to carp at the style of the activists.
Perhaps they would be more effective if they shaved, used
Mennen spray under their arms and donned sports jackets
and ties. Perhaps they should model themselves after
Gandhi rather than Jerry Rubin. But it is just as possible
that their radical style and radical convictions reinforce each
other.
And despite any shortcomings in their tactics, they are
the only ones who are putting themselves on the line to
oppose evils that many others quietly accept.
We ask the University community to share the frustra
tion of SDS rather than taking their frustrations out against
it. We urge our readers to overlook a personal and collective
style and examine the convictions which lie behind. And we
urge those who share such convictions to find some mean
ingful way to act on them.
No one took much notice of pushing and shouting in
Vietnam yesterday.
