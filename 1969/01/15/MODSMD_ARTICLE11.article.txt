# TA'S TRILEMMA

They are damned if they "do,"
They are damned if they "don't,"
TAs are the peasants who never say "won't":
They are the "low-life" of academe,
Condemned to slavery in manner extreme.

TAs are the black sheep of campus life
Caught between pay low and demands so rife
Apprentices to faculties hope so guile,
TAs are lost serfs in durance vile!
TAs take over when profs are gone
To highâ€”pay research in Washington:
Students are short-changed by research mad
From ego self-serving to publish glad.
L'envoi
Bachelor's degree to doctorate Heaven
Take four years to slavish seven:
Poverty takes its terrible toll
From academe victims of TA dole.
