Demands Revolutionary
itor, THE DAILY:
If the fight at State is "pri
marily for large changes in the
curriculum for blacks," says John
Sumner, "then I'm not particular
ly opposed." But if the goal is
"not changes in the educational
structure, but rather an attempt at
revolution," the we can count him
out. Moving one person from
counted-out to slightly opposed

doesn't seem too worthwhile but
there are probably others who sup
port the demands but don't like the
word revolution. I want to point
out that you can't be for the de
mands and against revolution at the
same time because the demands,
black control of black education
and places for all black students,
are themselves revolutionary.
In a capitalist society, which
produces for private profit and is
therefore unable to finance public
education, to demand education
for all black students is revolution
ary because it challenges the
society's exchange-value principle
for allocating resources (make
what produces private profit) and
sets up the principle of use value
(make what the people need.) For
black students to demand a black
controlled black studies program is
revolutionary too, because it chal
lenges the society's cultural
myth—the benevolent expansion
of "western civilization"—and sub
stitutes another rationality which
includes the right of colonized
peoples to their own cultures.
They aren't the revolution but
they are revolutionary demands;
put them into practice for the rest
of us and we'd have a revolution.
In response to Miss Falk's letter

I would like to suggest that she and
anybody else who feels solidarity
with the strike go down to San Jose
State College any day around noon
and join the picket lines. They need
people desperately.

Pro-Coalition
Editor, THE DAILY:
Bob Beyers' article in Monday'
Daily contained 2 interpretive er
rors of some importance.
First, I must challenge the as
sertion that the end result of the
efforts of the coalition might be
to "splinter existing support for
educational reform at this univer
sity."
The coalition has as its prime
purpose the furtherance of educa
tional reform, and is trying to es
tablish a base from which students
can act as an impetus toward this
goal. To date I have seen no evid
ence whatsoever that this is result
ing in either factional splintering
or the much-feared "faculty back
lash". Rather, the coalition is
viewed—correctly, I think—as a
healthy and constructive manifest
ation of real concern. This can
only be welcomed in a university
which has long suffered from ap
parent student indifference to
such issues.
We in the coalition think our
selves as fulfilling the announced
expectation of the S.E.S. steering
committee; as stated in their In
troduction:
"We have not attempted to
specify the addresses of our rec
ommendations. The consitutional
law of the University will become
more highly developed over the
coming months as questions of
what to decide become inter
twined with questions about juris
diction to decide. The results of
that deliberative and decision
making activity may at times be
somewhat chaotic, but they can
not fail in the end to be healthy."
Second, there was an implica
tion in Bob's article that the
group of students I introduced to
the faculty Senate last Thursday
was not popularly viewed as "rep
resentative". I should think that
there was more than sufficient
divergence of opinion reflected in
the student presentations to have
dispelled any such doubts. In one
reasonably dramatic instance I
personally took strong and very
vocal exception to the conten
tions of on e of my fellow stu
dents.
The students who appeared at
the Senate meeting all shared a
deep concern with the educational
aims of the S.E.S.; there was
nothing else of significance they
held in common.
