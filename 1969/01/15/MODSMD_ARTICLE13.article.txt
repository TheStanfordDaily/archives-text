# World Makes Drew Blue
## Dubious Cabinet Secretary 
### DREW PEARSON 
Various nicknames have been
coined for Walter J. Hickel, the
would-be Secretary of The Inter
ior. Because of his generosity in
handing out concessions to Oil
Companies in Alaska, one nick
name is "Help-Yourself—Hickel."
But Senators who have made an
investigation of the Hickel record
think that equally appropriate is
"I-Am-The-Law Hickel" or "Leap
-Before-You-Look" Hickel.
The latter is derived from
Hickel's purchase of a Swedish
Ferry Boat for use in Alaskan
coastwise waters when it was ob
vious such use would be a viola
tion of the Jones Act prohibiting
foreign built vessels from plying in
coastal trade.
The "I-Am-The-Law': nick
name is derived from the Gov
ernor's habit of taking the law
into his own hands when it speci
fieds that he should do exactly
the opposite.
One such case was his attempt
to prevent the Eskimo Fishing Co
operative at Bethel from selling its
salmon to a Japanese freezer ship,
despite the fact that the law speci
fically gave the Eskimos the right
to sell their catch to whomever
they wanted and the Japanese
ship had been cleared by the State
Department for Alaskan trade.

Hickel, however, took the law
into his own hands and sent ten
state employees, including a state
trooper, to try to board the ship,
scare it away and break up the
deal.
More recently "I-am-the-Law"
Hickle has been taking the law
into his own hands in his decision
to remain as Governor of Alaska
even after his official appointment
as Secretary of the Interior on
Jan. 20
Apparently Hickel fears he
may not be confirmed or that
confirmation may be delayed, so
he wants to hang on to his job as
Governor of Alaska.
This however, is clearly against
the Alaskan Constitution, which
states: "The Governor shall not
hold any other office. ..."
Hickel also ignored the law
when he appointed Harold
Strandberg, Commissioner of Pub
lic Works, despite the fact that
Strandberg had been a member of
the Legislature which voted to in
crease the salary of the Commis
sioner of Public Works. For a legi
slator or a Congressman to take a
job for which he has voted a sal
ary increase is against the Consti
tution.
However, "I-Am-The-Law"
Hickel carefully waited until the
legislature had adjourned so
Strandberg's appointment could

not be challenged. When Joe
Laßocca broke the story in the
Fairbanks Hickel had his 28-year
old Attorney General Kent
Edwards, write an opinion white
washing the appointment. How
ever, it's now being challenged by
a tax-payer's suit and remains il
legal just the same.
Another case where Hickel put
himself above the law was when
he tried to remove Clem Tillion of
Halibut Cover from the Northwest
International Fisheries Commis
sion's Advisory Board becasue he
proposed increasing the severance
tax on Oil Companies in Alaska.
The oil companies had been pay
ing only two percent. The Univer
sity of Alaska, after a study, rec
ommended a severance tax of ten
percent. Tillion, a republican
member of the Alaskan Legisla
ture, proposed a two percent in
crease.
Hickel, a great champion of the
Oil Companies was so irate at Til
lion, his fellow republican, that he
wrote aletter to the interior de
partment in Washington—which
he will head next week—recom
mending that Tillion be fired from
the Fisheries Advisory Board. Til
lion is a Commercial King Crab
andSalmon Fisherman, eminently
qualified to sit on the fisheries
board. So the interior department
refused.

may not be confirmed or that
confirmation may be delayed, so
he wants to hang on to his job as
Governor of Alaska.
This however, is clearly against
the Alaskan Constitution, which
states: "The Governor shall not
hold any other office. ..."
Hickel also ignored the law
when he appointed Harold
Strandberg, Commissioner of Pub
lic Works, despite the fact that
Strandberg had been a member of
the Legislature which voted to in
crease the salary of the Commis
sioner of Public Works. For a legi
slator or a Congressman to take a
job for which he has voted a sal
ary increase is against the Consti
tution.
However, "I-Am-The-Law"
Hickel carefully waited until the
legislature had adjourned so
Strandberg's appointment could

not be challenged. When Joe
Laßocca broke the story in the
Fairbanks Hickel had his 28-year
old Attorney General Kent
Edwards, write an opinion white
washing the appointment. How
ever, it's now being challenged by
a tax-payer's suit and remains il
legal just the same.
Another case where Hickel put
himself above the law was when
he tried to remove Clem Tillion of
Halibut Cover from the Northwest
International Fisheries Commis
sion's Advisory Board becasue he
proposed increasing the severance
tax on Oil Companies in Alaska.
The oil companies had been pay
ing only two percent. The Univer
sity of Alaska, after a study, rec
ommended a severance tax of ten
percent. Tillion, a republican
member of the Alaskan Legisla
ture, proposed a two percent in
crease.
Hickel, a great champion of the
Oil Companies was so irate at Til
lion, his fellow republican, that he
wrote aletter to the interior de
partment in Washington—which
he will head next week—recom
mending that Tillion be fired from
the Fisheries Advisory Board. Til
lion is a Commercial King Crab
andSalmon Fisherman, eminently
qualified to sit on the fisheries
board. So the interior department
refused.
Various nicknames have been
coined for Walter J. Hickel, the
would-be Secretary of The Inter
ior. Because of his generosity in
handing out concessions to Oil
Companies in Alaska, one nick
name is "Help-Yourself—Hickel."
But Senators who have made an
investigation of the Hickel record
think that equally appropriate is
"I-Am-The-Law Hickel" or "Leap
-Before-You-Look" Hickel.
The latter is derived from
Hickel's purchase of a Swedish
Ferry Boat for use in Alaskan
coastwise waters when it was ob
vious such use would be a viola
tion of the Jones Act prohibiting
foreign built vessels from plying in
coastal trade.
The "I-Am-The-Law': nick
name is derived from the Gov
ernor's habit of taking the law
into his own hands when it speci
fieds that he should do exactly
the opposite.
One such case was his attempt
to prevent the Eskimo Fishing Co
operative at Bethel from selling its
salmon to a Japanese freezer ship,
despite the fact that the law speci
fically gave the Eskimos the right
to sell their catch to whomever
they wanted and the Japanese
ship had been cleared by the State
Department for Alaskan trade.

Hickel, however, took the law
into his own hands and sent ten
state employees, including a state
trooper, to try to board the ship,
scare it away and break up the
deal.
