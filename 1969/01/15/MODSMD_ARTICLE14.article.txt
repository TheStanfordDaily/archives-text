Dear Mom,
I have always been an adherent
of the Flat Earth theory and was
delighted to see that the English
Flat Earth Society finally got
some publicity after the Apollo
flight. Where can I take Flat Earth
courses at Stanford?
Plain Student
Earth Sciences
Dear Plain Student,
I have received many letters re
questing a Flat Earth Department,
and I think this would be an ideal
issue for the S.D.S. people to
back. After all, the Flat Earth
people are a minority group and
are persecuted. However, the frat
ernities will not back the idea.
They say they are opposed to any
flat bodies.
Actually, this would not be an
innovation at Stanford. Harvard
had a Dept. of Flat Earth Studies.
They hired a vessel and the entire
department—faculty and students
—sailed out to the horizon where,
unfortunately, they fell off the
world.
But we must not be held back
by precedents, dear. This is an era
of change. And, as the president
of the Flat Earth Society remark
ed after the Apollo flight, "Wd are
reconsidering our position." This

shows a spirit of scientific inquiry
which is more than the Round
Earth people display! The motto
of the new department could be:
"Flattery will get you anywhere."
Flatly yours,
Flatly yours, Mom

Dear Mom,
I'm a graduate student from
Georgia and I miss the magnolias
and mint julips. What do you rec
ommend?
Beauregard

Dear Beauregard,
I recommend that you drink a
quart of Southern Comfort before
class each day. It will definitely
comfort you, and you'll probably
be back in Georgia before you all
know it!
Have a peachy trip,
Mom

Dear Motr

My mother makes her living as
a Spiritualist and by reading
palms. People keep telling me that
these psychic gifts run in families.
What does that make me?
L.
Dear L,
That makes you a son-of-a
witch.
Love,
Mom
