## Warranties I Have Known 
### ART BUCHWALD 
Betty Furness, in a speech the
other day, revealed something
that the average consumer has
known for years. It is that the
warranties that come with most
American products aren't worth
the computer cards they're
printed on.
There may be a lot of changes
in Washington in 1969, but one
thing you can be sure of: the
American consumer is still going
to get a shafting by the great free
enterprise system.
The other day I went to Mc-
Carthy, Swaine and Klutzknowl
ton, the appliance store, to return
an electric can opener I had
bought my wife for Christmas.
"Why do you wish to return
it?" the man asked.
"Because it doesn't work."
"Did you fill out the Green
Warranty Card that came with
it?"
"Yes, I did."
"And what happened?"
"The can opener still didn't
work."
"I see. Could you tell me how
soon you filled out the Green
Warranty Card after you got the
electric can opener?"
"Maybe three days, a week.
I'm not sure."

"But it specifically says that
the Green Warranty Card must be
filled out 24 hours after purchas
ing the appliance."
"Yes, but since it was a Christ
mas present we didn't open up the
package until Christmas morning,
and therefore we didn't see the
Green Warranty Card and have a
chance to fill it out for a few days
as we were too busy trying to get
the thing to work."
"But if you didn't fill out and
mail the Green Warranty Card
within 24 hours of the purchase,
it's hardly our fault that the elec
tric can opener doesn't work, is
it?"
"I wouldn't say that," I said.
"I think I should get a new elec
tric can opener."
"We can't do that. The only
one who has the authority to give
you a new electric can opener is
our warranty department, which
is located in Leavenworth, Kan.
But since you didn't send in the
Green Warranty Card within 24
hours of purchase, they probably
have no record of your buying an
electric can opener in the first
place."

"You have a record of it.
Here's my sales slip."
"Yes, that's true. We know you
purchased an electric can opener
and you know you purchased an
electric can opener, but Leaven
worth, Kan., doesn't know."
"Look," I said, "I should think
you would be worried for the
good name of McCarthy, Swaine
and Klutzknowlton."
"But we're not owned by
McCarthy, Swaine and Klutz
knowlton any more. We were
bought out b> Federated Pumps
and Warehouses which is a subsid
iary of Drinkwater Fire and Theft,
which is owned by Sable Hosiery
and TV Antennas, which merged
last month with Moon Orbiting
Platforms, Inc."
