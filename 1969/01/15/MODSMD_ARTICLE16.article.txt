### 
A professor at the University
of California at Berkeley has de
fied the Board of Regents and an
nounced he will give 22 students
credit for last quarters controver
sial course featuring Black Panther
Eldridge Cleaver.
The action taken by Associate
Prof, of Psychology Edward
Sampson yesterday is the first
official defiance on the Board of
Regents ban of credit on Social
Analysis 139 X.
Sampson said he would use his
"faculty prerogative" to give five
students in his section five units
credit for the current quarter.
Three other professors who
have taught the course have not
announced whether they will give
credit to the remaining 45 stu
dents who took the course. "
There has been no official com
ment from the University but
Chancellor Roger Heyns last week
asked Academic Senate Commit
tees to investigate possible misuse
of independent study programs.
The course was developed by
the Student Center for Participa
tion in Education (CPE) and ap
proved by the Faculty Board of
Educational development.
Some reaction to Sampson's
defiance is expected this Thursday
or Friday when the Board of Re
gents meets in Berkeley.
