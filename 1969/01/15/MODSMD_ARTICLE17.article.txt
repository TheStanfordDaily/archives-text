## Nuclear Development 
### 
In this day when "cliches are
shattered and stereotypes smashed
left and right," U.S. policymakers
and citizens continue to apply
"absolutely strong taboos" to
their thinking about nucear tech
nology.
Such attitudes, believes politi
cal scientist Stefan T. Possony,
have hampered severely thiscoun

try's development of both peace
ful and military uses for atomic
energy.
Possony, director of interna
tional political studies at Hoover
Institution, addressed a meeting
of the World Affairs Council of
Northern California at the group's
headquarters in San Francisco last
week.

The development of "clean"
nuclear devices, he said, meaning
those which do not contaminate
the environment beyond minimal
levels, is the crucial element in
future nuclear technology.
Passony said that both an un
duly strict State Department in
terpretation of the 1963 partial
nuclear test-ban treaty and the
general attitude of "taboo," each
reinforcing the other, haye
worked to hold back the "Plow
share" project on peaceful uses of
atomic energy and to all but stop
development of nuclear propul
sion systems for space vehicles.
"Now that the success of
Apollo B's moon flight has put
space travel high in the American
imagination, we ought to begin to
face the fact that we've about
reached the limit of the capabili
ties of chemical propulsion.
"If we really want to get out
beyond the moon, it's not very
feasible to depend on inertial
flight. Nor does chemical propul
sion give us the potentials we need
for payload and speed.
"Another concern about the
present methods of driving space
vehicles is the lack of maneuver
ability. This has large military im
plications. I don't bring this up to
scare anyone. But a close look at
the Soviet Union's space weapons
progress—especially their frac
tional orbital bombardment sys
tem (FOBSy-makes me very un
easy."
