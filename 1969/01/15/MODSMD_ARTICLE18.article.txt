# Area Businesses Ally With Stanford
## 
### 
Implementing a plan to offer
their employees continuing educa
tion in engineering, science, man
agement, and business, 16 Bay
Area industrial firms have joined
with Stanford University to form
the Association for Continuing
Education (ACE), it was an
nounced last week.
ACE chairman Julian Johnson,
Lockheed Missiles and Space Co.
executive, stated that the associa
tion has been incorporated under
a state charter. The first meeting
of its 10-man board was held in
December.
The first task of ACE will be to
plan non-credit courses for the
Stanford Instructional Television
Network which is soon to be ac
tivated, he said. Such courses will
be given during hours when the
network is not in use by Stan
ford's School of Engineering for

regular academic programming.
ACE will also coordinate plans for
other teaching institutions in the
Bay Area to offer credit courses
during evening hours.
Other seminars, conferences,
and educational programs also will
be sponsored and organized by
ACE under the plan, he said.
The Stanford Instructional
Television Network was granted a
construction permit last year by
the Federal Communications
Commission to broadcast on ex
tremely high frequencies which
will make it essentially "closed
circuit."
The network will program live
telecasts from regular classes on
campus to company classrooms,
where two-way communications
will enable students to reply to
the instructor.
