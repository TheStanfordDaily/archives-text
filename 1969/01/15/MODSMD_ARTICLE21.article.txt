## Tribe Capers In Action Shattering A Myth

The little kid with the slingshot brought down the towering
giant again Sunday afternoon.
In another one of those "It'll never happen in a million years"
affairs, the New York Jets completely throttled the Baltimore Colts in
the Super Bowl. It may have been the biggest upset in the history of
professional football.
The Jets were more psyched up than the Spartans at Thermopylae.
Representing the supposedly-weaker American Football League, they
were given about as much chance to beat Baltimore as Cassius Clay was
in his first fight with Sonny Liston. Like Clay, the Jets proved all the
experts wrong.
The Colts simply took it for granted they would win. Proud cham
pions of the established National Football League, the Super Bowl was
an anti-climax for Baltimore after a 34-0 rout of Cleveland in the NFL
title game. With the best defense in football, Baltimore was
invincible. . . like Sonny Liston was invincible.
The upset has a unique place in American sporting history. It can
arouse more interest, ignite more excitement, and stimuate far more
controversy than the expected. There is nothing sensational about
watching a team favored by three touchdowns grind out the anticipated
three-touchdown win. The underdog is the crowd-pleaser. The
possibility of an upset, and its occurrence, is responsible for a large
measure of the public's fascination with competitive sports.
Approximately 82.5 million fans witnessed Sunday's shocker on
television. Readtions were mixed. Many wept, others (the nation's
sportswriters) sat iin stunned silence, while a third group (much smaller
than the rest)counted dollar signs.
Losers and underdogs throughout the world revelled in the Colt's
demise. The victorious Jets became a symbol of the little man bucking
the establishment, the kid from the wrong side of the tracks beating out
the rich boy in spotless white pants, the homely Texan making it big in
Washington, the Greek with the funny name stepping into national
prominence.
What happened Sunday afternoon followed a trend that has been
developing since the dawn of 1968. The unexpected has become
commonplace —the expected obsolete.
One year ago Houston proved UCLA could be beaten, and another
myth was shattered. The San Francisco Warriors upset St. Louis in the
playoffs without Nate Thurmond, inciting brief hopes for a champion
ship. The Detroit Tigers fought back from near disaster to embarrass
the St. Louis Cardinals in the World Series, giving the American League
grounds for claims to parity with the National.
Gene McCarthy dumped LBJ in the New Hampshire primary, sparking
hopes among Democrats that a party face-lift might occur. Tiny Tim
showed that blondes really don't have more fun, conclusively demon
strating that talent and good looks aren't everything. And the
"Forgotten American," Richard Nixon, proved that he could win an
election, despite Spiro Agnew.
These events have not gone by the boards unnoticed. The common
man is awakening from years of slumber. The upsets of the past year
have given him renewed hope.
These morale boosters for the downtrodden have significance on the
local scene also. Stanford's basketball team plays UCLA in Los Angeles
on February 1. Right now, the Indians are 18 point
underdogs. . .


MAL FUNCTIONS—Co-captain Mai McElwain fires his left hand
juniper amid heavy traffic against Washington State Saturday night.
Behind McElwain is Cougar Mike Gomez who tossed in 19 points for
the victors. Gary Elliot (right) attempts block. McElwain and Co
captain Don Griffin led a second half Indian comeback that fell short,
71-66.


AUTOMATIC—Accurate Don Griffin fires away from 18 feet out over
the vain reach of WSU's Mike Gomez and Rick Erickson. Griff moved
into the sixth spot in all-time Stanford scoring with his 39 points
against the two Washington schools.
