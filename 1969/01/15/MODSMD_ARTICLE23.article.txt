# Laxmen Eye Third Successive Crown
## 
### 
The Stanford lacrosse team will
hold an organizational meeting to
night at 8:00 in Room 274, Tres
idder Union, to discuss plans for
the 1969 season. Those interested
in competing on the '69 squad are
encouraged to attend.
Last year the Indians put to
gether a perfect 13-0 record, in
creasing their winning streak over
the past two seasons to 19-0 and
capturing the Northern California
Lacrosse Association Champion
ship for the second year in a row.
Stanford has 16 returning let
termen from 1968's unbeaten
contingent. Gone is the NCLA's
Most Valuable Player, Mel Ellis,
who guarded the Tribe net for
four years. The gap left by Ellis is
the biggest question mark for the
Indians in the coming season. Also
lost is Bob Hawkins, whose
powerful midfield stick scored 17
goals last year.
Co-captains of this season's
squad are George Muser and Bill
Eakland, NCLA All-Stars for the
past two campaigns. Muser led
Tribe scorers with 17 goals and 21
assists last year. Eakland, an out
standing defensive player, was in
strumental in Stanford's yield of a
mere 53 goals last year. The
Indians totalled 110.

The team will have well-experi
enced depth this year and a well
rounded offense. The defense
should be as stubborn as ever, led
by Eakland and sophomore Wade
Killefer.
"We're going to miss Ellis," co
captain Eakland said yesterday,
"and Coach Don Ronayne is gone.
But the few spots we need to fill
will come from the strong incom
ing freshmen. We don't lack en
thusiasm and most important of
allâ€”we know how to win."
This quarter will be spent on
informal practices, getting ready
for the season opener on March
22. The 1969 schedule will in
clude a trip to Denver and one to
Oregon.
