# Hockey Team
## 
### 
Stanford's first ice hockey
team won its first game last Fri
day night. The Indians edged the
Peninsula Penguins, 14-11, at the
Belmont Iceland.
The newly emergent Stanford
club is still in the process of for
mation, and includes undergradu
ate, graduate, and even faculty
members.
The Tribe showed awesome
power combined with a rather
porous defense. They also had to
borrow a goalie. It is expected
that the team will play a regular
schedule of games against such
teams as the Penguins, the Menlo

College team, and already existing
teams in San Francisco, Berkeley,
and Sacramento.
College hockey in the rest of
the country has expanded rapidly
in the past few years. Even places
as far south as the University of
Tennessee have formed teams.
Stanford's next game will be a
rematch with the Penguins Friday
night at 10:45 p.m. at the Bel
mont Iceland. All players are still
welcome. Goalies are especially
needed. For more information,
call Dr. Fuller Torrey at home,
