# Rifle Club Meets
## 
### 
The Stanford Rifle and Pistol
Club will hold its first meeting of
Winter Quarter tonight from 7-9
p.m. in the rifle range across
Galvez Street opposite the Men's
Gym. All students- and faculty
members who are interested in
target practice and instruction are
encouraged to attend.
The Rifle and Pistol Club was
established in order to supplement
the marksmanship classes offered
throughout the year. Interested
persons are offered a chance to
practice with handguns or rifles,
to fire their own weapons (.22

and less) under supervision and to
receive individual instruction on
any level they desire. The dues of
$5 per quarter cover the cost of
ammunition and the use of all the
equipment necessary for firing.
The Club sponsors the varsity
rifle team which finished third in
last year's North California Inter
collegiate Rifle Conference.
Several members of the team will
be at each session both as coaches
and recruiters for the team. The
emphasis is on an educational, but
pleasant, evening of shooting.
