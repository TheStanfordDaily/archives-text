# 'Minds, Men And Machines' Subject Of Weekly Lectures
## 
### 
"Minds, Men, and Machines," a
study of computers and what they
mean to the future of mankind,
will be the subject of a five-lecture
series to be presented at Stanford
University beginning tonight.
The talks, open to the public,
will be given on consecutive Wed
nesdays at 7:45 p.m. in Room
100, the Physics Lecture Hall.
Lecture coordinator and one of
the speakers is Michael Arbib, as
sistant professor of electrical en
gineering at Stanford Electronics
Laboratories. The series is spon
sored by the University's Office of
Public Events.
As Prof. Arbib points out, "We
find that the existence of modern
electronic computers is forcing us
to re-evaluate our notion of the
machine, and try to see in what
way we can understand ourselves
better in seeking out the mechan
isms of the brain's action—but
also to understand the ways in
which man differs from any
machine now constructed."

The first speaker will be an
historian, Prof. Elton Morison of
Yale. Prof. Morison, whose spec
ialty is the impact of technology
upon American history, will di
scuss "From the First Industrial
Revolution to the Computer
Age—And Beyond."
Prof. Morison holds that since
machines are programmed by
humans, if man is unwise in his
decisions, he may subjugate him
self to a few rigid programs which
machines execute to carry out cer
tain of man's affairs. But it is pos
sible to program a machine to
serve individual needs as well as
those of man in general.
The Jan. 22 speaker, Prof. Sey
mour Papert of Massachusetts In
stitute of Technology, will discuss
"The Minds of Robots" to deter
mine to what extent machines
should become more human than
man.
The Jan. 29 speaker, Prof.
Kenneth Colby of Stanford's
Artificial Intelligence Project, who
once programmed a computer to
simulate a patient's nervous break
down, will discuss 'Psychiatry
and the Beliefs of Computers."
His studies have analyzed the
manner in which people modify
their actions by building up their
belief-systems.
Prof. Arbib's own lecture,
scheduled for Feb. 5, will examine
"The Metaphorical Brain." His
studies indicate that "there is no
reason why we should view man
as anything but a complicated
machine." He will compare com
puter functioning with current re
search in neurological brain
function.
The concluding speaker Feb.
12 is Biology Prof. Robert Sin
sheimer of California Institute of
Technology. In "The Brain of
Pooh" he will try to assess the
way in which mankind with its
present scientific knowledge can
change the course of evolution.

The Jan. 22 speaker, Prof. Sey
mour Papert of Massachusetts In
stitute of Technology, will discuss
"The Minds of Robots" to deter
mine to what extent machines
should become more human than
man.
The Jan. 29 speaker, Prof.
Kenneth Colby of Stanford's
Artificial Intelligence Project, who
once programmed a computer to
simulate a patient's nervous break
down, will discuss 'Psychiatry
and the Beliefs of Computers."
His studies have analyzed the
manner in which people modify
their actions by building up their
belief-systems.
Prof. Arbib's own lecture,
scheduled for Feb. 5, will examine
"The Metaphorical Brain." His
studies indicate that "there is no
reason why we should view man
as anything but a complicated
machine." He will compare com
puter functioning with current re
search in neurological brain
function.
The concluding speaker Feb.
12 is Biology Prof. Robert Sin
sheimer of California Institute of
Technology. In "The Brain of
Pooh" he will try to assess the
way in which mankind with its
present scientific knowledge can
change the course of evolution.
"Minds, Men, and Machines," a
study of computers and what they
mean to the future of mankind,
will be the subject of a five-lecture
series to be presented at Stanford
University beginning tonight.
The talks, open to the public,
will be given on consecutive Wed
nesdays at 7:45 p.m. in Room
100, the Physics Lecture Hall.
Lecture coordinator and one of
the speakers is Michael Arbib, as
sistant professor of electrical en
gineering at Stanford Electronics
Laboratories. The series is spon
sored by the University's Office of
Public Events.
As Prof. Arbib points out, "We
find that the existence of modern
electronic computers is forcing us
to re-evaluate our notion of the
machine, and try to see in what
way we can understand ourselves
better in seeking out the mechan
isms of the brain's action—but
also to understand the ways in
which man differs from any
machine now constructed."

The first speaker will be an
historian, Prof. Elton Morison of
Yale. Prof. Morison, whose spec
ialty is the impact of technology
upon American history, will di
scuss "From the First Industrial
Revolution to the Computer
Age—And Beyond."
Prof. Morison holds that since
machines are programmed by
humans, if man is unwise in his
decisions, he may subjugate him
self to a few rigid programs which
machines execute to carry out cer
tain of man's affairs. But it is pos
sible to program a machine to
serve individual needs as well as
those of man in general.
