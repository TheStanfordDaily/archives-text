# ACT French Farce
## 'Flea In Her Ear': Inventive Genius 
### GARY SCHMIDGALL 
The fine and precarious art of French
farce is alive and prospering at the American
Conservatory Theater (ACT) in San
Francisco. It takes a good bit of courage and
style—not to say gall—to mount a pleasur
able farce in our intense, humorless times,
but ACT has performed the feat with "A
Flea in Her Ear" by Georges Feydeau.
To set matters straight at the outset,
"Flea" is ACT's finest production since its
doors were opened for the first time with
Moliere's "Tartuffe." This is hardly a sur
pise, for both plays demand a sharp and snug
sense of ensemble. And ACT provides a per
fect blend of individual virtuosities (plus a
secret ingredient—elan, perhaps—for better
mileage) for the dainty engine of Feydeaus's
cheerful farce.
The dramatic combustion, to push on in
trepidly with the image, is spontaneous.
Farce is the ultimate test of a professional
repertory company's ESPRIT DE CORPS
and individual talent; ACT passes the test
triumphantly on both counts.

The success of the evening is easily
traceable to the inventive genius of the di
rector, Gower Champion. He does not so
much direct as choreograph "Flea"—and this
fits nicely with the sylization that infuses
the production (even the costumes and
make-up are delectably overdone).
Champion floods the stage with a torrent
of fine gestures and miniscule bits of clever
ness; his players never come to rest without
striking a pose. However, none of these
directorial fillips—and this is the mark of
genius—is extraneous or gratuitous. When we
meet them we are invariaby struck by their
Tightness. I search my memory in vain for an
honest-to-God cliche, although one thinks of
"cliche" and "farce" as the Siamese twins of
the theater.
I hesitate to impose upon the wholeness
of the production to note individual ex
cellences, yet I am forced to do so by
memories of Michael O'Sullivan's sid
e-splitting portrayal of a male secretary with
a speech impediment (O'Sullivan's return to
the company from Broadway is, itself, an

event worth celebrating.); Harry Frazier as
the portly, oddly-gaited Dr. Finache; Robert
Gerringer in the double role of the Innocent
Husband and the besotted porter; and Carol
Teitel as the sweetly peevish Jealous Wife.
Smaller Parts "Splendid"
A sense of justice requires mention of the
splendid smaller parts realized by Deborah
Sussel (The Maid), Ann Weldon (The
Spaniard).
The sets, conceived in black and white,
are fresh and appropriately stylish, from the
old-fashioned footlights to the Cheshire Cat
on the roof of the Pretty Pussy Hotel ("It
doesn't sound like a family place.") where
the rollicking second act spins forth. The
"flicker" effect which opens each act is also
fun.
Rather than rave (a word whose frequent
use in connection with critics I do not find
particularly flattering) further, I will close
with a perhaps rather imperious remark that,
for anyone who fancies himself a partisan of
the legitimate stage, attendance at "A Flea
in Her Ear" is obligatory.

Flea in Her Ear" by Georges Feydeau.
To set matters straight at the outset,
"Flea" is ACT's finest production since its
doors were opened for the first time with
Moliere's "Tartuffe." This is hardly a sur
pise, for both plays demand a sharp and snug
sense of ensemble. And ACT provides a per
fect blend of individual virtuosities (plus a
secret ingredient—elan, perhaps—for better
mileage) for the dainty engine of Feydeaus's
cheerful farce.
The dramatic combustion, to push on in
trepidly with the image, is spontaneous.
Farce is the ultimate test of a professional
repertory company's ESPRIT DE CORPS
and individual talent; ACT passes the test
triumphantly on both counts.

The success of the evening is easily
traceable to the inventive genius of the di
rector, Gower Champion. He does not so
much direct as choreograph "Flea"—and this
fits nicely with the sylization that infuses
the production (even the costumes and
make-up are delectably overdone).
Champion floods the stage with a torrent
of fine gestures and miniscule bits of clever
ness; his players never come to rest without
striking a pose. However, none of these
directorial fillips—and this is the mark of
genius—is extraneous or gratuitous. When we
meet them we are invariaby struck by their
Tightness. I search my memory in vain for an
honest-to-God cliche, although one thinks of
"cliche" and "farce" as the Siamese twins of
the theater.
I hesitate to impose upon the wholeness
of the production to note individual ex
cellences, yet I am forced to do so by
memories of Michael O'Sullivan's sid
e-splitting portrayal of a male secretary with
a speech impediment (O'Sullivan's return to
the company from Broadway is, itself, an

event worth celebrating.); Harry Frazier as
the portly, oddly-gaited Dr. Finache; Robert
Gerringer in the double role of the Innocent
Husband and the besotted porter; and Carol
Teitel as the sweetly peevish Jealous Wife.
Smaller Parts "Splendid"
A sense of justice requires mention of the
splendid smaller parts realized by Deborah
Sussel (The Maid), Ann Weldon (The
Spaniard).
The sets, conceived in black and white,
are fresh and appropriately stylish, from the
old-fashioned footlights to the Cheshire Cat
on the roof of the Pretty Pussy Hotel ("It
doesn't sound like a family place.") where
the rollicking second act spins forth. The
"flicker" effect which opens each act is also
fun.
Rather than rave (a word whose frequent
use in connection with critics I do not find
particularly flattering) further, I will close
with a perhaps rather imperious remark that,
for anyone who fancies himself a partisan of
the legitimate stage, attendance at "A Flea
in Her Ear" is obligatory.
The fine and precarious art of French
farce is alive and prospering at the American
Conservatory Theater (ACT) in San
Francisco. It takes a good bit of courage and
style—not to say gall—to mount a pleasur
able farce in our intense, humorless times,
but ACT has performed the feat with "A
Flea in Her Ear" by Georges Feydeau.
