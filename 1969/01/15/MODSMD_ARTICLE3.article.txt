# Vice Provost
## Packer To Leave Post 
### 
Vice Provost Herbert Packer,
43, Steering Committee chairman
of the Study of Education at
Stanford (SES) has requested to
be relieved of his administrative

duties by the end of the current
academic year.
Packer, a member of the Stan
ford law faculty since 1956, was
appointed vice-provost for aca
demic planning by President
Wallace Sterling in November,
1966, and soon afterwards was
named to his SES post. At that
time, he indicated he probably
would return to teaching and re
search when the Studn was com
pleted. Its reports are nofevbeing
distributed to the campus.
Author of a new book, "The
Limits of the Criminal Sanction,"
published this fall by Stanford
University Press, Packer intends to
resume his teaching and research
activities at the Law School.
His research plans include
studies of alternatives to the crim
inal sanction in fields such as
gambling and morals offenses, a
history of the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the Second Circuit,
and other studies of the relations
between law and social thought.
In addition, he expects to do
some speaking and writing on in

stitutional reform in higher educa
tion.
President Kenneth Pitzer said
of Packer: "Prof. Packer's skilled
and devoted service as chairman
of the SES Steering Committee
has provided a very solid basis for
faculty and students to appraise
and improve the Lniversity's edu
cational and extra-curricular pro
grams. 11
Student Body President Denis
Hayes also reacted to Packer's
announcement,
"Someone once remarked that
it is impossible for a man with an
active mind and a cutting intellect
not to occasionally wound some
one. Herb Packer has drawn a lot
of blood over the last couple
yearsâ€”most frequently from the
rigid necks of greying eminences
within the faculty.
Vice-President and Provost
Richard Lyman expressed dis
appointment in Packer's decision.
Packer was the original propon
ent and a principal architect of
the Senate of the Academic
Council, a new representative
body.
