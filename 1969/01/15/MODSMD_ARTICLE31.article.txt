## Two African Plays Premiere Tonight 
### 
Two African plays by Nigerian
playwright Joseph Okpaku, pre
sented by the Department of
Speech and Drama and The Jour
nal of the New African Literature
and the Arts, will open tonight in
the Little Theater at 8 p.m.
Both will receive their premier
stage performances at Stanford.
The plays will continue Jan. 17,
18, 22, 23, 24, and 25.
BBC prize-winning play, "The
Virtues of Adultery," subtitled
"an amusing tragedy," is the
drama of a relationship between
two friends caught in the sad con
sequences of a joke that went too
far.
Martin Esslin calls the play "a
rollicking farce in a really great
tradition which shows how human
we all are." British playwright,
Willis Hall, says it "sustains inter

est from start to finish—amusing
throughout—very very funny in
deed."
Clothes Are Authentic
Part of the dialogue is in Niger
ian English. Costumes are authen
tic Nigerian clothing and music
comes from both Nigeria and
South Africa. The play was pro
duced in London by BBC radio
last year.
"The Silhouette of God" is a
narrative pantomime concerning
two American missionaries who
brought civilization and Christian
ity to Nigeria by such methods as
teaching children who had never
seen snow to sing "I'm Dreaming
of a White Christmas." Their ef
forts were aided by sympathetic
Americans who sent over 20 tons
of bleach for Christmas.
Appearing in "The Virtues of

Adultery" will be Pieter Van Niel,
Alberette Chapelle, Ivan Mc-
Donald, Rose Mendez and Tony
Mendez. The director is Lee
Miller. Susanne Barber, Alberette
Chapelle, Andrea Hine, Ivan
McDonald and Sandra Richards
are in "The Silhouette of God,"
which is directed by Donald
Currie.
