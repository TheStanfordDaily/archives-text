# SDS Disrupts Board Over Asian Relations
## 
### JACK KAPLAN 
About 50 students, including
many members of Students for a
Democratic Society (SDS), phys
ically broke up a Board of Trus
tees luncheon at the faculty club
yesterday afternoon at 2:25. The
Trustees dispersed, unharmed, but
were unable to finish the meeting.
The students were protesting
University involvement with the
defense department and the Viet
Nam war.
In a position paper publicizing
the protest, SDS demanded that
three trustees (Roger Lewis, pres
ident of General Dynamics Corp.,
William Hewlett, president of
Hewlett-Packard Corp., and Tom
Jones, president of Northrop
Corp.) resign either from the
Board or from positions they hold
in defense-related industries, and
that the Stanford Research Insti
tute (SRI) cease participation in
certain military research projects.
Protesters were trying to force an
open trustee meeting in which
they could discuss their demands.
Four students attended trustee
committee sessions earlier in the
day at the board's invitation.
These included Student Body
President Denis Hayes; Michael
Menke, a steering committee
member of the Study of Educa
tion at Stanford; Thomas
Grissom, graduate student in edu
cation; and Phil Taubman, associ
ate editor of The Stanford Daily.
Bowman Gathering
Students began to gather at the
Bowman Alumni House, site of
the scheduled Board of Trustee
meeting, at 12:30. They were told
by a Bowman staff member that
the Trustees were not yet in the
Board room, but were having
lunch at the nearby faculty club.

While most students discussed
what tactics to use, others entered
the Board room from its outside
door.
Students then discussed alter
native plans of action, reaching no
consensus. Some suggested staying
until the demands were met.
Associate Dean Willard Wyman
suggested that four or five stu
dents request to be allowed to
attend the meeting. Most of the
students, though, wanted a com
pletely open meeting at Dinkel
spiel or the Tresidder lounge.
Braunstein Talks
Wyman then arranged to have
LASSU Speaker Yale Braunstein
address the Trsutees. Braunstein
requested an open meeting but,
according to Wyman, he was "not
as clear as he can be, and his sug
gestion was not taken seriously."
Because of the student protest,
the trustees decided to remain in
the lunchroom of the Faculty
Club and hold the meeting there.
At about 2:00, some students
managed to enter the Faculty
Club. The protesters gathered out
side the room where the Trustees
were meeting.
Dean Wyman informed the stu
dents that a faculty advisory com
mittee, had declared the students
in violation of University regula
tions, and began asking the pro
testers for their names. Many stu
dents gave false names, according
to Wyman. The list of over 30
names will be released to the jud
icial council.
Scuffle
At one point a brief scuffle
broke out between one of the pro
testers and a Faculty Club waiter.
A student set off a fire alarm in
the club.

At 2:15, most of the pro
testers, came into the club to
"decide collectively" whether to
leave or stay.
Some students thought that
the protesters had made their
point by having their names taken
and should leave the building. But
the discussion was interrupted
suddenly when the door to the
Trustees' dining room was flung
open from the inside by a student
demonstrator who had reportedly
entered through a door on the
courtyard side of the room.
Many of the students who had
been seated during the discussion
jumped up and rushed toward the
door. In the lunchroom members
of the Trustees also came to the
door to block students.
Shouts Heard
During the ensuing scuffle, a
demonstrater shouted, "Keep
your hands off me, baby, or I'll
smash you in the face," to an ad
ministrator. Another, demonstra
ter shouted, "What is your right
to be here, punk?" to a Trustee.
As the students entered the
dining room, the Trustees left.
One or two Trustees remained for
a few minutes, but refused to de
bate with the demonstrators.
In the confusion, students ob
tained many documents including
the meeting's agenda.
Gradually the students began
leaving.
Position Paper
The protest took most faculty,
administrators, and newsmen by
surprise. It was publicized late
yesterday morning through the
SDS position paper. Last night the
paper re-stipulating the demand
that Stanford and its Trustees get
out of involvements in Southeast
Asia, was circulated for signatures
in dorms.
Several members of a faculty
advisory group on campus disrup
tion observed the demonstration.
After consulting with them, Presi
dent Pitzer said disciplinary pro
ceedings would be initiated by the
Dean of Students Joel Smith.
Under rules promulgated this
fall with faculty concurrence, it is
a violation of campus policy for a
member of the faculty, staff or
student body to prevent or dis
rupt the effective carrying out of
a university function.
Demands Reiterated
SDS's other demands, many of
them reiterations of demands
made last fall, include:
"That Stanford Research Insti
tute cease all chemical and biolog
ical warfare studies now and in
the future;
"That all faculty resign from
Defense Department boards, and
that no faculty be hired who serve
on Department boards;
"That the SRI Counterin
surgency Office in Thailand be
discontinued;
"That development of 'people
sniffers,' presently being con
ducted at SRI, be discontinued.

they could discuss their demands.
Four students attended trustee
committee sessions earlier in the
day at the board's invitation.
These included Student Body
President Denis Hayes; Michael
Menke, a steering committee
member of the Study of Educa
tion at Stanford; Thomas
Grissom, graduate student in edu
cation; and Phil Taubman, associ
ate editor of The Stanford Daily.
Bowman Gathering
Students began to gather at the
Bowman Alumni House, site of
the scheduled Board of Trustee
meeting, at 12:30. They were told
by a Bowman staff member that
the Trustees were not yet in the
Board room, but were having
lunch at the nearby faculty club.

While most students discussed
what tactics to use, others entered
the Board room from its outside
door.
Students then discussed alter
native plans of action, reaching no
consensus. Some suggested staying
until the demands were met.
Associate Dean Willard Wyman
suggested that four or five stu
dents request to be allowed to
attend the meeting. Most of the
students, though, wanted a com
pletely open meeting at Dinkel
spiel or the Tresidder lounge.
Braunstein Talks
Wyman then arranged to have
LASSU Speaker Yale Braunstein
address the Trsutees. Braunstein
requested an open meeting but,
according to Wyman, he was "not
as clear as he can be, and his sug
gestion was not taken seriously."
Because of the student protest,
the trustees decided to remain in
the lunchroom of the Faculty
Club and hold the meeting there.
At about 2:00, some students
managed to enter the Faculty
Club. The protesters gathered out
side the room where the Trustees
were meeting.
Dean Wyman informed the stu
dents that a faculty advisory com
mittee, had declared the students
in violation of University regula
tions, and began asking the pro
testers for their names. Many stu
dents gave false names, according
to Wyman. The list of over 30
names will be released to the jud
icial council.
Scuffle
At one point a brief scuffle
broke out between one of the pro
testers and a Faculty Club waiter.
A student set off a fire alarm in
the club.

At 2:15, most of the pro
testers, came into the club to
"decide collectively" whether to
leave or stay.
Some students thought that
the protesters had made their
point by having their names taken
and should leave the building. But
the discussion was interrupted
suddenly when the door to the
Trustees' dining room was flung
open from the inside by a student
demonstrator who had reportedly
entered through a door on the
courtyard side of the room.
Many of the students who had
been seated during the discussion
jumped up and rushed toward the
door. In the lunchroom members
of the Trustees also came to the
door to block students.
Shouts Heard
During the ensuing scuffle, a
demonstrater shouted, "Keep
your hands off me, baby, or I'll
smash you in the face," to an ad
ministrator. Another, demonstra
ter shouted, "What is your right
to be here, punk?" to a Trustee.
As the students entered the
dining room, the Trustees left.
One or two Trustees remained for
a few minutes, but refused to de
bate with the demonstrators.
In the confusion, students ob
tained many documents including
the meeting's agenda.
Gradually the students began
leaving.
Position Paper
The protest took most faculty,
administrators, and newsmen by
surprise. It was publicized late
yesterday morning through the
SDS position paper. Last night the
paper re-stipulating the demand
that Stanford and its Trustees get
out of involvements in Southeast
Asia, was circulated for signatures
in dorms.
Several members of a faculty
advisory group on campus disrup
tion observed the demonstration.
After consulting with them, Presi
dent Pitzer said disciplinary pro
ceedings would be initiated by the
Dean of Students Joel Smith.
Under rules promulgated this
fall with faculty concurrence, it is
a violation of campus policy for a
member of the faculty, staff or
student body to prevent or dis
rupt the effective carrying out of
a university function.
Demands Reiterated
SDS's other demands, many of
them reiterations of demands
made last fall, include:
"That Stanford Research Insti
tute cease all chemical and biolog
ical warfare studies now and in
the future;
"That all faculty resign from
Defense Department boards, and
that no faculty be hired who serve
on Department boards;
"That the SRI Counterin
surgency Office in Thailand be
discontinued;
"That development of 'people
sniffers,' presently being con
ducted at SRI, be discontinued.

until the demands were met.
Associate Dean Willard Wyman
suggested that four or five stu
dents request to be allowed to
attend the meeting. Most of the
students, though, wanted a com
pletely open meeting at Dinkel
spiel or the Tresidder lounge.
Braunstein Talks
Wyman then arranged to have
LASSU Speaker Yale Braunstein
address the Trsutees. Braunstein
requested an open meeting but,
according to Wyman, he was "not
as clear as he can be, and his sug
gestion was not taken seriously."
Because of the student protest,
the trustees decided to remain in
the lunchroom of the Faculty
Club and hold the meeting there.
At about 2:00, some students
managed to enter the Faculty
Club. The protesters gathered out
side the room where the Trustees
were meeting.
Dean Wyman informed the stu
dents that a faculty advisory com
mittee, had declared the students
in violation of University regula
tions, and began asking the pro
testers for their names. Many stu
dents gave false names, according
to Wyman. The list of over 30
names will be released to the jud
icial council.
Scuffle
At one point a brief scuffle
broke out between one of the pro
testers and a Faculty Club waiter.
A student set off a fire alarm in
the club.

At 2:15, most of the pro
testers, came into the club to
"decide collectively" whether to
leave or stay.
Some students thought that
the protesters had made their
point by having their names taken
and should leave the building. But
the discussion was interrupted
suddenly when the door to the
Trustees' dining room was flung
open from the inside by a student
demonstrator who had reportedly
entered through a door on the
courtyard side of the room.
Many of the students who had
been seated during the discussion
jumped up and rushed toward the
door. In the lunchroom members
of the Trustees also came to the
door to block students.
Shouts Heard
During the ensuing scuffle, a
demonstrater shouted, "Keep
your hands off me, baby, or I'll
smash you in the face," to an ad
ministrator. Another, demonstra
ter shouted, "What is your right
to be here, punk?" to a Trustee.
As the students entered the
dining room, the Trustees left.
One or two Trustees remained for
a few minutes, but refused to de
bate with the demonstrators.
In the confusion, students ob
tained many documents including
the meeting's agenda.
Gradually the students began
leaving.
Position Paper
The protest took most faculty,
administrators, and newsmen by
surprise. It was publicized late
yesterday morning through the
SDS position paper. Last night the
paper re-stipulating the demand
that Stanford and its Trustees get
out of involvements in Southeast
Asia, was circulated for signatures
in dorms.
Several members of a faculty
advisory group on campus disrup
tion observed the demonstration.
After consulting with them, Presi
dent Pitzer said disciplinary pro
ceedings would be initiated by the
Dean of Students Joel Smith.
Under rules promulgated this
fall with faculty concurrence, it is
a violation of campus policy for a
member of the faculty, staff or
student body to prevent or dis
rupt the effective carrying out of
a university function.
Demands Reiterated
SDS's other demands, many of
them reiterations of demands
made last fall, include:
"That Stanford Research Insti
tute cease all chemical and biolog
ical warfare studies now and in
the future;
"That all faculty resign from
Defense Department boards, and
that no faculty be hired who serve
on Department boards;
"That the SRI Counterin
surgency Office in Thailand be
discontinued;
"That development of 'people
sniffers,' presently being con
ducted at SRI, be discontinued.

THE SCENE INSlDE—lnside the dining room in the Faculty Club
where they were meeting, Trustees and Provost Richard Lyman
discuss the actions of students outside the room who were asking to
talk to them as two students enter. Other students, mainly members
of the Students for a Democratic Society, eventually gained entrance
to the room, but the Trustees left. The students were reiterating de
mands made last fall calling for the University and those associated
with it to sever ties in Southeast Asia. Yesterday they singled out
three Trustees and called for their resignation either from the Board
or from the firms which the students asserted were contributing to
oppression in Vietnam and elsewhere.
About 50 students, including
many members of Students for a
Democratic Society (SDS), phys
ically broke up a Board of Trus
tees luncheon at the faculty club
yesterday afternoon at 2:25. The
Trustees dispersed, unharmed, but
were unable to finish the meeting.
The students were protesting
University involvement with the
defense department and the Viet
Nam war.
In a position paper publicizing
the protest, SDS demanded that
three trustees (Roger Lewis, pres
ident of General Dynamics Corp.,
William Hewlett, president of
Hewlett-Packard Corp., and Tom
Jones, president of Northrop
Corp.) resign either from the
Board or from positions they hold
in defense-related industries, and
that the Stanford Research Insti
tute (SRI) cease participation in
certain military research projects.
Protesters were trying to force an
open trustee meeting in which
they could discuss their demands.
Four students attended trustee
committee sessions earlier in the
day at the board's invitation.
These included Student Body
President Denis Hayes; Michael
Menke, a steering committee
member of the Study of Educa
tion at Stanford; Thomas
Grissom, graduate student in edu
cation; and Phil Taubman, associ
ate editor of The Stanford Daily.
Bowman Gathering
Students began to gather at the
Bowman Alumni House, site of
the scheduled Board of Trustee
meeting, at 12:30. They were told
by a Bowman staff member that
the Trustees were not yet in the
Board room, but were having
lunch at the nearby faculty club.

While most students discussed
what tactics to use, others entered
the Board room from its outside
door.
Students then discussed alter
native plans of action, reaching no
consensus. Some suggested staying
until the demands were met.
Associate Dean Willard Wyman
suggested that four or five stu
