# New Cabinet To Meet
## 
### 
The ASSU Cabinet, in its first
meeting this afternoon, will join
the growing number of campus
bodies who are discussing with the
student participation in the dis
cussion of SES proposals.
President Denis Hayes indica
ted yesterday that the advisory
group's agenda is always flexible,
but that student concern with
SES and Trustee selection are sure
to bring these topics up for discus
sion.
The 20-member group, which
will be meeting each Wednesday
in Tresidder room 267, was
named earlier this quarter by
Hayes to provide "some sort of
consensual outlook" to facilitate
the operation of student govern
ment.
The cabinet might become a
broadly based group for action,
should the representatives of the
various student constituencies
reach agreement on the topics. At

the present time, however, Hayes
sees the body's main purpose as
one of sampling opinion.
Members on the cabinet and
their constituencies are: Vic Von
Schlegell, vice president; Yale
Braunstein, speaker of LASSU;
Soo B orson Wright, medical
school; Ron Wilton Business
school; Dave McMullan, education
school; Martine Bidgoff, law
school; W. M. Hafferty, engineer
ing school; Barry Askinas, Gradu
ate Students Association; Andy
Moss, A.F.T. local; Doug
Chandler, Interfraternity Council;
Erik Larson, head sponsor; Larry
Levin, Interclub Council; Nate
Kritman, BSU; Dan Snell, The
Daily, Rod Levine, Committee on
Relations with Academic Senate;
Tim Coburn, SDS; and Phil
Taubman, Jeff Kane, and Richard
Such from the Student Conduct
Legislative Council.
