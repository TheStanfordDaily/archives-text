# Endowment Ends
## SRT Faces Financial, Administrative Crisis 
### JENNY MATTHEWS 
The Stanford Repertory Theater (SRT) may be faced
with major financial difficulties at the end of this season
when the 1965 Rockefeller Grant which initiated the
company runs out.
Aggravated by inadequate facilities, a two-year vacan
cy at the head of the drama department, and recent
audience unpopularity, the problems confronting SRT,
in the words of one member, "are going to force some
decisions as to whether SRT can even continue in its
present state."
SRT was originally set up by the Rockefeller
endowment as an independent professional repertory
theater with 15 professional actors.
Rapid depletion of the initial grant, as well as the
problem of Stanford drama students not having enough
stage opportunities forced the company to reduce its
number of professional actors each year and increase
integration with the University's School of Humanities
and Sciences.
Financial Assistance
Added financial assistance allocated by the Board of
Trustees, however, did not alleviate monetary problems.
Since the last of the Rockefeller grant will be gone by
the end of this season, the problem of inadequate funds
is expected to intensify.
Commenting on the present situation, one SRT
member stated bleakly, "We need a huge budget which
will not come from the University, and there is no
reason to think that it will. It is silly to talk in the
figures that SRT needs to a university plagued with
rising costs and federal spending cutbacks."
The operation is partially financed by box office
income, but as explained by SRT's business manager,
Judy Burgess, "the price of tickets would have to be
raised to prohibitive levels in order for the company to
break even.
"In general, audience revenue never pays for a
theater. It almost always has to find a subsidy. But
needed support from outside the University is unlikely
at the moment."
5 Professionals ..
Last year there remained only five professional actors
in the company who doubled as teachers in the drama
department's "Master of Fine Arts" program (MFA).
This professional training program gives students
working for their masters degrees a chance to gain
experience in the fields of acting, directing, design, and

technical theater by taking a major role in SRT's
productions.
This year, however, there is only one professional
actor in the program.
"As a result," commented one graduate drama
student, "the original idea of the professional company
is virtually nonexistent."
According to Tom Stockfisch, a graduate student in
the drama school's Ph.D. program, however, "it is not
simply a question of having the money to pay the
salaries of professional actors.
Money Needed
"It is also a question of having the money to do
thorough and professional stage productions that would
motivate outstanding people to work here."
SRT, in fact, has been accused in recent years of a
declining production quality.
"No one can expect an organization," continued
Stockfisch, "to be catapulted from a yearly budget of
hundreds of thousands of dollars and still produce
theater comparable to its previous productions."
Several critics of SRT, however, feel that the
company's quality is also handicapped this year by a
selection of plays that isn't cognizant of audience
appeal.
"This year's choice of plays," griped one MFA
candidate, "is ridiculous. T!ie plays were picked by the
four individual directors, and there was no over-all view
or analysis of audience interest in the selection of the
four."
Play Choices
Others feel that the directors don't seem to know
what the people want and how many people want it.
"Plays are often chosen by academicians," Stockfisch
explained, "who are sometimes too taken with the
historic significance of the play. Such choices, however,
no longer speak to the people of today.
Robert Morgan, third year MFA student, who is
directing SRT's upcoming production, "The Queen and
the Rebels," admits, "the season is possibly too heavy,"
but contends, "there isn't a play on the bill that isn't
worth doing."
"There is something unique about each one," Morgan
continued, "which each director must seek out and
emphasize."
Morgan agreed that perhaps the productions
"couldn't all be used in the professional theater" which

is forced to rely heavily on box office incomes instead of
university-type subsidy, but emphasized that "SRT's
first concern is with the student—or should be."
"At SRT, I've been given fantastic exposure to a lot
of things I might not be able to experiment with later in
the professional theater, and I've received a fantastic
theatrical education."
One major production problem that almost everyone
associated with SRT seems to agree upon is the lack of
an adequate theater on campus for the express purpose
of putting on plays.
"Memorial Auditorium," explained Judy Burgess, "is
the best theater available to SRT. It was designed,
however, as an all-purpose school auditorium. It is,
therefore, very unsatisfactory for putting on plays. The
acoustics are terrible."
Too Small
The Little Theater and the Nitery, on the other hand,
are too small to accommodate the audience of a major
SRT production.
A major handicap for the last two years in the
repertory theater's acquisiton of funds and facilities has
been the absence of the head of the drama department.
Robert Loper, the last department head, was forced
to resign in 1967 because of health reasons.
According to Stephen Book, second year MFA
student and co-president of the "Mafia," "Things are
getting left by the wayside because there is no 'dictator'
running the operation. A drama organization simply
can't be run by a committee."
"Long-term hiring of faculty, however, can't be done
without a chairman. Major policies can't even be thought
about before a new chairman is selected."
Administrative Problems
"People outside the drama department," Book
emphasized finally, "don't see the real administrative
problems at hand. They aren't aware of the split in the
problems that have confronted SRT. At first, the
students were unhappy with the set-up of fifteen
professionals because there were not enough stage
opportunities for them . . .
"So just as we reached a satisfactory system, the
problem of not having a department head took over."
Whether the current financial and administrative
problems will cause SRT to alter its present system or to
discontinue remains to be seen. The situation is perhaps
best described by Stockfisch's statement, "there is no
simple solution."

SRT FlGURES—Visiting Director Michael Harry (top) from England
comments on the problems and future of the Stanford Repertory
Theater. From a different perspective, second-year master of fine arts
candidate Stephen Book views the organization, which stands to lose
its endowment at the end of the season.
The Stanford Repertory Theater (SRT) may be faced
with major financial difficulties at the end of this season
when the 1965 Rockefeller Grant which initiated the
company runs out.
Aggravated by inadequate facilities, a two-year vacan
cy at the head of the drama department, and recent
audience unpopularity, the problems confronting SRT,
in the words of one member, "are going to force some
decisions as to whether SRT can even continue in its
present state."
SRT was originally set up by the Rockefeller
endowment as an independent professional repertory
theater with 15 professional actors.
Rapid depletion of the initial grant, as well as the
problem of Stanford drama students not having enough
stage opportunities forced the company to reduce its
number of professional actors each year and increase
integration with the University's School of Humanities
and Sciences.
Financial Assistance
Added financial assistance allocated by the Board of
Trustees, however, did not alleviate monetary problems.
Since the last of the Rockefeller grant will be gone by
the end of this season, the problem of inadequate funds
is expected to intensify.
Commenting on the present situation, one SRT
member stated bleakly, "We need a huge budget which
will not come from the University, and there is no
reason to think that it will. It is silly to talk in the
figures that SRT needs to a university plagued with
rising costs and federal spending cutbacks."
The operation is partially financed by box office
income, but as explained by SRT's business manager,
Judy Burgess, "the price of tickets would have to be
raised to prohibitive levels in order for the company to
break even.
"In general, audience revenue never pays for a
theater. It almost always has to find a subsidy. But
needed support from outside the University is unlikely
at the moment."
5 Professionals ..
Last year there remained only five professional actors
in the company who doubled as teachers in the drama
department's "Master of Fine Arts" program (MFA).
This professional training program gives students
working for their masters degrees a chance to gain
experience in the fields of acting, directing, design, and

technical theater by taking a major role in SRT's
productions.
This year, however, there is only one professional
actor in the program.
"As a result," commented one graduate drama
student, "the original idea of the professional company
is virtually nonexistent."
According to Tom Stockfisch, a graduate student in
the drama school's Ph.D. program, however, "it is not
simply a question of having the money to pay the
salaries of professional actors.
Money Needed
"It is also a question of having the money to do
thorough and professional stage productions that would
motivate outstanding people to work here."
SRT, in fact, has been accused in recent years of a
declining production quality.
"No one can expect an organization," continued
Stockfisch, "to be catapulted from a yearly budget of
hundreds of thousands of dollars and still produce
theater comparable to its previous productions."
Several critics of SRT, however, feel that the
company's quality is also handicapped this year by a
selection of plays that isn't cognizant of audience
appeal.
"This year's choice of plays," griped one MFA
candidate, "is ridiculous. T!ie plays were picked by the
four individual directors, and there was no over-all view
or analysis of audience interest in the selection of the
four."
Play Choices
Others feel that the directors don't seem to know
what the people want and how many people want it.
"Plays are often chosen by academicians," Stockfisch
explained, "who are sometimes too taken with the
historic significance of the play. Such choices, however,
no longer speak to the people of today.
Robert Morgan, third year MFA student, who is
directing SRT's upcoming production, "The Queen and
the Rebels," admits, "the season is possibly too heavy,"
but contends, "there isn't a play on the bill that isn't
worth doing."
"There is something unique about each one," Morgan
continued, "which each director must seek out and
emphasize."
Morgan agreed that perhaps the productions
"couldn't all be used in the professional theater" which

is forced to rely heavily on box office incomes instead of
university-type subsidy, but emphasized that "SRT's
first concern is with the student—or should be."
"At SRT, I've been given fantastic exposure to a lot
of things I might not be able to experiment with later in
the professional theater, and I've received a fantastic
theatrical education."
One major production problem that almost everyone
associated with SRT seems to agree upon is the lack of
an adequate theater on campus for the express purpose
of putting on plays.
"Memorial Auditorium," explained Judy Burgess, "is
the best theater available to SRT. It was designed,
however, as an all-purpose school auditorium. It is,
therefore, very unsatisfactory for putting on plays. The
acoustics are terrible."
Too Small
The Little Theater and the Nitery, on the other hand,
are too small to accommodate the audience of a major
SRT production.
A major handicap for the last two years in the
repertory theater's acquisiton of funds and facilities has
been the absence of the head of the drama department.
Robert Loper, the last department head, was forced
to resign in 1967 because of health reasons.
According to Stephen Book, second year MFA
student and co-president of the "Mafia," "Things are
getting left by the wayside because there is no 'dictator'
running the operation. A drama organization simply
can't be run by a committee."
"Long-term hiring of faculty, however, can't be done
without a chairman. Major policies can't even be thought
about before a new chairman is selected."
Administrative Problems
"People outside the drama department," Book
emphasized finally, "don't see the real administrative
problems at hand. They aren't aware of the split in the
problems that have confronted SRT. At first, the
students were unhappy with the set-up of fifteen
professionals because there were not enough stage
opportunities for them . . .
"So just as we reached a satisfactory system, the
problem of not having a department head took over."
Whether the current financial and administrative
problems will cause SRT to alter its present system or to
discontinue remains to be seen. The situation is perhaps
best described by Stockfisch's statement, "there is no
simple solution."

SRT FlGURES—Visiting Director Michael Harry (top) from England
comments on the problems and future of the Stanford Repertory
Theater. From a different perspective, second-year master of fine arts
candidate Stephen Book views the organization, which stands to lose
its endowment at the end of the season.
The Stanford Repertory Theater (SRT) may be faced
with major financial difficulties at the end of this season
when the 1965 Rockefeller Grant which initiated the
company runs out.
Aggravated by inadequate facilities, a two-year vacan
cy at the head of the drama department, and recent
audience unpopularity, the problems confronting SRT,
in the words of one member, "are going to force some
decisions as to whether SRT can even continue in its
present state."
SRT was originally set up by the Rockefeller
endowment as an independent professional repertory
theater with 15 professional actors.
Rapid depletion of the initial grant, as well as the
problem of Stanford drama students not having enough
stage opportunities forced the company to reduce its
number of professional actors each year and increase
integration with the University's School of Humanities
and Sciences.
Financial Assistance
Added financial assistance allocated by the Board of
Trustees, however, did not alleviate monetary problems.
Since the last of the Rockefeller grant will be gone by
the end of this season, the problem of inadequate funds
is expected to intensify.
Commenting on the present situation, one SRT
member stated bleakly, "We need a huge budget which
will not come from the University, and there is no
reason to think that it will. It is silly to talk in the
figures that SRT needs to a university plagued with
rising costs and federal spending cutbacks."
The operation is partially financed by box office
income, but as explained by SRT's business manager,
Judy Burgess, "the price of tickets would have to be
raised to prohibitive levels in order for the company to
break even.
"In general, audience revenue never pays for a
theater. It almost always has to find a subsidy. But
needed support from outside the University is unlikely
at the moment."
5 Professionals ..
Last year there remained only five professional actors
in the company who doubled as teachers in the drama
department's "Master of Fine Arts" program (MFA).
This professional training program gives students
working for their masters degrees a chance to gain
experience in the fields of acting, directing, design, and

technical theater by taking a major role in SRT's
productions.
This year, however, there is only one professional
actor in the program.
"As a result," commented one graduate drama
student, "the original idea of the professional company
is virtually nonexistent."
According to Tom Stockfisch, a graduate student in
the drama school's Ph.D. program, however, "it is not
simply a question of having the money to pay the
salaries of professional actors.
Money Needed
"It is also a question of having the money to do
thorough and professional stage productions that would
motivate outstanding people to work here."
SRT, in fact, has been accused in recent years of a
declining production quality.
"No one can expect an organization," continued
Stockfisch, "to be catapulted from a yearly budget of
hundreds of thousands of dollars and still produce
theater comparable to its previous productions."
Several critics of SRT, however, feel that the
company's quality is also handicapped this year by a
selection of plays that isn't cognizant of audience
appeal.
"This year's choice of plays," griped one MFA
candidate, "is ridiculous. T!ie plays were picked by the
four individual directors, and there was no over-all view
or analysis of audience interest in the selection of the
four."
Play Choices
Others feel that the directors don't seem to know
what the people want and how many people want it.
"Plays are often chosen by academicians," Stockfisch
explained, "who are sometimes too taken with the
historic significance of the play. Such choices, however,
no longer speak to the people of today.
Robert Morgan, third year MFA student, who is
directing SRT's upcoming production, "The Queen and
the Rebels," admits, "the season is possibly too heavy,"
but contends, "there isn't a play on the bill that isn't
worth doing."
"There is something unique about each one," Morgan
continued, "which each director must seek out and
emphasize."
Morgan agreed that perhaps the productions
"couldn't all be used in the professional theater" which

is forced to rely heavily on box office incomes instead of
university-type subsidy, but emphasized that "SRT's
first concern is with the student—or should be."
"At SRT, I've been given fantastic exposure to a lot
of things I might not be able to experiment with later in
the professional theater, and I've received a fantastic
theatrical education."
One major production problem that almost everyone
associated with SRT seems to agree upon is the lack of
an adequate theater on campus for the express purpose
of putting on plays.
"Memorial Auditorium," explained Judy Burgess, "is
the best theater available to SRT. It was designed,
however, as an all-purpose school auditorium. It is,
therefore, very unsatisfactory for putting on plays. The
acoustics are terrible."
Too Small
The Little Theater and the Nitery, on the other hand,
are too small to accommodate the audience of a major
SRT production.
A major handicap for the last two years in the
repertory theater's acquisiton of funds and facilities has
been the absence of the head of the drama department.
Robert Loper, the last department head, was forced
to resign in 1967 because of health reasons.
According to Stephen Book, second year MFA
student and co-president of the "Mafia," "Things are
getting left by the wayside because there is no 'dictator'
running the operation. A drama organization simply
can't be run by a committee."
"Long-term hiring of faculty, however, can't be done
without a chairman. Major policies can't even be thought
about before a new chairman is selected."
Administrative Problems
"People outside the drama department," Book
emphasized finally, "don't see the real administrative
problems at hand. They aren't aware of the split in the
problems that have confronted SRT. At first, the
students were unhappy with the set-up of fifteen
professionals because there were not enough stage
opportunities for them . . .
