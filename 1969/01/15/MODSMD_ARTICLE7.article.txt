### PAUL RUPERT 
As a Christmas gift to us all, President-elect Nixon
appointed trustee-industrialist David Packard to help run
the nation's monstrous engine of war. To continue the
New Year with Stanford glory, Governor Reagan
appointed trustee-industrialist Dean Watkins to the U. of
California Board of Regents. And yesterday SDS'ers and
others tried to join the trustees for lunch to ask some
questions about what was going on behind those closed
doors.
It is safe to predict that the trustees here and else
where will soon be under great pressure from students who
want some power or who just want to listen in to meet
ings. I would like to try to dispel some of the questions
that will flow from the inevitable encounters.
The Stanford trustees are busy, wealthy men and
women who serve long hours for no pay not even ex
penses. Like Columbia, which I will have more to say
about in a moment, there are no educators, taculty or
students on the board. Meetings are closed and private.
Those of us who are affected by the basic decisions they
make have little to say in the making. Consequently,
many people don't trust the trustees.

Some students feel that lor all we know, the trustees
may be using the University and its resources— like SRI,
its technical schools and Law School and Business
school—to further the ends of their personal corpora
tions in the Stanford Industrial park and elsewhere. Per
haps the selfless service of these men isn't really so
selfless after all. It just might be that for these men the
university is not an end in itself, but a means to their
own ends; students are not really to be educated and
liberated, but trained.
Now I know this must sound very suspicious of me.
Perhaps a few years ago I might have been more
generous. But among other things some good research of
the Columbia trustees pointed out some very business
like uses of the university by a similar group of generous
men. Ever since then, I have felt that the burden of
proof lay with the trustees to dispel any charges of miss
use of the university.
Industrial Park
At Columbia it seems that the University was (and is)
buying up blocks of Harlem in order to build an
industrial park modelled on our very own: Columbia
trustees woud do the building, the financing and a fair

part of the occupying of said park. The use of the uni
versity to buy land and then sell it at a loss to the
trustees for their own purposes was not uncommon. The
solicitation and distribution of funds to those areas and
departments which were most relevant to the trustees
personnel and research needs was harder to pin down,
but discernible. These abuses and many more were un
covered by NACLA (North American Congress on Latin
America), a research group in New York whose long
work was aided by the "liberation" of President Kirk's
files during the spring demonstration. The students felt
that "open covenants openly arrived at" should prevail:
basic decisions within the university must not be secret.
The tactics and the truth of the Columbia accusations
aside,what does such an analysis say to us? It seems to
me that we could quite rightly make similar accusations
here. To what extent does SRI research benefit the
trustees' corporations? How much of the phenomenal
success of the Industrial park corporations depends on
Stanford professors' consultations? To what extent do
the trustees purposely or inadvertently solicit funds for
the technical and scientific fields more energetically than
for thp liberal arts or the library?

basic decisions within the university must not be secret.
The tactics and the truth of the Columbia accusations
aside,what does such an analysis say to us? It seems to
me that we could quite rightly make similar accusations
here. To what extent does SRI research benefit the
trustees' corporations? How much of the phenomenal
success of the Industrial park corporations depends on
Stanford professors' consultations? To what extent do
the trustees purposely or inadvertently solicit funds for
the technical and scientific fields more energetically than
for thp liberal arts or the library?
As a Christmas gift to us all, President-elect Nixon
appointed trustee-industrialist David Packard to help run
the nation's monstrous engine of war. To continue the
New Year with Stanford glory, Governor Reagan
appointed trustee-industrialist Dean Watkins to the U. of
California Board of Regents. And yesterday SDS'ers and
others tried to join the trustees for lunch to ask some
questions about what was going on behind those closed
doors.
It is safe to predict that the trustees here and else
where will soon be under great pressure from students who
want some power or who just want to listen in to meet
ings. I would like to try to dispel some of the questions
that will flow from the inevitable encounters.
The Stanford trustees are busy, wealthy men and
women who serve long hours for no pay not even ex
penses. Like Columbia, which I will have more to say
about in a moment, there are no educators, taculty or
students on the board. Meetings are closed and private.
Those of us who are affected by the basic decisions they
make have little to say in the making. Consequently,
many people don't trust the trustees.

Some students feel that lor all we know, the trustees
may be using the University and its resources— like SRI,
its technical schools and Law School and Business
school—to further the ends of their personal corpora
tions in the Stanford Industrial park and elsewhere. Per
haps the selfless service of these men isn't really so
selfless after all. It just might be that for these men the
university is not an end in itself, but a means to their
own ends; students are not really to be educated and
liberated, but trained.
Now I know this must sound very suspicious of me.
Perhaps a few years ago I might have been more
generous. But among other things some good research of
the Columbia trustees pointed out some very business
like uses of the university by a similar group of generous
men. Ever since then, I have felt that the burden of
proof lay with the trustees to dispel any charges of miss
use of the university.
Industrial Park
At Columbia it seems that the University was (and is)
buying up blocks of Harlem in order to build an
industrial park modelled on our very own: Columbia
trustees woud do the building, the financing and a fair

part of the occupying of said park. The use of the uni
versity to buy land and then sell it at a loss to the
trustees for their own purposes was not uncommon. The
solicitation and distribution of funds to those areas and
departments which were most relevant to the trustees
personnel and research needs was harder to pin down,
but discernible. These abuses and many more were un
covered by NACLA (North American Congress on Latin
America), a research group in New York whose long
work was aided by the "liberation" of President Kirk's
files during the spring demonstration. The students felt
that "open covenants openly arrived at" should prevail:
basic decisions within the university must not be secret.
