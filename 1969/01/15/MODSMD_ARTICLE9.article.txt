SDS Lack of Respect
Editor, THE DAILY:
For myself and probably most
students on this campus it is a
popular and comfortable position
to be sympathetic with the de
mands of the S.D.S., but it is now
necessary to assume the unpopu
lar position of refuting the S.D.S.
and recognizing them for what
they are. Today I witnessed the
demonstration against the Trus
tees. The members of S.D.S. de
clared themselves to be "bandits"
and "gangsters' • set on using "gor
illa tactics" to make the Board
meet their demands. I will not dis
pute the validity of these labels
that they place upon themselves
for they are quite justified. Until
now I have felt that the demands
were something that should be
considered and that each student
has a responsibility to his own
education to concern himself with
the issues.

The apathy of the students
though has allowed the S.D.S. to
believe that they have the right to
represent the students of Stanford
University in making demands
that they deem relevant and nec
essary. I personally abhor the tac
tics of the S.D.S. and feel that it is
a grave error on the part of the
student body to allow such an
organization to make demands in
our name. I have always wondered
what constitutes the make-up of
the S.D.S.
At the demonstration I saw
many weak people who have
found an identity in S.D.S. They
are born followers. It is a shame
that they have wasted the oppor
tunity here at Stanford to become
leaders. It is unfortunate that they
cannot tolerate the opinions of
each other. This is the reason for
the disorganization that prevails in
their meetings and the amazing
hostilities existing among the lead
ers.
It is depressing for me to see
such people gather and proclaim
to be intelligent, sensitive individ
uals and then act like the most
disrespectful and insensitive be
ings possible. What were the rea
sons for their drinking from the
pitchers of water that were in the
board room of the alumni house
(which they took the liberty to
break into) when glasses were
available? Is their vocabulary so
lacking that the only descriptive
word that they can find as mean
ingful is "shit"? What is the ad
vantage of addressing the chief of
police as "dirty pig" upon first
meeting him? When do you show
respect for your fellow man? Is
there any provocation that justi
fies treating a fellow human being
as a "pig".
A rational opinion merits only
a chorus of laughter at an S.D.S.
meeting. Maybe it is time to laugh
back at this irrational and anti
intellectual phenomena that
claims to represent the "students
for a democratic society." I hard
ly feel sympathetic anymore; the
S.D.S. hardly feels.

Parking Problem
Editor:THE DAILY:
The new library to be built ad
jacent to the present Main Library
and UGLY is a welcom addition
to the campus. However, the fact
that the new library will eliminate
the present faculty-staff parking
lot cannot be welcome news to
anyone but a University Planner.
The University's desire to re
move the automobile from the
center of campus is understand
able. Cars are noisy and dirty, and
they occasionally misbehave and
do grievous damage to plants,
trees, and slothful pedestrians.
But until the University makes it
possible for faculty, staff, and

graduate students to live within
walking (or biking) distance of the
campus, the automobile will re
main a necessity, especially in the
rainy winter months. Building
mammoth parking lots a mile
from the quad is no solution.
People should not have to drive
through Palo Alto in order to
walk for twenty minutes in the
rain to get from their car to their
desk.
It is astounding that a Univer
sity so "aware" of the need for
organic urban planning should be
so piecemeal in its own develop
ment. Has anyone in the Plannirg
Office decided what will be done
with the cars which are now
parked in the Library lot? Right
now the number of registered cars
on campus almost equals the
number of parking spots (God
knows how many unregistered
cars there are). The University
contemplates a 30 percent in
crease in the size of the faculty,
with a requisite increase in the
size of the staff. I suspect this will
mean a 30 percent increase in the
number of cars on campus.
Where are we going to out
them?

LASSU Approval
Editor, THE DAILY:
"The Steering Committee is
only a study; it has no mandate to
change. . . and no power other
than the persuasiveness that its
recommendations appear to
command," Herbert Packer said.
"The recommendations must then
go to whatever authority or agency
has the power to act."
Packer named the Academic
Council, the Board of Trustees
and the President as those authori
ties. In regard to LASSU or stu
dent approval of the recommenda
tions, he said that the"judgement"
and opinions of such groups
would be considered.
Packer said he could not
address himself to the "abstract
questions of whether we are seek
ing the judgement or the approval
of LASSU." He explained that the
committee would take its recom
mendations to LASSU and to the
faculty to "find out whether we
are on the right track." The rec
ommendations would then go to
President Sterling for final de
cision or referral to the Board of
Trustees.
From The Stanford Daily, Feb.
16,1967
Mr. Packer, LASSU awaits the
committee's recommendations.

Squash at Stanford
Editor, THE DAILY: Now that I
am back at Stanford after a year
long internship in Washington,
D.C., I am again acutely aware of
and sincerely disappointed with

the limited athletic facilities avail
able at the University. I am refer
ring primarily to the shortage of
indoor facilities that can b» used
day and night, and in all weather
conditions.
It seems incredible that a major
university, which draws faculty
and students from across the
nation and internationally, could
fail to provide the facilities which
many of us have learned to use
and enjoy at other universities.
Games such as squash, hand
ball, badminton, and paddlebali
are traditional sports around the
university. They are excellent for
providing the vigorous exercise we
all need, they can be accommo
dated with a busy schedule (which
may favor exercising in the even
ings), and they make for good
competition between individuals
over a wide age group. Even the
facilities that are provided, seem
too cramped, our basketball game
Saturday was interrupted over and
over, due to the crowding. I
strongly urge that facilities for the
sports I have mentioned be con
structed at Stanford.
