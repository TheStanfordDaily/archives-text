# SDS In High Gear; Trustees Disturbed
## 
### ANN DENTON PHILIP TAUBMAN 
Tuesday's confrontation be
tween the Board of Trustees and
Students for a Democratic Society
(SDS) may have thrown Trustee
plans for future campus meetings
into jeopardy and has shifted SDS
activities into high gear.
SDS plans include a rally in
White Plaza today at noon to ex
plain motivations and issues in
volved in ihe Trustee demonstra
tion. SDS members are also circu
lating petitions in dorms to
inform students of demands.
"We're not abou*; to stop now,"
noted one SDS member.
Dean of Students Joel Smith
has sent a list naming more than
30 students identified a the dem
onstration to the Stanford Jud
icial Council, headed by Prof.
Jack Friedenthal. Friedenthal
declined to release any of the
names.
Trustee Ernest Arbuckle,
Chairman of the Board of Wells
Fargo Bank, commented yester
day "There won't be any future
meetings on campus uhless we are
assured they won't be broken
up."
Arbuckle expressed hope that
the University community would
band together to prohibit any
future outbreaks. Arbuckle said,
"John Gardner phoned me this
morning from Chicago greatly dis
turbed and upset by yesterday's
demonstration. We both hope the
faculty, student body, and admin
istration will join together in re
fusing to tolerate any future at
tacks.
Board President William Palmer
Fuller 111 reflected yesterday that,
"I was quite depressed and sad
dened by the disruption. I
thought we had been making
material progress in increasing stu
dent communication with the
Board."
Fuller, however, does not think
the disruption will change trustee
plans to continue meeting on
campus. Fuller said, "It would
seem absolutely incredible and
ridiculous to me for the trustees

to be forced off the campus they
direct. We've got many things to
discuss and perhaps we should
have open meetings all the time or
occasionally. I really haven't given
the subject very much thought."
Today's SDS activities run con
current with SDS 'fears and
theories about the demonstrations
ramifications. One member
frankly stated, "I'm quite sure
that some of us will get thrown
out of school."
Thinking back to the judicial
problems raised last year concern
ing the Central Intelligence
Agency confrontation, Fred
Cohen, a leader in SDS, pointed
out, "If disciplinary action is
brought against us this year, it
should be quite clear that the
issue involved will not be the
nature of the Stanford judicial
process.
"The reeil issues involved will
be the power allocation in the
University and Stanford's involve
ment in economic and military
operations in Southeast Asia."
Trustee anger over Tuesday's
disruption was complemented yes
terday by administrators who re
counted with bitter bemusement
their violent scuffles with SDS
members. Fred Glover, executive
assistant to President Pitzer, des
cribed his brief battle with stu
dents: "At one point I opened a
door to the Trustee dining room
and found several students lunging
toward me into the room. There
was some violent pushing, but I
managed to close the door."
Once in the Trustee room, one
student grabbed the meeting
agenda and grappled with Glover
for control of the document.
Glover was dragged down the hall
for several yeards before the stu
dent sprang loose.
The SDS demonstration has
illicited a critical counter petition
by students in the Committee for
an Open Campus. The petition
attacks the "irresponsible acts of
these individuals claiming to seek
change and reform in the opera
tion of this institution."

Board."
Fuller, however, does not think
the disruption will change trustee
plans to continue meeting on
campus. Fuller said, "It would
seem absolutely incredible and
ridiculous to me for the trustees

to be forced off the campus they
direct. We've got many things to
discuss and perhaps we should
have open meetings all the time or
occasionally. I really haven't given
the subject very much thought."
Today's SDS activities run con
current with SDS 'fears and
theories about the demonstrations
ramifications. One member
frankly stated, "I'm quite sure
that some of us will get thrown
out of school."
Thinking back to the judicial
problems raised last year concern
ing the Central Intelligence
Agency confrontation, Fred
Cohen, a leader in SDS, pointed
out, "If disciplinary action is
brought against us this year, it
should be quite clear that the
issue involved will not be the
nature of the Stanford judicial
process.
"The reeil issues involved will
be the power allocation in the
University and Stanford's involve
ment in economic and military
operations in Southeast Asia."
Trustee anger over Tuesday's
disruption was complemented yes
terday by administrators who re
counted with bitter bemusement
their violent scuffles with SDS
members. Fred Glover, executive
assistant to President Pitzer, des
cribed his brief battle with stu
dents: "At one point I opened a
door to the Trustee dining room
and found several students lunging
toward me into the room. There
was some violent pushing, but I
managed to close the door."
Once in the Trustee room, one
student grabbed the meeting
agenda and grappled with Glover
for control of the document.
Glover was dragged down the hall
for several yeards before the stu
dent sprang loose.
The SDS demonstration has
illicited a critical counter petition
by students in the Committee for
an Open Campus. The petition
attacks the "irresponsible acts of
these individuals claiming to seek
change and reform in the opera
tion of this institution."

Tuesday's confrontation be

Students for a Democratic Society

plans for future campus meetings
into jeopardy and has shifted SDS
activities into high gear.
SDS plans include a rally in
White Plaza today at noon to ex
plain motivations and issues in
volved in ihe Trustee demonstra
tion. SDS members are also circu

noted one SDS member.

Trustee Ernest Arbuckle,
Chairman of the Board of Wells
Fargo Bank, commented yester
day "There won't be any future
meetings on campus uhless we are
assured they won't be broken

Arbuckle expressed hope that
the University community would
band together to prohibit any
future outbreaks. Arbuckle said,
"John Gardner phoned me this
morning from Chicago greatly dis
turbed and upset by yesterday's
demonstration. We both hope the
faculty, student body, and admin
istration will join together in re
fusing to tolerate any future at
tacks.
Board President William Palmer
Fuller 111 reflected yesterday that,
"I was quite depressed and sad
dened by the disruption. I
thought we had been making
material progress in increasing stu

Board."
