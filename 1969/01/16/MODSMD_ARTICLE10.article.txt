## LBJ Closes With A Bang 
### ART BUCHWALD 
This is the first week in five years
that you can't hear an unkind
word about President Lyndon B.
Johnson. As he is preparing to
leave office his most ardent critics
have changed their tunes, and it's
hard to believe that they are talk
ing about the same man they were
discussing a year ago.
One of his toughest critics said
at a party the other night, "He
may have made mistakes, but you
can't fault him on what he tried
to do."
Another Johnson nonadmirer
agreed, "If Nixon does half as well
as Lyndon did, he'll be a good
President." "Nixon won't.
They don't make Presidents like
L.B.J, any more."
"You know what I liked about
Johnson?" another former anti-
Johnson man said. "His style. He
had a free-wheeling style which
made you admire him. I think
Nixon's biggest weakness is he has
no style."
"You can say that again.
Lyndon came from Texas, and at

least you knew where he stood on
the issues."
"You're right. You have no
idea where Nixon stands on any
thing."
"Johnson really worked as
President," said another man who
used to get red when Lyndon's
name was mentioned. "Maybe he
had his faults, but he also had his
strengths, and his strengths out
numbered his faults."
"Nixon's faults outnumber his
strengths."
A lady nodded her head. "I
can't stand Nixon on TV. At least
when you saw Johnson on TV
you knew he was sincere."
The lady next to her agreed.
"President Johnson had kind eyes
and a sincere chin."
"He was good to the poor," I
said, not wanting to look as if I
had anything against Johnson.
"And he worried about
black people, " a former Mc-
Carthy supporter said.
"Nixon won't hold a candle to
him when it comes to what John
son did for education."
