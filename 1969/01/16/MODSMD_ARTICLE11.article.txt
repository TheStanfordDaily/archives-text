## Marijuana Arrests On Campus 
### 
Editor, THE DAILY:
According to the Daily "early
(Monday) morning . . . Building
Superintendent Joseph Riley no
ticed a 'pungent, disagreeable
odor' coming from a desk locker
in the second floor carrel room"
of the Meyer Library. The Super
intendent presumably unlocked
the locker and removed a brief
case. Then either he or the Assis
tant Director of Libraries Robert
Goiter opened the briefcase. Dis
covering a "drug," the Assistant
Director notified Assistant Busi
ness Manager Daniel DeYoung and
(although accounts differ) Assis
tant Dean of Students Willard
Wyman.) The Assistant Business
Manager contacted campus police
and the Santa Clara County Sher
iff's office. A student was subse
quently arrested.
Meiking the facile assumption
that the Daily account is not sub
stantially inaccurate, every Stan
ford student should ask himself
the following questions: What was
the Building Superintendent doing
smelling around student lockers?
(Shouldn't the job of smelling stu
dent lockers by assigned to a sub
ordinate employee?) Isn't a stu
dent justified in believing that
when he leaves his belongings in a
locked compartment they will not
be disturbed by employees of the
University? If a student leaves his

diary in a library locker is it sub
ject to inspection by the library
staff? What attitude toward stu
dents is implicit in the Building
Superintendent't or the Assistant
Director's presumed privilege to
open a student's briefcase? If a
librarian brings a pungent sand
wich to work, will they rifle her
lunchbag or purse? If the odor
was really disagreeable couldn't
the unopened briefcase have been
isolated until the student called
for it? What authority does an As
sistant Business Manager have to
call in the sheriff? Where the legal
ity of a search and an intended
arrest is in question, can't a more
competent legal opinion be ob
tained elsewhere in the University
than from the Business Office (or
from the Dean of Student's intui
tionist constitutional lawyer)?
Granting that the University
ought not to be a sanctuary for
the illegal use of narcotics, Univer
sity employees do not have the
duty of law enforcement. But
where they presume to exercise
such a duty, students should have
the same right against them as
they have against law enforcement
officers - that is, "the right to be
secure .in their persons, houses,
papers and effects (which they
"seek to preserve as private, even
in an area accessible to the pub
lic") against unreasonable searches
and seizures."

What Mrs. Jane Stanford said
about professors (in her address to
the Trustees of July 23, 1904) ap
plies equally to building super
visors, librarians, business manag
ers and deans of students:
"There are men . . . who are
entirely out of place in a univer
sity. The sooner we cease to be a
school the sooner we may do
without spies and watchmen for
the students. A university profes
sor acting as a detective ... is, in
my judgment, a disgrace to the
profession, and to the institu
tion."

• THERE IS HOPE
Editor, THE DAILY :
It was most reassuring to learn

that the Daily's editorial staff,
looking down from its pontifical
vantage point, has deemed that
President Kenneth S. Pitzer "Can
certainly acquire the [administra
tive ] skills that a college like Rice
never demanded." On a campus
bereft of all hope for enlightened
administration until now, sudden
ly there is light on the horizon.

• CONDEMNS SDS TACTICS
Editor, THE DAILY :
We would like to speak for our
selves in condemning the tactics
used by the S.D.S. yesterday at
the Board of Trustees meeting.
Understandably the S.D.S.
wants communication with the
Trustees on the problems of our
education and Trustees' involve
ment in the war and in big in
dustry. But the S.D.S. embarked

on this "communication" effort
with such a righteous superiority
and inconsiderate sense of mutual
humanity that even the most level
headed and reasonable person
would have felt offended. Not
only was communication rendered
impossible yesterday - but we pre
dict the Trustees will feel no com
pulsion to "communicate" further
with the S.D.S. Especially irritat
ing is that the S.D.S. is creating an
association between this kind of
mud throwing and student con
cern over political issues. The
Daily's reference to the "morally
concerned but passive students
and professors" implies that the
SDS is the only group willing to
actually do something about their
political concerns. This is self con
gratulatory and completely un
true. The Graduate Student As
sociation, for instance, has taken
substantial amounts of time to
talk to prominent citizens, and
organize panel discussion and
symposiums to air the issues that
need desperately to be resolved.

We feel further that the SDS is
employing the same tactics that it
pretends to abhor. The Daily asks
if we noticed how much pushing
and shouting took place in Viet
nam yesterday. Violence must
lean on violence for its justifi
cation. Bullishness and name-cal
ling come all too easily to this
group which pretends to be the
conscience of the university.
Finally we would like to point
out that the Daily's sense of res
pect for other human beings is in
the same class as that of the
S.D.S. The Trustees are stereo
typed as people who will "prob
ably never listen" - the implica
tion being that they do not de
serve even basic decency. This at
titude is dangerous since if the
people with the reigns of power
are sufficiently provoked and
communication brought to a
standstill - a conservative backlash
will sweep all the progress that has
been made up until now.

• CRIMES IN THE STACKS
Editor, The DAILY :
After reading about plans to
build a new, "humanized" annex
to the main library, we were
struck by the irony of the fact
that the existing library stacks
have become unpleasant, if not
unsafe, for women students at
Stanford. Crimes of "exhibition
ism" have occurred with alarming
frequency and have become a real
menace to girls studying the main
library.
We personally know of five
women graduate students who
were repeatedly bothered in the
stacks during fall quarter. Unfor
tunately, most of the incidents
that occur are not reported. Girls
feel that the matter is too delicate
to be spoken of; or they believe
that they are the only ones who
have been molested. The "sec
recy" of the offense is precisely
what the exhibitionist is counting
on.
Police advise that if a woman is
bothered in the stacks, she should
try to get a good look at the crim
inal's face; she should, if possible,
call out to other people in the vi
cinity who might also identify the
man; and she should report the
crime to the main desk immedi
ately.
We have written this letter be
cause we feel that the "hidden
crimes" that have become a lib
rary pestilence can be halted only
if brought out into the open.
