## Flicks Out Of Their Mind 
### WALTER MARTIN 
A feast of films is being spon
sored in Cubberley by Rinconada
House (Saturday at 7:30 and 10;
Sunday at 2 and 7; Monday at
7:30). It's called "New Cinema"
(The Arcturus Collection of Janus
Films) and is made up of 19 short,
sweet things by Truffaut, Godard,
Polanski, Lester, Marker, and
Mogubgub to name only a few of
the less fascinating....Nine of them
will be shown as Part I this time;
the second half is coming in two
weeks. Collectively they've cap
tured just about every golden
Ducat, Silver Lion and Brass Spit
toon offered in the festivals, and
their makers are now among the
old masters.
For instance: Truffaut's "Les
Mistons '67", a reconstructed ver
sion of his very first film, seen
here for the first time, and unmis
takably and early sketch for the
"The 400 Blows". Unlike most of
the others in Part I, all thoroughly
modern, this has the peculiar soft
quality o. ancient (pre-60's) cin-

ema: it tells a story, is well-com
posed, unflashy, unfrenzied and
straight-forward.
The brats of the title are spell
bound by the sexuality they sense
in the beautiful, barefoot Bern
adette, and since they are too
young to love her they decide to
hate her, to torment her every
where she goes.
Movie Theater
One of their practical jokes (or
battles, as they prefer to think of
them) takes place in a movie the
ater (Truffaut and his pal Godard
have since made the film-within
the-film one of their numerous
hallmarks) and there is more mis
chief in a garden with an old man
watering flowers, in hommage to
one of the founding fathers of
films, Lumiere, and his "Arroseur
arrose" ("The Sprinkler Gets
Sprinkled"), one of the first
movies ever made.
The brats step on his hose and
when he looks into the nozzle to
see why the water stopped, they
let him have it. Godard paid simi-

lar respects to Lumiere in "Les
Carabiniers". Little things like this
confirm belief in their real love
for and mastery of the motion
picture.
New Cinema has other kinds of
delights: Polanski's tale of the gro
tesque and the Beckettesque,
"The Fat and the Lean", for one.
The Fat sits in his wicker rocking
chair throughout, ordering the
Lean to dance, to beat his drum,
to fetch his food, to wash his feet.
Are they master and slave*? Hus
band and wife? Sade and Masoch?
or what? We never know.
All we are given is the images
112 daily drudgery, i.e. ritual. At
times the Lean longs to escape to
the far city he can see on the hori
zon, but he can't break the invis
ible chains that bind him to the
Fat: they belong together; they
make a team.
Experiment With Time
Chris Marker's "La Jetee" is an
important film, as well as a very
good one. Its nearest relatives in
clude "Marienbad," "Alphaville,"

and "THX-1138-4EB". It has the
look of science fiction, but cuts to
deeper levels than most of that.
As an experiment with time, it has
extended the frontiers of what is
possible in films.
First there is the disturbing ef
fect of a "movie" made entirely
of stills. Then it begins and ends
in the present, but was made
sometime after the Third World
War. Its hero becomes the guinea
pig of several more or less mad
scientists who send him back into
his past and forward into his
future, dredging for sunken trea
sures of memory that may benefit
the leftovers of the human race.
What he finds instead is the
woman he had seen on the jetty at
Orly Airport just before the
bombs went off. None of which
really lets you know how rich a
film it is.
There are others, not so rich,
but which succeed in their sim
plicity so well that I likqd them
even more.


"La Jetee," experiment with time, is one of 18 new films to be presented Saturday, Sunday, and
Monday in Cubberly Auditorium.

tured just about every golden
Ducat, Silver Lion and Brass Spit
toon offered in the festivals, and
their makers are now among the
old masters.
For instance: Truffaut's "Les
Mistons '67", a reconstructed ver
sion of his very first film, seen
here for the first time, and unmis
takably and early sketch for the
"The 400 Blows". Unlike most of
the others in Part I, all thoroughly
modern, this has the peculiar soft
quality o. ancient (pre-60's) cin-

ema: it tells a story, is well-com
posed, unflashy, unfrenzied and
straight-forward.
The brats of the title are spell
bound by the sexuality they sense
in the beautiful, barefoot Bern
adette, and since they are too
young to love her they decide to
hate her, to torment her every
where she goes.
Movie Theater
One of their practical jokes (or
battles, as they prefer to think of
them) takes place in a movie the
ater (Truffaut and his pal Godard
have since made the film-within
the-film one of their numerous
hallmarks) and there is more mis
chief in a garden with an old man
watering flowers, in hommage to
one of the founding fathers of
films, Lumiere, and his "Arroseur
arrose" ("The Sprinkler Gets
Sprinkled"), one of the first
movies ever made.
The brats step on his hose and
when he looks into the nozzle to
see why the water stopped, they
let him have it. Godard paid simi-

lar respects to Lumiere in "Les
Carabiniers". Little things like this
confirm belief in their real love
for and mastery of the motion
picture.
New Cinema has other kinds of
delights: Polanski's tale of the gro
tesque and the Beckettesque,
"The Fat and the Lean", for one.
The Fat sits in his wicker rocking
chair throughout, ordering the
Lean to dance, to beat his drum,
to fetch his food, to wash his feet.
Are they master and slave*? Hus
band and wife? Sade and Masoch?
or what? We never know.
All we are given is the images
112 daily drudgery, i.e. ritual. At
times the Lean longs to escape to
the far city he can see on the hori
zon, but he can't break the invis
ible chains that bind him to the
Fat: they belong together; they
make a team.
Experiment With Time
Chris Marker's "La Jetee" is an
important film, as well as a very
good one. Its nearest relatives in
clude "Marienbad," "Alphaville,"

and "THX-1138-4EB". It has the
look of science fiction, but cuts to
deeper levels than most of that.
As an experiment with time, it has
extended the frontiers of what is
possible in films.
First there is the disturbing ef
fect of a "movie" made entirely
of stills. Then it begins and ends
in the present, but was made
sometime after the Third World
War. Its hero becomes the guinea
pig of several more or less mad
scientists who send him back into
his past and forward into his
future, dredging for sunken trea
sures of memory that may benefit
the leftovers of the human race.
What he finds instead is the
woman he had seen on the jetty at
Orly Airport just before the
bombs went off. None of which
really lets you know how rich a
film it is.
There are others, not so rich,
but which succeed in their sim
plicity so well that I likqd them
even more.


"La Jetee," experiment with time, is one of 18 new films to be presented Saturday, Sunday, and
Monday in Cubberly Auditorium.
A feast of films is being spon
sored in Cubberley by Rinconada
House (Saturday at 7:30 and 10;
Sunday at 2 and 7; Monday at
7:30). It's called "New Cinema"
(The Arcturus Collection of Janus
Films) and is made up of 19 short,
sweet things by Truffaut, Godard,
Polanski, Lester, Marker, and
Mogubgub to name only a few of
the less fascinating....Nine of them
will be shown as Part I this time;
the second half is coming in two
weeks. Collectively they've cap
tured just about every golden
