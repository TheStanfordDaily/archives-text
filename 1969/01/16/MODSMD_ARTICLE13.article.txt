# ROUCH DRAFT

### BILL LELAND ALAN STRAIN 
(EDITOR'S NOTE: Rough Draft is
a weekly column dealing with pro
cedural and substantive questions
pertaining to the Draft. Alan
Strain and Bill Leland are Coun
selors with Stanford University.)
The following are common
positions.
"Selective Service System or
Internal Revenue Service —same
thing; nobody wants to serve or
pay; nobody understands all the
rules; it's just a game; some play
well and are lucky; others, well
tough luck."
C.O. Status
"I have not been recognized
as a Conscientious Objector by
the Selective Service System, but
my conscience tells me otherwise.
Refusing induction is perhaps the

only single act in my life through
which I can clearly manifest
where I stand. To submit to in
duction would negate all that I
have learned and the essence of all
that is living and beautiful."
* * *
"I have no compunction about
being devious or dishonest in deal
ing with the draft. The system is
corrupt and illegitimate. Anything
that I can do to avoid induction is
justified?"
Selective Service System
"The essential purpose of the
Selective Service System is to pro
vide bodies for the military ma
chine. To comply with the Select
ive Service System in any way is
to recognize that machine as valid
and legitimate."
"The United States military de
fends the principles of freedom

and the democratic way of life
and allows one to reap the bene
fits of being a citizen of the
United States. All men must recog
nize their obligation to defend our
country by accepting their call
into the military.
♦ ♦ #
"It just seems a misuse of
everybody's time to have a man
with 17 years of formal education
serve as a private in the Army."
Approach To Life
The manner in which a man ap
proaches his decisions about the
military may say a great deal
about the way he approaches his
life. Some men consider their de
cisions concerning military service
to be among the most important
decisions of their lives. Some men
consider these decisions to be a
matter of conscience. (Individual

consciences can dictate different
actions.)
* * *
The ambiguity of the law adds
uncertainty and inconsistency.
The malpractice of local boards
adds anger, frustration, disillusion,
and confusion. Cynicism is made
too easy. Perhaps, the issues and
implications are too numerous
and too complex for any one in
dividual to resolve.

Does anyone have the Answer?
Another thought. . . Leo Tol
stoy, April 7, 1899 ... "I can well
understand that you, a young man
full of life, loving and loved by
your mother, friends, perhaps a
young woman, think with a nat
ural terror of what awaits you if
you refuse conscription; and per

haps you will not feel strong
enough to bear the consequences
of refusal, and knowing your
weakness, will submit and become
a soldier. I understand complete
ly, and I do not for a moment al
low myself to blame you. Know
ing very well that in your place I
might perhaps do the same thing.
Only do not say that you did it
because it was useful or because
everyone else does it. If you did
it, know that you did wrong. For
a man who knows its significance,
the call to the army is perhaps the
only opportunity for him to be
have as a morally free creature
and fulfill the highest requirement
of his life-or else merely to keep
his advantage in sight like an
animal and thus remain slavishly
submissive and servile until he be
comes degraded and stupid."
