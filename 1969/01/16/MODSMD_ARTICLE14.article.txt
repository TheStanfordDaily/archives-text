# Conspiracy Of Two
## The 						Necessity For Self-Determination 
### DANIEL SNELL JEFFREY BLUM 
(First of a Series)
One of the precepts on which
society officially operates is self
determination, that each individ
ual has the right and the respon
sibility to control his own life,
self-determination seems to be
one of the Judeo-Christian values

that is well worth keeping in our
increasingly valueless world.
The main reason for keeping it
is that no other form of direction
seems to work. The family unit,
which once had great influence on
the individual, is now weakening
because of the individual's increas
ing involvement in the outside
world. The high divorce rate with
in this country and the tendency
of children to receive more and
more of their education outside
the home reveal the impotence of
the family as an agent of consis
tent social control.
The state does not work well
either as a director of individuals,
as the Soviet Union and her allies
have discovered in their central
ized economic and social plan
ning. The modern nation-state is
simply too big to be dominated
by state planning, and Commun
ists reluctantly are setting up little
pockets of small-scale capitalism,
and they are finding themselves
forced to allow more freedom to
individuals.
Moreover, people at least in
this country have a strong repug
nance toward state control in
most parts of their lives. Note, for
example, the furor over the subse
quent withdrawal of the Selective
Service's paper on "Channeling"
when it became widely distrib
uted.
Powerful Institutions
This leaves powerful social and
economic institutions within the
society as the agencies most re
sponsible for directing the individ
ual. Everyone knows that in order
to survive comfortably one must
have a job. The kinds of jobs avail
able are determined by diverse
forces within the economy, and
the kind of job one has does in
turn determine what kinds of
friends and acquaintances one has.
But there is serious question as to
whether the sort of pluralistic
corporate capitalist economy that

has developed within the United
States ought really to direct the
lives of its members.
Pluralistic capitalism has a
tendency to reflect the values of
the dominant set of managers,
who make decisions about what
sorts of products to make and
what kinds of jobs to have? This
excludes black, brown, and for
eign people, but makes them all
want the big cars and nice houses
that management and professional
people enjoy.
The large corporations working
for profit proliferate frequently
superfluous products like cos
metics and cars with built-in plan
ned obsolescence, and then they
advertise them heavily to create a
market. Meanwhile, basic psycho
logical needs of people for com
munity and companionship are ig
nored. The end result is that dire
poverty coexists with overwhelm
ing productivity, and no one is
really satisfied.
Labor's Problem
Although labor tends to be
paid more and more for its serv
ices, the nine-to-five day leaves
most people unconvinced that
they have accomplished anything
they really want to accomplish.
Those students who have worked
on summer jobs in factories are
aware how disquieting a whole life
of this would be.
But while-collar workers share
the problems of the blue-collar
men. They too must curb their
creativity for the good of the
whole organization. And recently,
some professional people have rec
ognized that their positions force
them to do things that are morally

repugnant to them. Witness the "
agonized liberals who work for
the Stanford Research Institute,
convinced that the Vietnam war is
wrong, yet turning out projects
for "national defense" that help
carry on the war.
Inherently it seems that cor
porate control of men's lives can
not be expected to be good be
cause what maximizes profits can
not automatically be expected to
be best for the individual em
ployee's or client's life.
Tides of Economy
The state and family are incap
able of directing the individual,
and the individual who makes no
great effort to achieve self-deter
mination will be swept about by
the tides of a pluralistic economy.
Self-determination, in addition
to freeing the individual from
forces which do not have his best
interests in mind, also enables
each person to assert his own sig
nificance and individuality. And
there is markedly less possibility
that he will feel that what he him
self has decided to do is worthless.
To act competently and cre
atively in determining one's own
actions is not as easy as to obey
some outside force. But when it is
clear that the outside forces that
once seemed to work in people's
best interests no longer do, then it
is irresponsible to strive toward
anything less than deciding what
your life will be like for your
self.
