## 'Whites, Blacks Must Work Together' 
### 
"Just as the vast majority of
ghetto dwellers are law-abiding,
decent and struggling human be
ings, the majority of whites are
not exploiters,'' Sociology Prof.
Bernard Cohen writes in the sum
mer-fall issue of the University
quarterly Stanford Today. "But
our expectations make us lose

sight of both facts."
"In order to change the system
of expectations, we must recog
nize that much of the responsibil
ity rests with the white society
. . . but that these changes require
the working together of whites,
black militants and Negroes, and
cannot be accomplished by any of
these groups alone," he com
ments.
"While I agree that changing
white expectations must be done
by whites, I don't agree that it is
solely the white man's problem.
The actions of Black Power have
consequences for the white expec
tations of Negroes that are no less
important because they are un
recognized.
"Insofar as Black Power at
tempts to blackmail concessions
from the white power structure
through fear and violence, it rein
forces rather than contradicts
white expectations about the
and violent nature of

Negroes.
"Insofar as the white power
structure makes concessions in the
face of such blackmail, it rein
forces Negro expectations that
whites will yield only to violence.
Expectations are associated
with status, Prof. Cohen emphasi
zes. The less we know about a
person the more we expect him to
act according to our pre-conceived
notions.
Therefore, "in order to break
down or change the expectations
based on status conceptions, we
must create situations where all
status expectations are operating
and where experience can contra
dict status conceptions.
"These contradictions will
generate considerable conflict and
tension and the tensions must be
controlled," he writes.
These status conceptions in
clude Negro feelings that all white
are exploiters, and white feelings
that all Negroes are "primitive,

violent and to be feared," Prof.
Cohen indicates.
Whites and blacks must work
together to change the system and
to learn to live with the conflict
that is a necessary part of
achieving racial harmony, he con
cludes.
