# Brit. MBA's Cry 'Back To England'
## 
### 
British businessmen have failed to show much interest in a "Back
to Britain" movement among Stanford MBA's from the Island nation.
"You might say we're trying to reverse the present brain drain
from Britain to the U.S., but so far the success has been only mar
ginal," sayd Chris Cadell, of London.
The "Back to Britain" movement was organized by Cadell in hopes
of communicating to British industry the interest of many of the
MBA students ireturning to Britain.
Cadell contacted 37 companies in which the British students at
Stanford had some interest. A plan was developed for students to be
flown back to Britain for interviews over the Christmas and Spring
holidays.
"Although half of the 12 British students are returning over this
holiday and more are expected to go home over spring vacation, the
reason 1 am not completely pleased with the results is that only seven
companies of those contacted are participating," lamented Cade...
"Few British companies realize that it is up to them, and to their
advantage, to attract MBA's back to Britain. If they don't react soon,
American companies will end up hiring the best future British man
agers."
The six students going home for the holidays, including Cadell, will
go through a series of interviews at seven companies which responded
favorably to the program. Five other companies decided to send inter
viewing teams to Stanford because of the interest shown.
"British industry is slowly beginning to recognize the need for
professionally trained managers, and the established American busi
ness schools are acclaimed as a great source of talent," explained
Cadell.
