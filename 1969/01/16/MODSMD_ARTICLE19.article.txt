# Debate Team Posts Wins In Foreign Policy Tourneys
## 
### 
With the winter quarter barely
underway, the Stanford debate
team has posted convincing wins
at three West Coast tournaments.
As they continued to argue the
problems of executive control of
U.S. foreign policy, Stanford de
baters took two first places, two
second places, and one third place
in its first tournaments of the
quarter.

Hosting the Fifth Stanford
Redwood Invitational Tourna
ment, the debaters welcomed
teams from 43 schools, represent
ing 23 states, to the campus on
January 2,3,4.
Three Stanford teams survived
the preliminary rounds and ad
vanced to the elimination debates.
Two teams, Bob Cory-Ron Oster
and Stu Baskin-Tom Goodhue, de
feated University of Oregon teams
in the semi-finals. On the basis of
those wins, Stanford received the
first and second place awards.
Freshman Stu Baskin and soph
omore Tom Goodhue were named
the top two speakers in the con
test.
During registration, Stanford
debaters traveled to U.S.C. Two
teams, Ron Elving-Ken Philpot
and John Mower- Dean Swartz,
entered the elimination rounds,
but were defeated by teams that
eventually finished first and sec
ond in the tourney. Only one
other school, Ohio State, equalled
Stanford's depth by placing two
teams into elimination berths.
An unusual judging situation
developed at the Cal State at
Hayward tournament, Jan. 10-11.
Stanford debaters were asked to
persuade attorneys and magis
trates that one position was super
ior to another. This is different
from the normal situation in
which professors of speech judge
the debates.
Adapting well, Stanford swept
the first and third place awards in
the senior division (Joe Thruman-
Terry Bacon and Gary Hamburg-
Bill Skane) and received the sec
ond place award in junior division
debate (Jim Baer-Mike Rogers).
