# Packer--'A 19th-century Liberal?
## 
### SUSAN SWARD 
"I regard myself essentially as a ninteenth-century liberal," says
Vice Provost Herbert Packer.
"I constantly betray my bias as the man in the middle," Packer
went on to admit in an interview with The Daily yesterday."I have
little sympathy for those who advocate the philosophy that the end
justified the means."
Packer, who joined the Stanford law faculty in 1956, has requested
to be relieved of his administrative duties by the end of the current
academic year.
Soon after Packer was appointed vice provost for academic plan
ning by Wallace Sterling in 1966, he assumed the post of Steering
Committee Chairman of the Study of Education at Stanford (SES).
At the time of his appointment, Packer announced he would probably
return to teaching when the Study was completed.
Self-Study
"When Sterling asked me to come into the administration," Packer
recalled, "it was understood that I would take a major role in the
self-study plan that was very much in the air at that time."
When Packer was appointed vice provost, his role was initially to be
that of a "non-administrating administrator. I was to do the kind of
long range planning that on the whole doesn't get done.
"I have ended up spending more time on SES than on any other
single thing, but I've been involved in a whole range of University
problems. I've served as an advisor to the President and Provost,
Packer said.
Without having the precise title, Packer has had a lot of the com
mittee responsibilities an undergraduate dean would have had. The
SES recommendations include a proposal for the appointment of a
strong dean of undergraduate studies. When questioned about the
possible role for an undergraduate dean at Stanford, Packer replied, "I
think an undergaduate dean for Stanford should come from the School
of Humanitites and Sciences. Essentially, however, I think this is a
question for the President to the University should decide.
Prestige, Leverage
"If undergraduate education is accepted as an important part of
the university, then it is important to have an academic officer
charged with working for its improvement. I think it's less important
where the office fits administratively than how much prestige and
budgetary leverage such an officer has."
Packer admitted that he expected opposition to the proposal con
cerning an Undergraduate Dean from the School of Humanitites and
Sciences. "It wouldn't surprise me if the School tries to forestall the
appointment of an undergraduate dean," he said.
Speaking about the role of student participation in academic plan

ning, Packer remarked, "I don't have a fixed view on precisely what
form student participation should take. The people who do the work
on committees at Stanford have the influence.
"I am very optimistic about the influence students can have on
what the Faculty Senate decides on the basis of student participation
in debates in the Senate. This is not to say I am for or against their
participation," Packer added. "1 am an interested bystander in the
discussion of the role of student voice."
'Healthy Thing'
Packer feels that it is a "healthy thing" that the SES proposals have
not been directed to any specific body with the University.
"It is not appropriate for me to get into the question of who
decides on the SES proposals," Packer said, "but it is highly appropri
ate for me to be involved in what is decided."
In discussing the issue of faculty power within the University,
Packer spoke about his role in the formation of the Academic Senate
in 1968.
"I came to the conclusion that life on the campus was becoming
increasingly complex," Packer observed. "The Academic Council was
too big to handle problems and the executive committee of the
Academic Council was too small. So it is accurate to say that the
formation of the Academic Senate was my idea in the first place.
Arrow Credited
"The detailed work behind the Senate's formation, and this is very
important, was not done by me," Packer said. "The major credit goes
to Professor Kenneth Arrow, who unfortunately left this institution
to go to "Harvard".
Packer mentioned initial faculty reluctance to the idea of an
Academic Senate. According to Packer, this reluctance was " well
intentioned but short-sighted."
Pull of Disciplines
According to Packer, one of the major forces working against a
sense of University community is the pull of the disciplines. He does
admit, though, that "The University has to be a very poly-centric
place with different people doing different things.
"The University should engage in activities related to human aspira
tions and needs. Universities aren't conscious instruments of social
change, but they do provide the intellectual stimulus upon which
social change, depends." When Packer is not engaged in university
administration, his main field of interest is criminal law.
"I've always done a great deal of writing," Packer noted, "for the
New York Review of Books, The New Republic and similar maga
zines. I enjoy writing for an intelligent, general audience."
