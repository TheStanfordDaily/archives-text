# Test-Ban Treaty Ratification Affects Sino-Soviet Relations
## 
### 
Because Communist China now
is nuclear-armed, or soon will be,
a pending treaty to halt the spread
of atomic weapons is much more
than an end in itself.
The so-called "nonprolifer
ation" agreement, argues Walter
C. Clemens, may be seen as a
critical "transition from one stage
to another in the postwar efforts
to control the arms race."
His book, "The Arms Race and
Sino —Soviet Relations," was pub
lished recently by Stanford Uni
versity's Hoover Institution.
Clemens is associate professor
of government at Boston Univer
sity and acting director of its
Soviet and East European Pro
gram. He also is an associate at
Harvard's Russian Research
Center.
The author believes time is of
the essence in putting the nonpro
liferation treaty into actual effect.

The pact was opened for adher
ence by U.S. and Soviet signing in
July. It has not yet been ratified
by the Senate.
Nuclear Capability
"Assuming the treaty were rat
ified by West Germany and other
key threshold powers"--that is,
those capable of acquiring atomic
weapon capability rapidly—"the
Kremlin and the White House
could take it that the nuclear club
would be fixed at five members,
at least for the time being.
"On the other hand, if the
superpowers did not succeed in
limiting their own arms buildup,
the chances would increase that
some key threshold power might
decide to go nuclear.
"If the Kremlin-its anxieties
heightened by proxmity to
China-proceeded with ABM (anti
ballistic missile) deployment, the
general stability of the Soviet-U.S.
arms competition would probably
be shattered."
If this ABM decision were to
be made, he continues, it would
probably thus destroy "all hope
for an accord on underground
testing, on the control of fission
able materials, and on a halt to
nuclear spread."
Number of Signs
Clemens finds a number of
signs that Moscow is willing to go

beyond then onprol iferation
treaty, if it becomes effective, and
suggests several possible reasons
for this new willingness:
"The most important trend
bearing on Soviet interests in arms
control is probably the shifting
nature of the balance of strategic
power."
The author notes that the
USSR is expected at least to equal
this country in 1969 in numbers
of land-based ICBM's and has in
other ways cut the U.S. lead in
the arms race. But he feels Wash
ington could make it prohibitively
expensive if the Soviets were to
try for complete parity in weap
onry, much less superiority.
"Moscow's concern about the
implications of an unbridled stra
tegic arms race were probably
prompted in part by Washington's
decision in 1967-68 to proceed
with deployment of the Sentinel
ABM system."
Some U.S. officials, Clemens
adds, mentioned the Soviet as well
as the Red Chinese threat of at
tack in justifying the plans for de
ployment.
"Signs multiplied in late
1967-68 that the Soviet govern
ment had strong doubts about the
efficacy of ABM defenses and that
it planned to give much more at
tention to civil defense activity."

"Moscow's concern about the
implications of an unbridled stra
tegic arms race were probably
prompted in part by Washington's
decision in 1967-68 to proceed
with deployment of the Sentinel
ABM system."
Some U.S. officials, Clemens
adds, mentioned the Soviet as well
as the Red Chinese threat of at
tack in justifying the plans for de
ployment.
"Signs multiplied in late
1967-68 that the Soviet govern
ment had strong doubts about the
efficacy of ABM defenses and that
it planned to give much more at
tention to civil defense activity."
Because Communist China now
is nuclear-armed, or soon will be,
a pending treaty to halt the spread
of atomic weapons is much more
than an end in itself.
The so-called "nonprolifer
ation" agreement, argues Walter
C. Clemens, may be seen as a
critical "transition from one stage
to another in the postwar efforts
to control the arms race."
His book, "The Arms Race and
Sino —Soviet Relations," was pub
lished recently by Stanford Uni
versity's Hoover Institution.
Clemens is associate professor
of government at Boston Univer
sity and acting director of its
Soviet and East European Pro
gram. He also is an associate at
Harvard's Russian Research
Center.
The author believes time is of
the essence in putting the nonpro
liferation treaty into actual effect.

The pact was opened for adher
ence by U.S. and Soviet signing in
July. It has not yet been ratified
by the Senate.
Nuclear Capability
"Assuming the treaty were rat
ified by West Germany and other
key threshold powers"--that is,
those capable of acquiring atomic
weapon capability rapidly—"the
Kremlin and the White House
could take it that the nuclear club
would be fixed at five members,
at least for the time being.
"On the other hand, if the
superpowers did not succeed in
limiting their own arms buildup,
the chances would increase that
some key threshold power might
decide to go nuclear.
"If the Kremlin-its anxieties
heightened by proxmity to
China-proceeded with ABM (anti
ballistic missile) deployment, the
general stability of the Soviet-U.S.
arms competition would probably
be shattered."
If this ABM decision were to
be made, he continues, it would
probably thus destroy "all hope
for an accord on underground
testing, on the control of fission
able materials, and on a halt to
nuclear spread."
Number of Signs
Clemens finds a number of
signs that Moscow is willing to go

beyond then onprol iferation
treaty, if it becomes effective, and
suggests several possible reasons
for this new willingness:
"The most important trend
bearing on Soviet interests in arms
control is probably the shifting
nature of the balance of strategic
power."
The author notes that the
USSR is expected at least to equal
this country in 1969 in numbers
of land-based ICBM's and has in
other ways cut the U.S. lead in
the arms race. But he feels Wash
ington could make it prohibitively
expensive if the Soviets were to
try for complete parity in weap
onry, much less superiority.
