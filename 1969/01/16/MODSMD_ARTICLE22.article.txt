# Gaughran Takes Post At Foothill Club
## 
### 
Stanford's Jim Gaughran, one
of the nation's finest aquatics'
coaches, will become Foothill
Aquatic Club water polo coach, it
was announced Tuesday by FAC
president Nort Thornton.
The spring-and-summer posi
tion will not interfere with Gaugh
ran's duties at Stanford.
Gaughran, 36, takes over for
Art Lambert, who held the post
from 1964-68, but announced his
resignation last fall after coaching
the fifth-place U.S. Olympic team
at Mexico City.
Thornton, FAC senior men's
competitive coach, said, "We ex
pect the level of our club's water
polo program will remain as high
with the addition of Jim. and

eventually we know it will im
prove. We regard Jim as a great
addition to our club, and when
the opening came we felt he was
the logical choice."
In accepting his new position,
Gaughran stated, "It takes awhile
to build a water polo team of
some stature. We expect to have
pretty much of a new team so

we're looking for interested young
men in the 17-21-year-old age
bracket right now. But in line
with this, anybody who expresses
an interest will be given a chance.
"We hope the main interest
will be among young men with
four strong years of water polo in
them as obviously 1972 is what all
of us in this business are pointing
toward. I don't know what the
summertime plans of my Stanford
players are as yet."
Gaughran hopes to hold five
night-a-week workouts at Foothill
College's famed Olympic-size pool
'as the layout is more comparable
to standards set forth for AAU
title sites. Depending on early in
terest in his new program, Gaugh
ran hopes to field a tough Foothill
A. C. entry in the AAU National
Indoor meet at Santa Barbara in
May. Otherwise, he'll take his top
Stanford varsity and yearling per
formers for a bid.
No stranger to summertime
aquatic programs, Gaughran has
devoted the past two summers to
"teaching purely the basic funda
mentals of the sport" to inexperi
enced age group competitors.
Prior to that, he coached
Olympic Club of San Francisco to
polo prominence as his Marty
Hull-paced charges finished sec
ond in 1963 and '64 AAU Out
door showdowns at Foothill,
dropping respective one-goal,
overtime losses. His '64
"Winged-O" aggregation finished
third in the Olympic Trials at Los
Angeles Swim Stadium (Coli
seum).
Former All-American
Gaughran won AAU Ail-Ameri
can honors four consecutive times
from 1955-59 as a player and led
the Olympic Club team as a play
ing coach, additionally winning a
berth on the '56 U. S. Olympic
team. Currently a member of the
U. S. Olympic water polo commit
tee, he was assistant coach and
team manager of the '63 U. S.

entry in the Pan American Games
at Sao Paulo, Brazil.
His efforts rejuvinated Stan
ford's aquatics' program. The '63
Indian poloists were ranked No. 1
nationally in national college list
ings and have three runnerup
rankings to their credit. Stanford's
'67 swin team won the NCAA
title and the 1966 and '68 aggre
gations finished fourth.
This season, Stanford is one of
the early favorites to capture the
NCAA crown and already ranks as
one of the country's current relay
and dual-meet powerhouses.
Gaughran captained Stanford's
water polo and swim teams as a
senior in 1954, culminating a col
lege swim career that saw him
twice named to the All-American
team, and two times to the AU-
Pacilic Coast Conference water
polo honor team.
The 1950 Sequoia High gradu
ate was a standout freestyle sprint
and individual medley performer
both as a prep and collegian.


COACH GAUGHRAN


GYM GlANTSâ€”Stanford gymnastics coach Dan Millman's two top prospects in 1969 figure to be
sophomore Steve Rochell (above) and junior Craig Dickson (below). Rochell, former Illinois state
high school still rings champion, will be "in strong contention for the NCAA rings title," according to
Millman. Millman considers Dickson, who took firsts in the all-around competition in both meets
last weekend, "a possible contender for the 1970 World Championships Team."
