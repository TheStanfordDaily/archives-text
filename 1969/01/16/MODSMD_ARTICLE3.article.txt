## Johnson Retains Tax 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP)-Presi
dent Johnson included a big boost
in Social Security benefits for 25
million Americans in his record
breaking $195.3 billion final bud
get submitted to Congress Wed
nesday.
The largest-ever budget pro
jects a $3.4 billion surplus for
fiscal 1970 beginning next July 1
as a result of his recommendation
for a one-year extension of the 10
per cent income surtax.
It will be up to a Republican
president, Richard M. Nixon, who
takes office Monday, and a Demo
cratic-controlled Congress to
accept or revise the budget in the
months ahead.
But Budget Director Charles J.
Zwick, after frequent consult
ations with Nixon administration
officials in recent weeks, said they
agree on the appropriateness of a
1970 surplus.
By implication this could mean
they go along with continuance of
the surtax—later confirmed by
Nixon in a statement. Zwick em
phasized the incoming officials
were not committed to the spec
ifics of the budget.
However, Nixon issued a state
ment giving qualified endorsement
to extension of the surtax, pend
ing studies by his administration
and the Congress in the next few
months.
Johnson urged that, if Congress
votes to keep the surtax, it give
Nixon power to end it or reduce it
before June 30, 1970, if events
warrant this.
Johnson's social security
recommendations would mean a
basic increase of 10 per cent for
all 25 million persons now on the
rolls.
If Johnson's recommendations
are accepted, not only will older
Americans get higher social secur
ity payments but all wage earners
and employers will pay higher
taxes to finance the increases.
The President included $25.7
billion to finance Vietnamese war
operations in the year ahead. He
said this would pay for the cur
rent troop strength and levels of
fighting. These levels are down

somewhat so that the war figure is
$3.5 billion less than that for the
current year.
The President's new proposed
seven-cent rate for a letter stamp
would combine into one rate the
present six-cent first class stamp
and the eight-cent airmail stamp.
In addition, he asked increases
in the single piece third-class mail
rate, chiefly covering advertising
material. All of these postal hikes
would bring in $519 million a
year, he estimated.
Johnson's excise tax recom
mendations would continue the
auto levy at 7 per cent and the
telephone service levy at 10 per
cent for another year.
Both now are scheduled to
drop to 5 per cent on Jan. 1,
1970.
The President said his surtax
and excise tax proposals would
mean $9.5 billion of additional
revenue for his 1970 budget.
Not only did Johnson estimate
a $3.4 billion surplus in fiscal
1970 but he also projected a $2.4
billion black ink figure for the
current uear, fiscal 1969.
Both Johnson and Zwick called
the budget an extremely tight
one, and there were sure to be
cries in Congress that some pro
grams are underfinanced.

Sirhan Talks at Trial
LOS ANGELES (AP>-The
first male prospective juror was
tentatively seated at the Sirhan
Bishara Sirhan murder trial today
and the defendant spoke out for
the first time.
The prosecutor, David N. Fitts,
had asked the juror, Lawrence K.
Morgan: "Would you have the
courage, once deliberating, if first
degree murder was a proper ver
dict in this case, to come down
here and say Mr. Sirhan must die
in the gas chamber?"
Sirhan leaned forward and
smiled at the juror from the
counsel table.
"There, you're getting a good
view of him now and he's smiling
at you," Fitts told Morgan. "He
probably will be smiling at you
for the rest of the trial "
At this point, Sirhan spoke out
in court for the first time since his
trial began Jan. 7.

"I smile at you, too, Mr.
Fitts," he said.
The judge then told Fitts to
stick to questions and make no
comments on Sirhan's behavior.

administration will aim to get at
the Paris peace talks an "enforce
able agreement" to end the Viet

Rogers told an impromptu
news conference after an appear

• San Fernando State
NORTHRIDGE (AP)-An ac
countant who said he was one of
the "hard-core militants," sued
Wednesday for $50,250 over a
statement that the group had
planned to murder Dr. Delmar T.
Oviatt, acting president of San
Fernando State College.
The libel and slander suit was
filed by Harry A. Carter against
Oviatt and Richard A. Hill, presi
dent of the college's Alumni As
sociation.
The suit said Hill told newsmen
Monday that "hard-core mili
tants" had planned to turn last

Thursday's campus demonstration
into a full riot and kill Oviatt.
Carter called the statement false.
The demonstration brought
286 arrests and convinced Glenn
Mahler, student body president of
"the urgency of the situation."
"We were talking about the de
mands but we were working as if
we had a long time. We just didn't
realize the urgency of it."
Mahler said the whole mood of
the student body had changed
since the demonstrations.

The President said his surtax
and excise tax proposals would
mean $9.5 billion of additional
revenue for his 1970 budget.
Not only did Johnson estimate
a $3.4 billion surplus in fiscal
1970 but he also projected a $2.4

Both Johnson and Zwick called
the budget an extremely tight

Sirhan Talks at Trial
LOS ANGELES (AP>-The
first male prospective juror was
tentatively seated at the Sirhan
Bishara Sirhan murder trial today
and the defendant spoke out for
the first time.
The prosecutor, David N. Fitts,
had asked the juror, Lawrence K.
Morgan: "Would you have the
courage, once deliberating, if first
degree murder was a proper ver
dict in this case, to come down
here and say Mr. Sirhan must die
in the gas chamber?"
Sirhan leaned forward and
smiled at the juror from the
counsel table.
"There, you're getting a good
view of him now and he's smiling
at you," Fitts told Morgan. "He
probably will be smiling at you
for the rest of the trial "
At this point, Sirhan spoke out
in court for the first time since his
trial began Jan. 7.

"I smile at you, too, Mr.
Fitts," he said.
The judge then told Fitts to
stick to questions and make no
comments on Sirhan's behavior.

WASHINGTON (AP)-William

Rogers told an impromptu
news conference after an appear

hopeful signs that the world is
coming around to the belief that
"the use of force is not produc

"We desire a negotiated settle

• San Fernando State
NORTHRIDGE (AP)-An ac
countant who said he was one of
the "hard-core militants," sued
Wednesday for $50,250 over a
statement that the group had
planned to murder Dr. Delmar T.
Oviatt, acting president of San
Fernando State College.
The libel and slander suit was
filed by Harry A. Carter against
Oviatt and Richard A. Hill, presi
dent of the college's Alumni As
sociation.
The suit said Hill told newsmen
Monday that "hard-core mili
tants" had planned to turn last

Thursday's campus demonstration
into a full riot and kill Oviatt.
Carter called the statement false.
The demonstration brought
286 arrests and convinced Glenn
Mahler, student body president of
"the urgency of the situation."
"We were talking about the de
mands but we were working as if
we had a long time. We just didn't
realize the urgency of it."
Mahler said the whole mood of
the student body had changed
since the demonstrations.
WASHINGTON (AP)-Presi
dent Johnson included a big boost
in Social Security benefits for 25
million Americans in his record
breaking $195.3 billion final bud
get submitted to Congress Wed
nesday.
The largest-ever budget pro
jects a $3.4 billion surplus for
fiscal 1970 beginning next July 1
as a result of his recommendation
for a one-year extension of the 10
per cent income surtax.
It will be up to a Republican
president, Richard M. Nixon, who
takes office Monday, and a Demo
cratic-controlled Congress to
accept or revise the budget in the
months ahead.
But Budget Director Charles J.
Zwick, after frequent consult
ations with Nixon administration
officials in recent weeks, said they
agree on the appropriateness of a
1970 surplus.
By implication this could mean
they go along with continuance of
the surtax—later confirmed by
Nixon in a statement. Zwick em
phasized the incoming officials
were not committed to the spec
ifics of the budget.
However, Nixon issued a state
ment giving qualified endorsement
to extension of the surtax, pend
ing studies by his administration
and the Congress in the next few
months.
Johnson urged that, if Congress
votes to keep the surtax, it give
Nixon power to end it or reduce it
before June 30, 1970, if events
warrant this.
Johnson's social security
recommendations would mean a
basic increase of 10 per cent for
all 25 million persons now on the
rolls.
If Johnson's recommendations
are accepted, not only will older
Americans get higher social secur
ity payments but all wage earners
and employers will pay higher
taxes to finance the increases.
The President included $25.7
billion to finance Vietnamese war
operations in the year ahead. He
said this would pay for the cur
rent troop strength and levels of
fighting. These levels are down

somewhat so that the war figure is
$3.5 billion less than that for the
current year.
The President's new proposed
seven-cent rate for a letter stamp
would combine into one rate the
present six-cent first class stamp
and the eight-cent airmail stamp.
In addition, he asked increases
in the single piece third-class mail
rate, chiefly covering advertising
material. All of these postal hikes
would bring in $519 million a
year, he estimated.
Johnson's excise tax recom
mendations would continue the
auto levy at 7 per cent and the
telephone service levy at 10 per
cent for another year.
Both now are scheduled to
drop to 5 per cent on Jan. 1,
1970.

• Rogers On Vietnam
WASHINGTON (AP)-William
P. Rogers, secretary of state-des

administration will aim to get at
the Paris peace talks an "enforce
able agreement" to end the Viet
nam war.
Rogers told an impromptu
news conference after an appear
ance before the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee that he sees
hopeful signs that the world is
coming around to the belief that
"the use of force is not produc

"We desire a negotiated settle

"We want an enforceable agree

• San Fernando State
NORTHRIDGE (AP)-An ac
countant who said he was one of
the "hard-core militants," sued
Wednesday for $50,250 over a
statement that the group had
planned to murder Dr. Delmar T.
Oviatt, acting president of San
Fernando State College.
The libel and slander suit was
filed by Harry A. Carter against
Oviatt and Richard A. Hill, presi
dent of the college's Alumni As
sociation.
The suit said Hill told newsmen
Monday that "hard-core mili
tants" had planned to turn last

Thursday's campus demonstration
into a full riot and kill Oviatt.
Carter called the statement false.
The demonstration brought
286 arrests and convinced Glenn
Mahler, student body president of
"the urgency of the situation."
"We were talking about the de
mands but we were working as if
we had a long time. We just didn't
realize the urgency of it."
Mahler said the whole mood of
the student body had changed
since the demonstrations.
WASHINGTON (AP)-Presi
dent Johnson included a big boost
in Social Security benefits for 25
million Americans in his record
breaking $195.3 billion final bud
get submitted to Congress Wed
nesday.
The largest-ever budget pro
jects a $3.4 billion surplus for
fiscal 1970 beginning next July 1
as a result of his recommendation
for a one-year extension of the 10
per cent income surtax.
It will be up to a Republican
president, Richard M. Nixon, who
takes office Monday, and a Demo
cratic-controlled Congress to
accept or revise the budget in the
months ahead.
But Budget Director Charles J.
Zwick, after frequent consult
ations with Nixon administration
officials in recent weeks, said they
agree on the appropriateness of a
1970 surplus.
By implication this could mean
they go along with continuance of
the surtax—later confirmed by
Nixon in a statement. Zwick em
phasized the incoming officials
were not committed to the spec
ifics of the budget.
However, Nixon issued a state
ment giving qualified endorsement
to extension of the surtax, pend
ing studies by his administration
and the Congress in the next few
months.
Johnson urged that, if Congress
votes to keep the surtax, it give
Nixon power to end it or reduce it
before June 30, 1970, if events
warrant this.
Johnson's social security
recommendations would mean a
basic increase of 10 per cent for
all 25 million persons now on the
rolls.
If Johnson's recommendations
are accepted, not only will older
Americans get higher social secur
ity payments but all wage earners
and employers will pay higher
taxes to finance the increases.
The President included $25.7
billion to finance Vietnamese war
operations in the year ahead. He
said this would pay for the cur
rent troop strength and levels of
fighting. These levels are down

somewhat so that the war figure is
$3.5 billion less than that for the
current year.
The President's new proposed
seven-cent rate for a letter stamp
would combine into one rate the
present six-cent first class stamp
and the eight-cent airmail stamp.
In addition, he asked increases
in the single piece third-class mail
rate, chiefly covering advertising
material. All of these postal hikes
would bring in $519 million a
year, he estimated.
Johnson's excise tax recom
mendations would continue the
auto levy at 7 per cent and the
telephone service levy at 10 per
cent for another year.
Both now are scheduled to
drop to 5 per cent on Jan. 1,
1970.
The President said his surtax
and excise tax proposals would
mean $9.5 billion of additional
revenue for his 1970 budget.
Not only did Johnson estimate
a $3.4 billion surplus in fiscal
1970 but he also projected a $2.4
billion black ink figure for the
current uear, fiscal 1969.
Both Johnson and Zwick called
the budget an extremely tight
one, and there were sure to be
cries in Congress that some pro
grams are underfinanced.

they go along with continuance of
the surtax—later confirmed by
Nixon in a statement. Zwick em
phasized the incoming officials
were not committed to the spec
ifics of the budget.
However, Nixon issued a state
ment giving qualified endorsement
to extension of the surtax, pend
ing studies by his administration
and the Congress in the next few
months.
Johnson urged that, if Congress
votes to keep the surtax, it give
Nixon power to end it or reduce it
before June 30, 1970, if events
warrant this.
Johnson's social security
recommendations would mean a
basic increase of 10 per cent for
all 25 million persons now on the
rolls.
If Johnson's recommendations
are accepted, not only will older
Americans get higher social secur
ity payments but all wage earners
and employers will pay higher
taxes to finance the increases.
The President included $25.7
billion to finance Vietnamese war
operations in the year ahead. He
said this would pay for the cur
rent troop strength and levels of
fighting. These levels are down

somewhat so that the war figure is
$3.5 billion less than that for the
current year.
The President's new proposed
seven-cent rate for a letter stamp
would combine into one rate the
present six-cent first class stamp
and the eight-cent airmail stamp.
In addition, he asked increases
in the single piece third-class mail
rate, chiefly covering advertising
material. All of these postal hikes
would bring in $519 million a
year, he estimated.
Johnson's excise tax recom
mendations would continue the
auto levy at 7 per cent and the
telephone service levy at 10 per
cent for another year.
Both now are scheduled to
drop to 5 per cent on Jan. 1,
1970.
The President said his surtax
and excise tax proposals would
mean $9.5 billion of additional
revenue for his 1970 budget.
Not only did Johnson estimate
a $3.4 billion surplus in fiscal
1970 but he also projected a $2.4
billion black ink figure for the
current uear, fiscal 1969.
Both Johnson and Zwick called
the budget an extremely tight
one, and there were sure to be
cries in Congress that some pro
grams are underfinanced.

Sirhan Talks at Trial
LOS ANGELES (AP>-The
first male prospective juror was
tentatively seated at the Sirhan
Bishara Sirhan murder trial today
and the defendant spoke out for
the first time.
The prosecutor, David N. Fitts,
had asked the juror, Lawrence K.
Morgan: "Would you have the
courage, once deliberating, if first
degree murder was a proper ver
dict in this case, to come down
here and say Mr. Sirhan must die
in the gas chamber?"
Sirhan leaned forward and
smiled at the juror from the
counsel table.
"There, you're getting a good
view of him now and he's smiling
at you," Fitts told Morgan. "He
probably will be smiling at you
for the rest of the trial "
At this point, Sirhan spoke out
in court for the first time since his
trial began Jan. 7.

"I smile at you, too, Mr.
Fitts," he said.
The judge then told Fitts to
stick to questions and make no
comments on Sirhan's behavior.
• Rogers On Vietnam
WASHINGTON (AP)-William
P. Rogers, secretary of state-des
ignate, said Wednesday the Nixon
administration will aim to get at
the Paris peace talks an "enforce
able agreement" to end the Viet
nam war.
Rogers told an impromptu
news conference after an appear
ance before the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee that he sees
hopeful signs that the world is
coming around to the belief that
"the use of force is not produc
tive."
"We desire a negotiated settle
ment on an honorable basis that
satisfies our limited commitments
in Vietnam," Rogers said.
"We want an enforceable agree
ment. Our objectives have not
changed."
• San Fernando State
NORTHRIDGE (AP)-An ac
countant who said he was one of
the "hard-core militants," sued
Wednesday for $50,250 over a
statement that the group had
planned to murder Dr. Delmar T.
Oviatt, acting president of San
Fernando State College.
The libel and slander suit was
filed by Harry A. Carter against
Oviatt and Richard A. Hill, presi
dent of the college's Alumni As
sociation.
The suit said Hill told newsmen
Monday that "hard-core mili
tants" had planned to turn last

Thursday's campus demonstration
into a full riot and kill Oviatt.
Carter called the statement false.
The demonstration brought
286 arrests and convinced Glenn
Mahler, student body president of
"the urgency of the situation."
"We were talking about the de
mands but we were working as if
we had a long time. We just didn't
realize the urgency of it."
Mahler said the whole mood of
the student body had changed
since the demonstrations.
