### 
Student demands for five TA
directed courses were not granted
at a meeting of the political
science faculty yesterday after
noon. The faculty, however, did
accept the principle of student
participation in decisions involv
ing student-initiated course.
Profs. Richard Fagen, Ray
mond Wolfinger, and Richard
Brody, at the department's instru
ction, prepared the following
statement:
The faculty unanimously passed a
resolution approving the principle that
both graduate and undergraduate stu
dents be represented on the Depart
ment committee which will consider
courses initiated and taught by stu
dents Spring Quarter and thereafter.
The Department also instructed its
Plans and Policy Committee to con
sider and report back to the Depart
ment on two student proposals for
dealing with courses initiated and
taught- by students. These two pro
posals were presented to the Depart
ment at the beginning of its meeting.

In response to a student-circulated
petition demanding that five student
led courses be offered In Winter Quar
ter, the Department noted that three
of the five proposed courses are being
offered by faculty members: Marxism,
offered by Prof. North this quarter;
Black Politics, offered by Professor
Greenberg in the Spring Quarter; and
U.S. Diplomatic Problems in the Third
World, offered by Professor Lowen
kopf In the Spring Quarter.
A fourth course, The Greeks, the
Bible, and Marx, was rejected by the
department for the winter quarter with
an invitation to resubmit the proposal
for consideration for the spring quar
ter. The fifth proposed course, A Rad
ical Smorgasbord, was never formally
submitted to the Department.
The Department also noted that
only two of the five courses mentioned
in the student petition had actually
come before the Department with
faculty sponsors willing to give credit
for them. The petition presented to the
Department had 106 signatures, of
which 12 were from declared Political
Science majors.
One ot the two proposals, pre
sented by four undergraduates
who requested and received per
mission to address the meeting,
called for a review committee for
student-initiated courses com
posed of three professors, three
undergraduates, and three gradu
ate students.
The only criteria for accept
ability would be sufficient student
demand and merit of the course.
The unavailability of a qualified
instructor within the department
would merely be reason for an in
tensified effort to find one from
outside.
The other proposal would also
establish a committee to review
new course offerings, but it would
be composed of four faculty
members and four
graduates and two undergradu
ates.

Bible, and Marx, was rejected by the
department for the winter quarter with
an invitation to resubmit the proposal
for consideration for the spring quar
ter. The fifth proposed course, A Rad
ical Smorgasbord, was never formally
submitted to the Department.
The Department also noted that
only two of the five courses mentioned
in the student petition had actually
come before the Department with
faculty sponsors willing to give credit
for them. The petition presented to the
Department had 106 signatures, of
which 12 were from declared Political
Science majors.
One ot the two proposals, pre
sented by four undergraduates
who requested and received per
mission to address the meeting,
called for a review committee for
student-initiated courses com
posed of three professors, three
undergraduates, and three gradu
ate students.
The only criteria for accept
ability would be sufficient student
demand and merit of the course.
The unavailability of a qualified
instructor within the department
would merely be reason for an in
tensified effort to find one from
outside.
The other proposal would also
establish a committee to review
new course offerings, but it would
be composed of four faculty
members and four
graduates and two undergradu
ates.
Student demands for five TA
directed courses were not granted
at a meeting of the political
science faculty yesterday after
noon. The faculty, however, did
accept the principle of student
participation in decisions involv
ing student-initiated course.
Profs. Richard Fagen, Ray
mond Wolfinger, and Richard
Brody, at the department's instru
ction, prepared the following
statement:
The faculty unanimously passed a
resolution approving the principle that
both graduate and undergraduate stu
dents be represented on the Depart
ment committee which will consider
courses initiated and taught by stu
dents Spring Quarter and thereafter.
The Department also instructed its
Plans and Policy Committee to con
sider and report back to the Depart
ment on two student proposals for
dealing with courses initiated and
taught- by students. These two pro
posals were presented to the Depart
ment at the beginning of its meeting.

In response to a student-circulated
petition demanding that five student
led courses be offered In Winter Quar
ter, the Department noted that three
of the five proposed courses are being
offered by faculty members: Marxism,
offered by Prof. North this quarter;
Black Politics, offered by Professor
Greenberg in the Spring Quarter; and
U.S. Diplomatic Problems in the Third
World, offered by Professor Lowen
kopf In the Spring Quarter.
A fourth course, The Greeks, the
Bible, and Marx, was rejected by the
department for the winter quarter with
an invitation to resubmit the proposal
for consideration for the spring quar
ter. The fifth proposed course, A Rad
ical Smorgasbord, was never formally
submitted to the Department.
