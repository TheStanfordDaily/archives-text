# Professional Fellows
## Journalists Come Back To Campus 
### MADELYN SPATT 
Every year, practicing journal
ists come to Stanford for one to
three quarters to study anything
they want except journalism.
They are members of a special fel
lowship program which pays their
tuition plus a stipend of $17{j a
week during the time they are
here.
In practice, the Professional
Journalism Fellowship is a paid
self-improvement course, designed
to return newspeople to the cam
pus so they can improve their
backgrounds in intellectual fields.
The Fellowship is a program
for professionals, run by a profes
sional. Its director is Herbert
Brucker, former editor of The
Hartford Courant. Brucker came
to Stanford to head the program
when it began, two and a half

years ago, shortly after he was
mandatorily retired from the Cour
ant. He plans to leave at the end of
this year, to return to the East
Coast and possibly write a column.
He presently writes a column for
The Palo Alto Times.
No Scholastic Pressures
As Edward Higgins, 37, of The
St. Louis Post Dispatch admitted,
the Fellowship is almost a vaca
tion. There are no outside pres
sures upon the Professional Jour
nalism Fellows (PJF's); nothing is
required. This separates the PJFs
from the other students, whom
they believe go to college for
marks and degrees.
"We have none of the stigma of
going to school," said Peter Kil
bom, 29, of McGraw-Hill World

Nr-ws. "We don't have tests to
pass or papers to hand in, so we
don't avoid courses because
they're tough. We're in classes be
cause we want to be there."
Enthusiasm For Courses
This type of exposure to the
university-the opportunity to
satisfy pure intellectural curiosity
ma I es the PJFs very enthusiastic
about their courses. Each of them
conies to Stanford with an idea of
whst he wants to learn.
Donald Meisner, 30, copy edi
tor for The Milwaukee Journal,
came to study military affairs.
This quarter he is auditing Profes
sor George's course in force and
diplomacy in the political science
department. Other popular sub
jects for PJFs are economics,
history, sociology, computer
science and, surprisingly, modern
sculpture.
Interests In Varied Subjects
"Art is an important part of
our culture," said Patricia Doyl,
38, one PJF who took this course.
Mrs. Doyle has had more contact
with students and schools than
the other Fellows. She is presently
education editor of The Kansas
City Star and visits campuses
across the midwest as part of her
job. She found education courses
here are designed to produce
teachers and so branced out to
genetics, intellectual history and
cultural transmission (anthropol
ogy).
PJFs choose courses on some
of the same bases other students
do. They look for good teachers
and subjects they think will help
in their work. Last quarter, Peter
Kilborn took Economics I with
Professor Bach to see how econ
omics has been transformed in the
past ten years. He has also taken
computer science, in order to under
stand changes he sees in the
society.
Not all the PJFs want the same
type of intellectual experience.
Donald Hudson, a writer for To
oday a newspaper in Cape
Kennedy, Fla., is studying linguis
tics. According to him, language is
the tool he works with as a writer,
and he should learn more about it.
Stanford 'Disappointing'
After one quarter, PJFs have
developed definite opir ions about
Stanford, California and the stu
dents of today.
Of the school?
"A disappointment," according
to Kilborn. "It's known as the
Harvard of the West and I ex

pected a lot. I've never been to
Harvard, though, so I might be
disappointed in that also."
Outraged Reaction To Students
The reaction of the PJFs to the
students is often outraged, often
led by the belief that experience
will kill most student ideals.
Donald Meisner, a University of
Wisconsin student during the late
19505, found SDS reminiscent of
the old Wisconsin Socialist club.
His own collegiate flight to social
ism has been modified since. He
presently professes himself a
"middle-of-the-road Democrat."
Th';s is a move to the left from his
conservative Republican family
background.
Other PJFs are not so tolerant
of student rejection of the status
quo.
"The majority of the students
here profit from the established
system," said Peter Kilborn. "Yet
they want to destroy it." is
protest always bad?
"A certain amount," he said,
"can only help—protest against
race injustice—for equal rights."
He drew a line at some economic
protests.
"They don't realize what
they're advocating. Today, they
want to tax inheritances out of
existence. In a few years, they'll
want to take over the family bus
iness. Then, attitudes will
change."
'A White Man's School'
"This is still a white man's
school," said Meisner. Other PJFs
in the study lounge criticized this
definition. "White," he answered,
"in terms of upper middle class
per capita incomes. High tuition
and acadmic requirements insure
that."
Contact with DAILY
The major social contact the
Fellows had with undergraduates
last quarter was a dinner arranged
in October to bring together PJFs
and Daily editors. PJFs compared
it with their own college meetings
with professionals. Brenton
Welling, Jr., transportation editor
of Business Week is a former
member of the staffs of the Har
vard Crimson.
"When the Niemann fellows
came to speak, we listened." The
Niemann program at Harvard was
the prototype for the PJF pro
gram here.
Mor.t of the PJFs thought one
of the reasons for student journal
ists not listening was that they
h« ve no plans for journalism as a

career. They found the contact in
teresting, if not always ego-build
ing.
"I usually have two drinks be
fore a dinner," said Don Meisner,
"but I criticized a Daily staffer on
his opinion on journalism. I never
got the second drink. I had my
opinion well, he had his."
'Students Reject Us'
Welling, at 40 one of the oldest
PJFs, summarized the viewpoints
of the undergraduates in one sen
tence. "Today's students reject us
and our values."
When he spoke as a prospective
employer, he was definite on what
would happei: to arrogant begin
ners who thought they knew
everything. "Anyone like that
wouldn't get anywhere in my or
ganization. I'd take arrogance
once, but after that I think the
line is 'I think you'd be happier
somewhere else' "
Yet, PJFs are not always un
sympathetic to student protests.
Edward Higgins, after a trip to
San Francisco State, thought
there were some points to the pro
test, though it had gotten out of
hand. He mentioned TA salaries
and other academic issues he
thought should be protested,
where inequities have persisted for
years, but are first being publi
cized now.
As society becomes more com
plex, there will be more programs
established to bring professionals
back to the campus. The PJFs
agreed a six month "intellectual
holiday" every five years might be
useful. Herbert Brucker, the direc
tor sees return to campus pro
grams as an inevitable trend.
Doctors have been doing it since
World War I.
Financial Difficulties Foreseen
The Stanford program, how
ever, is presently in financial dif
ficulty. The Ford Foundation
grant, which seeded it, is sche
duled to run out this year.
Brucker does not think the pro
gram will die, though. It is too
firmly established. There will
probably however, be many less
than the 26 Fellows presently en
rolled after this year.
According to Brucker, eventu
ally employers will recognize the
necessity of paying the way for
their own employees to partici
pate.
"It will become a necessity,"
he said. "The world is moving so
fast a college education becomes
outmoded."
