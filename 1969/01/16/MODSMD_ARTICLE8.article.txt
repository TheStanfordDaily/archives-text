# Notes From Paris
## The 						Death Of A Myth 
### MICHAEL L. SCHWARTZ 
"The events of May and June"
as one now euphemistically calls
it, has been and continues to be
the object of diverse interpreta
tions. Andre Malraux, writer and
current Minister of Culture,
termed it a "crisis of civilization".
Raymond Aron, historian and
sociologist, put it in the context
of P.M. Proudhon's remark of
1848, "One has made a revolution
without an idea. The French
nation is a nation of comedians.
"Not even the many student
leaders were agreed to its meaning
or purpose, a fact which was often
obscured by , the "solidarite" ex
hibited by the mass of students in
face of a common enemy, police
repression.
Leaving the interpretation of
May and June to historical debate,
a more immediately important
question concerns the transforma
tion of the "movement" which
has taken place since spring of last
year. The cry is often heard, "con
tinuons le combat" but because
the "combat" has moved from the
barricades of the Quartier Latin to
the debates in universities, the
latent divisions between student
groups concerning political phil
osophy and tactics have now
come to the surface.
Thus the most fundamental
transformation which has taken
place is the death of a myth, the
mvth of the unity of purpose

which had once united student
masses and also many professors
and workers.
Political Battle
To some students, who are
often referrrd to by the ambigu
ous name of "enrage", to con
tinue the "combat" means to con
tinue an essentially political bat
tle. The goal is not only to change
the structures and purpose of the
university, but also to make radi
cal transformations to society it
self. Nevertheless, even in this
group there is more of a consensus
of tactics than of purpose.
The newspaper Le Monde
found at least five different
Trotskyite and at least three dif
ferent pro-chinese movements, a
variety of groups based on castro
ism and guevaraism, and seven or
eight varieties of anarchistic or
revolutionary communistic
groups.
The tactics of the "enrages",
which often "involve force, were
evident when they manhandled,
insulted, and held hostage for sev
eral hours the president of the Un
iversity of Nanterre. Furthermore,
student leader Jacques Sauvageot
seems to speak for them all when
he said, "We are preparing for the

overthrow of the regime; we don't
deny it."
Attempt Tor Reform
To others, to continue the
"combat" means to work
uniquely towards a profound re
form of the university. This
group, however, is divided also be
tween those who are willing to
participate in the recent reform
law passed by the government and
those unwilling, because they be
lieve it is merely a token, an at
tempt at appeasement.
To still others, the out-moded
structures of the university are no
where nearly as dangerous as the
threat posed by the "gauchistes"
(leftists). The confrontation be
tween right and left wing students
have been somewhat less than
cordial. On one occasion the edi
torial office of a leftist news
paper was ransaked which subse
quently led to the burning of a
cafe which had been a hangout for
rightists students (act of reprai
sal).
Finally, but not least of all,
there are those, "Conformists" as
they are called, who seem to be
more concerned with passing their
exams than in participating ithe
political debates or the reform

projects. Their number is far from
negligible.
Revolutionary Zeal
In the hope of reigniting the
revolutionary zeal which had
united students last May and
June, student "enrages" have
adopted a program of action
which often includes student
strikes and harassment of profes
sors and university administrators.
Their tactics, however, instead of
sparking unity, are annoying the
general public and alienating
many would-be followers.
As one professor commented
after the newly appointed presi
dent of Nanterrre University had
been held hostage by students,
"After the night of May 10, thou
sands of professors protested by
parading in the streets of Paris
their solidarity with the students
and their indignation in the face
of brutal repression—l was among
them. I hope that today, the same
cry of indignation arises through
out France among the entire
teaching corps."

The future of the french uni
versityis at stake and the pros
pects are not altogether encourag
ing.

of P.M. Proudhon's remark of
1848, "One has made a revolution
without an idea. The French
nation is a nation of comedians.

Leaving the interpretation of
May and June to historical debate,
a more immediately important
question concerns the transforma

has taken place since spring of last

the "combat" has moved from the
barricades of the Quartier Latin to
the debates in universities, the
latent divisions between student
groups concerning political phil
osophy and tactics have now
come to the surface.
Thus the most fundamental
transformation which has taken
place is the death of a myth, the

which had once united student
masses and also many professors
and workers.
Political Battle
To some students, who are
often referrrd to by the ambigu
ous name of "enrage", to con
tinue the "combat" means to con
tinue an essentially political bat
tle. The goal is not only to change
the structures and purpose of the
university, but also to make radi
cal transformations to society it
self. Nevertheless, even in this
group there is more of a consensus
of tactics than of purpose.
The newspaper Le Monde
found at least five different
Trotskyite and at least three dif
ferent pro-chinese movements, a
variety of groups based on castro
ism and guevaraism, and seven or
eight varieties of anarchistic or
revolutionary communistic
groups.
The tactics of the "enrages",
which often "involve force, were
evident when they manhandled,
insulted, and held hostage for sev
eral hours the president of the Un
iversity of Nanterre. Furthermore,
student leader Jacques Sauvageot
seems to speak for them all when
he said, "We are preparing for the

overthrow of the regime; we don't
deny it."
Attempt Tor Reform
To others, to continue the
"combat" means to work
uniquely towards a profound re
form of the university. This
group, however, is divided also be
tween those who are willing to
participate in the recent reform
law passed by the government and
those unwilling, because they be
lieve it is merely a token, an at
tempt at appeasement.
To still others, the out-moded
structures of the university are no
where nearly as dangerous as the
threat posed by the "gauchistes"
(leftists). The confrontation be
tween right and left wing students
have been somewhat less than
cordial. On one occasion the edi
torial office of a leftist news
paper was ransaked which subse
quently led to the burning of a
cafe which had been a hangout for
rightists students (act of reprai
sal).
Finally, but not least of all,
there are those, "Conformists" as
they are called, who seem to be
more concerned with passing their
exams than in participating ithe
political debates or the reform

projects. Their number is far from
negligible.
Revolutionary Zeal
In the hope of reigniting the
revolutionary zeal which had
united students last May and
June, student "enrages" have
adopted a program of action
which often includes student
strikes and harassment of profes
sors and university administrators.
Their tactics, however, instead of
sparking unity, are annoying the
general public and alienating
many would-be followers.
As one professor commented
after the newly appointed presi
dent of Nanterrre University had
been held hostage by students,
"After the night of May 10, thou
sands of professors protested by
parading in the streets of Paris
their solidarity with the students
and their indignation in the face
of brutal repression—l was among
them. I hope that today, the same
cry of indignation arises through
out France among the entire
teaching corps."

The future of the french uni
versityis at stake and the pros
pects are not altogether encourag
ing.
