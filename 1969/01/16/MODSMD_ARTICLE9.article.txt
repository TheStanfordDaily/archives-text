in his position until the beginning
of the next volume with the aid of
Assistant News Editor Craig Wil
son.

Dawson, who will remain a
writer for the paper, said he de

the lead .story in yesterday's
paper, "SDS Disrupts Board Over
Asia Relations," in which the
scuffle between demonstrators
and administrators was not de
scribed in detail. He objected to
its failure to mention names of
demonstrators. He also opposed
the editorial which asserted that
SDS's demands were justified
though their tactics were not ap
pealing.
