DONT
LOOK
WOW
But you
may be about
to blow
your life
A
JL A.n astonishing number of
people make a stupid and tragic
mistake. To put it simply, they
jump into careers without really
looking. The result —a dreary life
of frustration and anger.
Can this happen to you? Could
be—unless you can answer ques
tions like these to your own satis
faction before you make your move:
Are you really a Chief...or an
Indian?
Do you belong in a big organi
zation? Or a small one? Or do you
belong by yourself?
Can you really stand pressure?
There are a great many serious
questions you must ask —and an
swer —about a career. But the most
critical are the ones you ask your
self about vow. Unless you can an
swer them honestly, it makes little
sense to ask, for example, "What's
it really like to be an investment
banker?"
Careers Today can tell you
what it's like to be an investment
banker. More important, this
meaningful new magazine can help
you decide whether becoming an
investment banker is even a sen
sible option for you in the first
place!
It's a magazine about careers
that starts not with jobs, but with
people. And it's dedicated to the
proposition that you must do your
own thing...and that if you don't,
you run the grave risk of blowing
your life.
Careers Today is relevant. For
people who are searching...from
people who have discovered how to
do their own thing.
How about you? Could you use
a little truth at this point in your
search?

But you
may be about

your life
A
JL A.n astonishing number of
people make a stupid and tragic
mistake. To put it simply, they
jump into careers without really
looking. The result —a dreary life
of frustration and anger.
Can this happen to you? Could
be—unless you can answer ques
tions like these to your own satis
faction before you make your move:
Are you really a Chief...or an
Indian?
Do you belong in a big organi
zation? Or a small one? Or do you
belong by yourself?
Can you really stand pressure?
There are a great many serious
questions you must ask —and an
swer —about a career. But the most
critical are the ones you ask your
self about vow. Unless you can an
swer them honestly, it makes little
sense to ask, for example, "What's
it really like to be an investment
banker?"
Careers Today can tell you
what it's like to be an investment
banker. More important, this
meaningful new magazine can help
you decide whether becoming an
investment banker is even a sen
sible option for you in the first
place!
It's a magazine about careers
that starts not with jobs, but with
people. And it's dedicated to the
proposition that you must do your
own thing...and that if you don't,
you run the grave risk of blowing
your life.
Careers Today is relevant. For
people who are searching...from
people who have discovered how to
do their own thing.
How about you? Could you use
a little truth at this point in your
search?
