# Freshmen Share Double Life As Mirror Image

### BARBARA HYLAND 
The twins in the Doublemint
gum commercials may speak of
doubling your pleasure, doubling
your fun, but what is it really like
to have a double, to have an ident
ical twin?
There are several pairs of twins
at Stanford who share this experi
ence, but for most people looking
in a mirror is as close as they will
ever come to having a counter
part.
Mark and Skip Justman, twins
in the freshman class, sat on op
posite sides of the table in the
Union and talked about their situ
ation. Skip said he enjoyed being
interviewed since "we never talk
to each other about being twins."
He explained that the advantage

of being a twin is that "We always
have someone to do something
with."
Mark continued that in sports
like sailing, "We act together."
Each can sense what the other will
do. They have been tested for
special ESP abilities sometimes
found in twins, but the tests were
negative.
They have the same interests in
most activities. In debating and
traveling having a twin is espec
ially useful since it means an eas
ily available partner.
Must Question Ideas
Mark explained that having a
twin kept him from being dog
matic and conservative. When
their opinions differ Mark feels
that he must question his own

ideas. Since they both have had
the same environment, something
else must explain the difference.
Skip agreed and said that when
he differs from Mark he sees his
own idea in a new perspective.
"You stop assuming it's the na
tural state of the world and start
analyzing it."
"The meaning of life is to ana
lyze yourself," Mark said. If you
have a twin, there's "twice as
much to think about," Skip went
on. "A twin is an extension of
yourself. I see the world
through myself and him."
Mark said this has led to toler
ance not only towards his brother
but to others. Because of being a
twin he feels that he has a greater

"sympathy and willingness to
understand other people."
'One Entity*
Feeling that he and his brother
are "one entity" has not always
been a completely comfortable
situation according to Mark. They
passed through a critical stage.
They were both "super-sensitive"
of each other's faults, often ig
noring their own. "You think
people will attribute his faults to
you," Mark said.
Neither sees the confusion in
appearance as a real disadvantage.
Physically their distinguishing
characteiistic is a birthmark on
Skip's back, which, Mark re
marked, means "You have to get
pretty intimate to tell us apart."
He said, however, "It's easy to tell

us apart after a month. People ex
pect us to be exactly alike but
after they know us for about a
month they find two individuals."
Pressured To Break
Skip said that "some people
consider you a freak" if you don't
separate from your twin. He sal ■
they arc pressured to break away
but they've tried to overcome
their concern for society.
Being an identical twin means
more than bearing an outward re
semblance to another person. The
natural way Mark and Skip Just
man continually avoid saying "I"
and refer to themselves as "we"
points to the unique bond be
tween twins that surpasses phys
ical similarities.

DOUBLE VlSlON—ldentical twins, Mark and Skip Justman, believe
that "If you're a twin, there's twice as much to think about." At least,
they can always put their heads together.
