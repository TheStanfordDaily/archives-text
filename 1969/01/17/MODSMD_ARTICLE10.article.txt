# A 						Conspiracy Of Two
## Education For Self-Determination 
### JEFREY BLUM DANIEL SNELL 
on the basis of uniformed emo
tional impulses," a graduating
senior mourned last week, talking
| about the process of applying to
i graduate schools.
He felt he had no rational basis
on which to decide things, how
ever, and it seems that somewhere
along the line he has not been
helped to practice rational self
determination.
As we have said, self-determin
ation is independent thought lead
ing to free, self-imposed choice
and action. It is the ability and
opportunity to decide critically
what your own future will be like.
We can have it really only
when we are aware of all the pos
sibilities for our lives and have the
chance to evaluate each
alternative. Self-deti nation,
like conscious awareness oes not
automatically occur in thi college
educated youth like legs on a tad
pole. It must be actively sought
by the mind.
Educational institutions have
long pretended to have self-deter
mination as a goal. At Stanford
we are told that knowledge and
the disciplines gained through aca
demic work help to make free
men free. If the university is really

serious about maximizing free
dom, then here are some sugges
tions in how it might begin.
Self-determination begins to be
possible when students become
aware of the decisions they will
have to make and are able to learn
about the whole range of options
open to them. Shortly after grad
uation the student must choose an
occupation. Often the choice is
permanent.
Rather than have such an im
portant decision made on impulse
because of a persuasive recruiter,
or arbitrarily by the choice of an
unoppressive major, the Univer
sity should tackle directly the
problem of vocational education.
It should actively solicit in
formation about different occupa
tions and life-styles in order to
show the student how corporation
executives live as opposes to hip
pies, monks, novelists, professors,
realtors and craftsmen. We are not
talking about an expanded place
ment service, though that might
be part of it; we are talking about
making the undergraduate years a
time for thorough examination of
possible individual futures.
But it is not enough for stu
dents merely to be aware of al

ternative life styles if they are to
have the freedom to determine
how they will live. They must be
given the chance to evaluate them,
and thereby make them genuine
possibilities for themselves.
Rather than channel students into
existing institutions, the Univer
sity should present them along
with feasible alternatives, have
students actively evaluate all the
possibilities and choose for them
selves the paths they wish to fol
low. In order to be free, students
must be prepared to evaluate their
options, and academic courses
that encourage life-style evalua
tion are an excellent beginning.
Everyone agrees that education
is the development of skills of cri
tical thought and their application
to a number of fields and discip
lines. The specific forms of critical
thought are direct experimenta
tion whenever possible, or else re
search into the opinions and state
ments of learned men
Why not apply the same con
cepts of critical thought, experi
mentation and research to the
problem of self-determination?
Students should be encouraged to
try out a wide range of residences
which differ with respect to group
size, group composition, how

people are located within the res
ilience, and how people function
together as a group. Students
should also be able to experience
a great variety of potentially inter
esting professions and avocations
either directly when possible or
else vicariously through consulta
tion with those closely involved.
Only by this virtually unlimited
freedom to experiment can stu
dents relate the ideas of the class
room to their own experience.
This raises an important point,
that the capacity for self-deter
mination is enhanced by actually
practicing self-determination.
While at the University students
should be given control of their
own lives. Students' actions
should be regulated whenever pos
sible by their own decisions,
rather than the externally im
posed assignments of professors
and regulations of administrators.
Maximizing self-determination
would involve both freeing stu
dents from external regulations
and giving them the opportunity
to develop their own modes of
conduct regarding both academic
and social matters. Residences
would be entirely self-governing
and course work would be deter
mined largely by students acting
upon advice from professors.
Grades and normal curves could
no longer be used as the basic
measure of performance since
each person would maintain his
own criteria.
The student would define his
own basic goals rather than wait
for them to be imposed upon him
from above in the form of artifi
cial punishments and rewards at
tached to academic work. Such
things would be involved in the
actual practice of self-determina
tion.
Suggestions like these could
most likely never be fully imple
mented. But they could serve as
an ideal toward whiph the Univer
sity could move if it chose to. If
students seek to maximize their
own self-determination both with
in the University and after they
leave, then a university dedicated
toward this end is in their own in
terests, and students should see
that.
But it is not necessarily in the
interests of faculty and adminis
trators.
The necessity of different seg
ments within the university to co
exist with each other requires that
each segment restrict some of its
interests in order to preserve the
rights of others. But this necessity
neither requires nor justified
wholesale abandonment of one's
own interests.

ford maximizes self-determina
tion.)
