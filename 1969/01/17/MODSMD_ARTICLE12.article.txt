## Black Comedy Overcomes Tedium 
### BOB O'MEALLY 
Moments of bawdy, amusing
circumstance and a first-rate cast
of players almost rescue Joseph
Okpaku's "The Virtues of Adult
ery," currently at the Little The
atre, from its overall effect of ted
iousness.
The BBC prize-winning "amus
ing tragedy" works best as a light
hearted burlesque. Ivan McDonald
and Fieter Jan Van Niel are cast as
two old friends who decide to
play a trick on Van Niel's wife to
secure a divorce from her. Con
trivances and spoofs involving a
pompous, crooked judge are suc
cessful and fun.
Tony Ade wale-Mendes, un
questionably the outstanding per
former in the production, plays
the judge, Chief Ewa (black-eyed
peas) Fineface. He rolls about the
stage with his wooden scepter cal

ling for order in good "Here
Comes the Judge" fashion.
"The Virtues of Adultery"
then attempts to be more than a
comedyâ€”worse still it tries desper
ately to be "meaningful." "How
difficult it is to live out our tragi
comic lives," says Van Niel in an
unnecessary and melodramatic
soliloquy. "Even God gives for
giveness. . . Please, I'm so sorry."
Is there nowhere one can go to
escape such weighty words? Long
(and boring) pauses, agonizing
grimaces and heavy exhortations
for mercy climax this light, fun
skit. Without the last scene the
play is amusing and entertaining.
With the last scene, the play is
mediocre.
Also featured is "The Silhou
ette of God," a pantomime with
accompanying narration spoken
by Dr. Currie. The dancers sweep
beautifully and orgiastically
around an "altar," gesturing and
flowing beneath black sheets and
behind white masks. Okpaku
gives, in the narration, a black per
spective of the coming of white,
Christian missionaries to Africa.
He uses sharp irony and subtle
understatement to poetically ex
plain the viewpoint of the native
Africans. The stage is lit only with
candles, so that the effect is eerie
and haunting. Of the two plays,
this is the one you will remember.
It is definitely worth seeing.
