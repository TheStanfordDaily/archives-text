Forty figure drawings-done
during the past year and a half by
Stanford Art Prof. Keith Boyle
will be exhibited at Stanford Art
Gallery from Jan. 17 to Feb. 16.
The exhibition, Boyle's third at
the University Gallery since he
joined the art faculty in 1962,
represents his work from weekly
drawing sessions with his studio
mates Frank Lobdell and Nathan
Oliveira, also of the Stanford Art
Department.
Boyle's drawings are in marked
contrast to the paintings on which
his national reputation has been
built. His drawings are soft and
subtle, with the figure positions
mostly at ease. His painting style
uses almost electrically brilliant

colors to convey a challenge of
hard edge, tension, and directness.
Man's cultural milieu is the
theme of most of Boyle's paint
ing. The familiar signs of civiliza
tion—arrows, fluorescent colors,
the chevron, railroad tracks, pro
pellers, dotted lines—appear in
them boldly, sharply, and cleanly.
On his drawings, Boyle com
ments, "The drawings are a differ
ent way of dealing with visual
ideas. I enjoy drawing and evolv
ing space ideas as they relate to
my painting.. Each way supports
theother, evolves the other."
Stanford Art Gallery is open to
the public without charge from 10
a.m. to 5 p.m. Tuesdrough Satur
day, and from 1 to 5 p.m. on Sun
day. It is closed Mondays.
