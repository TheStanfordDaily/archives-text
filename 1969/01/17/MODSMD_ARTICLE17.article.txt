## Librarian To Give Final Concert 
### DAVID DAVENPORT 
After spending nearly eight
years commuting from San
Francisco to opera capitals of
Europe, Africa, and Australia,
Stanford librarian Raymond Nils
son will give a farewell concert
Sunday at St. Mark's Episcopal
Church in Palo Alto at 5 p.m.,
then leave for Australia to further

Performing as principal tenor
in the San Francisco Opera Com
pany since its origin in 1961, Nils
son has combined his work there
with appearances abroad and serv

At age 27, Nilsson left a secure
teaching post in Sydney and went
to England for study in opera. In
1954, he joined the Royal Opera
Company of Convent Garden as
the principal tenor, and made
numerous broadcasts over the
BBC.
Since coming to San Francisco,
Nilsson has been inconstant de
mand for performances in Eng

land, Germany, Holland, Belgium,
Australia, and South Africa, re
ceiving leaves of absence from his
library work for these engage
ments. While at Stanford, he has
given concerts for the Library
Staff Association fund, appeared
in the student production of "Fal

staff," and last year gave a concert
for students in the Memorial Aud
itorium.
A former rugby player, Nilsson
has thoroughly enjoyed working
with the Stanford rugby team. He
also helped to bring cricket to the
Stanford campus.
Mr. Nilsson has refused most
overseas engagements for the past
year, wanting to spend the time
with his wife and three children.
But now, he has decided that he
must move on to pursue his ca
reer. After performances in Aus
tralia and New Zealand, he will ac
cept a position as Professor of
Singing at the Conservatorium of
Music in Sydney, a great honor
since he received his early training
there.
