## Paris Peace Table Settled 
### 
PARIS (AP)—With a long pro
cedural deadlock broken, the
Vietnam peace talks will resume
Saturday, two days before Presi
dent Johnson leaves office.
The United States and North
Vietnam announced Thursday the
breakthrough on the debate over
the conference table, eight
months and 8,000 dead Ameri
cans after they first met in Paris
to begin talks on ways to get
peace negotiations going.
Ambassador W. Averell Harri
man, who retires as head of the
U.S. delegation Sunday, said the
solution was a victory for neither
side—the United States and South
Vietnam on one side and North
Vietnam and the Viet Cong's Na
tional Liberation Front on the
other.
The delegations will sit down
at an unmarked round table, as
North Vietnam demanded But at
each side will be a rectangular
table for secretaries, satisfying
South Vietnam's Demands for the
appearance of a two-sided confer
ence.
Harriman expressed hope the
conference could move quickly to
talks on the substance of peace,
possibly by the time Ambassador
Henry Cabot Lodge arrives to suc
ceed him within 10 days.

PARIS (AP)—With a long pro

Vietnam peace talks will resume
Saturday, two days before Presi

The United States and North
Vietnam announced Thursday the
breakthrough on the debate over
the conference table, eight
months and 8,000 dead Ameri
cans after they first met in Paris
to begin talks on ways to get
peace negotiations going.
Ambassador W. Averell Harri
man, who retires as head of the
U.S. delegation Sunday, said the
solution was a victory for neither
side—the United States and South
Vietnam on one side and North
Vietnam and the Viet Cong's Na
tional Liberation Front on the
other.
The delegations will sit down
at an unmarked round table, as
North Vietnam demanded But at
each side will be a rectangular
table for secretaries, satisfying
South Vietnam's Demands for the
appearance of a two-sided confer
ence.
Harriman expressed hope the
conference could move quickly to
talks on the substance of peace,
possibly by the time Ambassador
Henry Cabot Lodge arrives to suc
