• Faculty Opposes SDS
Editor, THE DAILY :
In its recent editorial, "SDS
and the Trustees," The Stanford
Daily seeks to explain away the
unfortunate and completely unac
ceptable behavior of the SDS
mobsters who disrupted the meet
ing of the Trustees on Tuesday,
Jan. 14. The admits to
"shortcomings in their tactics,"
but asks for sympathetic under
standing of their goals. The "per
sonal and collective style" pre
sumably is to be overlooked in
favor of "the convictions which
lie behind," which would seem to
argue that the ends justify the
means regardless of who or how
many might disagree with the
"ends." This view recalls highly

unpleasant memories of Adolph
Hilter and Nazi Germany.
We believe that it is time for all
of us in the Stanford community
to draw a clear distinction be
tween issues and behavior, and to
recognize disagreeable and disrup
tive behavior for exactly what it is
and what it does to us. We urge
prompt and decisive disciplinary
measures for those involved in
Tuesday's disgrace. Certain rules
of behavior, as earlier agreed upon
by this community, clearly were
violated despite ample opportuni
ties that exist for lawful protest.
Such protest is a means for publi
cizing views on current problems
and for seeking, within the limits
of acceptable behavior, the sup
port of the majority in legitimate
action. But the right of protest

does not convey the right to dis
rupt, to destroy, or to violate the
rights of others.
We hold that everyone is en
titled to argue his own beliefs, but
we favor appropriate disciplinary
action against those who adopt
storm—trooper tactics toward
achieving their ends.

• Look To The Bust
Editor, THE DAILY:
An undergrad was busted for
marijuana and Stanford SDS in
vaded a meeting of the Board of
Trustees, but only with 40 people.
People in SDS, like most of you,
smoke marijuana. People from
one end of campus to the other
are selling, smoking, storing the
weed; lots of people. An under
grad was busted for marijuana,
and everyone is silent.
If SDS were interested in the
popularity of a cause alone, they
would have made this theater of
the absurd, this marijuana game, a
cause celebre. But 40 people, al
most exclusively Stanford under
graduates, demanded an end to
Stanford imperialism, not an end
to police on campus or legalizing
of marijuana. And 40 people are
not enough. Forty of my friends,
according to the usual pronounce
ments of Willard Wyman, Joel
Smith, Kenneth Pitzer, will have
to suffer, for their insult to cor
porate power.
Willard Wyman pulled the trig
ger on that marijuana bust, he
called the cops. (Doesn't Bill
smoke too?) But as far as the in
terests of students are concerned
Bill is an honorable man. Bill and
Joel are the handsome handpicked
team who move through the polit
ical demonstrations casually
throwing out carefree banter to
their radical friends; until the
proper moment when it comes
time to take each name, label each
photograph, and pick out those
people they know.
Last year Bill Wyman was the
nice guy who was sure convincing
when he said that the union sit-in
made him decide to quit his job as
chief administration fink. This
year he is not quite so nice; and
he is not quite so convincing. Wil
lard—Wyman—nice—guy called the
cops on a Stanford undergrad who
had some grass. And the Stanford
campus is silent...as all good ma
jorities are supposed to be.

• Deplore SDS Tactics
Editor, THE DAILY:
(This is a copy of a letter addres
sed to the Board of Trustees:)
On behalf of the Committee
for New Demoncratic Politics, we
deplore the tactics which some of
our fellow students employed in
disrupting your recent meeting on
the Stanford campus. However,
we would like to vigorously affirm
the importance of some of the is
sues which were obscured by the
physical disturbance.
First, despite the use of inap
propriate tactics, Tuesday's dis
turbance indicated the need for
more meetings of the Trustees on
campus. This is imperative if we
would hope to improve rapport
between yourselves and Stanford
students. We would further en
courage the opening of your meet
ings not just to either token
spokesmen or uncontrollable
mobs, but to small groups of stu
dents representing divergent cam
pus views. We realize that this
could delay the consideration of
some business of peculiar interest
to yourselves. We feel, however,
that student—Trustee understand
ing could be improved if students
could become better acquainted
with you on personal and official
levels. Our final suggestion is that
you consider seriously the sub
stance, and not the method of
presentation, of the student con
cerns which were at issue Jan. 14.
American international involve
ment and conflict of interest are

subjects which students want to
discuss with you on a rational
level, not just in selective and un
representative one's and two's,
but rather in groups. We would
like to establish communication
now while it is still possible.

• 'Shape Up Or Ship Out'
Editor, THE DAILY:
I plead equal time to address
the Student Body.
You dissenting students some
how don't get the picture. The
university, this particular Univer
sity, does not belong to you, nor,
as temporary and maturing family
members, is it your right or privi
lege to tell your mother you'll eat
strained bananas but not spinach.
A vintage vaudeville idol, Harry
Lauder, told his demanding aud
iences, "I'm giving you what I
think is good for you" and they
loved him for it. It was their right
not to attend his show if they
didn't like it. It was his right to
defend not the entire entertain
ment world's policy, but his par
ticular interpretation of it.
You dissenters must think the
Trustees and alumni are doddering
and spineless, but we assure you—
we advise you—the Stanford In
dian is alive and doing well.
A council of Elders has yet to
be called to powwow. The scat
tered tribes will convene to ask of
you dissenting braves, "What is
your right to be here, punk?"
Beware the ritual smoke sig
nals. They spell out the old Indian
message, "Shape up or ship out".
