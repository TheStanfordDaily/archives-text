# Big Game Revisited
## Tribe Five Guns For Powerful Bears 
### FRED MANN 
Don Griffin and Company only
play one basketball game this
weekend. But, by the time it is
over, they undoubtedly will be
very thankful for the vacation.
The Indians travel to Berkeley
tonight to face the big, bad Bears
of Coach Jim Padgett. As in the
football version of Big Game, the
Tribe is the underdog.
California, with a 7-4 record on
the season, was picked by many
for the second spot in this year's
Pacific Eight conference race.
Thus far, barring a few hard luck
losses, the Oskies have lived up to
those predictions.
Sporting perhaps the best soph
omore in the conference in the
person of Jackie Ridgle, Cal has
become quite a scoring machine,
averaging 80 points a game. Ridgle
is currently going at a 20.6 point
per game clip, and center Bob
Presley is averaging 16.7.
Aside from Ridgle, 6-4, and
Presley, 6-11, other starters on the
tall squad include Paul Loveday,
6-10, Charlie Johnson, 6-0, and
Waddell Blackwell, 6-0.
The front line for the Bears has
averaged a whopping 54 rebounds
a game, compared to Stanford's
40. Johnson and Blackwell are
rated two of the quickest guards
on the Coast, and have terrorized
opponents with their adept pas
sing and defense all year long.
Furthermore, Coach Padgett
has managed to utilize his bench
strength consistently. It is essen

tially a ten man team, with last
year's starter Trent Gaines, and
Bill Duwe working as swing men.
At first glance, it would seem
that the Bears are close to unbeat
able, yet they are still having
trouble jelling as a team. Their
overtime loss to Washington last
weekend on a questionable referee
decision may help to fire up the
club for their battle with the In
dians.
Coach Howie Dallmar's cagers
will need no help to get up for the
contest. "There should be no
problem being the underdog
against California," the coach
commented. "The team is as
ready as could possibly be for this
important game."
Star guard Don Griffin shared
Dallmar's belief that the squad is
ready for battle. "We all believe
that we can win," he stated. "It
will be tough, but they can be
beaten."
Griff can look forward to more
tight guarding from the two Cal
guards. Against Washington and
Washington State, he was double
teamed nearly every time he hand
led the ball, and still banged in 39
points. He is currently second in
the league in scoring, behind only
UCLA's Lew Alcindor.
Tonight is a real test," said Dal
lmar. "We are simply going to for
get the misfortune of last week
end and concentrate on playing
against a big, strong and active
California team."

Perhaps the kev to the ball
game will be in Stanford's ability
to score in the first half. In the
Cards' nine losses, cold shooting
before intermissions has been the
major trouble. Usually down at
the half, the Indians have become,
by necessity, a second half team.
In their encounter with Washing
ton however, the team could not
find the hoop during the second
period either, and lost by 17
points.
Stanford's inability to hit early
in their games has also caused
problems with their passing.
"When the kids get behind early,
they hurry their passes in order to
get off more shots," the coach re
marked. "Hurried passes are usual
ly bad passes," he concluded.
The team should play a more
cautious game tonight in Cal's
Harmon Gym. Realizing that they
can not run on the swift Bears,
the visitors will hope to work for
good percentage shots throughout
the contest and control the tempo
of the game.
Senior Bill Halligan will get the
starting call for the Cards at the
forward spot opposite Mai
McElwain, a position that has
caused trouble for the team all
year. Halligan will have his hands
full if he draws the assignment of
guarding the potent Ridgle, which
seems likely.
The key match up will be with
the big men. Stanford's Bill Pal
mer, 6-7, must contain Presley of
fensively, and screen him off the
boards to hold down the Cal scor
ing.
Not only the crowd at Berk
eley, but an entire West Coast
T.V. audience will be waiting to
see if a Stanford team effort can
overcome the highly touted indi
vidual talent of the Bears.


JACKIE JUMPER â€”California's springy sophomore, Jackie Ridgle
bounds skyward to cast off shot over Washington State's Dennis Hogg.
Ridgle carries a 20.6 average into tonight's Big Game at Berkeley.


SOPHOMORE STARTER -Stanford's own sophomore star, Dennis
O'Neill gets off a 15 foot jump shot in a recent battle with Washington.
O'Neill is the only Indian shooting over 50 per cent on the season, and
leads all starters with a 71 per cent free throw average. Although he has
taken oniy 60 of the team's 910 shots from the field, O'Neill has proven to
be an asset to the squad through his floor leadership and constant hustle.
