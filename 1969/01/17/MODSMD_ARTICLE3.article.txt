# Has Judicial Crisis Ghost Returned?
## 
### PHILIP TAUBMAN 
Has the stage been set at Stan
ford for another judicial crisis this
spring?
Even as students massed around
the trustee meeting on Tuesday,
the spectre of name-taking, judicial
deliberation, and eventual dispute
arose in the minds of administra
tors, faculty members, and stu
dents involved in last May's sit-in.
The backdrop for judicial pro
ceedings this year is substantially
firmer than a year ago, yet enough

News Analysis

confusion exists to cloud events
and instill a sense of anxiety among
those involved in the case.
The critical dispute last spring
concerned the legitimacy of the all
faculty judicial system, the Interim
Judicial Body (IJB). The IJB was
appointed by former President
Sterling as a terrporary judicial
structure to handle cases until the
Committee of Fifteen ironed
out a permanent system.
System Accepted
The C 1 5 system, which estab
lished the Student Conduct Legis
lative Council (SCLC) and the
Stanford Judicial Council (SJC),
was finalized during the sit-in and
accepted by the faculty and admin
istration by early summer.

The student body, however,
failed to act immediately as the
student legislature (LASSU) post
poned consideration until this fall.
In an October referendum, by a
margin of 5 to 1, students accepted
the CIS plan with one special pro
viso: the acceptance would he valid
only until March 1, 1969, when a
new vote would be taken.
The SJC, like the IJB, might be
disputed as a temporary system.
Such dispute, however, will be less
easily founded than with the IJB.
Unlike the IJB, the SJC was voted
on by the faculty and student body
and members were not arbitrarily
appointed by the President but
rather selected by faculty and stu
dents.
Possible Dispute
If the SJC is not challenged and
judicial proceedings are concluded
before March 1, 1969, dispute
could arise over other aspects of
the case. For example, someone
may challenge the campus policy
on demonstrations. Students will
be tried as demonstration policy
violators. The policy was never
voted on by the student body.
Acting President Robert Glaser
formulated the policy after con
sulting with members of the fac
ulty and student body. Ther6 is no
precedent for having such a policy
formally accepted by vote, but the
overall principle of SCLC govern
ance stresses joint faculty-student
rule making.
Glaser would have preferred an
SCLC created demonstration

policy, but the delay in student
ratification of SCLC came too late
for Glaser to wait. He strongly de
sired an immediate clarification of
the policy which had been open to
assault as too general and vague.
Power to Void
According to the legislative and
judicial charter of 1968, the SCLC
has power to void the demonstra
tion policy if it presents an alterna
tive formula for campus consider
ation. If such action should occur
prior or during SJC deliberations,
confusion would ensue over the
legality of trying students for viola
ting an invalidated law.
Even if proceedings run smooth -

ly with no dispute of the SJC or the
demonstration policy, the action
taken by the SJC might ignite a
crisis. There was great disparity in
the level of offenses committed on
Tuesday. Violations on Tuesday
ran from ringing a false fire alarm
and forcing open a door to sympa
thetically but non-actively being in
the area. Trouble could develop if
SJC discipline recommendations
fail to vary according to intensity
of violation.
Judicial proceedings at Stanford
always have the potential for spark
ing a crisis. The University can
stand or fall simply on a question
of legitimacy.

SCLC created demonstration

policy, but the delay in student
ratification of SCLC came too late
for Glaser to wait. He strongly de
sired an immediate clarification of
the policy which had been open to
assault as too general and vague.
Power to Void
According to the legislative and
judicial charter of 1968, the SCLC
has power to void the demonstra
tion policy if it presents an alterna
tive formula for campus consider
ation. If such action should occur
prior or during SJC deliberations,
confusion would ensue over the
legality of trying students for viola
ting an invalidated law.
Even if proceedings run smooth -

ly with no dispute of the SJC or the
demonstration policy, the action
taken by the SJC might ignite a
crisis. There was great disparity in
the level of offenses committed on
Tuesday. Violations on Tuesday
ran from ringing a false fire alarm
and forcing open a door to sympa
thetically but non-actively being in
the area. Trouble could develop if
SJC discipline recommendations
fail to vary according to intensity
of violation.
Judicial proceedings at Stanford
always have the potential for spark
ing a crisis. The University can
stand or fall simply on a question
of legitimacy.
Has the stage been set at Stan
ford for another judicial crisis this
spring?
Even as students massed around
the trustee meeting on Tuesday,
the spectre of name-taking, judicial
deliberation, and eventual dispute
arose in the minds of administra
tors, faculty members, and stu
dents involved in last May's sit-in.
The backdrop for judicial pro
ceedings this year is substantially
firmer than a year ago, yet enough

News Analysis

confusion exists to cloud events
and instill a sense of anxiety among
those involved in the case.
The critical dispute last spring
concerned the legitimacy of the all
faculty judicial system, the Interim
Judicial Body (IJB). The IJB was
appointed by former President
Sterling as a terrporary judicial
structure to handle cases until the
Committee of Fifteen ironed
out a permanent system.
System Accepted
The C 1 5 system, which estab
lished the Student Conduct Legis
lative Council (SCLC) and the
Stanford Judicial Council (SJC),
was finalized during the sit-in and
accepted by the faculty and admin
istration by early summer.

The student body, however,
failed to act immediately as the
student legislature (LASSU) post
poned consideration until this fall.
In an October referendum, by a
margin of 5 to 1, students accepted
the CIS plan with one special pro
viso: the acceptance would he valid
only until March 1, 1969, when a
new vote would be taken.
The SJC, like the IJB, might be
disputed as a temporary system.
Such dispute, however, will be less
easily founded than with the IJB.
Unlike the IJB, the SJC was voted
on by the faculty and student body
and members were not arbitrarily
appointed by the President but
rather selected by faculty and stu
dents.
Possible Dispute
If the SJC is not challenged and
judicial proceedings are concluded
before March 1, 1969, dispute
could arise over other aspects of
the case. For example, someone
may challenge the campus policy
on demonstrations. Students will
be tried as demonstration policy
violators. The policy was never
voted on by the student body.
Acting President Robert Glaser
formulated the policy after con
sulting with members of the fac
ulty and student body. Ther6 is no
precedent for having such a policy
formally accepted by vote, but the
overall principle of SCLC govern
ance stresses joint faculty-student
rule making.
