# Tactics Condemned
## 
### 
The Stanford Student Legisla
ture (LASSU) last night con
demned violent demonstrations,
stating that the legislature "objects
philosophically and tactically to
their use on our campus."
The resolution, sponsored by
Frank Philpot, a graduate student
in humanities and sciences, en
dorsed the goal of an open Univer
sity, and called upon President
Kenneth S. Pitzer "to discuss with
all interested students the problem
of the University's relationship to
the Stanford Research Institute
and the University's policy toward
military and counter-insurgency re
search."
An amendment calling for open

meetings ol the Board of Trustees
was defeated.
In a separate action by a vote of
39-7, the Legislature rejected a pro
posal from the Academic Senate
which rejected an alternate propos
al for joint student-faculty consid
eration on the SES report.
LASSU accepted a proposal
similar to that put forward by the
student Coalition that would allow
for creation of a new body consist
ing of the Academic Senate and an
equal number of students to pass
on SES recommendations. ASSU
President Denis Hayes sponsored
the bill, which calls for any SES
recommendation that passes the
combined groups by a two-thirds
majority to be finally ratified.
