# Dean Joel Smith Named President Of Denison
## 
### MARSHALL SCHWARTZ 
Dean of Students Joel P. Smith
will leave Stanford at the end of
this academic year to return to his
home state and assume the presi
dency of Denison University.

The 35-year old associate
provost, a native of Toledo, Ohio,
will take over the reins of the coed
ucational liberal arts college of
2,000 students July 15.
Students, faculty, and trustees
participated in his selection. Smith
will be the 15th president of the
institution, located in Granville,
and founded in 1831. He was first
approached about the post in
November, and decided to accept a
week ago.
Smith has been dean of students
for two troubled years and has
constantly been caught at the hub
of controversies. His most recent
involvements have concerned the
judicial system and this year's Pre-
Reg plans.
Sit-Ip
The judicial controversy, which
gave rise to last spring's Old Union
sit-in, began in November 1967
when members of Students for a
Democratic Society and their
sympathizers tried to prevent the
Central Intelligence Agency from
holding job interviews on campus.
Smith asked the Student Judi
cial Council (SJC) to try ten
students on charge of violation of
the campus po'i.v on demon
strations and the Fundamental
Standard.
The SJC originally refused to
hear the case. When Smith
threatened to take the issue to the
Interim Judicial Body (IJB), an all
faculty group, they reversed the
decision.
Appeals Case
They found the ten innocent
when they decided the demon
strations policy was "vague and
unenforceable." Smith then
appealed the case to the IJB, which
found seven of the students guilty.
In protest to having the
student's decision overruled by the
faculty—in fact, letting faculty
have sole say over student judicial
matters—students broke into the
Old Union and staged a 57-hour
sit-in.
This summer, Smith tried to
prevent the appearance of Dave
Harris, former Stanford student
body president and resistance
leader, and his wife Joan Baez

Harris, from appearing as part of
the Pre-Reg program for the class
of 1972.
He reluctantly allowed the
event to be held when Dean of the
Chapel B. Davie Napier accepted its
sponsorship.
Less Controversial
Smith will undoubtedly
encounter less controversial prob
lems in his new role. "Many things
about Denison have impressed
me," he commented, "but most of
all I am impressed by the respect
which so many Denisonians have
for their college and the values it
represents."
President Kenneth S. Pitzer
praised Smith. "In a time of major
transition for Stanford and other
universities, Dean Smith has never
lost his enthusiasm for students."
For the remainder of his stay
here, Smith will report directly to
Pitzer, with the title of assistant to
the president and dean of students.

Provost Richard W. Lyman
commented, "We'll miss him here.
The work of a dean of students
these days is about as demanding as
any in the university short of the
president's; Joel has carried out
this difficult assignment with
judgement, high intelligence, and
grace."
But his job has not been easy. As
one student leader who has had
many dealings with the dean com
mented, "Joel Smith should never
have been a dean of students.
"He suffered from the
destructive combination of having
a conscience and great sensitivity
yet equally great ambition. He
cared immensely for students and
it hurt him deeply to be hard and
tough, but to get ahead he had to
be firm and often insensitive. I
think Joel is a very happy man
tonight. He's got a chance to be
himself."

approached about the post in
November, and decided to accept a
week ago.
Smith has been dean of students
for two troubled years and has
constantly been caught at the hub
of controversies. His most recent
involvements have concerned the
judicial system and this year's Pre-
Reg plans.
Sit-Ip
The judicial controversy, which
gave rise to last spring's Old Union
sit-in, began in November 1967
when members of Students for a
Democratic Society and their
sympathizers tried to prevent the
Central Intelligence Agency from
holding job interviews on campus.
Smith asked the Student Judi
cial Council (SJC) to try ten
students on charge of violation of
the campus po'i.v on demon
strations and the Fundamental
Standard.
The SJC originally refused to
hear the case. When Smith
threatened to take the issue to the
Interim Judicial Body (IJB), an all
faculty group, they reversed the
decision.
Appeals Case
They found the ten innocent
when they decided the demon
strations policy was "vague and
unenforceable." Smith then
appealed the case to the IJB, which
found seven of the students guilty.
In protest to having the
student's decision overruled by the
faculty—in fact, letting faculty
have sole say over student judicial
matters—students broke into the
Old Union and staged a 57-hour
sit-in.
This summer, Smith tried to
prevent the appearance of Dave
Harris, former Stanford student
body president and resistance
leader, and his wife Joan Baez

Harris, from appearing as part of
the Pre-Reg program for the class
of 1972.
He reluctantly allowed the
event to be held when Dean of the
Chapel B. Davie Napier accepted its
sponsorship.
Less Controversial
Smith will undoubtedly
encounter less controversial prob
lems in his new role. "Many things
about Denison have impressed
me," he commented, "but most of
all I am impressed by the respect
which so many Denisonians have
for their college and the values it
represents."
President Kenneth S. Pitzer
praised Smith. "In a time of major
transition for Stanford and other
universities, Dean Smith has never
lost his enthusiasm for students."
For the remainder of his stay
here, Smith will report directly to
Pitzer, with the title of assistant to
the president and dean of students.

Provost Richard W. Lyman
commented, "We'll miss him here.
The work of a dean of students
these days is about as demanding as
any in the university short of the
president's; Joel has carried out
this difficult assignment with
judgement, high intelligence, and
grace."
But his job has not been easy. As
one student leader who has had
many dealings with the dean com
mented, "Joel Smith should never
have been a dean of students.
"He suffered from the
destructive combination of having
a conscience and great sensitivity
yet equally great ambition. He
cared immensely for students and
it hurt him deeply to be hard and
tough, but to get ahead he had to
be firm and often insensitive. I
think Joel is a very happy man
tonight. He's got a chance to be
himself."
