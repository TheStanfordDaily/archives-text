# ROTC Presence On Campus Discussed At Open Meeting
## 
### ANN DENTON 
Strong support for the existing
Reserve Officers Training Corps
(ROTC) program surfaced yester
day— primarily among cadets—
during a two-hour open hearing on
University-ROTC relations.
The forum, attended by about
70 students and faculty in the
Undergraduate Library, was
sponsored by the Ad Hoc Senate
Committee on ROTC. The com
mittee, consisting of four students,
four faculty, and one adminis
tration member, was appointed by
the Academic Senate to draw up a
report by Feb. 15 on the recom
mended relationship between the
University and ROTC.
Marine Col. Robert Thomas,
head of the Department of Naval
Science and a member of the com
mittee, indicated that courses in
military history and world power,
now taught in the ROTC program,
may be offered through the history
and political science departments
in the future.
Cadet Views
Many ROTC cadets strongly
defended the present program,
saying their classes were
"challenging," "interesting," and
"more open to diverse views than
many courses taught in other
departments."
Charles Felsenthal, a senior Air
Force ROTC cadet majoring in
German, claimed there is "a much
higher degree of open mindedness
and willingness to listen within
ROTC than people want to
believe." He said minority opinions
are not listened to in humanities
classes.
"There has been a rise of a new
power elite that wants to shout us
down and run us out of town. The
real issue is academic freedom. If
we all jump on the bandwagon and
run ROTC out of town, then I
think we move one step further
toward the entrenchment of anti
intellectual attitudes."
Presence Attacked
Prof. Charles Stein, statistics,
attacked the presence of ROTC on
campus, saying that "military
habits of thought, obedience and
carrying out orders . . . are com
pletely contrary to the scholarly
habits which should be exemplified
at a university.
"Following orders brought the
U.S. to its present miserable state,"
he added. "It's wrong to train
officers to carry on the present
policy of American aggression in
Vietnam and Thailand."
Offering assurance of never
having participated in ROTC, long
haired Harvey Hukari, a communi
cations graduate student, said,
"You would set a dangerous prece
dent by abolishing ROTC." He
concluded "Diversity is the hall
mark of a great university."
Geology major, Don Walklot.

senior Navy ROTC cadet, argued
that forcing ROTC off campus
would exclude the people whom
you want to influence most in the
future."
Stating that he was challenged

daily by friends and associates as to
his purpose in becoming a naval
officer, he said, "If our foreign
policy is faulty and if the university
is a ray of light, perhaps this ray of
light could rub off on a cadet."

defended the present program,
saying their classes were
"challenging," "interesting," and
"more open to diverse views than
many courses taught in other
departments."
Charles Felsenthal, a senior Air
Force ROTC cadet majoring in
German, claimed there is "a much
higher degree of open mindedness
and willingness to listen within
ROTC than people want to
believe." He said minority opinions
are not listened to in humanities
classes.
"There has been a rise of a new
power elite that wants to shout us
down and run us out of town. The
real issue is academic freedom. If
we all jump on the bandwagon and
run ROTC out of town, then I
think we move one step further
toward the entrenchment of anti
intellectual attitudes."
Presence Attacked
Prof. Charles Stein, statistics,
attacked the presence of ROTC on
campus, saying that "military
habits of thought, obedience and
carrying out orders . . . are com
pletely contrary to the scholarly
habits which should be exemplified
at a university.
"Following orders brought the
U.S. to its present miserable state,"
he added. "It's wrong to train
officers to carry on the present
policy of American aggression in
Vietnam and Thailand."
Offering assurance of never
having participated in ROTC, long
haired Harvey Hukari, a communi
cations graduate student, said,
"You would set a dangerous prece
dent by abolishing ROTC." He
concluded "Diversity is the hall
mark of a great university."
Geology major, Don Walklot.

senior Navy ROTC cadet, argued
that forcing ROTC off campus
would exclude the people whom
you want to influence most in the
future."
Stating that he was challenged

daily by friends and associates as to
his purpose in becoming a naval
officer, he said, "If our foreign
policy is faulty and if the university
is a ray of light, perhaps this ray of
light could rub off on a cadet."


ROTC DEBATE—Marine Col. Robert Thomas and philosophy graduate
student George Cattermole, members of the A d Hoc Senate Committee
on ROTC, shown here, took part in an open meeting on University-

report by Feb. 15 on the recom
mended relationship between the
University and ROTC.
Marine Col. Robert Thomas,
