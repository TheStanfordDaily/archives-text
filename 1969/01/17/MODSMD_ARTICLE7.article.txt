The SDS-led interruption of
Tuesday's Board of Trustees meet
ing proved "to the trustees that
the university is no longer theirs,"
declared SDS member Steve
Smith at a White Plaza rally noon
yesterday.
Reactions to the disruption led
other students to circulate peti
tions denouncing the violent tac
tics used by SDS as "irrespon
sible" and having "no place in an
academic environment."
The rally attended by over
students was called in an effort to
explain the reasons behind the in
vasion of the Faculty Club where
the Trustees wore meeting for
lunch.
Smith maintained "Stanford's
Trustees are members of the
North American ruling class."
They were "demoralized and
frightened" by the demonstration,
and, said Smith, "Anything that
frightens them is good."
SDS member David Pugh, a
junior in political science, listed
the nine demands and explained
each. In summary the demands
asked that "all members of the
university community Trustees,
Faculty, SRI, and Adminis
tration— halt all economic and
military operations and projects
concerned with Southeast Asia."

Pugh said that "If we can get
the power to move on these nine
demands then we can get going.
Then we can try to replace corpo
rate capitalism with a more
human system."
Also among the speakers was a
Mexican-American representative,
Rogelio Reyes, from the striking
members of the American Feder
ation of Teachers (AFT) at San
Jose State college. Finding no
Mexican-Americans in the crowd,
he said, "This proves what a racist
institution this is. This is the type
of thing that we're fighting at San
Jose State."
During the speeches petitions
were passed around by newly
-formed group called the Open
Campus Committee. According to
leader John Munger, senior in
political science, the committee
was organized 'prior to, but stimu
lated by the SDS action at Tues
day's Trustee meeting."
Munger indicated the group
hopes to attract students "inter
ested in progress without destroy
ing what you are trying to im
prove on. We are also interested in
the broadest communication
possible in the University."
A final tally of the petitions
signed will be made Sunday. The
Committee claims to have col
lected over 200 signatures at the
rallv yesterday afternoon.
