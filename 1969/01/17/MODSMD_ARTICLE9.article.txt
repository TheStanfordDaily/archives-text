# Two Minutes Of Haight
## Hysteria, Kennan, And You 
### TIM HAIGHT 
Is it my imagination, or are
liberal professors jumping on the
police state bandwagon and rush
ing their polemics into print? Per
haps that's a bit strong, but it is
true that George Kennan has a
book out that puts student activists
down pretty hard, that Louis Halle
and others have attached us in The
New Republic, and that at least
four of last year's issues of Com
mentary featured lead articles
" damning the New Left.
Now I'm not denying Kennan
his right to be reprinted in the cur
rent issue of Readers' Digest as he
is, nor am I claiming that the many
faults of the radical-hippie move
ment should not be pointed out. I
have, in fact, dignified some of
those criticisms by sending letters
in to various journals, in the inter
j est of dialogue.
But it is the hysteria of those
who criticize hysteria, the evangel
istic certainty of the advocates of
reserving judgment, and lack of
constructive alternatives proposed
by those who stress our negativism

that fascinate, and hurt me. And I
take very personally, indeed, these
criticisms of my generation—
because I have tried my best to be a
decent part of it.
I am told that I do nothing but
oversimplify, that I am vulgar, that
my stylo of dress is defiant, that I
am stony-hearted, that I would
rather curse the darkness than light
a candle, that I propose no alterna
tives, that I do not talk in terms of
reason but in terms of power, that I
am sick if I turn on, that all I want
to do is destroy. Here I am, Frank
enstein's monster.
So we might title this column,
"A letter to Dr. Frankenstein, by
the beast he taught to write, or
'You made me what I am today, I
hope you're satisfied.' "
What my generation of activists
are remembered for >iow are the
clips of street ric U on TV. 1 feel
like the Hell's Angels—'"When
we're good, nobody remembers.
When we're bad nobody forgets."
Taken personally, this probably
means I will be remembered, if at
all, for my hell fire speech after the

sit-in last spring.
How people forget. Those years
on academic committees, that sum
mer I worked for (1 kid you not)
the administration, that fifty-odd
page curriculum change report for
the English department, all the
non-violent demonstrations, all the
tete-a-tetes with individual profes
sors, plates of beef stroganoff at
faculty homes, even all the profes
sors I scored things for.
And I am not unique in this. If I
were, this column would be the
height of sick egotism. But if you
show me a radical at Stanford
who's been around a little while, I
can show you a veteran of the same
"constructive" experience, to a
greater —in many, many cases —or
lesser degree.
For what? To make reports and
reasoned arguments and be told,
"The Trustees won't go for it." To
spend literally months jocking a
committee around to the point
where they will stand up to one
entrenched bureaucrat. To con
vince a bunch of alumni—did I for
get the speeches and panels before

them?—that my hair is just that,
my hair, and not a plot against
them, or that I'm not for absolute
freedom.
How I remember the shrugs end
ing all those talks in professors'
offices, in answer to the question,
"Well, short of violence, what do
we do?" More than one of you has
admitted to me that we are headed
toward civil war. More than one of
you has nodded when I listed ways
faculties could take stands without
endangering academic freedom,
said, "We're working on that," and
then done nothing more.
How about that big petition
drive to get the napalm factory out
of Redwood City a few years back,
and how it was disqualified, with
more than 30,000 signatures, on a
technicality? How about the times
we tried to set up program formats
that would have avoided incidents
like the time Humphrey came and
we were turned down in the name
of position and power?
So when we have some confron
tation, a couple of you come
around and say, "Why don't you

talk to us?" And we say, "This is
the only way to get you to come
around."
And you wonder why SDSers
begin to think you might be more
interested in defending your
economic security than in truth,
justice, or such things? And you
wonder why 1 get angry? And you
wonder why I finally decided I
would learn more in jail for draft
resistance than in the sea of
numbers and open attempts to
socialize me of the communication
department? Shit, man.
You know, just between you
and me, I'm not going to get a gun
and start the American revolution.
I don't dig killing. I don't even
think the present Left tactics are
getting anywhere, and I've said so
before in print. I would love to be
able to count on you to provide
leadership, reason, compassion, or
any other of those good things I
value, but where the hell are you?
You're at home writing articles
putting me down.
Pretty nasty and hysterical
column, eh? OK, prove me wrong.
