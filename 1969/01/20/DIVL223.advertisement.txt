Eulogy For Johnson
Lyndon Johnson ceases to be president today, and
his friends and enemies will come together and pro
nounce good the times in which he lived and ruled.
And we would like to also. For strangely, because of
his frequent personal repulsiveness and his sometimes
arrogant dedication to a foreign policy rooted in the
past and aiming more toward empire than toward peace,
Lyndon Johnson made people think.
He made them see the utter irony of trying to save
the children of the black ghetto while trying to destroy
the children of a distant yellow world.
But certainly it is a better thing to have a country in
which large groups of people honestly care to re-evalu
ate what they and their nation are doing, honestly care
to look at policies in terms of morality as well as effic
iency. It is a finer thing to have that kind of country
than the quieter place that Mr. Johnson inherited.
Another man in the same position, given the odd
times we live in, might have inspired the same kind of
thought in his people. But, though he may have wished
it otherwise, we are thankful for this tall ungainly man
who drawled a large segment of the nation into an
awareness of conscience.
