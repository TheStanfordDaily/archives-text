# Joel Smith: The Man And The Dean
## 
### Susan Sward 
Joel Smith looks like the man
in a New Yorker advertisement
for dress shirts.
His pipe-smoking, dapper
figure has been a common sight
around the Stanford campus since
January, 1965, when Smith came
here as a lawyer in the general
secretary's office. After serving as
the associate dean of students for
approximately a year and a half,
Smith became Associate Provost
and Dean of Students in February
of 1967.
Last Friday the announcement
was made public that Smith had
accepted the Presidency of
Denison College in Ohio. He will
return to the state in which he
was born at the end of the year to
take over the helm of the small,
coeducational liberal arts
university.
Prefers Smaller Community
In an interview with The Daily
last Friday, Smith said, "I am
basically interested in
uncfer graduate education, and
while I'm really earnest in saying
that I appreciate the exceptional
responsibilities I've had at

Stanford, I prefer to be part of a
smaller academic community.
"The other part of the
equation is the fine quality of
Denison," noted Smith. He sat
thoughtfully for a moment and
then added,
"One shouldn't try to do the
job I've had for the last several
years for probably more than a
few years. It's very hard to sustain
the appropriate sensitivity."
When questioned about the
manner in which his successor will
be chosen, Smith stated that
President Pitzer will probably be
making a statement on this
question in the near future.
Day In The Life
A day in the life of Joel Smith
begins early. By 8 a.m. when the
Old Union opens in the morning,
Smith may have put in two hours
of reading and writing in his
office.
"During the more active part
of the day," Smith said, "there is
usually a committee meeting or
two. I claim to be the University
champion committee member. I
also spend some part of every day

consulting with the President and
Provost.
"I see students every day but
much less frequently than I wish.
Most students come to see me to
discuss a specific item of business.
Many come to express concern or
disappointment about something
that has happened."
Dean Smith's day at the office
ends at about 6 p.m. He only
works an hour or so in the evening
because he prefers "to work early
in the morning."
Stanford—A Learning Experience
Smith is most proud of his
participation in the "changes that
have developed in the residense
program since I've been dean.
Those changes were a result of
students, faculty and staff
working extremely well together.
"There are many exceptionally
able people at Stanford. Being
with such able people day in and
day out, I have had a great
opportunity to learn and grow."
Looking at the other side of
the question, Smith focused on
"the most disappointing thing to
me as Dean. It has been the
proportion of time I've had to

spend on things that do not
represent the interests of a broad
range of Stanford students.
"The political climate in the
last several years has been such
that it's been very difficult to find
the time to work on things that
need to be done. For example, a
significant improvement of the
fraternal system here," Smith
said.
On Political Activism
Smith does not feel that a
dramatic change in the student
body has occurred since he came
to Stanford in 1965. He does
believe a "very significant change
is occurring in the sense that
faculty and students are par
ticipating more actively in the
formulation of a whole range of
policies representing what the
university should be."
Concerning student activism at
Stanford, Smith stated that it was
impossible to make a general
statement on his sentiments.
"The most intelligent comment
I've ever heard on student
activism," said Smith, "was made
by Prof. David Potter. He pointed
out that protest per se is not good

or bad. It's merely a mode of ex
pression."
The dean made a distinction
among various forms of student
activism.
Activism On The Rise
"Someforms of student
activism have been enormously
beneficial to Stanford, but other
kinds of activism such as the
events last Tuesday seem to *ne
destructive. In the next few years
students will undoubtedly par
ticipate more actively in the
University community, which is in
my judgment desirable.
"In saying this, I don't con
done some of the really awful
abuses of freedom that have
occurred here in the last several
years," Smith noted.
Dean Smith smiled and said, "I
hope I haven't come off as
pedantic. I just want to say that I
am a happy guy right now. I am
very excited about the oppor
tunity that has come along for
me, and I want to continue being
useful at Stanford for the next
several months."

return to the state in which he
was born at the end of the year to
take over the helm of the small,
coeducational liberal arts
university.
Prefers Smaller Community
In an interview with The Daily
last Friday, Smith said, "I am
basically interested in
uncfer graduate education, and
while I'm really earnest in saying
that I appreciate the exceptional
responsibilities I've had at

Stanford, I prefer to be part of a
smaller academic community.
"The other part of the
equation is the fine quality of
Denison," noted Smith. He sat
thoughtfully for a moment and
then added,
"One shouldn't try to do the
job I've had for the last several
years for probably more than a
few years. It's very hard to sustain
the appropriate sensitivity."
When questioned about the
manner in which his successor will
be chosen, Smith stated that
President Pitzer will probably be
making a statement on this
question in the near future.
Day In The Life
A day in the life of Joel Smith
begins early. By 8 a.m. when the
Old Union opens in the morning,
Smith may have put in two hours
of reading and writing in his
office.
"During the more active part
of the day," Smith said, "there is
usually a committee meeting or
two. I claim to be the University
champion committee member. I
also spend some part of every day

consulting with the President and
Provost.
"I see students every day but
much less frequently than I wish.
Most students come to see me to
discuss a specific item of business.
Many come to express concern or
disappointment about something
that has happened."
Dean Smith's day at the office
ends at about 6 p.m. He only
works an hour or so in the evening
because he prefers "to work early
in the morning."
Stanford—A Learning Experience
Smith is most proud of his
participation in the "changes that
have developed in the residense
program since I've been dean.
Those changes were a result of
students, faculty and staff
working extremely well together.
"There are many exceptionally
able people at Stanford. Being
with such able people day in and
day out, I have had a great
opportunity to learn and grow."
Looking at the other side of
the question, Smith focused on
"the most disappointing thing to
me as Dean. It has been the
proportion of time I've had to

spend on things that do not
represent the interests of a broad
range of Stanford students.
"The political climate in the
last several years has been such
that it's been very difficult to find
the time to work on things that
need to be done. For example, a
significant improvement of the
fraternal system here," Smith
said.
On Political Activism
Smith does not feel that a
dramatic change in the student
body has occurred since he came
to Stanford in 1965. He does
believe a "very significant change
is occurring in the sense that
faculty and students are par
ticipating more actively in the
formulation of a whole range of
policies representing what the
university should be."
Concerning student activism at
Stanford, Smith stated that it was
impossible to make a general
statement on his sentiments.
"The most intelligent comment
I've ever heard on student
activism," said Smith, "was made
by Prof. David Potter. He pointed
out that protest per se is not good

or bad. It's merely a mode of ex
pression."
The dean made a distinction
among various forms of student
activism.
Activism On The Rise
"Someforms of student
activism have been enormously
beneficial to Stanford, but other
kinds of activism such as the
events last Tuesday seem to *ne
destructive. In the next few years
students will undoubtedly par
ticipate more actively in the
University community, which is in
my judgment desirable.
"In saying this, I don't con
done some of the really awful
abuses of freedom that have
occurred here in the last several
years," Smith noted.
Dean Smith smiled and said, "I
hope I haven't come off as
pedantic. I just want to say that I
am a happy guy right now. I am
very excited about the oppor
tunity that has come along for
me, and I want to continue being
useful at Stanford for the next
several months."

DAPPER DEAN—Dean of Students Joel Smith, leaving at the end of
the year for the presidency of Denison College in Ohio, smokes his pipe
thoughtfully and talks of his plans for the future. Nowadays he calls
himself a "very happy fellow."
Joel Smith looks like the man
in a New Yorker advertisement
for dress shirts.
His pipe-smoking, dapper
figure has been a common sight
around the Stanford campus since
January, 1965, when Smith came
here as a lawyer in the general
secretary's office. After serving as
the associate dean of students for
approximately a year and a half,
Smith became Associate Provost
and Dean of Students in February
of 1967.

"One shouldn't try to do the
job I've had for the last several
years for probably more than a
few years. It's very hard to sustain
the appropriate sensitivity."
When questioned about the
manner in which his successor will
be chosen, Smith stated that
President Pitzer will probably be
making a statement on this
question in the near future.
Day In The Life
A day in the life of Joel Smith
begins early. By 8 a.m. when the
Old Union opens in the morning,
Smith may have put in two hours
of reading and writing in his
office.
"During the more active part
of the day," Smith said, "there is
usually a committee meeting or
two. I claim to be the University
champion committee member. I
also spend some part of every day

consulting with the President and
Provost.
"I see students every day but
much less frequently than I wish.
Most students come to see me to
discuss a specific item of business.
Many come to express concern or
disappointment about something
that has happened."
Dean Smith's day at the office
ends at about 6 p.m. He only
works an hour or so in the evening
because he prefers "to work early
in the morning."
Stanford—A Learning Experience
Smith is most proud of his
participation in the "changes that
have developed in the residense
program since I've been dean.
Those changes were a result of
students, faculty and staff
working extremely well together.
"There are many exceptionally
able people at Stanford. Being
with such able people day in and
day out, I have had a great
opportunity to learn and grow."
Looking at the other side of
the question, Smith focused on
"the most disappointing thing to
me as Dean. It has been the
proportion of time I've had to

spend on things that do not
represent the interests of a broad
range of Stanford students.
"The political climate in the
last several years has been such
that it's been very difficult to find
the time to work on things that
need to be done. For example, a
significant improvement of the
fraternal system here," Smith
said.
On Political Activism
Smith does not feel that a
dramatic change in the student
body has occurred since he came
to Stanford in 1965. He does
believe a "very significant change
is occurring in the sense that
faculty and students are par
ticipating more actively in the
formulation of a whole range of
policies representing what the
university should be."
Concerning student activism at
Stanford, Smith stated that it was
impossible to make a general
statement on his sentiments.
"The most intelligent comment
I've ever heard on student
activism," said Smith, "was made
by Prof. David Potter. He pointed
out that protest per se is not good

or bad. It's merely a mode of ex
pression."
The dean made a distinction
among various forms of student
activism.
Activism On The Rise
"Someforms of student
activism have been enormously
beneficial to Stanford, but other
kinds of activism such as the
events last Tuesday seem to *ne
destructive. In the next few years
students will undoubtedly par
ticipate more actively in the
University community, which is in
my judgment desirable.
"In saying this, I don't con
done some of the really awful
abuses of freedom that have
occurred here in the last several
years," Smith noted.
Dean Smith smiled and said, "I
hope I haven't come off as
pedantic. I just want to say that I
am a happy guy right now. I am
very excited about the oppor
tunity that has come along for
me, and I want to continue being
useful at Stanford for the next
several months."

DAPPER DEAN—Dean of Students Joel Smith, leaving at the end of
the year for the presidency of Denison College in Ohio, smokes his pipe
thoughtfully and talks of his plans for the future. Nowadays he calls
himself a "very happy fellow."
Joel Smith looks like the man
in a New Yorker advertisement
for dress shirts.
His pipe-smoking, dapper
figure has been a common sight
around the Stanford campus since
January, 1965, when Smith came
here as a lawyer in the general
secretary's office. After serving as
the associate dean of students for
approximately a year and a half,
Smith became Associate Provost
and Dean of Students in February
of 1967.
Last Friday the announcement
was made public that Smith had
accepted the Presidency of
Denison College in Ohio. He will
return to the state in which he
was born at the end of the year to
take over the helm of the small,
coeducational liberal arts
university.
Prefers Smaller Community
In an interview with The Daily
last Friday, Smith said, "I am
basically interested in
uncfer graduate education, and
while I'm really earnest in saying
that I appreciate the exceptional
responsibilities I've had at

Stanford, I prefer to be part of a
smaller academic community.
"The other part of the
equation is the fine quality of
Denison," noted Smith. He sat
thoughtfully for a moment and
then added,
"One shouldn't try to do the
job I've had for the last several
years for probably more than a
few years. It's very hard to sustain
the appropriate sensitivity."
