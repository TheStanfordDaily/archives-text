• Participation Setback
Editor, THE DAILY:
Thank you, SDS. You have just
set the cause of meaningful stu
dent participation in university
decisions back at least a year.
This year the Trustees finally
agreed to meet on campus. They
started asking student leaders to
come to their meetings and talk to
them. They ate and visited in stu
dent residences, and they began to
see students as real people with
real concerns, rather than as ab
stract tuition-paying animals.
Some of them, through repeated
exposure, may even have started
to realize that the idea of student
and faculty participation in their
decisions isn't as unthinkable as
they once believed.
Sure, that isn't enough. We
aren't going to be able to outvote
the Board of Trustees in open
forum tomorrow afternoon. But it
does mean that, for the first time,
the Trustees are emerging into
what we would call the real world.
So what do you do? You give
them a beautiful excuse to start
meeting in San Francisco again.
You demonstrate a personal
hatred and an almost childish
petulance which are hardly likely
to convince the Board that they
could work with you as equals in
a decision-making situation. You
reinforce all the stereotypes that
we have just begun to break
down.
You say that I am forgetting
the issues; that the tragedy of
Vietnam amply excuses the farce
at the Faculty Club. But truly, do
you believe the Trustees are more
likely to listen to you because 50
people broke up their meeting?
Wouldn't 150 peaceful pickets
have had more effect? And what
about the many students who are
quietly, but very urgently, asking
SDS's questions at living-group en
counters with the Trustees? I've
seen one of these encounters, and
I think these students—whom the
trustees can't possibly brush off as
"hippie demonstrator types"—are
much more likely to be heard and
understood than SDS, whose pre
dictable insults elicit only a
predictable anger.
And has it occurred to you
that, by sabotaging the efforts of
people like Denis Hayes and Yale
Braunstein to get the Trustees to
accept us as responsible, voting
members of the community,
you're sabotaging our one chance
to get some control over the
policies you want changed?
I'm afraid that Tuesday's little
fracas was motivated chiefly by
the very human and universal
desire to throw mudballs at all the
high silk hats, and to tell all the
authority figures in the world to
go screw. As a catharsis, it was
great. As a tactic, it was stupid. As
for its effect on the fight for
community government, it's the
best piece of ammunition the
old-guard conservatives have been
given in years.

• Semantics Of Violence
Editor, THE DAILY:
The eagerness with which cer
tain groups have rushed to con
demn the "violent" tactics of SDS
at the Tuesday meeting of the
Trustees leads me to believe that
much of the furor is due to what
Hayakawa might term a "semantic
problem." The demonstration
Tuesday was not violent. No one

was injured. No property (for
those who considered property
more sacred than human lives)
was damaged. If not violent, how
ever, the demonstration was char
acterized by a lack of respect for
the Trustees and the administra
tion. The distinction is an im
portant one; unfortunately, it is
one that too few students can
truly appreciate.
If there is one thing our pre
dominantly white middle class
background has taught us, it is un
questioned respect for those in
positions of authority. We learned
not to talk back to our parents,
not to correct our teachers, not to
break rules. In all dutifulness we
learned to accept the authority of
others to make decisions about
our lives. Positive and negative
sanctions (the possibility of going
to college, getting a good job
which would command its own re
spect and the corresponding fear
that this avenue to "success"
might be blocked) reinforced our
obedience.
In our desire to succeed in life,
we never thought to question the
authority which dominated and
directed us. The possibility that
our parents might be wrong, that
the teacher might know less than
we about the needs of the stu
dent, that the rules might be
unjust—such considerations
seldom or never entered our
heads. We acquiesced.
The Germans accepted the
authority of the state during
World War II; the death of six
million Jews is witness to the fact.
The American people accepted
Vietnam; death and destruction
on a massive scale, the effect of
our acquiescence, continue.
It is time that we began to ask
ourselves just how much respect
they deserve. Can I be expected to

respect men who made decisions
which adversely affect millions of
people throughout the world? The
abdication of responsibility has to
stop somewhere. The man who di
rects the manufacture of weapons
which maim, kill, and devastate is
responsible also for the de
structive use to which the
destructive potential he has cre
ated is put. Trustee Roger Lewis
(to name only one) as president of
the largest defense contractor in
the country, is a murderer.
Can I respect him? President
Pitzer accedes to the authority of
the Trustees and keeps the stu
dents quiet so that Roger Lewis
and his cohorts in offensive (not
defensive) industries can continue
to murder; as an accessory after
the fact, President Pitzer is guilty
of the same crimes against human
ity-
Can I respect him? When stu
dents accede to the authority of
the administration and the
trustees, we too jure implicated in
the crime. Can we respect our
selves?
Don't talk to me of "violent"
tactics. SDS could have employed
the tactics of the Trustees and
flown a General Dynamics F-111
over the Faculty Club, napalming
the whole bunch (innocent by
standers as well). Instead we
called them motherfuckers. Which
they are. Virginia Linsley

• Semantics Of Violence
Editor, THE DAILY:
The eagerness with which cer
tain groups have rushed to con
demn the "violent" tactics of SDS
at the Tuesday meeting of the
Trustees leads me to believe that
much of the furor is due to what
Hayakawa might term a "semantic
problem." The demonstration
Tuesday was not violent. No one

was injured. No property (for
those who considered property
more sacred than human lives)
was damaged. If not violent, how
ever, the demonstration was char
acterized by a lack of respect for
the Trustees and the administra
tion. The distinction is an im
portant one; unfortunately, it is
one that too few students can
truly appreciate.
If there is one thing our pre
dominantly white middle class
background has taught us, it is un
questioned respect for those in
positions of authority. We learned
not to talk back to our parents,
not to correct our teachers, not to
break rules. In all dutifulness we
learned to accept the authority of
others to make decisions about
our lives. Positive and negative
sanctions (the possibility of going
to college, getting a good job
which would command its own re
spect and the corresponding fear
that this avenue to "success"
might be blocked) reinforced our
obedience.
In our desire to succeed in life,
we never thought to question the
authority which dominated and
directed us. The possibility that
our parents might be wrong, that
the teacher might know less than
we about the needs of the stu
dent, that the rules might be
unjust—such considerations
seldom or never entered our
heads. We acquiesced.
The Germans accepted the
authority of the state during
World War II; the death of six
million Jews is witness to the fact.
The American people accepted
Vietnam; death and destruction
on a massive scale, the effect of
our acquiescence, continue.
It is time that we began to ask
ourselves just how much respect
they deserve. Can I be expected to

respect men who made decisions
which adversely affect millions of
people throughout the world? The
abdication of responsibility has to
stop somewhere. The man who di
rects the manufacture of weapons
which maim, kill, and devastate is
responsible also for the de
structive use to which the
destructive potential he has cre
ated is put. Trustee Roger Lewis
(to name only one) as president of
the largest defense contractor in
the country, is a murderer.
Can I respect him? President
Pitzer accedes to the authority of
the Trustees and keeps the stu
dents quiet so that Roger Lewis
and his cohorts in offensive (not
defensive) industries can continue
to murder; as an accessory after
the fact, President Pitzer is guilty
of the same crimes against human
ity-
Can I respect him? When stu
dents accede to the authority of
the administration and the
trustees, we too jure implicated in
the crime. Can we respect our
selves?
Don't talk to me of "violent"
tactics. SDS could have employed
the tactics of the Trustees and
flown a General Dynamics F-111
over the Faculty Club, napalming
the whole bunch (innocent by
standers as well). Instead we
called them motherfuckers. Which
they are. Virginia Linsley
• Participation Setback
Editor, THE DAILY:
Thank you, SDS. You have just
set the cause of meaningful stu
dent participation in university
decisions back at least a year.
This year the Trustees finally
agreed to meet on campus. They
started asking student leaders to
come to their meetings and talk to
them. They ate and visited in stu
dent residences, and they began to
see students as real people with
real concerns, rather than as ab
stract tuition-paying animals.
Some of them, through repeated
exposure, may even have started
to realize that the idea of student
and faculty participation in their
decisions isn't as unthinkable as
they once believed.
Sure, that isn't enough. We
aren't going to be able to outvote
the Board of Trustees in open
forum tomorrow afternoon. But it
does mean that, for the first time,
the Trustees are emerging into
what we would call the real world.
So what do you do? You give
them a beautiful excuse to start
meeting in San Francisco again.
You demonstrate a personal
hatred and an almost childish
petulance which are hardly likely
to convince the Board that they
could work with you as equals in
a decision-making situation. You
reinforce all the stereotypes that
we have just begun to break
down.
You say that I am forgetting
the issues; that the tragedy of
Vietnam amply excuses the farce
at the Faculty Club. But truly, do
you believe the Trustees are more
likely to listen to you because 50
people broke up their meeting?
Wouldn't 150 peaceful pickets

much of the furor is due to what
Hayakawa might term a "semantic
problem." The demonstration
Tuesday was not violent. No one

was injured. No property (for
those who considered property
more sacred than human lives)
was damaged. If not violent, how
ever, the demonstration was char
acterized by a lack of respect for
the Trustees and the administra
tion. The distinction is an im
portant one; unfortunately, it is
one that too few students can
truly appreciate.
If there is one thing our pre
dominantly white middle class
background has taught us, it is un
questioned respect for those in
positions of authority. We learned
not to talk back to our parents,
not to correct our teachers, not to
break rules. In all dutifulness we
learned to accept the authority of
others to make decisions about
our lives. Positive and negative
sanctions (the possibility of going
to college, getting a good job
which would command its own re
spect and the corresponding fear
that this avenue to "success"
might be blocked) reinforced our
obedience.
In our desire to succeed in life,
we never thought to question the
authority which dominated and
directed us. The possibility that
our parents might be wrong, that
the teacher might know less than
we about the needs of the stu
dent, that the rules might be
unjust—such considerations
seldom or never entered our
heads. We acquiesced.
The Germans accepted the
authority of the state during
World War II; the death of six
million Jews is witness to the fact.
The American people accepted
Vietnam; death and destruction
on a massive scale, the effect of
our acquiescence, continue.
It is time that we began to ask
ourselves just how much respect
they deserve. Can I be expected to

respect men who made decisions
which adversely affect millions of
people throughout the world? The
abdication of responsibility has to
stop somewhere. The man who di
rects the manufacture of weapons
which maim, kill, and devastate is
responsible also for the de
structive use to which the
destructive potential he has cre
ated is put. Trustee Roger Lewis
(to name only one) as president of
the largest defense contractor in
the country, is a murderer.
Can I respect him? President
Pitzer accedes to the authority of
the Trustees and keeps the stu
dents quiet so that Roger Lewis
and his cohorts in offensive (not
defensive) industries can continue
to murder; as an accessory after
the fact, President Pitzer is guilty
of the same crimes against human
ity-
Can I respect him? When stu
dents accede to the authority of
the administration and the
trustees, we too jure implicated in
the crime. Can we respect our
selves?
Don't talk to me of "violent"
tactics. SDS could have employed
the tactics of the Trustees and
flown a General Dynamics F-111
over the Faculty Club, napalming
the whole bunch (innocent by
standers as well). Instead we
called them motherfuckers. Which
they are. Virginia Linsley
• Participation Setback
Editor, THE DAILY:
Thank you, SDS. You have just
set the cause of meaningful stu
dent participation in university
decisions back at least a year.
This year the Trustees finally
agreed to meet on campus. They
started asking student leaders to
come to their meetings and talk to
them. They ate and visited in stu
dent residences, and they began to
see students as real people with
real concerns, rather than as ab
stract tuition-paying animals.
Some of them, through repeated
exposure, may even have started
to realize that the idea of student
and faculty participation in their
decisions isn't as unthinkable as
they once believed.
Sure, that isn't enough. We
aren't going to be able to outvote
the Board of Trustees in open
forum tomorrow afternoon. But it
does mean that, for the first time,
the Trustees are emerging into
what we would call the real world.
So what do you do? You give
them a beautiful excuse to start
meeting in San Francisco again.
You demonstrate a personal
hatred and an almost childish
petulance which are hardly likely
to convince the Board that they
could work with you as equals in
a decision-making situation. You
reinforce all the stereotypes that
we have just begun to break
down.
You say that I am forgetting
the issues; that the tragedy of
Vietnam amply excuses the farce
at the Faculty Club. But truly, do
you believe the Trustees are more
likely to listen to you because 50
people broke up their meeting?
Wouldn't 150 peaceful pickets
have had more effect? And what
about the many students who are
quietly, but very urgently, asking
SDS's questions at living-group en
counters with the Trustees? I've
seen one of these encounters, and
I think these students—whom the
trustees can't possibly brush off as
"hippie demonstrator types"—are
much more likely to be heard and
understood than SDS, whose pre
dictable insults elicit only a
predictable anger.
And has it occurred to you
that, by sabotaging the efforts of
people like Denis Hayes and Yale
Braunstein to get the Trustees to
accept us as responsible, voting
members of the community,
you're sabotaging our one chance
to get some control over the
policies you want changed?
I'm afraid that Tuesday's little
fracas was motivated chiefly by
the very human and universal
desire to throw mudballs at all the
high silk hats, and to tell all the
authority figures in the world to
go screw. As a catharsis, it was
great. As a tactic, it was stupid. As
for its effect on the fight for
community government, it's the
best piece of ammunition the
old-guard conservatives have been
given in years.
