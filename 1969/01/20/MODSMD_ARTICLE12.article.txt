# A 						Conspiracy Of Two
## Stanford Self-Determination 
### JEFFREY BLUM DANIEL SNELL 
The University sincerely inter
ested in maximizing self-determi
nation could 1) present all
possible life styles and professions
to students, 2) encourage them to
research and experiment with
alternatives in order to make
rational choices, and 3) have stu
dents practice self-determination
as much as possible while on cam
pus.
Stanford, however, allows con
tact only with the "respectable"
academic disciplines. Zen medita
tion is not '.aught, but quantum
mechanics is. What makes the "re
spectable" disciplines respectable
is not that they are inherently
better for the student's mind, but
that teaching them serves to trans
mit skills necessary for the preser
vation of established institutions
both inside and outside the Uni
versity.
Some departments even fail to
present an overview of the "re
spectable" discipline, but present
only one theoretical orientation
to the exclusion of all others.
Most departments allow suffi
ciently little contact between
undergraduates and professors
that most students have little idea
what it is like to work profession
ally in their major field until they

have committed themselves to it
by entering graduate school.
Alternative Styles
Moreover the University makes
no effort to present students with
alternative life styles and pro
fessions that are not found on
campus. Students' only contact
with the outside world is through
job recruiters who, needless to
say, are more interested in supply
ing the manpower needs of their
companies than in maximizing a
student's self-determination.
Neither the Study of Educa
tion nor any other University
committee has proposed reforms
sufficiently basic and sweeping to
alleviate any of these problems.
It follows that is students have
virtually no contact with alterna
tive life-styles and professions,
then they will have little chance
to experiment with them within
the residences, where students
now could experiment with differ
ent styles and organizations.
Outmoded Institutions
Experimentation is forbidden
by commitment to outmoded
institutions and an archaic moral
code. The University allows only
fraternities and dormitories on
campus. Coeducation is allowed
only in buildings whose structure
guarantees effective separation of
the sexes. The University, owning
some 8800 acres, could easily

afford to allot land to developers
to build an attractive student
apartment complex on campus. It
could allow student co-ops to be
built. It could provide small group
housing to groups other than fra
ternities. It does none of these
things. Students who wish to
innovate are forced to move off
campus. But with the increasingly
tight off-campus housing situa
tion, often this is impossible.
On campus students rarely get
to practice self-determination.
The student is allowed to pick his
own courses, except for those
which are required. But after the
courses are chosen almost all the
student's academic work is deter
mined by others without his con
sent. It seems that for many
course selection is the most enjoy
able part of every quarter.
After choosing his courses, the
student is told when to go to
class, what to read and what to
write down in his notes. He is told
to work for grades, a criterion
with no reference to his own
needs or desires. He chooses only
the titles of his education; the
rest is imposed upon him by pro
fessors, administrators, and the
needs of society.
Course Evaluation
Although course evaluation is
encouraged in some areas of the

University, it is significant that
students are told to criticize only
the easily alterable aspects ol
courses. They are asked if the
reading was too heavy, not if
tliere should have to be assigned
reading at all.
Social regulations at Stanford
are more lenient than at most Uni
versities. Students may drink
liquor and even smoke pot. Most
have no curfew. Certainly, Stan
ford is better than high school.
Students may go outside between
classes, and most teachers don't
take role. Unlike high schools,
Stanford does not attempt to give
direct obedience training. Stu
dents must internalize the rules
and requirements and follow them
over periods of weeks and months
without any direct supervision.
They learn to accomplish what
other tell them to do with having
the others constantly remind
them. This kind of suspended obe
dience is exactly what is needed in
the modern corporation, but it is
not consistent with self-determ
ination. (NEXT: Why Stanford
has chosen obedience over
self-determination.)

present an overview of the "re
spectable" discipline, but present
only one theoretical orientation
to the exclusion of all others.
Most departments allow suffi
ciently little contact between
undergraduates and professors
that most students have little idea
what it is like to work profession
ally in their major field until they

have committed themselves to it
by entering graduate school.
Alternative Styles
Moreover the University makes
no effort to present students with
alternative life styles and pro
fessions that are not found on
campus. Students' only contact
with the outside world is through
job recruiters who, needless to
say, are more interested in supply
ing the manpower needs of their
companies than in maximizing a
student's self-determination.
Neither the Study of Educa
tion nor any other University
committee has proposed reforms
sufficiently basic and sweeping to
alleviate any of these problems.
It follows that is students have
virtually no contact with alterna
tive life-styles and professions,
then they will have little chance
to experiment with them within
the residences, where students
now could experiment with differ
ent styles and organizations.
Outmoded Institutions
Experimentation is forbidden
by commitment to outmoded
institutions and an archaic moral
code. The University allows only
fraternities and dormitories on
campus. Coeducation is allowed
only in buildings whose structure
guarantees effective separation of
the sexes. The University, owning
some 8800 acres, could easily

afford to allot land to developers
to build an attractive student
apartment complex on campus. It
could allow student co-ops to be
built. It could provide small group
housing to groups other than fra
ternities. It does none of these
things. Students who wish to
innovate are forced to move off
campus. But with the increasingly
tight off-campus housing situa
tion, often this is impossible.
On campus students rarely get
to practice self-determination.
The student is allowed to pick his
own courses, except for those
which are required. But after the
courses are chosen almost all the
student's academic work is deter
mined by others without his con
sent. It seems that for many
course selection is the most enjoy
able part of every quarter.
After choosing his courses, the
student is told when to go to
class, what to read and what to
write down in his notes. He is told
to work for grades, a criterion
with no reference to his own
needs or desires. He chooses only
the titles of his education; the
rest is imposed upon him by pro
fessors, administrators, and the
needs of society.
Course Evaluation
Although course evaluation is
encouraged in some areas of the

University, it is significant that
students are told to criticize only
the easily alterable aspects ol
courses. They are asked if the
reading was too heavy, not if
tliere should have to be assigned
reading at all.
Social regulations at Stanford
are more lenient than at most Uni
versities. Students may drink
liquor and even smoke pot. Most
have no curfew. Certainly, Stan
ford is better than high school.
Students may go outside between
classes, and most teachers don't
take role. Unlike high schools,
Stanford does not attempt to give
direct obedience training. Stu
dents must internalize the rules
and requirements and follow them
over periods of weeks and months
without any direct supervision.
They learn to accomplish what
other tell them to do with having
the others constantly remind
them. This kind of suspended obe
dience is exactly what is needed in
the modern corporation, but it is
not consistent with self-determ
ination. (NEXT: Why Stanford
has chosen obedience over
self-determination.)
The University sincerely inter
ested in maximizing self-determi
nation could 1) present all
possible life styles and professions
to students, 2) encourage them to
research and experiment with
alternatives in order to make
rational choices, and 3) have stu
dents practice self-determination
as much as possible while on cam
pus.
Stanford, however, allows con
tact only with the "respectable"
academic disciplines. Zen medita
tion is not '.aught, but quantum
mechanics is. What makes the "re
spectable" disciplines respectable
is not that they are inherently
better for the student's mind, but
that teaching them serves to trans
mit skills necessary for the preser
vation of established institutions
both inside and outside the Uni
versity.
