• SDS Teach-in Tonight
What lies behind SDS rhetoric?/
Come to a teach-in on South East/
Asia tognight at 7:30 in the
Tresidder Large Lounge.
Peter Wiley from San Francisco
will talk on South East Asia, and
Harry Cleaver will discuss the in
volvement of SRI. Another speak
er will talk about the funda
mentals of American foreign
policy. Floor discussion will
follow the talks.
According to Hal Hamilton of
SDS, "There is a war going on,
and Stanford helps supply that
war with both research and mana
gerial experts. We need to share
ideas of how to relate our lives to
the fact. The war surrounds us
and implicates us, and only we
can say NO."
•Grad Registration Down
Graduate male registration at
Stanford is down 402 students,
according to closing registration
figures released by Registrar
Harvey Hall.
Though some have probably
been drafted, Hall speculated that

a large number of graduate men
have gone into industry or teach
ing or other jobs which carry
occupational deferments.
The figures also represent a de
cline which set in with last fall's
registration, he reported.
Compared to the winter quart
er total last year, there has been
an overall gain of 24 male under
graduates, 118 women under
graduates, and 40 women
graduate students.
There are now 8334 men and
2734 women students enrolled for
a total of 11,068, compared to
8712 and 2576 for a total of
11,288 last year at the same time.
»'Aliens ' Register
About 25 people responded to
a call by the Midpeninsula Free
University (MFU) for 500 people
to register themselves as aliens
Saturday morning at the Main
Post Office in Palo Alto.
The purpose of the registration
was to demonstrate their position
as the "alienated generation."
According to the MFU, to be a
"Free American " you must
register or be deported.

The group, some of whom
were dressed in brightly colored
costumes and carrying balloons,
gathered on the patio outside the
building and played patriotic and
resistance songs on kazoos before
entering.
At least 20 persons completed
and turned in alien registration
forms which were accepted by the
clerks. The proceedings were
watched by two plainclothes Palo
Alto policemen as well as two
postal inspectors.
The registration was peaceful
and orderly. After registering, the
protestors, carrying a red flag with
peace and resistance symbols on it
and an American flag, paraded out
to the sidewalk, sang a few songs
in the rain and left.
When asked by THE DAILY if
there was any penalty for register
ing as an alien when you are not,
Postmaster Marvin Arbuckle re
plied that he wasn't sure but that
any prosecution would be by the
U.S. Attorney in San Francisco.
He added that the cards would be
forwarded to the U. S. Immigra
tion Office in San Francisco on
January 31, the deadline for
registering.
•German Secretary Dies
Mrs. Florence Brokmeyei,
senior secretary in the German de
partment for the past ten years,
passed away unexpectedly in her
Menlo Park house Friday.
Funeral services will be in
charge of Roller and Hapgood,
Palo Alto.
F. W. Strothmann, chairman of
the department, commented on
Mrs. Brokmeyer's death: "We
have not only lost a devoted
colleague, we have all lost a good
friend."

and implicates us, and only we
can say NO."
•Grad Registration Down
Graduate male registration at
Stanford is down 402 students,
according to closing registration
figures released by Registrar
Harvey Hall.
Though some have probably
been drafted, Hall speculated that

a large number of graduate men
have gone into industry or teach
ing or other jobs which carry
occupational deferments.
The figures also represent a de
cline which set in with last fall's
registration, he reported.
Compared to the winter quart
er total last year, there has been
an overall gain of 24 male under
graduates, 118 women under
graduates, and 40 women
graduate students.
There are now 8334 men and
2734 women students enrolled for
a total of 11,068, compared to
8712 and 2576 for a total of
11,288 last year at the same time.
»'Aliens ' Register
About 25 people responded to
a call by the Midpeninsula Free
University (MFU) for 500 people
to register themselves as aliens
Saturday morning at the Main
Post Office in Palo Alto.
The purpose of the registration
was to demonstrate their position
as the "alienated generation."
According to the MFU, to be a
"Free American " you must
register or be deported.

The group, some of whom
were dressed in brightly colored
costumes and carrying balloons,
gathered on the patio outside the
building and played patriotic and
resistance songs on kazoos before
entering.
At least 20 persons completed
and turned in alien registration
forms which were accepted by the
clerks. The proceedings were
watched by two plainclothes Palo
Alto policemen as well as two
postal inspectors.
The registration was peaceful
and orderly. After registering, the
protestors, carrying a red flag with
peace and resistance symbols on it
and an American flag, paraded out
to the sidewalk, sang a few songs
in the rain and left.
When asked by THE DAILY if
there was any penalty for register
ing as an alien when you are not,
Postmaster Marvin Arbuckle re
plied that he wasn't sure but that
any prosecution would be by the
U.S. Attorney in San Francisco.
He added that the cards would be
forwarded to the U. S. Immigra
