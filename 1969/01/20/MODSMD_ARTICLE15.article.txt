## French Farces: 'Superb' 
### GAIL ANDERSON 
Somewhere in the back of my
mind there has always been an
oft-disappointed suspicion that
the Stanford Speech and Drama
Department is capable of really
superb performance. The two
French farces currently playing on
campus are a surprising demon
stration of the magniturde of that
capability.
Despite a somewhat testy be
ginning and the difficulties of the
length, Moliere's The Learned
Ladies moves with a near
impossible precision. To take a
17th-century comedy, a trans
lation in rhymed couplets, stage it
in traditional French style (actors
facing and playing to the audi
ence, etc.) and still create great
comedy is the mark of great di
rection.
And Michel Langinieux's
directing is undoubtedly the out
standing merit of this production.
His actors make good use of the
stage (Dinkelspiel, of course, is far
more suited to this than Mem
Aud, where they had the sense
not to perform), and by playing in
period style, without recourse to

comic "gimmicks" or slapstick,
they capture the sense of a play
whose essence is the lines them
selves.
Top Directorship
The characterizations in the
play are second, but second only,
to the total direction of the per
formance; which is as it should be,
especially with Moliere. As the
elder of the learned ladies,
Marjorie Morley and Eleanor
Prosser are caricatures well-suited
to the play's assault on pedantry.
But the outstanding perfor
mance, in terms both of individual
caricature and of the sense of the
play as a whole, is given by
Carrillo Gantner as Trisotin, the
"sit." His sense of gesture and ex
pression as well as the delivery of
his lines make him a delight to
watch, and yet he never plays too
broadly for Langinieux's concep
tion of the play.
The second play on the bill is
Georges Feydeau's Don't Go
Walking Around Naked, a situa
tional farce about an a-modest
wife of a French official which
turns on the visits of
other dignitaries. One must

commend Langinieux for his
choice of plays alone; this cam
pus's repertory needed some ex
citement. Feydeau's farce is
shorter and livelier than Moliere's,
and both the performances and
the direction are near-perfect.
Constant Surprise
William Frankfather and Jayne
Roach play the husband and wife
superbly, and the play moves at
an incredible pace that keeps the
audience in a constant state of
surprise and hilarity. Langinieux
himself makes an appearance as a
Figaro reporter, with surprising
consequences: his acting is as ima
ginative and precise as his direc
tion.
The plays, of course, are not
perfect. Some of the characters
are a bit slow getting started, and
the Moliere is just slightly too
long to sustain completely for two
hours. But this performance is so
much better than anything else I
have seen the department produce
that I feel obliged to rave. It is a
bit embarrassing. But anyone who
wants to see a pair of magnificent
performances should not miss this
double bill.
