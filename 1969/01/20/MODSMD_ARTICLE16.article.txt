# Fired Up Indians Battle Cal But Ridgle Ruins Upset Try
## 
### FRED MANN 
A fired up Stanford basketball
team came within a whisker of up
setting the California Bears Friday
night, and had it not been for a
young sophomore from
Altheimer, Arkansas, they would
have pulled it off.
6-4'/2 Jackie Ridgle banged 30
points including nine free throws
in the final three and a half
minutes to take the toll of the
Indians, 73-65, in Harmon Gym
on the Berkeley campus.
Stanford, playing perhaps their
finest game of the season over
came their year-long problem of
cold shooting in the first half, and
stayed right with the Bears
throughout the contest. Shooting
47.2 per cent in the first twenty
minutes, the Tribe of Coach
Howie Dallmar went to the locker
room down by only one, 37-36.
It was in the second half that
Cal showed their power, and split
the Stanford zone defense for
high percentage shots. Ridgle and
guard Charlie Johnson, who
scored 11, found openings from
15 feet out, and blistered the nets
with deft shooting. Forward Bill
Duwe hit 18, mostly on jump
shots from the corners.
The two other California
starters, although scoring only
seven points between them,
probably did more to swing the
game to the Bears than did anyone
else. Waddell Blackwell guarded

Stanford's Don Griffin, and tuir
tained him in the second half after
Griff popped in eight long
jumpers in the first period. The
Card co-captain ended up with 21
points, even though he sat out
most of the second half with foul
trouble.
Center Bob Presley was 2-10
from the field, but throttled the
Stanford attack with his very
presence on defense. Every time
the visitors would move the ball
into Bill Palmer, and every time,
after seeing Presley in the key
ready to spring, Palmer would
pass the ball back out again.
But the difference in the game
was undoubtedly Ridgle. He was
everywhere for the victors, hitting
7-11 from the floor, 16-19 from
the free throw line, and pulling
off 13 rebounds, tops for either
club.
The Indians played step for
step with the running Bears, and
looked impressive throughout the
game. Following Griffin's 21
points, Dennis O'Neill threw in
16, and Mai McElwain 10 in the
losing cause.
Cal was slightly more accurate
with their shooting, 45 per cent to
40 per cent. The game was won
on the free throw line, where the
Bears hit on 81 percent, and the
Tribe only 60 per cent.
The ball game started with
Griffin hitting quick shots from
outside to move the Indians into a

four point bulge after only a few
minutes. Coach Dallmar's men
were hot from the outset..
The Bears on the other hand
quickly found openings in
Stanford's shifting zone, and were
open for close range attempts.
Although the Cal shooting was off
in the early going, Presley, Ridgle,
and Johnson controlled the back
boards .
Stanford's Griffin broke up a
Cal 3-on-l break and was slapped
with a questionable foul in the
process, starting a rash of fouls
that kept players from both sides
marching to the charity lines like
a parade.
The Cardinals hit a dry spell
midway through the second half,
and California moved out to a
seemingly commanding 12 point
lead. O'Neill and Mike Michel
took charge with Griffin on the
bench, and played the Bears' type
of game, running and passing,
bringing Stanford into a 63-62
lead with 3:53 left to play.
But the rest of the game was ,
Ridgle, driving and drawing fouls.
With a two point lead, Cal went 1
into a well executed stall, and ran
the clock down from 1:46 all the
way to :35 before the visitors
fouled in an attempt to get the
ball back. Although Duwe missed
the free shot, Ridgle grabbed the
rebound and was fouled by
McElwain. The sophomore calmly
hit both ends of a 1-1 situation
and also lofted in four more free
throws as the game ended.

the visitors would move the ball
into Bill Palmer, and every time,
after seeing Presley in the key
ready to spring, Palmer would
pass the ball back out again.
But the difference in the game
was undoubtedly Ridgle. He was
everywhere for the victors, hitting
7-11 from the floor, 16-19 from
the free throw line, and pulling
off 13 rebounds, tops for either
club.
The Indians played step for
step with the running Bears, and
looked impressive throughout the
game. Following Griffin's 21
points, Dennis O'Neill threw in
16, and Mai McElwain 10 in the
losing cause.
Cal was slightly more accurate
with their shooting, 45 per cent to
40 per cent. The game was won
on the free throw line, where the
Bears hit on 81 percent, and the
Tribe only 60 per cent.
The ball game started with
Griffin hitting quick shots from
outside to move the Indians into a

four point bulge after only a few
minutes. Coach Dallmar's men
were hot from the outset..
The Bears on the other hand
quickly found openings in
Stanford's shifting zone, and were
open for close range attempts.
Although the Cal shooting was off
in the early going, Presley, Ridgle,
and Johnson controlled the back
boards .
Stanford's Griffin broke up a
Cal 3-on-l break and was slapped
with a questionable foul in the
process, starting a rash of fouls
that kept players from both sides
marching to the charity lines like
a parade.
The Cardinals hit a dry spell
midway through the second half,
and California moved out to a
seemingly commanding 12 point
lead. O'Neill and Mike Michel
took charge with Griffin on the
bench, and played the Bears' type
of game, running and passing,
bringing Stanford into a 63-62
lead with 3:53 left to play.
But the rest of the game was ,
Ridgle, driving and drawing fouls.
With a two point lead, Cal went 1
into a well executed stall, and ran
the clock down from 1:46 all the
way to :35 before the visitors
fouled in an attempt to get the
ball back. Although Duwe missed
the free shot, Ridgle grabbed the
rebound and was fouled by
McElwain. The sophomore calmly
hit both ends of a 1-1 situation
and also lofted in four more free
throws as the game ended.
A fired up Stanford basketball
team came within a whisker of up
setting the California Bears Friday
night, and had it not been for a
young sophomore from
Altheimer, Arkansas, they would
have pulled it off.
6-4'/2 Jackie Ridgle banged 30
points including nine free throws
in the final three and a half
minutes to take the toll of the
Indians, 73-65, in Harmon Gym
on the Berkeley campus.
Stanford, playing perhaps their
finest game of the season over
came their year-long problem of
cold shooting in the first half, and
stayed right with the Bears
throughout the contest. Shooting
47.2 per cent in the first twenty
minutes, the Tribe of Coach
Howie Dallmar went to the locker
room down by only one, 37-36.
It was in the second half that
Cal showed their power, and split
the Stanford zone defense for
high percentage shots. Ridgle and
guard Charlie Johnson, who
scored 11, found openings from
15 feet out, and blistered the nets
with deft shooting. Forward Bill
Duwe hit 18, mostly on jump
shots from the corners.
The two other California
starters, although scoring only
seven points between them,
probably did more to swing the
game to the Bears than did anyone
else. Waddell Blackwell guarded

Stanford's Don Griffin, and tuir
tained him in the second half after
Griff popped in eight long
jumpers in the first period. The
Card co-captain ended up with 21
points, even though he sat out
most of the second half with foul
trouble.
Center Bob Presley was 2-10
from the field, but throttled the
Stanford attack with his very
presence on defense. Every time
