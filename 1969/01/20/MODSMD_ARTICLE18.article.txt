### 
The Stanford ice hockey team
won its second straight game,
17-9, Friday night at the Belmont
Iceland. Victims again were the
Peninsula Penguins, a team com
posed of predominately Canadian
players living in the Bay Area.
Despite the opponents' nine
goals, the newly formed Stanford
team showed much defensive
potential. Dick Jones played well
in the goal, and the backline of
Bill Atherton, Marty Taylor, and
Norm Cross were impressive.
The offensive power of the
team was clearly evident, as it had
been last week. Dan Westerlin,
Hugh Tirrell, Allen Pyle, and
Puller Torrey led the scoring.
The Indian squad is composed
of half graduate and half under
graduate students.
The next game for the team
will be on Friday at the Belmont
Iceland at 10:30 p.m. On January
28, the Cards meet Menlo College
in Stanford's first intercollegiate
hockey game.
