# Dean Willard Wyman May Leave Stanford Too
## 
### MARSHALL SCHWARTZ 
Stanford may be losing another
of its top administrators at the
end of this year.
Despite recent efforts of a
group of students to have Willard
Wyman named as successor to
Dean of Students Joel Smith, the
associate dean of students will
probably be at another school
come September.
Wyman last night confirmed
rumors that he has been having
lengthy discussions with another
California university about an
"academic and administrative"
job for next year.
He reported this to The Daily
after being told that a "Make Bill
Wyman Dean of Students Com
mittee" had been formed and had
been posting handbills in support
of its position.
The temporary chairman of the
group is Paul Floto, a junior in
political science.
'Flattering' Move
Wyman said the student move
was "flattering. I need an ego
boost." But he noted that his job
here has been "terribly draining."
"You can take this kind of
stuff for only so long," he said,
"and I'm beginning to weaken."
Wyman, who graduated from
Colby College in 1956 and
received his M.A. in English from
Stanford in 1962, is presently
finishing his doctoral disser
tation—on Wilbur Daniel Steels,
an American short story writer.
He expects to complete his work
this quarter.
Rumors have been circulating
for about a month that Wyman is
being considered for the job of
vice-provost at UC Santa Cruz's
next college.
Two-Year Stint
He commented that when he
took the job of associate dean
here, he informed the adminis
tration that it would be for only
about two years—and he will have
held the post for two years in
June.
The leaflet posted by the
student committee praised
Wyman's handling of difficult
situations created by campus radi
cals.
"Despite what the radical com
munity may say about Bill
Wyman, it is clear that he is one
of the few administrators at
Stanford who actually cares about
students," they said.
Spokesman to Administration
As for the job of dean of
students, Wyman feels that the
person in that post "should be a
spokesman for the students to the

administration, and not the other
way around. The students should
very much be the dean of
students' 'department,' and he
should try to represent them.
"He should be an academic
person, if possible, and a person
whose real concern is the Uni
versity and what the University
can do for students. And he
should be someone who can talk
to students.
"But I think it's almost an
impossible job to do today. My
purpose has been to keep the Uni
versity open for education, but
some of the students on the left
think I have betrayed them in
trying to do that," he added.
"Now when I walk through the
Union some of the students will
say, 'administrative fink.' "

Wyman's probable departure
comes on the heels of a rash of
resignations by other top adminis
trators —Vice Provost Herbert
Packer, Associate Dean of Under
graduate Education Robert Hind,
and Dean of Students Joel Smith.
Why the huge turnover? "I
think it's something that naturally
happens when you get a new
administration," Wyman
commented, referring to Kenneth
Pitzer's recent taking over the
reigns as president.
Wyman came to Stanford after
teaching English at Menlo School,
where he also coached football
and swimming. Previous to that,
he was a copywriter for an adver
tising agency in New York, and
packed horses in Montana for a
year.
