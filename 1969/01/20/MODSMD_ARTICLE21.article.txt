# Course Increases Reading Speed
## Students Can Comprehend At 2,500 Words Per Minute 
### ED SEJUD Daily Illini Staff Writer 
Speed reading does have its lit
tle problems.
As my hand hurried across the
puges, making an audible "swish
ing" sound, I became aware of a
certain stillness in the library.
Looking up from my book, I con
fronted an assortment of stunned,
bemused, disgusted and genuinely
sympathetic countenances on the
faces of my tablemates, all silently
asking, "Hey fella, what're you do
ing with your hand?"
"Speed reading!" I cried, jump
ing at my chance to show-off, "I
can read 2,000 words per minute
(wpm), comprehend more, get less
tired, complete the assignment and
STILL log more drinking time
than ever before, FURTHERMORE
. . —and so the lecture contin
ued, ending with . . That's no
brag — just plain fact."
"It's true however. Wednesday
night the Reading Dynamics Insti
tude graduated its first University
class, boasting that its students had
Increased their average reading
apeed by five times and had made
substantial increases in compre
hension as well. Other classes will
be graduated Thursday, Friday and
Into next week with similar results
— It's the payoff on a gamble

that takes nine weeks to pan-out.
First of Kind
The Evelyn Wood "Reading Dy
namics" course is the first of its
kind to be offered on the Univer
sity campus. It works on a new
principal which uses the reader's
own hand as a "pacer," contend
ing that you don't have to mental
ly repeat ("sub-vocalize") all that
you read, but rather that you can,
when properly instructed, open a
direct channel between your mind
and the printed page. In theory, a
person can read (and compre
hend!) as fast as he can see, with
his top speed limited only by his
ability to turh pages. Phenomenal
results have been obtained by ex
ceptional students, many attaining
speeds in excess of 25,000 wpm—
without sacrificing comprehension.
Students at the Reading Dynam
ics Institute learn to read DOWN
the page rather than across it.
Their eyes flow across the pages
in soft-focus rather than in the
jerky and old-fashioned "single fix
ation" method.
Dynamic readers actually learn
to read lines BACKWARDS as well
as straight down! (At exceptionally
high speeds, it doesn't matter what
direction you read a line — back
wards or forewards, it's all the

same.) Dynamic readers soon learn
to read groups of lines at a single
glance, often reading the second
half of a paragraph before even
seeing the first-half!
Greater Command
Reading dynamically, you obtain
a gi eater overall command of the
material, as especially evident in
long novels where one often for
gets the beginning of the story by
the time he reaches the end.
Instead of bypassing "War and
Peace," dynamic readers can only
complain, "Oh hell, I'll have to
waste two hours reading it!"
Ideally, such a concept offers
printed material as if it were a
painting, a sculpture, or other work
of art. The reader considers it as
a whole, as a complete, single en
tity rather than an agglomeration
of pages, paragraphs or chapters.
Because such readers make
fewer eye-fixations and mental rep
etitions than ordinary readers, they
are less succeptible to eye fatigue
and the usual headaches and drow
siness.
Since it is a manual skill rather
than a function of Intelligence, it
doesn't matter what the reader's
IQ is. While P.E. majors still won't
understand texts on nuclear phys
ics, they'll be able to read non
technical material at speeds equal
to their technically-oriented class
mates.

Paul Wilcher, super reader who
conducts the course, is an instruc
tor equal or better than any you'll
find on the University payroll. His
classes are cheerful and compe
tent with an informality that offers
welcome relief from the dreary
University classes which students
are so steeled against.
The price is a factor which dis
courages prospective students, but
it's cheap by any standards.
If a student avails himself of all
the facilities offered by the Insti
tude and attends all the class ses
sions, the price boils down to only
about $2 an hour, cheaper than
any private tutoring you'll ever
find. Spread over four years, the
course can save thousands of study
hours and can probably affect a
boost in a student's grade-point
average. Assignments which once
took days can be accomplished in
a matte of hours, leaving more
time for other pursuits (fun, drink
ing, girls, etc.). The Institute esti
mates that it can save average stu
dents 350 hours of study time each
semester — probably an under
statement.
Class Sessions
Class sessions are two and a half
hours long and are held once a
week (for eight weeks) In Lando
Place. Optional drill sessions are
held free each day at noon in the
YMCA, with private counseling

available as often as necessary.
After the initial payment (which
can be made in weekly install
ments) everything is provided by
the Institute. The student brings
only the essential apparatus — his
hand.
I attended the course In my
customary manner, coming late to
classes, often without the assigned
homework and without attending
even a single optional drill session.
Nonetheless, I managed to increase
my reading rate by five times and
can now read average material at
about 2,000 wpm with good com
prehension. More diligent students
raised their reading rates by more
than 10 times, with accompanying
increases in comprehension.
You still feel a little silly in th«
library, but finishing half a se
mester's reserve-file readings at •
crack is more than worth it. The
course (which carries a money
back guarantee) seems a valuable
investment for any student, or any
one with great reading demands,
and will undoubtedly gain popular
ity as its reputation spreads.
By the way, an average dynamlo
reader could have read this article

class, boasting that its students had
Increased their average reading
apeed by five times and had made
substantial increases in compre
hension as well. Other classes will
be graduated Thursday, Friday and
Into next week with similar results
— It's the payoff on a gamble

that takes nine weeks to pan-out.
First of Kind
The Evelyn Wood "Reading Dy
namics" course is the first of its
kind to be offered on the Univer
sity campus. It works on a new
principal which uses the reader's
own hand as a "pacer," contend
ing that you don't have to mental
ly repeat ("sub-vocalize") all that
you read, but rather that you can,
when properly instructed, open a
direct channel between your mind
and the printed page. In theory, a
person can read (and compre
hend!) as fast as he can see, with
his top speed limited only by his
ability to turh pages. Phenomenal
results have been obtained by ex
ceptional students, many attaining
speeds in excess of 25,000 wpm—
without sacrificing comprehension.
Students at the Reading Dynam
ics Institute learn to read DOWN
the page rather than across it.
Their eyes flow across the pages
in soft-focus rather than in the
jerky and old-fashioned "single fix
ation" method.
Dynamic readers actually learn
to read lines BACKWARDS as well
as straight down! (At exceptionally
high speeds, it doesn't matter what
direction you read a line — back
wards or forewards, it's all the

same.) Dynamic readers soon learn
to read groups of lines at a single
glance, often reading the second
half of a paragraph before even
seeing the first-half!
Greater Command
Reading dynamically, you obtain
a gi eater overall command of the
material, as especially evident in
long novels where one often for
gets the beginning of the story by
the time he reaches the end.
Instead of bypassing "War and
Peace," dynamic readers can only
complain, "Oh hell, I'll have to
waste two hours reading it!"
Ideally, such a concept offers
printed material as if it were a
painting, a sculpture, or other work
of art. The reader considers it as
a whole, as a complete, single en
tity rather than an agglomeration
of pages, paragraphs or chapters.
Because such readers make
fewer eye-fixations and mental rep
etitions than ordinary readers, they
are less succeptible to eye fatigue
and the usual headaches and drow
siness.
Since it is a manual skill rather
than a function of Intelligence, it
doesn't matter what the reader's
IQ is. While P.E. majors still won't
understand texts on nuclear phys
ics, they'll be able to read non
technical material at speeds equal
to their technically-oriented class
mates.

Paul Wilcher, super reader who
conducts the course, is an instruc
tor equal or better than any you'll
find on the University payroll. His
classes are cheerful and compe
tent with an informality that offers
welcome relief from the dreary
University classes which students
are so steeled against.
The price is a factor which dis
courages prospective students, but
it's cheap by any standards.
If a student avails himself of all
the facilities offered by the Insti
tude and attends all the class ses
sions, the price boils down to only
about $2 an hour, cheaper than
any private tutoring you'll ever
find. Spread over four years, the
course can save thousands of study
hours and can probably affect a
boost in a student's grade-point
average. Assignments which once
took days can be accomplished in
a matte of hours, leaving more
time for other pursuits (fun, drink
ing, girls, etc.). The Institute esti
mates that it can save average stu
dents 350 hours of study time each
semester — probably an under
statement.
Class Sessions
Class sessions are two and a half
hours long and are held once a
week (for eight weeks) In Lando
Place. Optional drill sessions are
held free each day at noon in the
YMCA, with private counseling

available as often as necessary.
After the initial payment (which
can be made in weekly install
ments) everything is provided by
the Institute. The student brings
only the essential apparatus — his
hand.
I attended the course In my
customary manner, coming late to
classes, often without the assigned
homework and without attending
even a single optional drill session.
Nonetheless, I managed to increase
my reading rate by five times and
can now read average material at
about 2,000 wpm with good com
prehension. More diligent students
raised their reading rates by more
than 10 times, with accompanying
increases in comprehension.
You still feel a little silly in th«
library, but finishing half a se
mester's reserve-file readings at •
crack is more than worth it. The
course (which carries a money
back guarantee) seems a valuable
investment for any student, or any
one with great reading demands,
and will undoubtedly gain popular
ity as its reputation spreads.
By the way, an average dynamlo
reader could have read this article
in about 30 seconds.
Speed reading does have its lit
tle problems.
As my hand hurried across the
puges, making an audible "swish
ing" sound, I became aware of a
certain stillness in the library.
Looking up from my book, I con
fronted an assortment of stunned,
bemused, disgusted and genuinely
sympathetic countenances on the
faces of my tablemates, all silently
asking, "Hey fella, what're you do
ing with your hand?"
"Speed reading!" I cried, jump
ing at my chance to show-off, "I
can read 2,000 words per minute
(wpm), comprehend more, get less
tired, complete the assignment and
STILL log more drinking time
than ever before, FURTHERMORE
. . —and so the lecture contin
ued, ending with . . That's no
brag — just plain fact."

speeds in excess of 25,000 wpm—
without sacrificing comprehension.
Students at the Reading Dynam
ics Institute learn to read DOWN
the page rather than across it.
Their eyes flow across the pages
in soft-focus rather than in the
jerky and old-fashioned "single fix
ation" method.
Dynamic readers actually learn
to read lines BACKWARDS as well
as straight down! (At exceptionally
high speeds, it doesn't matter what
direction you read a line — back
wards or forewards, it's all the

same.) Dynamic readers soon learn
to read groups of lines at a single
glance, often reading the second
half of a paragraph before even
seeing the first-half!
Greater Command
Reading dynamically, you obtain
a gi eater overall command of the
material, as especially evident in
long novels where one often for
gets the beginning of the story by
the time he reaches the end.
Instead of bypassing "War and
Peace," dynamic readers can only
complain, "Oh hell, I'll have to
waste two hours reading it!"
Ideally, such a concept offers
printed material as if it were a
painting, a sculpture, or other work
of art. The reader considers it as
a whole, as a complete, single en
tity rather than an agglomeration
of pages, paragraphs or chapters.
Because such readers make
fewer eye-fixations and mental rep
etitions than ordinary readers, they
are less succeptible to eye fatigue
and the usual headaches and drow
siness.
Since it is a manual skill rather
than a function of Intelligence, it
doesn't matter what the reader's
IQ is. While P.E. majors still won't
understand texts on nuclear phys
ics, they'll be able to read non
technical material at speeds equal
to their technically-oriented class
mates.

Paul Wilcher, super reader who
conducts the course, is an instruc
tor equal or better than any you'll
find on the University payroll. His
classes are cheerful and compe
tent with an informality that offers
welcome relief from the dreary
University classes which students
are so steeled against.
The price is a factor which dis
courages prospective students, but
it's cheap by any standards.
If a student avails himself of all
the facilities offered by the Insti
tude and attends all the class ses
sions, the price boils down to only
about $2 an hour, cheaper than
any private tutoring you'll ever
find. Spread over four years, the
course can save thousands of study
hours and can probably affect a
boost in a student's grade-point
average. Assignments which once
took days can be accomplished in
a matte of hours, leaving more
time for other pursuits (fun, drink
ing, girls, etc.). The Institute esti
mates that it can save average stu
dents 350 hours of study time each
semester — probably an under
statement.
Class Sessions
Class sessions are two and a half
hours long and are held once a
week (for eight weeks) In Lando
Place. Optional drill sessions are
held free each day at noon in the
YMCA, with private counseling

available as often as necessary.
After the initial payment (which
can be made in weekly install
ments) everything is provided by
the Institute. The student brings
only the essential apparatus — his
hand.
I attended the course In my
customary manner, coming late to
classes, often without the assigned
homework and without attending
even a single optional drill session.
Nonetheless, I managed to increase
my reading rate by five times and
can now read average material at
about 2,000 wpm with good com
prehension. More diligent students
raised their reading rates by more
than 10 times, with accompanying
increases in comprehension.
You still feel a little silly in th«
library, but finishing half a se
mester's reserve-file readings at •
crack is more than worth it. The
course (which carries a money
back guarantee) seems a valuable
investment for any student, or any
one with great reading demands,
and will undoubtedly gain popular
ity as its reputation spreads.

reader could have read this article

Speed reading does have its lit

As my hand hurried across the
puges, making an audible "swish

certain stillness in the library.
Looking up from my book, I con
fronted an assortment of stunned,
bemused, disgusted and genuinely
sympathetic countenances on the
faces of my tablemates, all silently
asking, "Hey fella, what're you do
ing with your hand?"
"Speed reading!" I cried, jump
ing at my chance to show-off, "I
can read 2,000 words per minute
(wpm), comprehend more, get less
tired, complete the assignment and
STILL log more drinking time
than ever before, FURTHERMORE
. . —and so the lecture contin

First of Kind
The Evelyn Wood "Reading Dy

own hand as a "pacer," contend
ing that you don't have to mental
ly repeat ("sub-vocalize") all that
you read, but rather that you can,
when properly instructed, open a
direct channel between your mind
and the printed page. In theory, a
person can read (and compre
hend!) as fast as he can see, with
his top speed limited only by his
ability to turh pages. Phenomenal
results have been obtained by ex
