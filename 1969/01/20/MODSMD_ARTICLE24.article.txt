Pittendrigh, 50, has been named

where he is currently dean of the
Graduate School and Class of
1877 professor of zoology, Dr.
Pittendrigh will take over his Stan
ford post Sept. 1.
He is best known for his
studies of biological rhythms in
animals—the so-called "biological
clocks" which function approxi
mately in time with 24-hour
cycles of daylight and darkness,
regulating certain aspects of meta
bolism, cells and organisms.
He also enjoys a national repu
tation as an inspiring teacher of
biology. A series of graduate semi
nars he gave at Stanford generated
great student enthusiasm, and he
has taught an extremely popular
undergraduate course in biology
at Princeton.
He joined the Princeton faculty ■
in 1947 and became a U.S. citizen
in 1950. In 1963 he was elected
to the National Academic of
Sciences. He also is a fellow of the

Sciences, and in 1967 was elected
president of the American Society

Stanford in the biological
sciences," said Prof. Donald
