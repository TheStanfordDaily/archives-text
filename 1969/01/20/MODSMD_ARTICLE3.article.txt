# C-15 Offers Help On SES Mediation
## 
### MELISSA PASSETT FELICITY BARRINGER 
The Committee of Fifteen has
offered its services to help negoti
ate a settlement in the dispute
over student participation in
faculty deliberations of Study of
Education at Stanford (SES)
recommendations.
Latest developments in that
dispute include student efforts to
discuss the issue with the steering
committee of the Academic
Senate, an effort rejected by the
steering committee last Thursday.
The committee claimed it
would not consider the demands
of the Coalition until official
student government positions had
been formulated. Thursday
evening LASSU supported the
Coalition's requests for equal vote
with the faculty on SES pro
posals.
Precedent Set
Michael Weinstein, a member
of both the Committee of Fifteen
(C-15), and the Coalition, stated
that the offer of the C-15, thus
acting on its own authority, is
without precedent. In the past,
issues have always been directed
to it by the three constituencies,
faculty, students and adminis
tration.
Speaking about the possible
nature of the procedures the C-15
might suggest, Prof. Philip
Rhinelader, the chairman of the
committee, said that nothing had
been discussed as yet, but specu
lated that different mechanisms
might be recommended for imple
menting different parts of the
report.
"If we can help, we want to,"
he said, stressing, however, that
the C-15 has no executive powers.
"The committee is purely
advisory," he stated. "It has no
powers whatever."
"A Modest Proposal"
In their meeting Jan. 16,
LASSU voted 41 to 13 to accept
the proposition of the Coalition
entitled "A Modest Proposal."
This proposal espouses the for
mation of an ASSU Education
Council of 52 members, a number
equal to that of the voting
members of the Faculty Senate,
to represent student opinion con
cerning the SES proposals.
According to the Coalition's
suggestions, the Academic Senate
and the Education Council would

meet to discuss and vote jointly
upon SES recommendations.
The proposal of the Academic
Senate, in contrast to that of the
Coalition, would relegate students
to a purely advisory capacity.
Although it would allow them to
express views directly to faculty
representatives before definite
action would be taken on SES
recommendations, the repre
sentative group of students would
be denied an equal vote.
Student Role
The Senate would establish a
student government body which
could name student members of
floor management committees of
the Academic Senate for SES pro
posals, debate these proposals,
and could return a previously
passed resolution for the Senate
for reconsideration. In such cases,
the Academic Senate would have
to reconsider the issue and include
a few student representatives in
one of their meetings to clarify
student opinion.
The general confusion inherent
in such procedures is reflected
even among members of the
various committees. As Kevin
Washington, an active member of
the Coalition stated, "I now
realize the complexities of trying
to get something like this
accomplished."

powers whatever."
"A Modest Proposal"
In their meeting Jan. 16,
LASSU voted 41 to 13 to accept
the proposition of the Coalition
entitled "A Modest Proposal."
This proposal espouses the for
mation of an ASSU Education
Council of 52 members, a number
equal to that of the voting
members of the Faculty Senate,
to represent student opinion con
cerning the SES proposals.
According to the Coalition's
suggestions, the Academic Senate
and the Education Council would

meet to discuss and vote jointly
upon SES recommendations.
The proposal of the Academic
Senate, in contrast to that of the
Coalition, would relegate students
to a purely advisory capacity.
Although it would allow them to
express views directly to faculty
representatives before definite
action would be taken on SES
recommendations, the repre
sentative group of students would
be denied an equal vote.
Student Role
The Senate would establish a
student government body which
could name student members of
floor management committees of
the Academic Senate for SES pro
posals, debate these proposals,
and could return a previously
passed resolution for the Senate
for reconsideration. In such cases,
the Academic Senate would have
to reconsider the issue and include
a few student representatives in
one of their meetings to clarify
student opinion.
The general confusion inherent
in such procedures is reflected
even among members of the
various committees. As Kevin
Washington, an active member of
the Coalition stated, "I now
realize the complexities of trying
to get something like this
accomplished."
The Committee of Fifteen has
offered its services to help negoti
ate a settlement in the dispute
over student participation in
faculty deliberations of Study of
Education at Stanford (SES)
recommendations.
Latest developments in that
dispute include student efforts to
discuss the issue with the steering
committee of the Academic
Senate, an effort rejected by the
steering committee last Thursday.
The committee claimed it
would not consider the demands
of the Coalition until official
student government positions had
been formulated. Thursday
evening LASSU supported the
Coalition's requests for equal vote
with the faculty on SES pro
posals.
Precedent Set
Michael Weinstein, a member
of both the Committee of Fifteen
(C-15), and the Coalition, stated
that the offer of the C-15, thus
acting on its own authority, is
without precedent. In the past,
issues have always been directed
to it by the three constituencies,
faculty, students and adminis
tration.
Speaking about the possible
nature of the procedures the C-15
might suggest, Prof. Philip
Rhinelader, the chairman of the
committee, said that nothing had
been discussed as yet, but specu
lated that different mechanisms
might be recommended for imple
menting different parts of the
report.
"If we can help, we want to,"
he said, stressing, however, that
the C-15 has no executive powers.
"The committee is purely
advisory," he stated. "It has no
powers whatever."
