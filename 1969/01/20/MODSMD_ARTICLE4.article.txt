President Kenneth Pitzer will speak to the Stanford student body

Dinkelspiel Auditorium. His topic will be the Study of Education at
Stanford (SES).
The program, sponsored by ASSU, will also involve a panel dis
cussion of SES. The panelists represent a wide range of views.
Besides Pitzer, the panel will include Robert Walker, Director of
General Studies and of Overseas Campuses; Herbert Packer, Vice
Provost and Chairman of the SES Steering Committee; Norton Batkin,
undergraduate on the SES Steering Committee; David Pugh,
undergraduate in Students for a Democratic Society (SDS); and
Sanford Dornbush, President of the Stanford chapter of the American
Association of University Professors. Student body president Denis
Hayes will be moderator.
The SES reports, which are presently being revealed to the
Stanford Community, are the result of a three-year study. Some parts
of the reports are being questioned by students and others by faculty.
The question of who will enact the SES recommendations has also
been a topic of debate recently.
