## Militants Protest Inaugural 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP)-Thou
sands of jeering antiwar demon
strators shouted angry protests
Sunday against President-elect
Nixon in a march on the Capitol.
Later some of them threw rocks
ineffectually at guests arriving for
an inaugural reception.
Mounted policemen rode into
the disheveled throng to drive it
back from a Smithsonian
Institution building after stones
had been thrown toward a dozen
dignitaries arriving for a reception
for Vice President-elect Spiro
Agnew.
The demonstrators, turning
their anger and defiance toward
the new administration even be
fore its beginning, carried signs
calling Nixon a war criminal as
they marched down Pennsylvania
Avenue shouting for peace.
Police estimated the marchers
at just under 5,000. David Delling
er, veteran leader of peace pro
tests, placed the turnout at
10,000 to 12,000. Most of the
marchers were in the
15-to-25-year age bracket.
Assistant Chief of Police Jersey
Wilson said 10 arrests were made
during the march.
Inspector Charles Adams of the
Park Police reported five more
arrests in the melee at the Smith
sonian's new Museum of History
and Technology.
One policeman, cut by a rock,
was taken to a hospital. Another,
hit on the back of the head with a
piece of police barricade, was
treated by a doctor at the scene.
Eight mounted policemen,
with nightsticks upraised, drove
the demonstrators back after the
rock-throwing started. Apparently
the sticks were not used and no
injuries were reported by guests or
protesters.
The march Sunday was staged
as the main act of the protest. But
the demonstrators plan a possibly
stormy encore Monday at the
Nixon inaugural parade.
Some youths in the throng
tried to rip down an American
flag flying in front of the head
quarters of the National Aero
nautics and Space Administration
within sight of the Capitol.
However, a band of fellow
marchers ringed the flagpole and
turned back their colleagues after
a spirited shoving match.
The march was staged two
hours before Nixon's arrival in the
Capitol on the eve of his inaugura
tion. Secret Service men routed
his motorcade clear of the protest
area to avoid any incident.

The marchers stepped off
peacefully down the broad
thoroughfare of Pennsylvania
Avenue and police reported only
one arrest at the outset when a
fight broke out after a band of
Yippees split away from the main
throng to make their own scene.
The long march passed the cita
dels of American government that
line the thoroughfare, snarled
traffic in all directions, and
startled the thousands of Re
publicans pouring into the city to
celebrate Nixon's inauguration.
Tourists were left agape when
about 150 protesters joined hands
and circled the Washington monu
ment during the noon hour to do
a maypole dance around the tall
marble spire while chanting, "Ho,
ho, Ho Chi Minh, NLF is gonna
win."
The first ranks of the march
repeated the chant as they moved
out. The National Liberation
Front (NFL) is the political arm
of the Viet Cong.
One group of marchers carried
a green and white banner that

urged "Victory for the Viet
Cong." In a mockery of Nixon's
campaign slogan, another banner
proclaimed, "Nixon's the One-No.
1 War Criminal."
Demonstrators, who have spent
at least $6,000 in staging their
show of antiwar sentiment, have
purchased two blocks of seats
along Pennsylvania Avenue to
raise banners of opposition during
the parade Monday.
Authorities said a record
number of 4,700 police and
National Guardsmen will be used
to protect the inauguration
activities.
Double Hijacking
MIAMI (AP) —Sky pirates —
including one who repealed a
presidential order with a death
threat —grabbed off two airliners
Sunday to make the second
successive twin air piracy
weekend. Both planes were
ordered to Cuba, carrying a total
of 265 people.
The president of Colombia,
Carlos Lleras Restrepo, tried to

derail the seventh hijacking of the
year. He denied fuel to an
Ecuadorian prop-jet seized by a
gun-brandishing passenger. But
the pilot radioed that the gunman
would kill him if the fuel was
denied. The Colombian Ministry
of Defense then ordered the fuel
delivered "in order to avoid a
tragic incident." The plan carried
83 passengers and a crew of six.
A few hours earlier, the pilot
of an Eastern Airlines jet radioed
from over Florida: "There's a man
in the cockpit with a gun and a
hand grenade." Capt. R. D. Smith
of Atlanta, Ga., added: "We're
heading for Havana." His DCB
carried 168 passengers and a crew
of eight.
Both the planes were en route
to Miami, the South American
plane from Guayaquil, Ecuador,
and the Eastern flight nine from
New York.
The Eastern jet landed at
Havana's Jose Marti Airport where
Cuban security officials took the
hijacker into custody. One of the
Cubans snapped the man's picture
as he descended from the craft.
The hijacker was described as a
slender man in his 20s, wearing a
dark suit.
Associated Press Corre
spondent Fenton Wheeler
reported from Havana that the
hijacker appeared calm and
unhurried as he accompanied the
Cuban officials into the airport.
The passengers began leaving the
plane about 10 minutes later.

The Eastern plane was released
and landed in Miami at 6:18 p.m.
It carried the crew and five New
York State passengers.
• Paris Peace Talks
PARIS (AP)—Awaiting arrival
of a new chief U.S. negotiator,
delegates to the Vietnam peace
talks worked hard Sunday in an
atmosphere of hope on prepa
rations for the start of down-to
business discussions.
Veteran diplomat Henry Cabot

Lodge, was due in Paris Monday
night to take up for the new
Nixon administration where
Ambassador Averell Harriman,
President Johnson's representative
here for eight months, left off.
Sources said the first session
could come as early as Tuesday.
But in Washington, Lodge said
that decision would have to await
his arrival in Paris, and other
Washington officials doubted the
talks would get under way so
soon.

The American i«am appears to
have been surprised at the rapidify
of Saturday's solution of pro
cedural problems which for more
than 10 weeks had obstructed the
conference.
Observers here consider
extremely significant the fact that
the logjam was broken on the
initiative of North Vietnam,
whose envoy at the outset unex
pectedly agreed with the
American attitude that petty pro
cedural considerations should be
swept aside.
• Coming Presidential
Problems
WASHINGTON (AP)-When
Richard Nixon takes the presi
dential oath Monday he will
inherit government social
machinery that has grown tenfold
since he left Washington eight
years ago.
The Great Society programs
President Johnson is leaving
behind, coupled with innovations
of President Kennedy, have
changed the face of domestic
government during the eight
Democratic years.
By one White House calcu
lation, 390 programs have been
added.
When Republican President
Eisenhower and Vice President
Nixon took command in 1953,
they faced another domestic face
lifting that had been accomplished
by Democratic presidents
Franklin D. Roosevelt and Harry
S. Truman.
The Eisenhower administration
tinkered with some of the
programs and added others of its
own—but it did not roll back the
clock on government involvement.
Nixon probably couldn't roll
back the whole Great Society if
he wanted to—and there's no indi
cation that he does.
But he faces numerous
decisions about whether programs
should be shifted to different
agencies or lower levels of govern
ment, whether some efforts
should be accelerated or curtailed,
and whether he should recom
mend new concepts in some areas
of the Great Society.
• Panther Shooting Probed
LOS ANGELES (AP)-Police
said they were searching Sunday
for two brothers identified by the
militant Black Panther organi
zation as involved in the fatal
shooting of two Panther officers
at UCLA.
A spokesman for the Panthers
said officials of that Negro group
hoped to meet publicly with
police Monday to give them
photographs of the two men and
two others who the Panthers say
are involved.
