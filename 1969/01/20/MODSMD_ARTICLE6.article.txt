## Arena Editor Spat Upon 
### MICHAEL KUHL 
The Students for a Democratic
Society's (SES) disruption of
Tuesday's Trustee meeting contin
ues to stir ripples of reaction and
counterreaction across the gener
ally peaceful surface of the Stan
ford student body.
Harvey Hukari, Jr., who critici
zed what he called the "Nazi-like
tactics of violence and physical in
timidation" of the radical student
group in an article in Friday's
Arena was spat upon by a student
Friday afternoon outside Tres
idder Union.
Over 1050 students in the past
five days signed petitions deplor
ing "the irresponsible acts of
those individuals claiming to seek
changes and reforms in the opera
tion" of Stanford. The document,
sponsored by the Open Campus
Committee, called for "utilization
of existing channels of communi
cation" to solve problems.
Hukari describes the conserva
tive journal he edits as an "under
ground newspaper of the Right
dedicated to counteracting the
shibboleths perpetrated by liberal
faculty members."
Friday's issue carried a lead ar
ticle extremely critical of Daily
coverage of SDS activities. Four
hundred copies were dumped in
the Old Union courtyard fountain
while several others were ripped
up and scattered near their distri
bution points.
"Although it is conceivable, I
doubt it is a reaction to one of
our film reviews," Hukari ex
plained. "Rather I think it indi
cates that our paper is beginning
to hurt the radicals by factually
reporting the violent events and
by publishing the names of some
of the demonstrators."
The action by the unidentified
assailant constitutes grounds for
an assault charge by Hukari, but
he does not plan to take legal act
ion.
"The matters will be pursued
further upon consultation with
the dean's office to see if we can
prevent this kind of thing from
happening again," he said. This
would leave the possibility of a

complaint filed with the Student
Judicial Council.
The Open Campus Commit
tee's petitions were torn down in
Roble and Florence Moore Halls,
according to member John Mun
ger.
"I didn't get any hostile reac
tion in passing the petitions

around," Munger said. "I had
never run into such enthusiasm."
Hukari criticizes The Daily for
much of the recent campus activ
ity. "The Daily has to bear the
blame for an increase in intoler
ance and a trend towards violence
on campus by not reporting it in
full and condemning it."

A MAN AND HIS PAPER—Campus figure Harvey Hukari was attached

up and scattered near their distri
bution points.
"Although it is conceivable, I
doubt it is a reaction to one of
our film reviews," Hukari ex
plained. "Rather I think it indi
cates that our paper is beginning
to hurt the radicals by factually
reporting the violent events and
by publishing the names of some
of the demonstrators."
The action by the unidentified
assailant constitutes grounds for
an assault charge by Hukari, but
he does not plan to take legal act
ion.
"The matters will be pursued
further upon consultation with
the dean's office to see if we can
prevent this kind of thing from
happening again," he said. This
would leave the possibility of a

complaint filed with the Student
Judicial Council.
The Open Campus Commit
tee's petitions were torn down in
Roble and Florence Moore Halls,
according to member John Mun
ger.
"I didn't get any hostile reac
tion in passing the petitions

around," Munger said. "I had
never run into such enthusiasm."
Hukari criticizes The Daily for
much of the recent campus activ
ity. "The Daily has to bear the
blame for an increase in intoler
ance and a trend towards violence
on campus by not reporting it in
full and condemning it."

A MAN AND HIS PAPER—Campus figure Harvey Hukari was attached
Friday, and 200 copies of his paper, The Stanford Arena, were taken
and dumped into the fountain in front of the Old Union. Hukari, a
graduate in communication, has been a long-time critic of the new left.
The Students for a Democratic
Society's (SES) disruption of
Tuesday's Trustee meeting contin
ues to stir ripples of reaction and
counterreaction across the gener
ally peaceful surface of the Stan
ford student body.
Harvey Hukari, Jr., who critici
zed what he called the "Nazi-like
tactics of violence and physical in
timidation" of the radical student
group in an article in Friday's
Arena was spat upon by a student
Friday afternoon outside Tres
idder Union.
Over 1050 students in the past
five days signed petitions deplor
ing "the irresponsible acts of
those individuals claiming to seek
changes and reforms in the opera
tion" of Stanford. The document,
sponsored by the Open Campus
Committee, called for "utilization
of existing channels of communi
cation" to solve problems.
Hukari describes the conserva
tive journal he edits as an "under
ground newspaper of the Right
dedicated to counteracting the
shibboleths perpetrated by liberal
faculty members."
Friday's issue carried a lead ar
ticle extremely critical of Daily
coverage of SDS activities. Four
hundred copies were dumped in
the Old Union courtyard fountain
while several others were ripped
up and scattered near their distri
bution points.
"Although it is conceivable, I
doubt it is a reaction to one of
our film reviews," Hukari ex
plained. "Rather I think it indi
cates that our paper is beginning
