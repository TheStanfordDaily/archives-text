# Films On Campus
## Extraordinary Schedule 
### TODD McCARTHY 
This quarter probably offers
the most extraordinary film
schedule in Stanford history and,
with capacity audiences jamming
practically all showings, this
probably goes to show that
students are interested in obtain
ing an increasingly high film
literacy, aside from just wise
cracking every Sunday night at
the Flicks. Enough for pro
foundities, however. In order to
somewhat sort out all the pictures
being screened each week, I will
write a column every Monday,
commenting on the movies I have
seen and offering other critics'
views on films I haven't caught.
First and foremost, if you
didn't see part one of the New
Cinema presentation at Cubberley
on Saturday or Sunday, be sure to
catch it tonight at 7:30. While the
program is called "New" Cinema,
many of the films are rather old,
Included are early shorts by

Truffaut, Polanski and Lester,
made as early as 1957, as well as
several exciting films from the
early '60's. It's well worth seeing.
On Tuesday and Wednesday
nights in Geology Room 320, the
reknowned Clive Miller presents
"The Letter" and "They Died
With Their Boots On." "The
Letter," based on a Somerset
Maugham story and directed by
William Wyler, is considered by
many to offer Bette Davis in her
finest performance; both she and
the film were nominated for
Academy Awards. "They Died
With Their Boots On" is a none
too-accurate account of Custer at
Little Big Horn and stars Errol
Flynn and Olivia de Havilland. If
that's your bag . . .
I've looked through over a
dozen comprehensive film books
and nowhere can I find a mention
of "The Yellow Cruise." this
week's I-Center film, shown at
Cubberley on Thursday. There are

such things as obscure master
pieces but surely Pauline Kael
would have said something.
"The Navigator," at Tresidder
on Friday, is perhaps Buster
Keaton's second best silent, the
best being "The General," which
is coming next week. "The
Navigator" has Keaton stranded at
sea with a girl on an empty ocean
liner and is filled with superb sight
gags. With this is a Laurel and
Hardy short, "Putting the Pants
on Phillip."
I have no way of commenting
on the specific experimental films
being shown at Geology 320 on
Friday at 11 p.m. but as groups,
these films are usually amusing
and sometimes exciting. This
week the films are "Castro
Street," "A Movie,"
"Menilmontant," "Lot in Sodom"
and "Metanomen."
The Saturday evening French
film is Jacques Feyder's "Carnival
in Flanders," made in 1935. Some
critics consider this a comedy
classic, but I fould it rather flat
and ultimately tedious. Histori
cally speaking, however, it may be
worthwhile.
Also on Saturday, at Memorial
Auditorium, is a showing of the
Japanese film, "Chushingura."
Coined as "Japan's National
Epic," it is a samurai film to end
all samurai films and also includes
some superb camera work.
Toshiro Mifune stars.
Finally, at the Flicks on
Sunday, is Stanley Kubrick's "Dr.
Strangelove." Most everyone has
probably seen it but if you have
seen it only on television, it's
profitable to catch it in a theatre.
Besides, no matter how many
times you've seen it, it's always
great to watch Peter Sellers arise
from his wheelchair and try to
salute the Fuhrer.

The Saturday evening French
film is Jacques Feyder's "Carnival
in Flanders," made in 1935. Some
critics consider this a comedy
classic, but I fould it rather flat
and ultimately tedious. Histori
cally speaking, however, it may be
worthwhile.
Also on Saturday, at Memorial
Auditorium, is a showing of the
Japanese film, "Chushingura."
Coined as "Japan's National
Epic," it is a samurai film to end
all samurai films and also includes
some superb camera work.
Toshiro Mifune stars.
Finally, at the Flicks on
Sunday, is Stanley Kubrick's "Dr.
Strangelove." Most everyone has
probably seen it but if you have
seen it only on television, it's
profitable to catch it in a theatre.
Besides, no matter how many
times you've seen it, it's always
great to watch Peter Sellers arise
from his wheelchair and try to
salute the Fuhrer.
This quarter probably offers
the most extraordinary film
schedule in Stanford history and,
with capacity audiences jamming
practically all showings, this
probably goes to show that
students are interested in obtain
ing an increasingly high film
literacy, aside from just wise
cracking every Sunday night at
the Flicks. Enough for pro
foundities, however. In order to
somewhat sort out all the pictures
being screened each week, I will
write a column every Monday,
commenting on the movies I have
seen and offering other critics'
views on films I haven't caught.
First and foremost, if you
didn't see part one of the New
Cinema presentation at Cubberley
on Saturday or Sunday, be sure to
catch it tonight at 7:30. While the
program is called "New" Cinema,
many of the films are rather old,
Included are early shorts by

Truffaut, Polanski and Lester,
made as early as 1957, as well as
several exciting films from the
early '60's. It's well worth seeing.
On Tuesday and Wednesday
nights in Geology Room 320, the
reknowned Clive Miller presents
"The Letter" and "They Died
With Their Boots On." "The
Letter," based on a Somerset
Maugham story and directed by
William Wyler, is considered by
many to offer Bette Davis in her
finest performance; both she and
the film were nominated for
Academy Awards. "They Died
With Their Boots On" is a none
too-accurate account of Custer at
Little Big Horn and stars Errol
Flynn and Olivia de Havilland. If
that's your bag . . .
I've looked through over a
dozen comprehensive film books
and nowhere can I find a mention
of "The Yellow Cruise." this
week's I-Center film, shown at
Cubberley on Thursday. There are

such things as obscure master
pieces but surely Pauline Kael
would have said something.
"The Navigator," at Tresidder
on Friday, is perhaps Buster
Keaton's second best silent, the
best being "The General," which
is coming next week. "The
Navigator" has Keaton stranded at
sea with a girl on an empty ocean
liner and is filled with superb sight
gags. With this is a Laurel and
Hardy short, "Putting the Pants
on Phillip."
I have no way of commenting
on the specific experimental films
being shown at Geology 320 on
Friday at 11 p.m. but as groups,
these films are usually amusing
and sometimes exciting. This
week the films are "Castro
Street," "A Movie,"
"Menilmontant," "Lot in Sodom"
and "Metanomen."
