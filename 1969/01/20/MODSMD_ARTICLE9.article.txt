# Coming Home To Roost
## Voyage Across The Freeway 
### MARK WEINBERGER 
She walked directly up to me and looked me straight in the eye.
She didn't hesitate asking, "What organization do you represent,
brother?"
She appeared to be 50 years old, but probably was only 40. The
expansive brown coat and cloth house dress hid an equally expansive
stomach, the type built up from years of starchy vegetables rather
than lean beef.
I could understand why this black woman would ask what I was
doing there. As I glanced around the auditorium, my whiteness stood
out glaringly in the otherwise totally-black group.
The buxom woman who stood before me with a slightly mistrust
ful gleam in her dark eyes was one of the few adults present. The East
Palo Alto meeting was planned for college students. But even with
several of the youthful organizers clustered around us, she took
charge.
Wasted Words
I didn't waste words explaining how I worked part-time for a local
newspaper in addition to being a student editor of The Stanford
Daily, and how the newspaper had asked me to try to get into the Bay
Area Black Students Union conference.
I knew what the outcome of this little dialogue just inside the
autitorium door was to be. The metropolitan daily newspaper I was
working for had no black reporters in this district.
"I'm with The Stanford Daily, ma'am," I offered quickly.
The response was inevitable. "I'm sorry, but members of the press
aren't allowed to cover our conference. You might get the details
from a member of your school's Union," the lady in the brown coat
mumbled somewhat sullenly.
No Malice
The sound of the African drums booming over the loudspeaker
faded as I trudged back to my car. As I drove the three blocks back
over the freeway to my family's home in white Palo Alto, one sen
tence flashed continuously through my mind: "I wouldn't have
kicked any of them out of my meeting just because they were
BLACK."
Quite a few of those 150 or so black students went to high school
in this area when I did. But none of them went to Palo Alto High
School, which sends 30 students a year to Stanford. They went to
Ravenswood or Sequoia or a number of others which send a handful. I
didn't know any of those black kids with African hair styles or color
ful African shirts and none of them knew me.
When I went to elementary school in Palo Alto, the community of
East Palo Alto was basically a poor white, low rent area. Only one
Negro was in my class in elementary schoolâ€”l guess he'd be called a
"house nigger" now.
By the time I left Palo Alto High School for Stanford, the number
of Negroes in my class was as small a percentage as my kindergarten
class 12 years earlier. But during this period, Palo Alto watched silent
ly as the community of poor whites across the freeway rapidly sub
mitted to a black wave, building a full-fledged ghetto before our very
white eyes.
Gulf Widens
A limited number of black students from the new ghetto sneaked
their way into our school, but that was almost the full extent of the
exchange between the professional middle class on one side and the
unskilled black community on the other.
Those earnest young black students at the conference where I
wasn't welcome are the same age as I am; many of them grew up
several blocks from where I did. But I never knew them and saw them
only at once a year football games.
Those blacks were meeting to combat the put-down from Palo
Alto, facing it with a proud and defiant and self-supporting group of
their own that challenges the heretofore inviolate assumptions of
white society.
I wanted to stay at that meeting last month to tell those black kids
that I was sorry that our two ways of life hadn't met ten years before

so that the meeting they were holding now would not have been
necessary.
Once A Year Voyages
But Bayshore freeway divided us like an ocean, an ocean I dared to
cross only for that well-guarded football game. There was no black
cultural program for us in the white ghetto. There was no crossing of
the color line that the freeway signified, and thus no integration of
our respective schools. There were no community action programs
that made those important firsfrsteps to deal with the black commun
ity's immense problems.
In short, we each went our own way, with Palo Alto trying to close
its eyes to all the increasingly- evident signs that the bad conditions in
the East Palo Alto ghetto were growing steadily worse. So, the dis
interest in those black youngsters ten years ago is now haunting the
white man at San Francisco State and countless other universities, and
will continue to haunt him for many years. As Malcolm X would have
deftly phrased it, the chickens of the past ten years and the pre
ceeding 400 years have come home to roost.
Those first steps that were needed ten years ago and hundreds of
years ago are finally being taken. This area has come alive with a
multi-cultural program of education led by a militant black, the im
minent crumbling of segregated school district boundary lines, com
munity action programs, and black curricula. Even the federal govern
ment is beginning to awaken from the long slumber of neglect.
However, those 150 black college kids missed all of that; the
damage had been done in countless ways years and generations before.
As it turned out, I was both perpetrator and ultimate loser, as that
substantial rather angry black woman at that meeting last month so
disturbingly pointed out.
