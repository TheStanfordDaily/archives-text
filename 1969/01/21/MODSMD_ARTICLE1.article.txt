## Nixon Takes Office 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP)-Richard
Nixon assumed the presidency of
the United States Monday—and
with it the awesome burden of
leading a divided nation in a strife
torn world.
The 37th President pledged "to
consecrate my office, my energies,
and all of the wisdom I can sum
mon, to the cause of peace among
nations."
The changing of the guard, in
ceremonies as old as the Republic,
was carried out in peace and har
mony.
But it also was shielded by bul
letproof glass and massive security
measures that bore witness to the
perils of public life in a vast and
restless nation.
At 12:15 p.m. the 56-year-old
grocer's son from Whittier, Calif.,
savoring the crowning moment of
a spectacular political comeback,
somberly repeated the 3 5-word
oath of office, prescribed by the
Founding Fathers.
There were no incidents at the
inaugration scene. Downtown,
however, police began scattered
arrests as hundreds of antiwar pro
testers surged against the barri
cades along the inaugural parade
route.
• Speech Praised
WASHINGTON (AP)-Presi
dent Nixon's inaugural speech
drew lavish praise Monday from
Republicans in Congress and Dem
ocrats, too, generally had kind
words for it. But a top Negro
leader, Dr. Ralph David Aber
nathy, expressed deep disappoint
ment.
Abernathy, head of the South
ern Christian Leadership Confer
ence, said while the speech was
eloquent and moving it dealt in
sweeping generalities and he
added:
"The speech reflected no sense
of urgency and no sensitivity to
the basic problems of hunger, pov
erty and race in this nation and
said very little about plans to heal
the wounds and bring the nation
together as he has previously
promised."

WASHINGTON (AP)-Richard
Nixon assumed the presidency of

leading a divided nation in a strife
torn world.
The 37th President pledged "to
consecrate my office, my energies,
and all of the wisdom I can sum
mon, to the cause of peace among
nations."
The changing of the guard, in
ceremonies as old as the Republic,
was carried out in peace and har
mony.

letproof glass and massive security
measures that bore witness to the
perils of public life in a vast and
restless nation.

of urgency and no sensitivity to
the basic problems of hunger, pov
erty and race in this nation and
said very little about plans to heal
the wounds and bring the nation
together as he has previously
promised."
