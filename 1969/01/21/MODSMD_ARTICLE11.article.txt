• Polv Sci Courses
Editor, THE DAILY:
As one of the four undergrad
uates present at last week's meet
ing of the Political Science Facul
ty, I think a few comments are in
order.
It would have been impossible
for the faculty to once again deny
students their rightful place in the
determination of department af
fairs. That was done this quarter,
when the desires of 170 students
for relevant courses in certain
areas were rejected.
We did all the legwork involved,
proposed reading lists, gathered
interested students, even provided
for teachers, since department
members are, so it seems, too
busy to teach courses about what
students want to learn. And the
faculty killed this show of initia
tive, squashed it as soon as it
raised its head, rejected or refused
to consider everything that came
before it.
Despite claims to the contrary,
these courses were not provided as
outlined by Messers. Wolfinger,
Brody, and Fagin. It was only in
the wake of the hatchet job done
by the faculty on the last propos
als that we were able to work out
a course in Marxism with Profes
sor North, and the fact remains
that none of the other faculty
members have offered to give up
the time required to do the same,
to answer the stated desires of
many other students.
The issue, as the faculty so
rightly sees, is one of power: we
challenge the absolute authority
over academic affairs the faculty
presently holds. We as students
have a stake in the courses our
department offers. We have a
stake in all of the affairs of that
department. We too have a right
to a say in those courses, those
affairs, a right to elect voting

members to the determining facul
ty bodies, to express our views, to
have a truly meaningful (i.e.,
power-based) voice in all that the
department does.
But we have been thrown a few
table scraps to keep us peaceful.
In principle, they say, we have a
right to be on one committee of
the department, to review only
those courses we propose. And a
faculty committee is going to
work out the mechanics. (Will it
be one student appointed by the
head of the department, to act as
a showpiece of enlightened aca
deme?, or perhaps they'll nicely
give us two to be revealed by Div
ine Providence?)
It was what I expected, but far
less than I had hoped.
"But students, proposing cour
ses? asking for a voice in what
they learn raising their heads out
of bondage? Shocking! They
aren't mature enough for any
voice. They haven't been through
the mill as we have. We have to
interpret the world for them.
They need philosopher-kings!"—
So do blacks, boys, so do blacks
just ask George Wallace.

• Radicals
Editor, THE DAILY:
The cities they are broke in half
And the middle men are
gone . . .
These hunters who are shriek
ing now
Do they speak for us?
—Leonard Cohen
Does the SDS speak for you? If
not, don't just sit there—let the
President and Trustees of Stan
ford know how you feel about the
issues.

• And Nazis
Editor, THE DAILY:
Comparing SDS to Nazis and
their tactics to those of storm
troopers makes me wonder if the
Geology faculty and other mind
less liberals on campus have any
understanding of the violence and
fascism that the Trustees are per
petrating throughout the world.
These liberals, who self-righteous
ly view themselves as the rational
middle, fail to perceive that only
outrage is a rational response to
men who draw their millions from
the manufacture of nerve gas,
anti-personnel weapons, and other
such "defense" systems. The
American government and corpor
ations can more appropriately be
compared to Nazis.
Alfred Krupp, who today has
assets in the billions, profited
greatly as a result of Nazi inflicted
genocide. And today, many of our
trustees net grand profits in con
nection with the US genocide of
the Vietnamese. It is interesting to
note that the people who are so
enraged with the tactics of SDS
are the same people who have
been apathetic to the savage tac
tics of American business.
To the liberal students who ex
pect to develop a rapport with the
trustees and the administration, I
have this observation. Every mem
ber of SDS, myself included, was
a liberal once, and I expect that
by the end of the school year
some of you will know what rad
icalized us.

• On Wisdom
Editor, THE DAILY:
There is one word which well
describes the letters from Messrs.
Murphy, Kimball and Miles con
demning the tactics and lack of re
spect shown by the Stanford
SDS'ers:
"WISDOM"

• Proving Mr. Haight Wrong
Editor, THE DAILY:
PROVING Mr. HAIGHT WRONG?
Poor Mr. Haight,
I can't negate
That pure frustration
Seems your fate,
But please resist
That uptight twist
That wouldst equate
Pure right with hate.
Bully boys and arrogance
Present an unappealing stance.
A cause so narrowly supported
Will probably be self-aborted.
So get yourself back to work
Resist the call to be a jerk
Early failures have forged tools
That hammered men from would
be fools.
This world's imperfect, I confess,
But it won't change through SDS.
