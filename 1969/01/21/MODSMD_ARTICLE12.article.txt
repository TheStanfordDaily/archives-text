## Radicals Not Pigs 
### CARY DICTOR 
As a member of SDS, I feel that we have been subjected to an
unwarranted number of ill-conceived attacks by various pigs of this
community. Here I will attempt to straighten the matter out.
Many complain that Our actions and tactics are not in accord with,
and may possibly be antithetical to, Our ends. This is garbage. As
anyone can plainly see were he not blinded by hypocritical bourgeou
sie neo-intelligence, Our ends are so magnificent, so invaluable, and so
purely and obviously God-like that virtually any and all means may be
employed in reaching them.
In simpler language, since We strive to eliminate wars, killing, vio
lence, exploitation, and oppression, as long as our methods contain
less of these things than which We want to do away with, they are
preferable and justifiable. So, if 200 Vietnamese are destroyed by the
United States government in a day, We have a veritable Carte Blanche
to brutalize and/or destroy anything or anyone of less value than 200
lives during that day. As you can see, this easily justifies Us in closing
Stanford and knocking down 1,000 trustees.
Although some would attempt to argue that using violence-oriented
tactics to protest war is incongruous, We know that non-violence is
unrealistic and ineffectual, besides being ideologically repulsive, be
cause We tried it for three weeks and found that the liberal do-gooders
and cowardly pacifists it brings into Our group are useless in Our
struggle.
Overflow Of Obscenity
Also, it is alleged that in many of Our confrontations there is an
overflow of obscenity. This, may I say, is true. We in SDS take
delight in demonstrating Our abilities to stand outside the pale of
middle-class mores and even common civility. However, contrary to
popular belief (as most true things are), the term "pig" is not bandied
about without purpose. A pig is anyone who contributes to the war
and exploitation of this country either by association with war exploi
tation industries, government, or simply by silence.
In fact, even those who profess to work against the war but do so
through despicable "democratic processes" are pigs. Hence, in short,
only SDS members are not pigs. This should make for a clear distinc
tion so that no future ambiguities develop.
To those who fear Us and label Us radical, let me say that unless
they are pigs, they have nothing to fear. For the pigs, however, who
admittedly make up a good proportion of the population, there is
much to fear. For those pigs have brutalized and oppressed, and in
turn they will be brutalized and oppressed until We have a peaceful
and unoppressive society. The "coersion, intimidation, and arrogance"
SDS is charged with is only radical because SDS is not the legal
government of this country. When It does become government, there
will be nothing Radical about It, and there won't seem to have been a
change in government at all, I can assure you.
Apple Pie
As for charges of foreign instigation of SDS, let me say that We are
as American as apple pie, and follow in the tradition of many fine
organizations of the past. We are a truly American response to truly
American conditions, much as the American posse was in the old
West. Just because We refuse military induction doesn't mean we
dis pprove of military tactics. It is simply that the enemy that we
should be napalming is here at home. After all, being against militar
ism is like hating your mother.
Lastly, We have been charged with anti-intellectualism. This is a
mistake I am delighted to rectify. In fact, it is simple. We are the peak
of intellectualism. We have reached the ultimate point in morality and
knowledge. We have perfect goals. They are absolute. They transcend
time, people, emotion, and intelligence.
The Spanish thought they had done it at the end of the 15th
century, but only We have finally accomplished it. We know the
Truth. Therefore, further inquiry into the Questions is foolish, for the
inescapable Answers lie with Us. Only the Demands remain to be met.
Properly speaking, Our duty is to dike the flow of heretical ideas and
practice and spread Our Truth throughout the world. This We will do
at any cost.
We will lay our lives down for it (for short jail terms only, of
course). Then finally We will emerge as the actual victors in human
history! Revolution must be born. Only through bloodshed and com
plete disregard for human dignity can peace and democratic values be
forged. Viva la Revolution!!

much to fear. For those pigs have brutalized and oppressed, and in
turn they will be brutalized and oppressed until We have a peaceful
and unoppressive society. The "coersion, intimidation, and arrogance"
SDS is charged with is only radical because SDS is not the legal
government of this country. When It does become government, there
will be nothing Radical about It, and there won't seem to have been a
change in government at all, I can assure you.
Apple Pie
As for charges of foreign instigation of SDS, let me say that We are
as American as apple pie, and follow in the tradition of many fine
organizations of the past. We are a truly American response to truly
American conditions, much as the American posse was in the old
West. Just because We refuse military induction doesn't mean we
dis pprove of military tactics. It is simply that the enemy that we
should be napalming is here at home. After all, being against militar
ism is like hating your mother.
Lastly, We have been charged with anti-intellectualism. This is a
mistake I am delighted to rectify. In fact, it is simple. We are the peak
of intellectualism. We have reached the ultimate point in morality and
knowledge. We have perfect goals. They are absolute. They transcend
time, people, emotion, and intelligence.
The Spanish thought they had done it at the end of the 15th
century, but only We have finally accomplished it. We know the
Truth. Therefore, further inquiry into the Questions is foolish, for the
inescapable Answers lie with Us. Only the Demands remain to be met.
Properly speaking, Our duty is to dike the flow of heretical ideas and
practice and spread Our Truth throughout the world. This We will do
at any cost.
We will lay our lives down for it (for short jail terms only, of
course). Then finally We will emerge as the actual victors in human
history! Revolution must be born. Only through bloodshed and com
plete disregard for human dignity can peace and democratic values be
forged. Viva la Revolution!!
As a member of SDS, I feel that we have been subjected to an
unwarranted number of ill-conceived attacks by various pigs of this
community. Here I will attempt to straighten the matter out.
Many complain that Our actions and tactics are not in accord with,
and may possibly be antithetical to, Our ends. This is garbage. As
anyone can plainly see were he not blinded by hypocritical bourgeou
sie neo-intelligence, Our ends are so magnificent, so invaluable, and so
purely and obviously God-like that virtually any and all means may be
employed in reaching them.
In simpler language, since We strive to eliminate wars, killing, vio
lence, exploitation, and oppression, as long as our methods contain
less of these things than which We want to do away with, they are
preferable and justifiable. So, if 200 Vietnamese are destroyed by the
United States government in a day, We have a veritable Carte Blanche
to brutalize and/or destroy anything or anyone of less value than 200
lives during that day. As you can see, this easily justifies Us in closing
Stanford and knocking down 1,000 trustees.
Although some would attempt to argue that using violence-oriented
tactics to protest war is incongruous, We know that non-violence is
unrealistic and ineffectual, besides being ideologically repulsive, be
cause We tried it for three weeks and found that the liberal do-gooders
and cowardly pacifists it brings into Our group are useless in Our
struggle.
Overflow Of Obscenity
Also, it is alleged that in many of Our confrontations there is an
overflow of obscenity. This, may I say, is true. We in SDS take
delight in demonstrating Our abilities to stand outside the pale of
middle-class mores and even common civility. However, contrary to
popular belief (as most true things are), the term "pig" is not bandied
about without purpose. A pig is anyone who contributes to the war
and exploitation of this country either by association with war exploi
tation industries, government, or simply by silence.
In fact, even those who profess to work against the war but do so
through despicable "democratic processes" are pigs. Hence, in short,
only SDS members are not pigs. This should make for a clear distinc
tion so that no future ambiguities develop.
To those who fear Us and label Us radical, let me say that unless
they are pigs, they have nothing to fear. For the pigs, however, who
admittedly make up a good proportion of the population, there is
much to fear. For those pigs have brutalized and oppressed, and in
turn they will be brutalized and oppressed until We have a peaceful
