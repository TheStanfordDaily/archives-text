# Studio Watts Strategy
## Art As Tool To Combat Alienation 
### 
"We're all ghetto individuals in
some degree, in the degree that we
are isolated, unknowing, sepa
rated, alienated or estranged,"
says James Woods, founder
presiderlt of the Studio Watts
School of the Arts in Los Angeles.
Woods believes individuals
from poor or rich "ghettos" can
move out of the poverty of iso
lation into the richness of
inclusion by having "something to
do together" that surmounts walls
of fear, tension and defenses, and
problems of racial, economic,
social and political polarization.
He feels it is a waste of time to
talk about the need for "good
communication." He leaps over
intellectualizing and creates situ
ations of sufficient interest to
draw people together so com
munication can begin.
Gave Up Profession
In late 1964 Woods gave up his
profession and guaranteed above
average income as an accountant
to start the Studio with his wife, a
former probation officer with the
County of Los Angeles.

He has explained the Studio
Watts format in these terms: "It is
a school for the arts which
primarily involves the antisocial,
alienated individual who is unable
to express himself constructively.
"We use art as the tool to
change this behavior pattern.
"We require that the individual
has the initiative to come to the
Studio, so that from the beginning
there is self motivation. We do no
recruiting. Word on what's going
on has gotten around.
Dropouts Are Sensitive People
"The problem of sensitive
people dropping out of the
system—and they're the ones that
do—is that at that point of alien
ation they are not in a position to
communicate. We have to restore
communication . . .find what we
have in common, develop a com
munication situation.
"We use the master-apprentice
relationship of instruction, which
initiates a communication situ
ation and effectively combats iso
lation.

"We have our rules and an indi
vidual most matriculate before he
is accepted as a full apprentice.
That established, the master had
to produce. The apprentice has to
produce. Some of the apprentices
are on scholarships of $200 a
month of which one-fourth goes
to the master, one-fourth for
supplies, one-fourth to the
apprentice, and one-fourth into a
reserve fund which is given to the
apprentice when he leaves the
Studio.
"This system generates a con
structive participation in society
and the self confidence to make
the next move toward self ad
vancement.
Must Understand Exposure
"We have to find what we all
have in common. We have to
understand exposure. The ghetto
gives the Negro no new exposure,
no new experience . . .nor do
white ghettos, rich or poor.
"We try to remove the voidness
of experience of the ghetto indi
vidual . . .and we're all ghetto
individuals in some degree. Any
individual isolated suffers from
voidness.
"The real key is the healing of
voidness so that a richness occurs
by learning of others different
from ourselves.
"Man's got to know how to
live, how to express. That's what
we stress."
Brought To Stanford
In May Woods brought the
Studio Watts drama group to
Stanford. Their play, "No Exit,"

portended the way the Stanford-
Studio Watts communication situ
ation is growing. The actors
stayed at Serra House with
students as hosts as well as staff
residents of the house.
The Studio drama group
returned to Stanford in October
with "Black Girl in Search of
God," adapted from George
Bernard Shaw's essay to play form
by Studio apprentice Wanda
Coleman.
Freelen, who is director of pro
grams for the Stanford Alumni
Association, and Associate Prof,
of English W. Bliss Carnochan are
members of the Studio Watts
Development Board, which had its
first meeting last month at the
Studio in Watts. They are making
plans for the Studio drama group
to present three plays a year at
Stanford, and making contacts
with other universities for campus
performances.
During the summer, Keith
Boyle, Frank Lobdell and Nathan
Oliveira of the Stanford art
faculty pioneered the Studio's
tutor arts program for the
especially talented apprentices
who emerge through the way of
life program. Fifty artists across
the country are committed to ex
panding the program next
summer.
On a recent weekend two

Stanford Graduate School of Busi
ness students, Ed Gill and Marky
Ellis, went to Studio Watts in Los
Angeles to begin a project of
getting the Studio format into
"exportable" form.
Interest is rising in opening
additional Studios on the now
proven Watts format. Woods this
month made a presentation to
Pennsylvania State Department of
Education which is considering
the establishment ta Studios
throughout the state.
He has been invited to make a
similar presentation to the
California State "Department of
Compensatory Education.

communication." He leaps over
intellectualizing and creates situ
ations of sufficient interest to
draw people together so com
munication can begin.
Gave Up Profession
In late 1964 Woods gave up his
profession and guaranteed above
average income as an accountant
to start the Studio with his wife, a
former probation officer with the
County of Los Angeles.

He has explained the Studio
Watts format in these terms: "It is
a school for the arts which
primarily involves the antisocial,
alienated individual who is unable
to express himself constructively.
"We use art as the tool to
change this behavior pattern.
"We require that the individual
has the initiative to come to the
Studio, so that from the beginning
there is self motivation. We do no
recruiting. Word on what's going
on has gotten around.
Dropouts Are Sensitive People
"The problem of sensitive
people dropping out of the
system—and they're the ones that
do—is that at that point of alien
ation they are not in a position to
communicate. We have to restore
communication . . .find what we
have in common, develop a com
munication situation.
"We use the master-apprentice
relationship of instruction, which
initiates a communication situ
ation and effectively combats iso
lation.

"We have our rules and an indi
vidual most matriculate before he
is accepted as a full apprentice.
That established, the master had
to produce. The apprentice has to
produce. Some of the apprentices
are on scholarships of $200 a
month of which one-fourth goes
to the master, one-fourth for
supplies, one-fourth to the
apprentice, and one-fourth into a
reserve fund which is given to the
apprentice when he leaves the
Studio.
"This system generates a con
structive participation in society
and the self confidence to make
the next move toward self ad
vancement.
Must Understand Exposure
"We have to find what we all
have in common. We have to
understand exposure. The ghetto
gives the Negro no new exposure,
no new experience . . .nor do
white ghettos, rich or poor.
"We try to remove the voidness
of experience of the ghetto indi
vidual . . .and we're all ghetto
individuals in some degree. Any
individual isolated suffers from
voidness.
"The real key is the healing of
voidness so that a richness occurs
by learning of others different
from ourselves.
"Man's got to know how to
live, how to express. That's what
we stress."
Brought To Stanford
In May Woods brought the
Studio Watts drama group to
Stanford. Their play, "No Exit,"

portended the way the Stanford-
Studio Watts communication situ
ation is growing. The actors
stayed at Serra House with
students as hosts as well as staff
residents of the house.
The Studio drama group
returned to Stanford in October
with "Black Girl in Search of
God," adapted from George
Bernard Shaw's essay to play form
by Studio apprentice Wanda
Coleman.
Freelen, who is director of pro
grams for the Stanford Alumni
Association, and Associate Prof,
of English W. Bliss Carnochan are
members of the Studio Watts
Development Board, which had its
first meeting last month at the
Studio in Watts. They are making
plans for the Studio drama group
to present three plays a year at
Stanford, and making contacts
with other universities for campus
performances.
During the summer, Keith
Boyle, Frank Lobdell and Nathan
Oliveira of the Stanford art
faculty pioneered the Studio's
tutor arts program for the
especially talented apprentices
who emerge through the way of
life program. Fifty artists across
the country are committed to ex
panding the program next
summer.
On a recent weekend two

Stanford Graduate School of Busi
ness students, Ed Gill and Marky
Ellis, went to Studio Watts in Los
Angeles to begin a project of
getting the Studio format into
"exportable" form.
Interest is rising in opening
additional Studios on the now
proven Watts format. Woods this
month made a presentation to
Pennsylvania State Department of
Education which is considering
the establishment ta Studios
throughout the state.
He has been invited to make a
similar presentation to the
California State "Department of
Compensatory Education.

has the initiative to come to the
Studio, so that from the beginning
there is self motivation. We do no
recruiting. Word on what's going
on has gotten around.
Dropouts Are Sensitive People
"The problem of sensitive
people dropping out of the
system—and they're the ones that
do—is that at that point of alien
ation they are not in a position to
communicate. We have to restore
communication . . .find what we
have in common, develop a com

"We use the master-apprentice
relationship of instruction, which
initiates a communication situ

"We have our rules and an indi
vidual most matriculate before he
is accepted as a full apprentice.
That established, the master had
to produce. The apprentice has to
produce. Some of the apprentices
are on scholarships of $200 a
month of which one-fourth goes
to the master, one-fourth for
supplies, one-fourth to the
apprentice, and one-fourth into a
reserve fund which is given to the
apprentice when he leaves the
Studio.
"This system generates a con
structive participation in society
and the self confidence to make
the next move toward self ad
vancement.
Must Understand Exposure
"We have to find what we all
have in common. We have to
understand exposure. The ghetto
gives the Negro no new exposure,
no new experience . . .nor do
white ghettos, rich or poor.
"We try to remove the voidness
of experience of the ghetto indi
vidual . . .and we're all ghetto
individuals in some degree. Any
individual isolated suffers from
voidness.
"The real key is the healing of
voidness so that a richness occurs
by learning of others different
from ourselves.

Brought To Stanford
In May Woods brought the
Studio Watts drama group to
Stanford. Their play, "No Exit,"

portended the way the Stanford-
Studio Watts communication situ
ation is growing. The actors
stayed at Serra House with
students as hosts as well as staff
residents of the house.
The Studio drama group
returned to Stanford in October
with "Black Girl in Search of
God," adapted from George
Bernard Shaw's essay to play form
by Studio apprentice Wanda
Coleman.
Freelen, who is director of pro
grams for the Stanford Alumni
Association, and Associate Prof,
of English W. Bliss Carnochan are
members of the Studio Watts
Development Board, which had its
first meeting last month at the
Studio in Watts. They are making
plans for the Studio drama group
to present three plays a year at
Stanford, and making contacts
with other universities for campus
performances.
During the summer, Keith
Boyle, Frank Lobdell and Nathan
Oliveira of the Stanford art
faculty pioneered the Studio's
tutor arts program for the
especially talented apprentices
who emerge through the way of
life program. Fifty artists across
the country are committed to ex
panding the program next
summer.
On a recent weekend two

Stanford Graduate School of Busi
ness students, Ed Gill and Marky
Ellis, went to Studio Watts in Los
Angeles to begin a project of
getting the Studio format into
"exportable" form.
Interest is rising in opening
additional Studios on the now
proven Watts format. Woods this
month made a presentation to
Pennsylvania State Department of
Education which is considering
the establishment ta Studios
throughout the state.
He has been invited to make a
similar presentation to the
California State "Department of
Compensatory Education.

House until Jan. 29.


JAMES WOOD
"We're all ghetto individuals in
some degree, in the degree that we
are isolated, unknowing, sepa
rated, alienated or estranged,"
says James Woods, founder
presiderlt of the Studio Watts
School of the Arts in Los Angeles.
Woods believes individuals
from poor or rich "ghettos" can
move out of the poverty of iso
lation into the richness of
inclusion by having "something to
do together" that surmounts walls
of fear, tension and defenses, and
problems of racial, economic,
social and political polarization.
He feels it is a waste of time to
talk about the need for "good
communication." He leaps over
intellectualizing and creates situ
ations of sufficient interest to
draw people together so com
munication can begin.
Gave Up Profession
In late 1964 Woods gave up his
profession and guaranteed above
average income as an accountant
to start the Studio with his wife, a
former probation officer with the
County of Los Angeles.

He has explained the Studio
Watts format in these terms: "It is
a school for the arts which
primarily involves the antisocial,
alienated individual who is unable
to express himself constructively.
"We use art as the tool to
change this behavior pattern.
"We require that the individual
has the initiative to come to the
Studio, so that from the beginning
there is self motivation. We do no
recruiting. Word on what's going
on has gotten around.
