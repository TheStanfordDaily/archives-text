# Summer Jobs Available
## Sierra Camp: Skiing, Hiking, Sailing 
### BETTY NISHIOKA 
Imagine yourself on a pair of
water skiis slicing through the
tranquil ripples of a mountain
lake. Or perhaps the wind is
pressing against the taut canvas of
your sailboat as you glide under
the warmth of a summer sun. Or
maybe you are hiking along a trail
blanketed by a spongy cushion of
fresh green moss.
These are only a few brief
descriptions of summer jobs being
offered to Stanford students this
summer.
This year, about 25 students
will be given the opportunity to
take part in a unique summer
experience at the annual Stanford
Sierra Camp.
Alumni Activity
The Camp, owned and operated
by the Stanford Alumni
Association, is located just south
of Lake Tahoe on the southwest
shore of a body of water which
bears the colorful name of Fallen
Leaf Lake.
For eleven weeks each summer,
this lake and the surrounding hills
are transformed into a beehive of
recreational, educational, and
social activities that are as diverse
as the interests of each of the
approximately 2000 participants.
This summer the Camp will
begin its season on June 21 and
continue until September 7.
Instructors for various sports
and art programs are needed, as
well as workers in the dining
room, the Papoose Playground,
and the fountain-store, which sup
plies everything from ice cream
sodas to Stanford sweatshirts.
Complete job descriptions and
applications are available for inter
ested students at the Bowman
Alumni House until January 29.
The Canp is open to the fami
lies and friends of Stanford alum
ni, faculty, administration, and
parents of Stanford students, and
the guests usually enjoy a leisurely
week at this mountain resort, al
though there is no time limit on
the length of their stay.
Something for Everyone
A glance at a few of the activi
ties of this camp which boasts
that it "has something for every
one" reveals that such a statement
is not far from the truth.
Twenty acres of the beautiful
Sierra Nevada countryside provide
the setting for the hiking, fishing,
canoeing, and sailing ventures of
the guests, and horses for riding
are supplied by a nearby camp.
The Sierra Camp is well-equip
ped with facilities that make bas
ketball, volleyball, tennis, and
archery a daily recreation, and
those who are dissatisfied with the
waters of the private beach can
swim in the heated pool, which
becomes the site for swimming
lessons every weekday morning.
A stay at this resort is filled
with educational as well as recrea
tional programs. Anyone over 10
years of age can take advantage of
the art instruction provided in a
variety of media by art students
who are members of the working
staff.
Student panels as well as in
formal discussions and speeches
by distinguished faculty and ad
ministration members offer in
sights into the attitudes of the

academic community toward cur
rent topics and issues. Former
members of the working staff
have contended that lectures be
come more meaningful as both
guests and staff are given oppor
tunities to become acquainted
with speakers and instructors in a
friendly, relaxed atmosphere.
Excellent Food
In spite of the fact that out
door activity has the tendency to
create hearty appetites, no guest is
allowed to go hungry. On the con
trary, the Camp is noted for the
excellence of its meals. Breakfast
is followed by a continental
breakfast for late risers, and both
meals feature Danish pastry which
is specially baked at the Camp it
self.
The highlight of each day is an
elaborately decorated gourmet
buffet served at lunch, at which
occasionally appear such moun
tain delicacies as fresh crab and
shrimp.

Guests are cared for even to the
very end of their stay, at which
time each departing family is
equipped with a box lunch for the
trip home.
Frank Hildreth, manager of the
Sierra Camp, emphasized that the
camp is geared toward family liv
ing and toward providing activities
that family members can enjoy to
gether.
There are, however, opportuni
ties for each member of the fam
ily to enjoy the companionship of
those in his own age group alone.
A brand new addition to the camp
this year is the Witches' Pool, a
trout pond for the exclusive use
of children under 16 years of age.
Daily babysitting service is
maintained at Papoose Play
ground, where children engage in
such activities as arts and crafts,
story telling, and nature hikes. In
the meantime, parents can relax
and enjoy social hours in the
Adult Lounge which furnishes a
bar and a large library.

A special attraction each week
is Wes Stetson, Lake Tahoe's pop
ular "Eye in the Sky," who soars
into camp in his yellow seaplane
to take guests on rides over the
breathtaking scenery.
Of course, for those who are
not satisfied with the activities
which go on in the canp, the en
tertainment at South Lake Tahoe
is only an irresistible half-hour
away.
Guests are free to do as they
like and participation in all pro
grams and activities are voluntary.
Dining and recreational services
must be maintained, however, and
this is where the student worker
fits in.
