## 'Disciple' Confused 
### GAIL ANDERSON 
There is something troubling about the American
Conservatory Theatre's production of Shaw's The
Devil's Disciple. There is also something enjoyable
about it. One at a time.
To an extraordinary degree, the staging of Shaw's
theatre demands an exacting conception of the play
and a precise execution of that conception.
Nineteenth century social comedy played straight
comes dangerously close to appearing as unintended
farce.
Shaw's play is farcical anyway: elements of
parody on melodrama form the basic structure of
the drama. Still, one feels at points that neither
director Edward Hastings nor his cast are aware of
the kind or degree of comedy they are playing.
The actors, to use a cliche, do not fully know
what play they are in: so characterization and
pacing are uneven, and comic effect alternates
between over- and underplaying.
Old Tricks Present
Some of these problems arise from the drama
itself. All the old tricks are there: mistaken identity,
irony, the rogue-hero prodigal son in a structure one
could discuss for pages; let it suffice that it is
enormously complex in its iconography, but not so
confusing that the viewer is bothered—unless he is
trying to pinpoint the difficulties of this
production.
The play begins too slowly and moves too
irregularly to justify that climactic moment when
the formal hero swings across stage on a rope to
rescue the natural hero of the play. One expects the
ending and yet does not know what to make of it.
Some sense of medodramatic movement tells the
audience that the play is building to that point,

regardless of the quality and pacing of the
production.
Still one is not really comfortable with the
conclusion. There is just enough lack of coherence
to make the play forgettable.
Comical Happenings
i That may well be the most damning adjective
that can be applied to a play, and I will qualify it.
The production is full of well-executed comic
moments—though others add nothing to the lines
themselves, and a few fall flat. Once the play is
under way, the actors develop a confidence of
characterization that the opening scene lacks. The
caricature parts of the hero's family are well
conceived, though perhaps too strikingly farcical in
comparison with the leads.
But a few performances can more than redeem
the difficulties of a production. Paul Shenar, as Dick
Dudgeon, the Devil's Disciple, commands the stage
quite as a comic hero should. What he lacks in
technical performance and consistency he makes up
in energy and a strong sense of who his character
is—and that is becoming too rare on the stage. James
Milton as his dolt of a brother is also suitably,
convincingly comic.
But Jay Doyle's General Burgoyne is the
outstanding performance of the evening. His sharp
definition of that curious blend of form and wit, the
English aristocrat, exactly captures the sense of a
self-conscious culture.
The constrast between him and Shenar's response
is too dissipated, by the nature of his character, to
compare with Doyle's pared-down performance.
But both actors succeed in exacting a theatrical
image from a confused and intricate piece of
Shavian scholarship. Which, after all, is something.

rescue the natural hero of the play. One expects the
ending and yet does not know what to make of it.
Some sense of medodramatic movement tells the
audience that the play is building to that point,

regardless of the quality and pacing of the
production.
Still one is not really comfortable with the
conclusion. There is just enough lack of coherence
to make the play forgettable.
Comical Happenings
i That may well be the most damning adjective
that can be applied to a play, and I will qualify it.
The production is full of well-executed comic
moments—though others add nothing to the lines
themselves, and a few fall flat. Once the play is
under way, the actors develop a confidence of
characterization that the opening scene lacks. The
caricature parts of the hero's family are well
conceived, though perhaps too strikingly farcical in
comparison with the leads.
But a few performances can more than redeem
the difficulties of a production. Paul Shenar, as Dick
Dudgeon, the Devil's Disciple, commands the stage
quite as a comic hero should. What he lacks in
technical performance and consistency he makes up
in energy and a strong sense of who his character
is—and that is becoming too rare on the stage. James
Milton as his dolt of a brother is also suitably,
convincingly comic.
But Jay Doyle's General Burgoyne is the
outstanding performance of the evening. His sharp
definition of that curious blend of form and wit, the
English aristocrat, exactly captures the sense of a
self-conscious culture.
The constrast between him and Shenar's response
is too dissipated, by the nature of his character, to
compare with Doyle's pared-down performance.
But both actors succeed in exacting a theatrical
image from a confused and intricate piece of
Shavian scholarship. Which, after all, is something.
There is something troubling about the American
Conservatory Theatre's production of Shaw's The
Devil's Disciple. There is also something enjoyable
about it. One at a time.
To an extraordinary degree, the staging of Shaw's
theatre demands an exacting conception of the play
and a precise execution of that conception.
Nineteenth century social comedy played straight
comes dangerously close to appearing as unintended
farce.
Shaw's play is farcical anyway: elements of
parody on melodrama form the basic structure of
the drama. Still, one feels at points that neither
director Edward Hastings nor his cast are aware of
the kind or degree of comedy they are playing.
The actors, to use a cliche, do not fully know
what play they are in: so characterization and
pacing are uneven, and comic effect alternates
between over- and underplaying.
Old Tricks Present
Some of these problems arise from the drama
itself. All the old tricks are there: mistaken identity,
irony, the rogue-hero prodigal son in a structure one
could discuss for pages; let it suffice that it is
enormously complex in its iconography, but not so
confusing that the viewer is bothered—unless he is
trying to pinpoint the difficulties of this
production.
The play begins too slowly and moves too
irregularly to justify that climactic moment when
the formal hero swings across stage on a rope to
rescue the natural hero of the play. One expects the
ending and yet does not know what to make of it.
