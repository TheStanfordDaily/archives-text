The Committee on the Gradu
ate Division at Stanford has
unamimously recommended that
the University-wide requirement
of at least one foreign language
for the Ph.D. be abolished, with
such requirements handled at the
discretion of each department.
On the agenda for Thursday's
meeting of the Senate of the Aca
demic Council, the recommen
dation has been explained as
follows by Graduate Dean Virgil
Whitaker:
"The committee was impressed
by the necessity and value of
foreign language training and
knowledge on the part of graduate
students, but it agreed that the
needs as they relate to different
disciplines are exceedingly vari
able.
"In particular, it was influ
enced by the arguments of Prof.
Arthur Schawlow, speaking for
the Department of Physics . . .that
the present use of English as the
international language of physics
makes training in a foreign
language unnecessary and that the
mounting pressures for the gradu
ate student's time makes the kind
of perfunctory mastery of a
foreign language achieved by
Ph.D. candidates an undesirable
diversion of time at the graduate
level . . .
"The case of physics was con
sidered to be probably a singular
one . . .the committee expects
that, in general, other de
partments may not substantially
decrease language requirements.
"Nevertheless, the committee
feels this step is a correct one in
the direction of increasing flexi
bility in graduate study and
decreasing the time required
toward obtaining a Ph.D."
