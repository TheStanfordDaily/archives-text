## SDS Teaches In On Demands 
### LYNNE McCALLISTER 
"Many people claim that the
demands of SDS are unfounded.
That is the purpose, of this
meeting, to provide information
to back up our demands," began
Leonard Siegal last night at a
teach-in in Tresidder large lounge,
sponsored by the Students for a
Democratic Society (SDS).
SDS relaxed their rhetoric last
night to provide a coherent,
factual explanation of their
demands that Stanford and Stan
ford Research Institute (SRI)
withdraw from all military con
cerns in Southeast Asia.
First, Harry Cleaver, a graduate
student in economics at Stanford,
spoke on SRI. Most of his infor
mation, he said, came from the
institute itself. He was followed
by Peter Wiley, who works on The
Leviathan, a radical magazine in
San Francisco. "He spends his
time doing research about the
system," said Siegel.
SRI was founded as an
"Applied research link between
the University and industry," said
Cleaver. There are 50 Stanford
faculty members and 60 students
working at SRI, and 15 SRI
people teaching courses at Stan
ford.
The problem is not a structural
one, says Cleaver. "The structure

is highly efficient and should be
admired. It is a connection be
tween the University and the real
world. Our objections are based
on the goals, whether one feels
that the interests it serves are ap
propriate."
Cleaver explained in detail the
military research that SRI does.
This includes classified atomic war
fare research, studies on anti
ballistic missiles, artillery effec
tiveness, helicopter vulnerability,
and counter-insurgency. These last
studies involve such things as the
study of terrain in countries
where revolutions may occur and
where the U.S. might become in
volved and investigations of the
advisability of helping the govern
ment of Peru to put down revolts.
SRI is also developing devices
called "people sniffers", which are
used by the military on airplanes
to detect Viet Cong hiding in the
jungles. Studies on chemical and
biological warfare malce np a rela
tively small part or the $28
million budget on military re
search.
"We must judge whether SRI is
really contributing to the peace
and prosperity of mankind, as is
stated in their founding grant."
Peter Wiley spoke about U.S.

economic involvement in South
east Asia.
"Materials to allow rich coun
tries to grow richer must come
from the poor," he quoted from
an SDS pamphlet. Wiley con
cluded that these countries are al
ready becoming highly dependent
on the U.S." If we think econ
omic involvement in Southeast
Asia is important, then we can't
withdraw. We are com-iitted to
permanent involvement there."
"We feel strongly that we
would not have had so much in
terest for these teach-ins if it had
not been for the Trustee confron
tation last week," said Siegel. "We
plan to follow this by setting up
discussion groups in the dorms."


CONCERNING SRI AND ASIAâ€”SDS member Leonard Siegel partici
pated in a teach-in last night in Tresidder's Large Lounge in which they
tried to show the reasons behind the demands the radical organization
presented to the University last quarter to get out of Southeast Asia.
