# Hayes, Others Plan SES Discussions
## 
### MICHAEL KUHL 
Student concern with the sub
stance of the Study of Education
at Stanford (SES) has led to
simultaneous action on a number
of different fronts.
ASSU President Denis Hayes
announced yesterday the for
mation of a steering committee to
coordinate a two-day
"University-wide Conference on
Educational Objectives" in early
February before the Academic
Senate begins to consider the pro
posals.
The Coalition, in a meeting last
night, decided to prepare a series
of "poop sheets" dealing with the
"substantiative recommendations
and some of the dissenting view
points that have emerged."
Members of the group plan to
wait for the response of the Aca
demic Senate at its special
meeting Thursday, now that
LASSU has voted down that
body's porposal for student par
ticipation, before taking further
action.
Modest Proposals
Hayes is currently attempting
to have a group of students
present to the Academic Senate
their feelings on discussion of SES
reports based on LASSU's
endorsement of the Coalition's
"modest proposal."
John Kramer, a senior in politi
cal science and chairman of the
conference steering committee,
explained that the group hopes
"to create an atmosphere of open
and full communication among all
segments of the Stanford com
munity."
Although the Coalition has
endorsed the planned conference,
some of the members are hesitant
of separating demands for student
involvement in the review of SES
proposals from the question of
student representation on the
Academic Senate.

"My first concern," explained
Coalition member Steve
Cummings, a senior in psy
chology, "is that the Academic
Senate doesn't begin to make
decisions about my education."
Equal Voice
Students will not become com
mitted to offering their own
recommendation on the report,
Cummings added, until they are
empowered with an equal voice in
the deliberation process.
The response of students at
yesterday afternoon's discussion
of SES demonstrated to most
Coalition members that a large
majority of the student body still
hasn't read the first four SES
reports and familiarized itself with
the issues involved.
This afternoon at 4:15 in room
3 34, the geology department
begins consideration of the under
graduate education report as it
effects that department.
Kramer sees the Conference,
scheduled for Monday, February
10 and Tuesday, February 11, as a
chance to separate "temporarily"
the two concerns of the Coalition.
Broad Base
"Student action is going to
have to be founded on a broad
informational base if it is going to
be listened to," he said.
Tuesday's program for the
Conference would center around
eight different areas of proposals
in the undergraduate education
and University housing reports.
Reports of the discussions led
by the various joint student,
faculty, and administration panels
would be presented to the Aca
demic Senate on February 13,
when it begins to consider the
SES proposals.
The conference steering com
mittee is also considering placing
the various proposals on the ballot
to gain a further expression of
student opinion.

Hayes is currently attempting
to have a group of students
present to the Academic Senate
their feelings on discussion of SES
reports based on LASSU's
endorsement of the Coalition's
"modest proposal."
John Kramer, a senior in politi
cal science and chairman of the
conference steering committee,
explained that the group hopes
"to create an atmosphere of open
and full communication among all
segments of the Stanford com
munity."
Although the Coalition has
endorsed the planned conference,
some of the members are hesitant
of separating demands for student
involvement in the review of SES
proposals from the question of
student representation on the
Academic Senate.

"My first concern," explained
Coalition member Steve
Cummings, a senior in psy
chology, "is that the Academic
Senate doesn't begin to make
decisions about my education."
Equal Voice
Students will not become com
mitted to offering their own
recommendation on the report,
Cummings added, until they are
empowered with an equal voice in
the deliberation process.
The response of students at
yesterday afternoon's discussion
of SES demonstrated to most
Coalition members that a large
majority of the student body still
hasn't read the first four SES
reports and familiarized itself with
the issues involved.
This afternoon at 4:15 in room
3 34, the geology department
begins consideration of the under
graduate education report as it
effects that department.
Kramer sees the Conference,
scheduled for Monday, February
10 and Tuesday, February 11, as a
chance to separate "temporarily"
the two concerns of the Coalition.
Broad Base
"Student action is going to
have to be founded on a broad
informational base if it is going to
be listened to," he said.
Tuesday's program for the
Conference would center around
eight different areas of proposals
in the undergraduate education
and University housing reports.
Reports of the discussions led
by the various joint student,
faculty, and administration panels
would be presented to the Aca
demic Senate on February 13,
when it begins to consider the
SES proposals.
The conference steering com
mittee is also considering placing
the various proposals on the ballot
to gain a further expression of
student opinion.
Student concern with the sub
stance of the Study of Education
at Stanford (SES) has led to
simultaneous action on a number
of different fronts.
ASSU President Denis Hayes
announced yesterday the for
mation of a steering committee to
coordinate a two-day
"University-wide Conference on
Educational Objectives" in early
February before the Academic
Senate begins to consider the pro
posals.
The Coalition, in a meeting last
night, decided to prepare a series
of "poop sheets" dealing with the
"substantiative recommendations
and some of the dissenting view
points that have emerged."
Members of the group plan to
wait for the response of the Aca
demic Senate at its special
meeting Thursday, now that
LASSU has voted down that
body's porposal for student par
ticipation, before taking further
action.
