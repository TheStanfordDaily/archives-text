# Panel Discusses SES, University Social Role
## 
### ANN DENTON 
The role of education and its
social relevance came into ques
tion yesterday at an open discus
sion of the reports of the Study of
Education at Stanford (SES) held
in Dinkelspiel Auditorium.
A seven-member panel includ
ing President Kenneth Pitzer and
Students for a Democratic Society
member David Pugh found a
dichotomy of opinion among the
overflow crowd of more than 450,
including a substantial SDS con
tingent.
Other panel members were
Herbert Packer, SES Steering
Committee chairman; Robert
Walker, chairman of Stanford's
general studies committee and
overseas campus program; Norton
Batkin, senior philosophy major
and member of the SES Steering
Committee; Sociology Prof. San
ford Dornbusch, chairman of the
freshman seminar program; and
moderator Denis Hayes, ASSU
president.
The question of whether edu
cation and society are at odds
kept haunting the 90-minute dis
cussion of the SES proposals and
recommendations.
Not Duplicated
Packer said that the University
is an intellectual institution not
duplicated anywhere else in
society in which "the process of
intellectual inquiry is pushed
hard."
Repudiating this statement,
Pugh stated students should "stop
thinking and start feeling."
In Pugh's opinion, SES is try
ing merely to loosen requirements
and therefore is "basically a
bunch of procedural reforms
rather than substantive reforms in
content."
He concluded that "to develop
into a full human being just isn't
being taught in this University."
Walker maintained that the job
of a university is the "advance
ment and communication of
knowledge."

He labeled Pugh's statement as
"nonsense" and "anti-intellec
tual," and went on to say that this
was a form of immaturity to be
expected among students. "I was
an immature student myself,
once," he said, drawing a hostile
reaction from the audience.
Batkin took a moderate posi
tion, saying education means dif
ferent things to different people.
One objective of the study, he
said, was to give students time to
develop themselves, to encourage
their own combination of per
sonal feeling and thought.
Pointing out that in commit-,
tees it is necessary to talk in oper
ational concerns, he said, "The
committee couldn't spend its time
defining what it means to feel or
think."
The Time To Feel
Batkin maintained that the
University leaves students the
time to feel, but it can not tell
them to feel. "I came here to get
an education. The University can't
tell me what to use it for."
In his opening remarks con
cerning recent progress at Stan
ford, Pitzer, who was addressing
the student body for the first
time, stated, "How far we go, and
how fast, depends a great deal . . .
not only on the relatively easy
task of setting new goals or de
mands . . . but also upon student
willingness to work for their
achievement."
Along this line he has asked for
nominations of student members
for search committees "for im
portant university officers, includ
ing specifically those of Dean of
Students and Director of Under
graduate Admissions."
Pitzer spoke of progress in
minority admissions, of his desire
"to minimize classified research,"
and of the need for "thoughtful
student attention" through a
course evaluation in weighing
faculty promotions.

Speaking of educational reform
at Stanford, Pitzer commented,
"to become effective, change
must be based on a broad consen
sus of those most directly af
fected, both faculty and students.
In a university community change
cannot be imposed by fiat."
Concerning the SES recom
mendations, Pitzer stated, "We
need to give greater emphasis to
teaching in the freshman year and
greater recognition to excellence
in teaching at every undergraduate
level."
Packer divided the SES recom
mendations into three points.
The first, "essentially ground
clearing in nature," is to remove
the "highly complex, over pres
criptive" General Studies pro
gram, and secondly to erect on
the "cleared ground" a self
directed learning process.
Independent Work
The process would be marked
by freshmen tutorials and much
more independent work.
The third and "most important
point" is the great necessity for an
administrative officer and com
mittee with the sole purpose of
enhancing undergraduate educa
tion and advocating the academic
interests of undergraduates.
