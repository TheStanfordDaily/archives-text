## Conservationists Hit Hickel 
### 
David Sachs, who has been
deeply involved in condemning
the. proposed appointment of
Alaska's Gov. Walter Hickel, as
Secretary of the Interior yester
day expressed hopelessness over
stopping impending Senate Com
mittee approval of the Interior
secretary-designate.
Sachs, a graduate genetics
student, is president of the Stan
ford Conservation Group and
associate director of the Stanford
Population and Environment
Forum, two campus groups con
cerned with the Hickel appoint
ment.
"We can send all the data and
testimony we want," he said
yesterday, "but unless something
really hot comes up—like the
Fortas business—there's not a
whole lot we can do."
Hickel was approved yesterday
by the Senate Committee on
Interior and Insular Affairs by a
10-3 decision, and the Senate acts
on his appointment today.
The Conservation Group, con

sisting of some 300 students,
faculty, and staff, last week con
demned the Hickel appointment
in a resolution sent to the Senate
Committee.
They charged that Hickel has
"demonstrated clear partiality
toward private commercial
interests at the expense of the
public welfare" and "has demon
strated a la'ck of comprehension
of the breadth of purpose
required in the Interior
Department."
The Population and Environ
ment Forum sent letters to
California Sen. Alan Cranston and
Senate Interior Committee chair
man Henry Jackson of
Washington. Sachs wrote the
letters, which took exception to
Hickel's statement that if water
standards were placed too high
they might hinder industrial
development.
Controversy around Hickel
flared when he stated he was
opposed to conservation "just for
the sake of conservation." This

spurred several conservation
groups throughout the country to
condemn the appointment.
Two Bay Are"a Indian leaders
joined the chorus against Hickel,
•denouncing the governor's stand
against a freeze on the rights to
Alaskan land valuable with oil
deposits. The area is presently
occupied by natives, including
Eskimoes, Aleuts and Indians.
After five days of close
scrutiny over Hickel's private
financial concerns, Interior Com
mittee members said they were
satisfied with plans to eliminate
conflicts of interest.
During committee hearings
Hickel also promised to maintain
national interest over regional. "I
will distinguish," he said,
"between the vastly different re
sponsibilities which rest upon a
governor and that which rests
with the Secretary of the United
States Department of the
Interior."
The Senate quickly approved
the other 11 Nixon cabinet
choices yesterday.
