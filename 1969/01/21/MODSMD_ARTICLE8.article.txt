# Despite Donor
## Napier's Future Secure 
### PHILIP TAUBMAN 
Three months after he arrived at Stanford, Davie
Napier, dean of the chapel, sorrowfully commented,
"I think my honeymoon with Stanford has ended."
On that rainy morning early in 1967, Napier
could not have imagined the prophetic nature of his
remarks. For two subsequent years he has inflamed
passions for and against his style in the pulpit, the
most serious challenge to his position surfacing only
last week in documents stolen from the Trustee
meeting by members of Students for a Democratic
Society (SDS).
The Trustees were due to consider a request by
Lowell Berry, donor of more than $1 million to
support the chapel, that his funds be transferred to
another department of the University. Berry's sup
porting reasons were dissatisfaction with Napier.
The Board had not yet considered the request
when their meeting was disrupted. A student dem
onstrater slipped away from the confusion in the
meeting room with a copy of a letter Berry had sent
the Trustees. In an SDS meeting immediatley fol
lowing the demonstration last Tuesday, the letter
was read aloud.
Approach To Religion
In the letter, Berry wrote that he was extremely
unhappy with Napier's performance. Berry ex
pressed specific regret over Napier's approach to
religion, feeling it is far too liberal and unChristian.
University officials, including President Kenneth
Pitzer, Provost Richard Lyman, and Vice President
for Finance Kenneth Cuthbertson, were planning to
recommend that the Board deny Berry's request.
The recommendation was founded on two argu
ments.
Pitzer, who had delayed consideration of the
matter until he had time to personally evaluate

Napier's work, feels very strongly that Napier is
doing an excellent job. Secondly, the University has
an established policy of not transferring gifts once
they are made. A gift, according to that policy, is
under complete University control once it is
granted.
No Change
Pitzer said last night, "I usually do not comment
on matters before they are considered by the Board,
but in view of information already circulating, I will
state that I will recommend to the Board that no
change be made in funds allocated to the chapel."
According to Cuthbertson, the recommendation
to the Board is a very powerful and positive affirma
tion of Napier's work. Trustees will consider the
Berry letter at their next meeting.
The move by Berry is the latest in a prolonged
attempt to shift his funds. For more than a year,
Berry has been pursuing the problem with Univer
sity administrators who have consistently tried to
dissuade him.
Wally's Work
Former President Wallace Sterling, the man who
hired Napier, spent numerous hours attempting to
persuade Berry that his request could never be
granted simply because of the strict policy on not
shifting gifts at the desire of donors.
Berry temporarily acceeded over the summer, but
evidently was inspired to revive the matter when
Napier sponsored a program with Joan Baez and
Dave Harris in Memorial Church during the fall pre
registration period.
Napier is further heartened by Pitzer, he says,
because the president has agreed to support a re
quest by Napier for a six-month leave of absence
beginning in January 1970. Napier was due for a
year's sabbattical this year had he remained at Yale.
