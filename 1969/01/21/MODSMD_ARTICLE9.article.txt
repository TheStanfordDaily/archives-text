# Editorial: Disappearing Administrators
## 
### 
Administering the groves
of academe is a killing job.
Last week Courtney
Smith, the president of Swar
thmore College, died in his
office. His heart failed on the
fifth day of campus demon
strations and disruption over
institution of a black studies
program. Courtney Smith
was 52 years old.
Last week at Stanford,
two top administrators an
nounced their intentions to
leave the hectic stage of ad
ministration in a major uni
versity. Herbert Packer, vice
provost and chairman of the
Study of Education at Stan
ford (SES), will return to
teaching and writing in the
law school. Joel Smith, asso
ciate provost and dean of stu
dents, is headed to Denison
College to become president,
a job he hopes will not in
clude constant crisis and con
frontation.
Robert Hind, associate
dean of undergraduate educa
tion and staff director of SES,
will leave Stanford this
March to take a job in Bos
ton.
Willard Wyman, associate
dean of students appears to
have joined the list of weary
and worn men looking for
some years of peace after be
ing swirled about in the
storm. Wyman will probably
move to the University of

Cainornia Santa Cruz cam
pus, praying it will be more
sedate than the third floor of
the Old Union.
What about Richard
Lyman, vice-president and
provost? He can be no less
exhausted from the battle.
He is now somewhat insul
ated from the pressures of
past years by President
Pitzer. During the SDS-
Trustee furor last week Pitzer
was under the gun in emer
gency meetings with advisors
while Lyman, undoubtedly
relieved, quietly ate lunch
with Trustees.
Lyman, Packer, and Smith
were appointed by former
President Wallace Sterling
only two years ago. Sterling
was providing Stanford with
leadership for the next de
cade, he thought. He was
wrong, not because he picked
incapable men, but because
he could not predict the at
mosphere in which these men
would work.
Packer and Smith have
not been flawless administra
tors. As lawyers they have
often viewed the campus
through legal glasses and mis
read the scene. Yet both are
intellectually brilliant and
think with piercing clarity.
Packer, in fact, may be one
of the most perceptive and
deeply intellectual people at
Stanford. They are far from
being evil men and any mis
takes made were not moti
vated by deceit or destructive
intention.
Hind and Wyman, though
not in equally powerful pos

it ions, have generated in
tensely sympathetic support
and concern for students.
Wyman is getting more and
more flak from radical stu
dents for his role as name
taken and "sell-out to the
police." He does not deserve
the bitter recriminations.
There are few, if any admin
istrators who have been bet
ter friends of students than
Wyman and Hind.
Rumors have been circu
lating that Pitzer is respon
sible for the sudden deple
tion of administrators. The
timing of his arrival and their
departure is indeed a catalyst
for speculation. The facts,
however, indicate the admin
istrative depletion is purely
coincidental. Packer has long
intended to return to law
school, stating his intention
to be a temporary adminis
trator when he was appoint
ed. Smith and Hind were
contacted about new jobs
well before Pitzer took over,
and Wyman has been negoti
ating with Santa Cruz for
many months.
The gut reality is the hel
lish nature of the job. We are
saddened that good, young
men are leaving Stanford. We
are deeply worried that re
placements of the same qual
ity will be impossible to find.
Who would take the jobs?
