# Poly Sci Students Continue Aim Of Setting Courses
## 
### JENNY MATTHEWS 
In the wake of the political
science department's dispute over
student-initiated courses, many
unsatisfied undergraduates are
looking toward spring quarter to
reassert their demands.
According to David Pugh,
political science student, there
will be no further action taken to
instate new courses led by gradu
ate students this quarter, but "we
will be drawing up courses for
spring with detailed outlines of
the make-up and we'll be trying to
find suitable people to teach them
so that there will be no further
technical excuses to cover up the
real reasons the courses were
dropped—ideological differences.
"We had some good meetings,"
Pugh continued, "but no tight
organization with which to back
up our demands. Winter quarter's
mistakes will serve as a lesson for
spring.
"We made an attempt through
the legitimate channels, but if our
attempts fail in the spring, I can
safely say that the students will
have to take militant action.''

Another undergraduate, Jim
Spickard, explained in an open
letter to the political science
faculty, published in yesterday's
Daily, that "the real issue is one
of power; we challenge the abso
lute authority over academic af
fairs the faculty presently holds.
We as students have a stake in the
courses our department offers . . .
We too have a right to have a say
in those courses."
Spickard voiced this demand in
spite of the department's state
ment published from last week's
faculty meeting affirming the
principle of student participation
in decisions involving student
initiated courses. Four under
graduates at the meeting, one of
them Spickard, presented two
proposals calling for a review com
mittee for these courses.
One of the proposals called for
a committee consisting of three
professors, three undergraduates,
and three graduate students. The
other proposed to establish
membership of four faculty and
four students—two under
graduates and two graduates.

Graduate student Dick Winters,
who helped set up the proposals,
contended that even the establish
ment of the "3-3-3" committee,
which is more advantageous to ex
tending student participation, "in
no way compromises faculty
autonomy."
Spickard as well as Pugh, how
ever, is "skeptical" that the
resolution will be approved, while
Winters believes that there is "no
chance."
According to Spickard, a new
review committee may possibly be
established composed of "so
mething like five professors, two
undergrads, and two grads."
Spickard Complains
"But we have a right to be on
one committee of the de
partment," he complained, "to re
view only the courses we propose.
And a faculty committee is going
to work out the mechanics . . ."
The final decision on the
adoption of this committee,
stated Spickard, could come in
about two or three weeks.
The department's further state
ment that three of the five

student-led courses proposed for
winter quarter are already being
offered by the faculty was also
met with some skepticism.
Courses Offered
These three courses consist of
"Marxism" offered by Prof.
Robert North, "Black Politics,"
offered by Prof. Edward Green
berg, and "U.S. Diplomatic
Problems in the Third World,"
offered by Proi. Martin
Lowenkopf in the spring.
"The explanations, however,"
Spickard challenged, "... that we
really have all we asked for are in
valid; it was only in the wake of
the hatchet job done on the last
proposals that we were able to
work out a course in Marxism
with Prof. North, a fact that re
flects his credit, not the de
partment's, It is still true that
none of the other faculty
members have offered to give up
the time required to do the same,
to answer the stated desires of
many other students."
Other students contend that
they are dissatisfied with the
faculty's approach to political

science. The adoption of graduate
student-led courses has, therefore,
been emphasized by the under
graduates in their proposals.
No Left-winger
"Prof. North is not a Marxist,"
Pugh stated. "The course on U.S.
diplomatic relations is not going
to be taught by a left-winger."
"We're not demanding that all
courses be taught by leftists,"
Pugh explained, "but we don't
feel that the department, being
one of the most conservative on
campus, should hold a monopoly
on the truth.
"The excuse that the courses
are already being offered is trans
parent."
Affiliation Irrelevant
According to graduate student
Dick Winters, who helped present
student proposals, however, if a
teacher is qualified to instruct a
class, "his political affiliation
should be irrelevant."
Winters, on the other hand,
suggested that there exists in the
department an underlying conflict
between the student's concern

manding that all courses be taught
by leftists, but we don't feel that

DICK WINTERS—"The most
fruitful outcome would come
through the efforts of a partner
ship of graduates in both the be
havioral sciences and political
theory. If objective critical in
quiry is the goal, courses should
reflect a union between the
two . .
with political theory and the
faculty's orientation toward the
political behavioral sciences.
"The undergraduates making
curriculum demands," Winters ex
plained, "are basically concerned
with introducing courses of a
theoretical orientation to a de
partment which often emphasizes
the behavioral sciences, in other
words, political behavior."
Faculty Researchers
According to other graduate
students, since the faculty often
stresses the behaviorist approach,
and therefore, researching politi
cal behavior, many of the faculty
are concerned with research rather

than with teaching and with pro
ducing graduate political science
researchers rather than with
offering more general under
graduate classes.
"As a result," stated one
student, "in about the last five
years, there has been a steady de
cline in the department's concern
with undergraduate education."
Another graduate student
noted that undergraduates, es
pecially those who are not
majoring in political science, tend
to want a broad overview of the
field—one that is relevant to their
concern with politics from a
normative approach. Of the 106
students, in fact, who originally

signed petitions for the new,
graduate student-led courses, only
12 were declared political science
majors.
Suggests Integration
"And if you check the list of
TA's that were willing to teach
these courses," Winter added,
"you'll find almost no students
majoring in the behavioral
sciences."
Winters believes, however, that
the most acceptable proposals for
student-led courses should be
based on an integration of the two
approaches.
"The most fruitful outcome,"
suggested Winters about the
future organization of student-led
courses, "would come through the
efforts of a partnership of gradu
ates in both the behavioral
sciences and political theory. If
objective critical inquiry is the
goal" of the dissatisfied under
graduates, their courses should
"reflect a union between the two"
approaches.

up our demands. Winter quarter's
mistakes will serve as a lesson for
spring.
"We made an attempt through
the legitimate channels, but if our
attempts fail in the spring, I can
safely say that the students will
have to take militant action.''

Another undergraduate, Jim
Spickard, explained in an open
letter to the political science
faculty, published in yesterday's
Daily, that "the real issue is one
of power; we challenge the abso
lute authority over academic af
fairs the faculty presently holds.
We as students have a stake in the
courses our department offers . . .
We too have a right to have a say
in those courses."
Spickard voiced this demand in
spite of the department's state
ment published from last week's
faculty meeting affirming the
principle of student participation
in decisions involving student
initiated courses. Four under
graduates at the meeting, one of
them Spickard, presented two
proposals calling for a review com
mittee for these courses.
One of the proposals called for
a committee consisting of three
professors, three undergraduates,
and three graduate students. The
other proposed to establish
membership of four faculty and
four students—two under
graduates and two graduates.

Graduate student Dick Winters,
who helped set up the proposals,
contended that even the establish
ment of the "3-3-3" committee,
which is more advantageous to ex
tending student participation, "in
no way compromises faculty
autonomy."
Spickard as well as Pugh, how
ever, is "skeptical" that the
resolution will be approved, while
Winters believes that there is "no
chance."
According to Spickard, a new
review committee may possibly be
established composed of "so
mething like five professors, two
undergrads, and two grads."
Spickard Complains
"But we have a right to be on
one committee of the de
partment," he complained, "to re
view only the courses we propose.
And a faculty committee is going
to work out the mechanics . . ."
The final decision on the
adoption of this committee,
stated Spickard, could come in
about two or three weeks.
The department's further state
ment that three of the five

student-led courses proposed for
winter quarter are already being
offered by the faculty was also
met with some skepticism.
Courses Offered
These three courses consist of
"Marxism" offered by Prof.
Robert North, "Black Politics,"
offered by Prof. Edward Green
berg, and "U.S. Diplomatic
Problems in the Third World,"
offered by Proi. Martin
Lowenkopf in the spring.
"The explanations, however,"
Spickard challenged, "... that we
really have all we asked for are in
valid; it was only in the wake of
the hatchet job done on the last
proposals that we were able to
work out a course in Marxism
with Prof. North, a fact that re
flects his credit, not the de
partment's, It is still true that
none of the other faculty
members have offered to give up
the time required to do the same,
to answer the stated desires of
many other students."
Other students contend that
they are dissatisfied with the
faculty's approach to political

science. The adoption of graduate
student-led courses has, therefore,
been emphasized by the under
graduates in their proposals.
No Left-winger
"Prof. North is not a Marxist,"
Pugh stated. "The course on U.S.
diplomatic relations is not going
to be taught by a left-winger."
"We're not demanding that all
courses be taught by leftists,"
Pugh explained, "but we don't
feel that the department, being
one of the most conservative on
campus, should hold a monopoly
on the truth.
"The excuse that the courses
are already being offered is trans
parent."
Affiliation Irrelevant
According to graduate student
Dick Winters, who helped present
student proposals, however, if a
teacher is qualified to instruct a
class, "his political affiliation
should be irrelevant."
Winters, on the other hand,
suggested that there exists in the
department an underlying conflict
between the student's concern

DICK WINTERS—"The most
fruitful outcome would come
through the efforts of a partner
ship of graduates in both the be
havioral sciences and political
theory. If objective critical in
quiry is the goal, courses should
reflect a union between the
two . .
with political theory and the
faculty's orientation toward the
political behavioral sciences.
"The undergraduates making
curriculum demands," Winters ex
plained, "are basically concerned
with introducing courses of a
theoretical orientation to a de

the behavioral sciences, in other

Faculty Researchers
According to other graduate
students, since the faculty often

and therefore, researching politi

are concerned with research rather

than with teaching and with pro
ducing graduate political science
researchers rather than with
offering more general under
graduate classes.
"As a result," stated one
student, "in about the last five
years, there has been a steady de
cline in the department's concern
with undergraduate education."
Another graduate student
noted that undergraduates, es
pecially those who are not
majoring in political science, tend
to want a broad overview of the
field—one that is relevant to their
concern with politics from a
normative approach. Of the 106
students, in fact, who originally

signed petitions for the new,
graduate student-led courses, only
12 were declared political science
majors.
Suggests Integration
"And if you check the list of
TA's that were willing to teach
these courses," Winter added,
"you'll find almost no students
majoring in the behavioral
sciences."
Winters believes, however, that
the most acceptable proposals for
student-led courses should be
based on an integration of the two
approaches.
"The most fruitful outcome,"
suggested Winters about the
future organization of student-led
courses, "would come through the

ment published from last week's
faculty meeting affirming the
principle of student participation
in decisions involving student
initiated courses. Four under
graduates at the meeting, one of
them Spickard, presented two
proposals calling for a review com
mittee for these courses.
One of the proposals called for
a committee consisting of three
professors, three undergraduates,
and three graduate students. The
other proposed to establish
membership of four faculty and
four students—two under
graduates and two graduates.

Graduate student Dick Winters,
who helped set up the proposals,
contended that even the establish
ment of the "3-3-3" committee,
which is more advantageous to ex
tending student participation, "in
no way compromises faculty
autonomy."
Spickard as well as Pugh, how
ever, is "skeptical" that the
resolution will be approved, while
Winters believes that there is "no
chance."
According to Spickard, a new
review committee may possibly be
established composed of "so
mething like five professors, two
undergrads, and two grads."
Spickard Complains
"But we have a right to be on
one committee of the de
partment," he complained, "to re
view only the courses we propose.
And a faculty committee is going
to work out the mechanics . . ."
The final decision on the
adoption of this committee,
stated Spickard, could come in
about two or three weeks.
The department's further state
ment that three of the five

student-led courses proposed for
winter quarter are already being
offered by the faculty was also
met with some skepticism.
Courses Offered
These three courses consist of
"Marxism" offered by Prof.
Robert North, "Black Politics,"
offered by Prof. Edward Green
berg, and "U.S. Diplomatic
Problems in the Third World,"
offered by Proi. Martin
Lowenkopf in the spring.
"The explanations, however,"
Spickard challenged, "... that we
really have all we asked for are in
valid; it was only in the wake of
the hatchet job done on the last
proposals that we were able to
work out a course in Marxism
with Prof. North, a fact that re
flects his credit, not the de
partment's, It is still true that
none of the other faculty
members have offered to give up
the time required to do the same,
to answer the stated desires of
many other students."
Other students contend that
they are dissatisfied with the
faculty's approach to political

science. The adoption of graduate
student-led courses has, therefore,
been emphasized by the under
graduates in their proposals.
No Left-winger
"Prof. North is not a Marxist,"
Pugh stated. "The course on U.S.
diplomatic relations is not going
to be taught by a left-winger."
"We're not demanding that all
courses be taught by leftists,"
Pugh explained, "but we don't
feel that the department, being
one of the most conservative on
campus, should hold a monopoly
on the truth.
"The excuse that the courses
are already being offered is trans
parent."
Affiliation Irrelevant
According to graduate student
Dick Winters, who helped present
student proposals, however, if a
teacher is qualified to instruct a
class, "his political affiliation
should be irrelevant."
Winters, on the other hand,
suggested that there exists in the
department an underlying conflict
between the student's concern

manding that all courses be taught

DICK WINTERS—"The most
fruitful outcome would come
through the efforts of a partner
ship of graduates in both the be
havioral sciences and political
theory. If objective critical in
quiry is the goal, courses should
reflect a union between the
two . .
with political theory and the
faculty's orientation toward the
political behavioral sciences.
"The undergraduates making
curriculum demands," Winters ex
plained, "are basically concerned
with introducing courses of a
theoretical orientation to a de
partment which often emphasizes
the behavioral sciences, in other
words, political behavior."
Faculty Researchers
According to other graduate
students, since the faculty often
stresses the behaviorist approach,
and therefore, researching politi
cal behavior, many of the faculty
are concerned with research rather

than with teaching and with pro
ducing graduate political science
researchers rather than with
offering more general under
graduate classes.
"As a result," stated one
student, "in about the last five
years, there has been a steady de
cline in the department's concern
with undergraduate education."
Another graduate student
noted that undergraduates, es
pecially those who are not
majoring in political science, tend
to want a broad overview of the
field—one that is relevant to their
concern with politics from a
normative approach. Of the 106
students, in fact, who originally

signed petitions for the new,
graduate student-led courses, only
12 were declared political science
majors.
Suggests Integration
"And if you check the list of
TA's that were willing to teach
these courses," Winter added,
"you'll find almost no students
majoring in the behavioral
sciences."
Winters believes, however, that
the most acceptable proposals for
student-led courses should be
based on an integration of the two
approaches.
"The most fruitful outcome,"
suggested Winters about the
future organization of student-led
courses, "would come through the

In the wake of the political
science department's dispute over
student-initiated courses, many
unsatisfied undergraduates are
looking toward spring quarter to
reassert their demands.
According to David Pugh,
political science student, there
will be no further action taken to
instate new courses led by gradu
ate students this quarter, but "we
will be drawing up courses for
spring with detailed outlines of
the make-up and we'll be trying to
find suitable people to teach them
so that there will be no further
technical excuses to cover up the
real reasons the courses were
dropped—ideological differences.
"We had some good meetings,"
Pugh continued, "but no tight
organization with which to back
up our demands. Winter quarter's
mistakes will serve as a lesson for
spring.
"We made an attempt through
the legitimate channels, but if our
attempts fail in the spring, I can
safely say that the students will
have to take militant action.''

Another undergraduate, Jim
Spickard, explained in an open

of power; we challenge the abso
lute authority over academic af
fairs the faculty presently holds.

Spickard as well as Pugh, how
ever, is "skeptical" that the
resolution will be approved, while
Winters believes that there is "no
chance."
According to Spickard, a new
review committee may possibly be
established composed of "so
mething like five professors, two
undergrads, and two grads."
Spickard Complains
"But we have a right to be on
one committee of the de
partment," he complained, "to re
view only the courses we propose.
And a faculty committee is going
to work out the mechanics . . ."
The final decision on the
adoption of this committee,
stated Spickard, could come in
about two or three weeks.
The department's further state
ment that three of the five

student-led courses proposed for
winter quarter are already being
offered by the faculty was also
met with some skepticism.
Courses Offered
These three courses consist of
"Marxism" offered by Prof.
Robert North, "Black Politics,"
offered by Prof. Edward Green
berg, and "U.S. Diplomatic
Problems in the Third World,"
offered by Proi. Martin
Lowenkopf in the spring.
"The explanations, however,"
Spickard challenged, "... that we
really have all we asked for are in
valid; it was only in the wake of
the hatchet job done on the last
proposals that we were able to
work out a course in Marxism
with Prof. North, a fact that re
flects his credit, not the de
partment's, It is still true that
none of the other faculty
members have offered to give up
the time required to do the same,
to answer the stated desires of
many other students."
Other students contend that
they are dissatisfied with the
faculty's approach to political

science. The adoption of graduate
student-led courses has, therefore,
been emphasized by the under
graduates in their proposals.
No Left-winger
"Prof. North is not a Marxist,"
Pugh stated. "The course on U.S.
diplomatic relations is not going
to be taught by a left-winger."
"We're not demanding that all
courses be taught by leftists,"
Pugh explained, "but we don't
feel that the department, being
one of the most conservative on
campus, should hold a monopoly
on the truth.
"The excuse that the courses
are already being offered is trans
parent."
Affiliation Irrelevant
According to graduate student
Dick Winters, who helped present
student proposals, however, if a
teacher is qualified to instruct a
class, "his political affiliation
should be irrelevant."
Winters, on the other hand,
suggested that there exists in the
department an underlying conflict
between the student's concern

DICK WINTERS—"The most
fruitful outcome would come
through the efforts of a partner
ship of graduates in both the be
havioral sciences and political
theory. If objective critical in
quiry is the goal, courses should
reflect a union between the
two . .
with political theory and the
faculty's orientation toward the
political behavioral sciences.
"The undergraduates making
curriculum demands," Winters ex
plained, "are basically concerned
with introducing courses of a
theoretical orientation to a de
partment which often emphasizes
the behavioral sciences, in other
words, political behavior."
Faculty Researchers
According to other graduate
students, since the faculty often
stresses the behaviorist approach,
and therefore, researching politi
cal behavior, many of the faculty
are concerned with research rather

than with teaching and with pro
ducing graduate political science
researchers rather than with
offering more general under
graduate classes.
"As a result," stated one
student, "in about the last five
years, there has been a steady de
cline in the department's concern
with undergraduate education."
Another graduate student
noted that undergraduates, es
pecially those who are not
majoring in political science, tend
to want a broad overview of the
field—one that is relevant to their
concern with politics from a
normative approach. Of the 106
students, in fact, who originally

signed petitions for the new,
graduate student-led courses, only
12 were declared political science
majors.
Suggests Integration
"And if you check the list of
TA's that were willing to teach
these courses," Winter added,
"you'll find almost no students
majoring in the behavioral
sciences."
Winters believes, however, that
the most acceptable proposals for
student-led courses should be
based on an integration of the two
approaches.
"The most fruitful outcome,"
suggested Winters about the
future organization of student-led
courses, "would come through the
efforts of a partnership of gradu
ates in both the behavioral
sciences and political theory. If
objective critical inquiry is the
goal" of the dissatisfied under
graduates, their courses should
"reflect a union between the two"
approaches.

In the wake of the political
science department's dispute over
student-initiated courses, many
unsatisfied undergraduates are
looking toward spring quarter to
reassert their demands.
According to David Pugh,
political science student, there
will be no further action taken to
instate new courses led by gradu
ate students this quarter, but "we
will be drawing up courses for
spring with detailed outlines of
the make-up and we'll be trying to
find suitable people to teach them
so that there will be no further
technical excuses to cover up the
real reasons the courses were
dropped—ideological differences.
"We had some good meetings,"
Pugh continued, "but no tight
organization with which to back
up our demands. Winter quarter's
mistakes will serve as a lesson for
spring.
"We made an attempt through
the legitimate channels, but if our
attempts fail in the spring, I can
safely say that the students will
have to take militant action.''

Another undergraduate, Jim
Spickard, explained in an open
letter to the political science
faculty, published in yesterday's
Daily, that "the real issue is one
of power; we challenge the abso
lute authority over academic af
fairs the faculty presently holds.
We as students have a stake in the
courses our department offers . . .
We too have a right to have a say
in those courses."
Spickard voiced this demand in
spite of the department's state
ment published from last week's
faculty meeting affirming the
principle of student participation
in decisions involving student
initiated courses. Four under
graduates at the meeting, one of
them Spickard, presented two
proposals calling for a review com
mittee for these courses.
One of the proposals called for
a committee consisting of three
professors, three undergraduates,
and three graduate students. The
other proposed to establish
membership of four faculty and
four students—two under
graduates and two graduates.

Graduate student Dick Winters,
who helped set up the proposals,
contended that even the establish
ment of the "3-3-3" committee,
which is more advantageous to ex
tending student participation, "in
no way compromises faculty
autonomy."
Spickard as well as Pugh, how
ever, is "skeptical" that the
resolution will be approved, while
Winters believes that there is "no
chance."
According to Spickard, a new
review committee may possibly be
