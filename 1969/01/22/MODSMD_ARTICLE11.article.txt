# Vocations For Social Change
## Jobs Offer Impact On Society 
### BROOKE SHEARER 
There is an alternative to the
rat-race, and George Brosi is
talking about it here today.
; No longer are the choices only
business, graduate school, the
army, and marriage. Consider if
you will, Vocations for Social
Change (VSC), a new "placement
agency" which lists openings and
persons and positions which have
a direct relation to institutional
change and some provision for
si(pport.
"Vocations for Social Change
is much more than a vital publi
cation that lists jobs outside the
rat-race," claims Brosi, agency
director and this week's
Freshman-guest-in-residence at
Wilbur.
- "VSC is just one outgrowth of
a more general ferment in our
society—a dissatisfaction with the
vocational role expectations that

we have inherited and a search for
alternative life styles . . .We are
trying to convince people that
they can have an impact on
changing society while earning a
living and doing work that fits
their particular skills and tempera
ments."
New Goals
Fortune magazine documents
George's beliefs. In their January
poll of college students they
found that indeed the majority of
present day students to attend
college in order to secure a job
with high pay and high salary. But
there is another two-fifths who
are disturbingly unclassifiable.
Fortune calls them the "fore
runners," assuming that their
ranks will grow.
They are the students who are
not using education as a means to
an end. They do not concern
themselves with "careerist values"
of money and rank but with style

of living and working which con
forms to their ideas of social
integrity.
In March of last year 26 year
old Brosi set about to attempt to
answer that question. He and a
staff of three (now expanded to
nine) went to work in Hay ward,
California. With an initial capital
of $147 they set up headquarters
at 2010 "B" Street (AC
415/518-4015) and began issuing
a monthly directory of job
openings.
The directory includes essays
on social change, tips on sub
sistence living, notices of nation
wide community reform, as well
as an application form for jobs.
This month's listings range from a
position for a teacher at The
Boston School for Human Re
sources to a request for a full-time
promotion-distributor for the
American Documentary Film
Corporation of San Francisco.
Independence Sought
VSC lists only positions for
employment within liberal, inde
pendent organizations. They do
not list openings with Shell Oil or
the Federal Government, but
cater to where they believe there
is an information lag.
Brosi explains in a grinning,
Tennessee drawl that "we need to
help people understand how
ordinary work roles can reinforce
systems of exploitation and
oppression . . .What we desire is a
shift in allocation of manpower
that could insure us of a future
determined by people in quest of
humane and democratic forms of
cooperation, rather than manipu
lation by a few 'experts'. De
veloping technology makes either
course possible. Only individual
human beings can decide."
A graduate of Carleton College,

Brosi has worked within
Appalachia, with CORE, with
SDS's Economic Research and
Action Project and with the
American Friends Service Com
mittee. He traveled as part of the
American peace movement to
Bratislava, Czechoslovakia and
there met with the Democratic
Republic of North Vietnam and
the National Liberation Front of
South Vietnam.
Brosi will hold an open
meeting in the Wilbur guest
cottage at 4:15 today. Prior to
that, he plans to lunch in Paloma,
and following the meetinp to dine
in Florence Monro

employment within liberal, inde

Brosi explains in a grinning,
Tennessee drawl that "we need to
help people understand how
ordinary work roles can reinforce
systems of exploitation and
oppression . . .What we desire is a
shift in allocation of manpower
that could insure us of a future
determined by people in quest of
humane and democratic forms of
cooperation, rather than manipu
lation by a few 'experts'. De
veloping technology makes either
course possible. Only individual
human beings can decide."
A graduate of Carleton College,

Brosi has worked within
Appalachia, with CORE, with
SDS's Economic Research and

there met with the Democratic

There is an alternative to the

talking about it here today.
; No longer are the choices only
business, graduate school, the
army, and marriage. Consider if
you will, Vocations for Social
Change (VSC), a new "placement
agency" which lists openings and
persons and positions which have
a direct relation to institutional
change and some provision for
si(pport.
"Vocations for Social Change
is much more than a vital publi
cation that lists jobs outside the
rat-race," claims Brosi, agency
director and this week's
Freshman-guest-in-residence at
Wilbur.
- "VSC is just one outgrowth of
a more general ferment in our
society—a dissatisfaction with the
vocational role expectations that

we have inherited and a search for
alternative life styles . . .We are
trying to convince people that
they can have an impact on
changing society while earning a
living and doing work that fits
their particular skills and tempera
ments."
