# Applications Solicited
## 
### 
The ASSU is actively soliciting
applications from students who
would be interested in serving on
a 53-member ASSU Education
Council. This Council will act as
the agent of the Associated Stu
dents in all matters relating to the
Study of Education at Stanford
(SES).
It is hoped that the applicants
will represent all facets of the
wide spectrum of academic dis
ciplines, academic levels, and phil
osophical persuasic-s of the Stan
ford community.
Once selected, members of the
Council will be responsible for a
working knowledge of the SES
proposals, will conduct research
into the various ramifications of
the SES reports, and will present
information to the student body.
Those interested may obtain
applications in the ASSU office
on the second floor of Tresidder.
