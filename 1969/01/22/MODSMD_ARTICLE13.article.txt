## 
### 
The Stanford Community
Coffee House will be closed
tonight. The closing is to avoid a
threatened disruption of normal
activities by a new campus organi
zation, The Protestors, Trouble
makers, and Anarchists (PTA).
The PTA yesterday circulated a
flyer announcing that there would
be free food, drink, and entertain
ment at the coffee house. Coffee

stated last night that no such
plans had been cleared with him.
Elmore and associates claim
the PTA is organized by Mark
Heller and Jim Sayre, former
students. Elmore said that Sayre
has continually printed ob
scenities on coffee house black
boards.
