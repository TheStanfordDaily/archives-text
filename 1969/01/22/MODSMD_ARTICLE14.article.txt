# An SDS View
## Student Capitalism 
### LEONARD SIEGEL 
The arrival of the Nixon ad
ministration probably won't bring
many changes in the intent of
U.S. policy, but there will be a
fundamental change of approach.
President Nixon will probably rely
more on the private sector for the
solution of social and internation
al problems.
His program to contract a con
sortium of private corporations to
assume the Vietnam War typifies
this approach in foreign policy,
and his "Student Capitalism" is
expected to replace direct govern
ment programs dealing with one
of America's growing domestic
problems. And important men
within the new administration are
developing a new plan to encour
age support for the War.
The Vietnam War has often de
cried as wasteful—even by its sup
porters. The morale of America's
fighting men is abysmally low.
Corporations
Consequently, Mr. Nixon in
tends to replace the inefficient
military-bureaucracy by enlisting
the participation of several pres
tigious corporations. Tax incen
tives will be granted to the corpor
ations, and "development fran
chise rights" will be granted to
corporations that do a good job in
fighting the Viet Cong. In addi
tion, Mr. Nixon is asking these pri
vate corporations to replace the
inequitable, antiquated "selective
service system" with a more
sophisticated program of "man
power development."
This policy must be opposed,
but because it won't work—and it
won't—but because it is funda
mentally wrong. The war is hurt
ing Vietnam and the Vietnamese.
Efficiency might make things even
worse.
Campus Disorder
"Student Capitalism" has been
a catch-phrase by those in the new
administration who are especially
concerned with campus disorder.
The theory behind "Student Capi
talism" postulates that by integra
ting responsible student leaders
into the corporate elite, the cor
porate leadership can not only
create a vision of upward mobil
ity, but can refer to the involve
ment of such student leaders
when students say they have no
voice in decisions affecting their
lives. Clearly the government
alone cannot provide the financial
backing necessary to create and
maintain such a program, so Mr.
Nixon is calling on several groups
within the leadership of business
to provide capital for the develop
ment of student-run firms, and to
arrange to integrate student pro

duction into the supply systems
of existing corporations.
Viewing the historical role of
the universities as liberal arts insti
tutions dedicated to creating an
atmosphere of free thought and a
dedication to the collection of
knowledge, it is difficult to see
how such a program could work.
Perhaps the best known specif
ic program for encouraging Stu
dent support of the Vietnam War
is being pushed by Assistant Sec
retary of Defense David Packard,
formerly an electronics engineer.
Mr. Packard's plan is to make stu
dents realize that their interests lie
in the continuation of the War, as
well as other Defense Department
endeavors. He plans to do this by
stipulating that defense contrac
tors hire or offer fellowships to
students in exchange for comfort
able contracting policies.
War Production
Not only does this go well with
the plan for Student Capitalism,
but it gives students solid interest
in the maintenance of War Pro
duction. According to Mr.
Packard, many young men oppose
the war merely because they don't
see it serving their personal inter
ests. Many cynics in high places
doubt the feasibility of the
Packard proposal, noting the
plethora of anti-war sentiment on
the campuses.
Mr. Packard, however, notes
the success of a pilot program on
the Campus of Stanford Univer
sity, where he has been a Trustee.
The Packard proposal and "stu
dent capitalism" are easy to see
through. By expending limited
resources, the ruling class intends
to sway the consciousness of
collegiate youth. In place of
human development and partic
ipatory decision-making, Mr.
Nixon's men hope to use crass
financial incentives in maintaining
an intolerable status.
We see then, that instead of
attacking the interests of the cor
porate elite responsible for the
War and the prostitution of the
campuses, Mr. Nixon will use his
power to reinforce the domina
tion of the corporations over our
lives and the lives of people
around the world. And at a profit.
