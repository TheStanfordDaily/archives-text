• Marijuana Bust
Editor, THE DAILY:
Recently I was busted in the
Meyer Library for possession of
marijuana. Since that moment
when I assured the deputy sheriff
that I would be very calm and
that he needn't pull his gun on
me, I learned something of our
local justice.
The Santa Clara's D.A.'s office
has told my lawyer that they're
going to try to pin a felony on me
as a kind of announcement of
their new "hard line" policy
against marijuana users at Stan
ford. Unfortunately they have a
good chance of convicting me in
the conservative Santa Jlara
courts. A felony conviction is very
hard to live with in our society.
The D.A.'s office has also let me
know that if I help the Santa
Clara sheriff's department arrest
my supposed source, all charges
against me will be dropped. I'm
beginning to realize that I'm just a
pawn in their game.
It seems now that a good many
Stanford students are on their
own as to how they're going to
protect themselves from this par
ticular insanity of our society.
Speaking from experience it's es
sential to have a lawyer who can
maneuver in the legal and personal
maze of this "justice." If you
can't afford a lawyer, your case is
decided upon by a hostile group
of country lawmen.
I think it would be very wise
for the Stanford student body to
hire a lawyer on retainer to handle
all possession busts on campus.

I'm sure there must be some
sympathetic Stanford grad who
would accept this job for a
nominal fee. The Santa Clara nar
cotics cowboys are on campus
now so please be careful.

• Didn 7 Call Cops
Editor, THE DAILY:
In his letter to the Daily on
January 17, Marc Sapir
erroneously stated that Associate
Dean of Students Willard Wyman
called the police to the campus in
the case of the student arrested in
the undergraduate library on a
charge of possessing marijuana.
As reported correctly in the
Daily story of Jan. 14, an assistant
director of libraries reported the
incident to an assistant business
manager of the University, who
called the Stanford chief of
police. He in turn notified the
Santa Clara County Sheriff's
office. Mr. Wyman did not call the
police, and in fact assisted the
student in securing legal counsel.

• Analysis Whitewash
Editor, THE DAILY:
Like your former news editor,
I was distressed by The Daily's
coverage of last Tuesday's
incidents at the Board of Trustees
meeting in the Faculty Club.
Neither the sins of omission in
Wednesday's story nor the
inflammatory tone of that day's

editorial were quite enough to get
me to my typewriter, but Philip
Taubman's "news analysis" on
Friday has finally done it.
It is one thing to underplay the
evont, as in the first news story, or
to forgive to excess, as in the
editorial. It is quite another thing
to distort facts, as Taubman did in
saying that the violations on
Tuesday ran from "ringing a false
fire alarm and forcing a door to
sympathetically but non-actively
being in the area." Most would
agree that the second clause
adequately describes the
non-violent end of the spectrum.
But my own observations in the
hallway behind the dining room
put the other end at an entirely
different level of seriousness.
Since I saw Taubman in the same
area repeatedly during the
proceedings, I assume he must
have seen many of the same
events; if he did, the kindest thing
that can be said of his statement is
that it is disingenuous.
In any scale of "levels of
offense" that I can think of, the
things that actually took place on
Tuesday are more serious
transgressions than the
boyish-sounding misdemeanors

Taubman mentions. Few people
in this community saw what
happened inside that building.
Since The Daily is apparently
unwilling to enlighten them in its
news pages, let me make it clear
that in the portions of the fracas
that I directly observed, faculty
members and administrators were
grappled with and knocked down;
others had papers taken forcibly
from them; still others were
repeatedly threatened with
violence.
It is perfectly true that by
comparison with events seen
recently on other campuses this
demonstration was not a very

violent one. There is room for a
range of views about the
justification of the tactics used,
the grievances that led to the
demonstration, and the action to
be taken against the
demonstrators. For this reason I
can accept, however, uneasily,
views such as you expressed in
Wednesday's editorial. There is,
however, no excuse at all for
applying whitewash to the
incident itself by rearranging the
facts, and The Daily fails all of us
when it does so.
