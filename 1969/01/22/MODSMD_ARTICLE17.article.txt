## Wrestlers Dumped Twice 
### 
The Stanford wrestling team
didn't have enough wrestlers or
enough debaters last week, losfrig
to San Jose State 28-21 on Wed
nesday, and to Washington State
29-13 on Friday.
Coach Dave Reid also came out
on the short end of a couple of
verbal hassles with referees.
Stanford had to forfeit 15
points in each match because they
had had no one in the 123, 130,
or 191 pound weight classes.
MISSED BY A HAIR
Against San Jose the 191
pound forfeit was unforeseen.
With San Jose ahead by only
23-18, two decisions would have
swung the match to the Indians,
24-23.
However, Ben Shaver was dis

qualified for not having shaved.
He tried to shave in the allotted
three minutes, but failed. Coach
Reid argued that he should be al
lowed to wrestle anyway, but the
referee refused. Ben wrestled an
exhibition instead and hurt his
back so he couldn't wrestle Fri
day.
The other controversy involved
riding time on Friday night. Soph
omore Dave Thomas was first
awarded a 4-4 draw, but the ref
eree, after a fifteen minute discus
sion with both coaches, overruled
the timer and Thomas came out a
one point loser.
BORCHERS STARS
Life wasn't so tough for Senior
captain Len Borchers, who was
third in the 1968 Olympic trials in

the 160 class. He pinned his San
Jose opponent in the second
round and trounced a desperately
stalling WSU grappler 10-0.
Sophomore heavyweight Hal
Hothan was impressive, bulldog
ging two behemoths for 5-0 and
8-2 wins.
Dave Thomas and Senior Bert
Ambler eked out 8-6 and 12-11
wins on Wednesday, then lost on
Friday 4-5 and 5-12. Sophomore
Craig Bernhard held on for a draw
against San Jose, but lost against
Washington State.
Bill Ross fought two hard
nosed fights at 177 pounds. He
lost to a good San Jose man 7-3,
but came back to tie Rupert Lees
of WSU when Lees was penalized
for stalling.
