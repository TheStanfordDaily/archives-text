# Teaching Program
## Black Panel Cut 
### LANG ATWOOD 
A dispute over the appearance
of a panel of black educators in a
teachers leadership training pro
gram at Stanford last week caused
a temporary setback in the
group's plans.
The Experienced Teaching Fel
lowship Program, one of 79 across
the country, allows 25 teachers to
develop a specialization in one
curriculum area and prepare to
assume supervisory and leadership
positions upon returning to their
districts.
The controversy arose when a
panel of black educators, includ
ing Dr. Nathan Hare, black studies
coordinator at San Francisco
State, invited by the student steer
ing committee, was canceled by
Dr. Fannie Shaftel, the director of
the program.
Shaftel stated she canceled the
presentation because faculty and
administrators had not had time
to review the steering committee's
plans and because she felt that
Hare's presence on campus at this
time might lead to an "explosive
situation." She stressed, however,
that she planned to invite Hare to

appear before the group in a full
two hour session at a later date.
Substitute Speaks
In place of the panel, Marie
Johnson, a former member of the
program who withdrew to accept
a position teaching black arts at
the California College of Arts and
Crafts in Oakland, spoke on the
situation of the blacks in our edu
cational system and presented a
slide and tape portrait of the
young black, particularly the art
ist.
Johnson stated that young
black people were fighting for
their very exsistence as men and
presented a strong indictment of
present school systems for "cas
trating" them. She compared pres
ent efforts to improve education
with those of the "no-where man"
in the Beatles movie, "Yellow
Submarine" and said, "We as edu
cators have allowed ourselves to
be controlled by no-where peo
ple."
To the teachers in the program,
she suggested first that they get to
know themselves. Reading about
the minorities and their struggles

is also essential, she stated. John
son stressed the need to find out
what attitudes are prolonged in
their respective school systems
and discuss the need for changes
with their school boards and ad
ministrations.
Solution or Problem?
Johnson concluded by quoting
a VISTA slogan which says, "If
you're not part of the solution,
you're part of the problem."
This is the third and last year
of the program at Stanford which
offers specialized training in sci
ence, mathematics, social sciences,
art and reading. Each area is spon
sored by a professor who works
with about five fellows. In addi
tion there is a weekly meeting of
the entire group to hear lectures
or hold discussions.
Over 300 teachers applied for
the program which is entirely fi
nanced by the federal government
through the Higher Education Act
of 1965. Stanford receives $3000
per fellow; two-thirds of this is
used to cover the cost of tuition,
the remainder is spent on guest
speakers, field trips and course
materials.
Plans Discussed
The program will not be of
fered next year because a Guid
ance and Counciling grant has
been approved under the same act
and under government policy no
university may have more than
one grant under the same title of
an act.
The steering committee met
yesterday afternoon along with
faculty members and administra
tors to plan the curriculum for the
remainder of the year. Among
plans discussed in an atmosphere
of friendly cooperation were a
weekend seminar in the Ortega
Park teacher's retreat, attending
Mexican-American Theater and
discussing innovations in second
ary school education.

an act.
The steering committee met
yesterday afternoon along with
faculty members and administra
tors to plan the curriculum for the
remainder of the year. Among
plans discussed in an atmosphere
of friendly cooperation were a
weekend seminar in the Ortega
Park teacher's retreat, attending
Mexican-American Theater and
discussing innovations in second
ary school education.
A dispute over the appearance
of a panel of black educators in a
teachers leadership training pro
gram at Stanford last week caused
a temporary setback in the
group's plans.
The Experienced Teaching Fel
lowship Program, one of 79 across
the country, allows 25 teachers to
develop a specialization in one
curriculum area and prepare to
assume supervisory and leadership
positions upon returning to their
districts.
The controversy arose when a
panel of black educators, includ
ing Dr. Nathan Hare, black studies
coordinator at San Francisco
State, invited by the student steer
ing committee, was canceled by
Dr. Fannie Shaftel, the director of
the program.
Shaftel stated she canceled the
presentation because faculty and
administrators had not had time
to review the steering committee's
plans and because she felt that
Hare's presence on campus at this
time might lead to an "explosive
situation." She stressed, however,
that she planned to invite Hare to

appear before the group in a full
two hour session at a later date.
Substitute Speaks
In place of the panel, Marie
Johnson, a former member of the
program who withdrew to accept
a position teaching black arts at
the California College of Arts and
Crafts in Oakland, spoke on the
situation of the blacks in our edu
cational system and presented a
slide and tape portrait of the
young black, particularly the art
ist.
Johnson stated that young
black people were fighting for
their very exsistence as men and
presented a strong indictment of
present school systems for "cas
trating" them. She compared pres
ent efforts to improve education
with those of the "no-where man"
in the Beatles movie, "Yellow
Submarine" and said, "We as edu
cators have allowed ourselves to
be controlled by no-where peo
ple."
To the teachers in the program,
she suggested first that they get to
know themselves. Reading about
the minorities and their struggles

is also essential, she stated. John
son stressed the need to find out
what attitudes are prolonged in
their respective school systems
and discuss the need for changes
with their school boards and ad
ministrations.
Solution or Problem?
Johnson concluded by quoting
a VISTA slogan which says, "If
you're not part of the solution,
you're part of the problem."
This is the third and last year
of the program at Stanford which
offers specialized training in sci
ence, mathematics, social sciences,
art and reading. Each area is spon
sored by a professor who works
with about five fellows. In addi
tion there is a weekly meeting of
the entire group to hear lectures
or hold discussions.
Over 300 teachers applied for
the program which is entirely fi
nanced by the federal government
through the Higher Education Act
of 1965. Stanford receives $3000
per fellow; two-thirds of this is
used to cover the cost of tuition,
the remainder is spent on guest
speakers, field trips and course
materials.
Plans Discussed
The program will not be of
fered next year because a Guid
ance and Counciling grant has
been approved under the same act
and under government policy no
university may have more than
one grant under the same title of
an act.
