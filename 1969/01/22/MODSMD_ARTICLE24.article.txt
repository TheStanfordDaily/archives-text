# Vet's Club Meets Today
## 
### 
The formation of a Veteran's
Club on the Stanford campus will
be the subject of a meeting this
afternoon at 12:30 in room 270'
in Tresidder Union.
The club which according to
spokesmen Jerrould Offstein will
have no political orientation has
drawn 20 members in an unpubli
cized get together last week.
The Stanford campus has near
ly 400 veterans and in addition
many more women who have
served in the armed forces.
According to Offstein the club
basically is being formed "as an
excuse to get out from under our
books."
The main purpose of the organ
ization is to socialize although
says Offstein "we do not preclude
anything."
Thus far such activities as a tu
torial program in association with
the County Education Office in
Santa Clara County are being con
templated.
