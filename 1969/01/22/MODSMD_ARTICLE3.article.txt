# Bustee Charges Legal Coercion

### CRAIG WILSON 
The Stanford student who was
arrested in the Undergraduate
Library for possession of mari
juana has charged that the Santa
Clara District Attorney's office is
trying him on felony charges "as a
kind of announcement of their
new hardline policy against mari
juana users at Stanford."
The charge has been leveled by
undergraduate John Lanthier in a
letter which appears in today's
Daily.
Lanthier, a sophomore was

arrested last Monday by Santa
Clara county sheriff's deputies as
he allegedly tried to pick up a
briefcase full of marijuana from
his desk locker in Meyer Library.
He was arrained last Thursday
and charged with felony pos
sesion of marijuana and pos
session of dangerous drugs.
Lanthier, an undergraduate in
anthropology, goes on to say,
"The D.A.'s office has also let me
know that if I help the Santa
Clara Sheriff's department arrest
my supposed source all charges
against me will be dropped.
Say's Lanthier, "I'm beginning
to realize that I'm just a pawn in
their game."
District Attorney Louis Bergna
said last night he didn't "know
anything about any new policy"
and that he's never heard of the
man.
"The Santa Clara district at
torney's office handles over 3500
cases a year with over 160 people
handling them."
Lanthier's lawyer couldn't be
reached for comment but Bergna
said that "if his lawyer will tell
you that anyone in my office said
any such thing I would be very
interested in hearing it."
Lanthier has changed his
lawyer since his arrest, switching
from attorney William Keough of
Palo Alto to San Francisco lawyer
Rudy Hoffman.
When questioned about
Lanthier's change, Keough had no
comment.
In reference to the charges
Bergna went on to say "half the
time some kids says some such
thing quoting something a lawyer
has told him," that is completely
untrue.
Lanthier spoke before the
student legislature last Thursday
calling for the establishment of a
bail bond system from which
Stanford students could draw.
He also asked that a lawyer be
hired by the Stanford student
body "on retainner that could
handle all possession busts on
campus."
Said Lanthier, "I'm sure there
must be some sympathetic Stan
ford grad who would accept this
chore for a nominal fee. The
Santa Clara narcotics cowboys are
on campus now so please be
careful."
