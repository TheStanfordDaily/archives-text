# Strike Threat At Berkeley
## 
### 
Third World Liberation Front
students are prepared to strike at
UC's Berkeley campus today
despite threats from Chancellor
Roger Heyns to keep the campus
open by "any means necessary."
The strike was called by the
Front, which claims to represent
blacks, Asians, Chicanos, and
American Indians, to reinforce its
demands for the establishment of
a Third World College.
The Front plans to organize in
formational picket lines at various
locations on campus and also to
send speakers to classes to discuss
the demands with students.
Heyns claimed that there has
been "substantive effort" in
meeting the Front's demands. "I
would not hesitate to call in
police as in the past," Heyns said,
"to keep the university
functioning as an educational
institution."
The Front is demanding the
Third World College include
ethnic departments for each of
the minorities it represents and
that the faculty be made up of the
various minorities. The students
are also asking for control of all
programs that involve Third World
students.
In addition to the Front's
strike, the Berkeley chapter of the
American Federation of Teachers
is planning a one-day work
stoppage in support of San Jose
State College members who have
been threatened with losing their
jobs for striking.
