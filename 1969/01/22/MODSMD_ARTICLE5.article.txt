## Youth Fare Threatened 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP)-A Civil
Aeronautics Board hearing ex
aminer recommended Tuesday
that the board cancel the cut-price
youth fares offered by 24 U.S. air
lines. He called the special fares
unjustly discriminatory.
Such plans are available only to
persons between the ages 12 and
21, and it is this focus on a par
ticular age group that drew the
attention and criticism of hearing
examiner Arthur S. Present in the
lengthy initial decision he sub
mitted to the board.
"Although youth fares are
available to everyone in the
specified age group," Present said,
"this attribute does not excuse
the discrimination unless age is a
proper foundation for the dis
crimination."
And that argument, he said,
was rejected last year by the U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals.
"The Court has made it plain
that the rule of equality is para
mount," Present said.
• Pueblo Hearing
CORONADO, CALIF. (AP)-
The skipper of the USS Pueblo
denied Tuesday before a Navy
court of inquiry each of 17 Com
munist charges that his ship vio
lated North Korean waters.
Cmdr. Lloyd M. Bucher also
said the Pueblo was nearly
rammed by a North Korean
fishing boat—"he swerved away at
the last possible minute"—the day
before the intelligence ship was
captured off the North Korean
coast last January.
His denials of intrusion came as
he testified to extreme difficulties
in trying to radio superiors in
Japan that his presence offshore
had been detected.
"During the period of
capture," Bucher said, "one of the
first things was that the antenna
for voice communication was shot
away."

"Did such an intrusion occur?"
demanded Capt. William New
some, counsel representing the
Navy at the five-admiral court as
he read each of the 17 North
Korean allegations of violation.
"The closest we came was
about 13.1 miles or 13 miles at
some points along the coast, I
don't remember where," Bucher
said.
• Strikes in Sicily
ROME (AP)—Fresh labor and
student violence rippled through
Italy and the islands of Sicily and
Sardinia Tuesday. Thousands
walked off their jobs to join ag
gressive street demonstrations.
The strikes virtually paralyzed
Sardinia's business life, stopped
Rome's and part of Naples' transit
system and halted work through
out most of Sicily and in the port
city of Trieste.
It was the bloodiest and most
effective wave of strikes so far this
year.
•AFT May Strike
SACRAMENTO (AP)-A
leader of the American Federation
of Teachers state colleges' union
said Tuesday there may be a five
day walkout of faculty members
on all campuses in California un
less trustees negotiate union de
mands at San Francisco State.
But Hutchinson, executive
secretary of the union in the
19-campus system, said another
possibility is that the faculty
might refuse to begin teaching in
the spring semester. "The
problems are not going to be re
solved until trustees do negotiate
with us," Hutchinson told news
men.
Hutchinson didn't say when
the possible five-day walkout
might be or whether it might be
an extension of the AFT's
planned one-day strike Wednesday
on 14 of the 19 college campuses.

•Suspects Surrender
LOS ANGELES (AP)-Two
brothers who turned themselves in
to police were booked Tuesday on
suspicion of murder in the
shooting deaths of two Black
Panthers at UCLA.
The district attorney's office
was considering a county grand
jury investigation of evidence
against Larry Joseph Stiner, 21,
who surrendered Tuesday, and his
brother, George Phillip Stiner, 22,
who surrendered Monday.
The younger Stiner had a gun
shot wound in his shoulder when

he surrendered to police. The
wound appeared several days old,
police said.
Stiner refused to discuss the
wound with police. "All he gave
us," said an officer, "was name,
rank and serial number."

• Strikes in Sicily
ROME (AP)—Fresh labor and
student violence rippled through
Italy and the islands of Sicily and
Sardinia Tuesday. Thousands
walked off their jobs to join ag
gressive street demonstrations.
The strikes virtually paralyzed
Sardinia's business life, stopped
Rome's and part of Naples' transit
system and halted work through
out most of Sicily and in the port
city of Trieste.
It was the bloodiest and most
effective wave of strikes so far this
year.
•AFT May Strike
SACRAMENTO (AP)-A
leader of the American Federation
of Teachers state colleges' union
said Tuesday there may be a five
day walkout of faculty members
on all campuses in California un
less trustees negotiate union de

But Hutchinson, executive
secretary of the union in the
19-campus system, said another
possibility is that the faculty
might refuse to begin teaching in
the spring semester. "The
problems are not going to be re
solved until trustees do negotiate
with us," Hutchinson told news
men.
Hutchinson didn't say when
the possible five-day walkout
might be or whether it might be
an extension of the AFT's
planned one-day strike Wednesday
on 14 of the 19 college campuses.

•Suspects Surrender
LOS ANGELES (AP)-Two
brothers who turned themselves in
to police were booked Tuesday on
suspicion of murder in the
shooting deaths of two Black

The district attorney's office
was considering a county grand
jury investigation of evidence
against Larry Joseph Stiner, 21,
who surrendered Tuesday, and his
brother, George Phillip Stiner, 22,
who surrendered Monday.
The younger Stiner had a gun
shot wound in his shoulder when

he surrendered to police. The
wound appeared several days old,
police said.
Stiner refused to discuss the
wound with police. "All he gave
us," said an officer, "was name,
rank and serial number."

WASHINGTON (AP)-A Civil
Aeronautics Board hearing ex
aminer recommended Tuesday
that the board cancel the cut-price
youth fares offered by 24 U.S. air
lines. He called the special fares
unjustly discriminatory.
Such plans are available only to
persons between the ages 12 and
21, and it is this focus on a par
ticular age group that drew the
attention and criticism of hearing
examiner Arthur S. Present in the
lengthy initial decision he sub
mitted to the board.
"Although youth fares are
available to everyone in the
specified age group," Present said,
"this attribute does not excuse
the discrimination unless age is a
proper foundation for the dis
crimination."
And that argument, he said,
was rejected last year by the U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals.
"The Court has made it plain
that the rule of equality is para
