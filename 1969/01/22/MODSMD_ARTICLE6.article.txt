An investigation regarding the
confrontation between the Board

student judicial aides in an
attempt to encompass all circum
stances of the occurence.
Students on the list will be

individually contacted and in
formed of the charges against
them. The extent of their in
volvement will determine further
action.
At present, a hearing on the
facts of the disruption and partici
pant's explanations of the under
lying basis for the demonstration

pressed hope "that some people
charge themselves and relate
precisely who did what."

confidential."
