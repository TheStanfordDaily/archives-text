# Study Committee Begun
## H & S Discusses SES Plans 
### SUSAN SWARD 
Along with the rest of the Stanford community, the
School of Humanities and Sciences (H&S) is in the
process of evaluating the proposals of the Study of
Education at Stanford (SES).
The reaction of the H&S faculty as a whole is crucial
in this period when the SES proposals are under
discussion by the community. For it is the 400 members
of the H&S faculty that do approximately 85 percent of
the teaching of undergraduates at Stanford. It is also the
H&S faculty that will be most centrally affected by the
outcome of the SES recommendations.
It is apparently impossible to generalize about "the
typical reaction" of the H&S faculty to the SES
proposals. The School is comprised of every department
in the University except the professional schools of earth
sciences, law, business, medicine, education and
engineering.
The Steering Committee of the H&S faculty—not to
be confused with the Steering Committee of the
Academic Senate —has established a committee chaired
by Nathan Maccoby of communications to examine the
SES proposals and their effect on H&S itself.
Discussion Desired
Both Maccoby and Robert McAfee Brown, vice
chairman of the committee, focused on the fact that the
committee has been established to insure the widest
possible discussion of the SES proposals among H&S
faculty.
According to Gavin Langmuir, the Chairman of the
H&S Steering Committee that established Maccoby's
committee, the committee is made up of 27 members of
the H&S faculty —each representing a different
department. Sub-committees have been established to
study certain portions of the proposals, and each of
these sub-committees will have at least 2 students on it.
Speaking about the committee's purpose, Halsey
Royden, acting dean of H&S, noted, "It represents a
desire to get a lot of faculty in-put and discussion taking

place before the Academic Senate consideres the various
SES proposals.
Undergrad Dean
"In order for any sort of program of educational
reform to be effective, it has to have the support of the
faculty responsible for carrying it out. I believe that the
proposed Dean of Undergraduate Education should be
part of H&S rather than an official on the Provost's
staff."
Royden, who came to Stanford as an acting assistant
professor of mathematics in 1951, is serving as acting
dean of H&S this year while Dean Robert Sears is on
sabbatical. He feels strongly that "the closer the
faculty's supervision of the program is, the more
effective the program will be.
"If the Undergraduate Dean is part of the Provost's
office," Royden added, "I see built-in structural
problems. The dean of H&S would then tend to focus
his interests on areas less concerned with undergraduate
education, and you might find H&S playing the devil's
advocate with respect to undergraduate education."
Clear Responsibility
Royden feels that Stanford will have the most
effective undergraduate educational system if H&S "has
clear responsibility for this program."
Herbert Packer, the Chairman of the SES Steering
Committee, disagrees with Royden on the question of
where the Undergraduate Dean should be situated in the
administration.
"What Mr. Royden and I agree upon is more
important, however," said Packer. "We agree that such a
dean should exist. I consider it less important where he
is in the administration than that he be as the focus of
responsibility with budgetary powers."
Hind Agrees
When questioned about the dean's placement within
the administration, Packer commented, "I think the
dean would have more power if he weren't under the
dean of H&S but on a University level. Then he is in a

better position to draw on the resources of the entire
University."
Robert Hind, Associate Dean of Undergraduate
Education, coucured with Packer's estimation of the
Undergraduate Dean's role. Hind, who is leaving
Stanford next month for the Education Development
Center in Newton, Massachusetts, said,
"I think it is essential that we get a strong
Undergraduate Dean if we're to carry out the proposals
and if we're to see a major improvement in
undergraduate education at Stanford. The position has
to have budgetary leverage and a role in reviewing
appointments and promotions."
Clear Division
Hind emphasized the fact that there must be a clear
division of responsibilities within the administration
"which has perhaps been somewhat lacking before.
Sanford Dornbush, professor of sociology and
director of the freshmen seminar program, said that he
does not "view H&S as a conservative block worrying
about its own prerogatives. H&S's concern is something
to be approved of. Because H&S does most of the
undergraduate teaching, it should be concerned with the
SES proposals."
William Clebsch, chairman of the SES sub-committee
on admissions, also expressed the view that H&S's
interest in the proposals is "quite legitimate. It's a fact
of life that H&S takes care of 85 percent of
undergraduate teaching and therefore is quite interested
in the manner in which educational reform is innovated.
Clebsch Confident
Clebsch noted that he has "every confidence the
administration and faculty will reconcile the issue of the
Undergraduate Dean to everybody's best interest."
According to Clebsch, "The University always
proceeds on good faith, and bad faith situations are the
exception. My experience with the Academic Senate is
that if there is a problem, the Senate sometimes meets
the problem head-on, sometimes foot on. But it usually
meets it."
