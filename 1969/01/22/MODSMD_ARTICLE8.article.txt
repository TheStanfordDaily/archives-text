# A 						Small Conspiracy
## The 						Why Of Stanford 
### JEFFREY BLUM 
The modern university is a
wonderful thing. It serves both its
students and the society at large.
Students pay tuition and comply
with university rules, which are
mostly academic, and receive a
diploma and placement into upper
middle class professions in return.
Wealthy individuals, govern
ments, foundations, and corpor
ations that dominate the society
contribute money and a certain
amount of leadership (trustees) to
the university, and receive in re
turn specific technical projects
(Stanford Research Institute) and
more importantly, a continual
supply of trained manpower. In
order to keep its end of the un
spoken bargain the university
must make sure that a very large
percentage of its students move
into "respectable" occupations.
In this context, it is not sur
prising that the university's aca
demic rules, such as professors
choosing subject matter and grad
ing students according to how
well they obey, serve to channel
students in certain directions rath
er than to maximize self-determin
ation.
The University, seeking to
serve both students and societal
institutions, must somehow recon
cile the contradictory interests of
the two. It has done so by con
vincing students that they really
want material comforts and re
spectable occupations rather than
self-determination, and then chan
neling them toward the institu
tions. It appears that Stanford has
been enormously successful in this
regard.

Bright Future
Most students, coming from
middle class background, do not
even need to be convinced. They
assume from the outset that
they're here to prepare themselves
for a good job and bright future.
But the most important value of
education for students is its con
tribution to self-determination,
not channeling. The pleasant but
ordinary upper middle class posi
tion awaiting the typical Stanford
student is not necessarily what he
needs or would desire if given the
chance to view other alternatives.
But also the modern university
has abdicated its critical function
in society. Because the university
depends upon the support of es
tablished institutions, it cannot
criticize them to the extent of
proposing abolition or even major
revision.
The university does not seek to
influence the basic directions and
values of society. It does not ex
periment with different customs
and practices to provide society
with alternatives for change. In
stead, the university helps to im
plement decisions already made
by the government by providing
any technical assistance required.
This is clearly not to say that
there are not critics of society
within the university. But these
people are a handful compared to
the vast majority of professors
who, believing that each person
should be free to do what he
wishes—even if it may hurt some
one else in distant Asia—present a
docile front to he world of big
government and big business that
wishes to utilize the resources of
the university. They raise no cry
over the channeling of their stu
dents perhaps because they, too,
are not aware of alternatives.
What is the function of educa
tional reform in the uncritical,
channeling university? Certainly it
is not self-determination. Reforms
and liberalization generally are in
tended to make the university op
erate more efficiently by raising
morale. Students can take one
course per quarter pass-fail so

they are not overburdened by
grading pressure. But still they are
graded and the nature of their
work is dictated to them.
Viciously Obtuse
The viciously obtuse general
studies requirements have been re
laxed somewhat and will be re
laxed further, but still there will
be requirements, and require
ments aside, subject matter in al
most every course will be decided
upon without even token consent
from students.
Study of Education commit
tees have included student mem
bers as have other committees.
But all these committees have pre
defined their areas of investigation
and limited the questions to be
asked so as not to alter funda
mentally the university.
Their concrete proposals for
reform are invariably superficial
and are designed to make the
whole structure operate more
smoothly rather than to question
the direction, intent, and under
lying philosophy of the university.
The greatest service SES commit
tees have served for students is to
dupe them into thinking they
have partial control over their
destinies, when in fact their in
fluence applies only to trivial mat
ters and not at all to he basic
nature and function of the univer
sity.
The university takes in stu
dents, isolates them from alterna
tive existences, channels them
toward "respectable" professions
and in the meantime allows them
to flatter themselves by being part
of educational reform. But really,
students are niggers, and on this
farm most are happy niggers.

The greatest service SES commit

The university takes in stu
dents, isolates them from alterna

farm most are happy niggers.

The modern university is a
wonderful thing. It serves both its
students and the society at large.
Students pay tuition and comply
with university rules, which are
mostly academic, and receive a
diploma and placement into upper
middle class professions in return.
Wealthy individuals, govern
ments, foundations, and corpor
ations that dominate the society
contribute money and a certain
amount of leadership (trustees) to
the university, and receive in re
turn specific technical projects
(Stanford Research Institute) and
more importantly, a continual
supply of trained manpower. In
order to keep its end of the un
spoken bargain the university
must make sure that a very large
percentage of its students move
into "respectable" occupations.
In this context, it is not sur
prising that the university's aca
demic rules, such as professors
choosing subject matter and grad
ing students according to how
well they obey, serve to channel
students in certain directions rath
er than to maximize self-determin
ation.
The University, seeking to
serve both students and societal
institutions, must somehow recon
cile the contradictory interests of
the two. It has done so by con
vincing students that they really
want material comforts and re
spectable occupations rather than
self-determination, and then chan
neling them toward the institu
tions. It appears that Stanford has
been enormously successful in this
regard.

Bright Future
Most students, coming from
middle class background, do not
even need to be convinced. They
assume from the outset that
they're here to prepare themselves
for a good job and bright future.
But the most important value of
education for students is its con
tribution to self-determination,
not channeling. The pleasant but
ordinary upper middle class posi
tion awaiting the typical Stanford
student is not necessarily what he
needs or would desire if given the
chance to view other alternatives.
But also the modern university
has abdicated its critical function
in society. Because the university
depends upon the support of es
tablished institutions, it cannot
criticize them to the extent of
proposing abolition or even major
revision.
The university does not seek to
influence the basic directions and
values of society. It does not ex
periment with different customs
and practices to provide society
with alternatives for change. In
stead, the university helps to im
plement decisions already made
by the government by providing
any technical assistance required.
This is clearly not to say that
there are not critics of society
within the university. But these
people are a handful compared to
the vast majority of professors
who, believing that each person
should be free to do what he
wishes—even if it may hurt some
one else in distant Asia—present a
docile front to he world of big
government and big business that
wishes to utilize the resources of
the university. They raise no cry
over the channeling of their stu
dents perhaps because they, too,
are not aware of alternatives.
What is the function of educa
tional reform in the uncritical,
channeling university? Certainly it
is not self-determination. Reforms
and liberalization generally are in
tended to make the university op
erate more efficiently by raising
morale. Students can take one
course per quarter pass-fail so

they are not overburdened by
grading pressure. But still they are
graded and the nature of their
work is dictated to them.
Viciously Obtuse
The viciously obtuse general
studies requirements have been re
laxed somewhat and will be re
laxed further, but still there will
be requirements, and require
ments aside, subject matter in al
most every course will be decided
upon without even token consent
from students.

dents perhaps because they, too,
are not aware of alternatives.
What is the function of educa
tional reform in the uncritical,
channeling university? Certainly it
is not self-determination. Reforms
and liberalization generally are in
tended to make the university op
erate more efficiently by raising
morale. Students can take one
course per quarter pass-fail so

they are not overburdened by
grading pressure. But still they are
graded and the nature of their
work is dictated to them.
Viciously Obtuse
The viciously obtuse general
studies requirements have been re
laxed somewhat and will be re
laxed further, but still there will
be requirements, and require
ments aside, subject matter in al
most every course will be decided
upon without even token consent
from students.
Study of Education commit
tees have included student mem
bers as have other committees.
But all these committees have pre
defined their areas of investigation
and limited the questions to be
asked so as not to alter funda
mentally the university.
Their concrete proposals for
reform are invariably superficial
and are designed to make the
whole structure operate more
smoothly rather than to question
the direction, intent, and under
lying philosophy of the university.
The greatest service SES commit
tees have served for students is to
dupe them into thinking they
have partial control over their
destinies, when in fact their in
fluence applies only to trivial mat
ters and not at all to he basic
nature and function of the univer
sity.
The university takes in stu
dents, isolates them from alterna
tive existences, channels them
toward "respectable" professions
and in the meantime allows them
to flatter themselves by being part
of educational reform. But really,
students are niggers, and on this
farm most are happy niggers.
