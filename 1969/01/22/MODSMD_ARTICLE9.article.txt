There has been considerable
public discussion for the last year,
1968, and moreover, a very in
tense dialogue within the past few
months on the directions that The
Black Revolutionary Movement
must take if it is to not only sur
vive, but effect those desired re
structurings in the American polit
ical-social-economic fabric.
Julius Lester, author of
"LOOK OUT WHITEY, BLACK
POWER'S GONNA GET YOUR
MOMMA" and a weekly colum
nist ("The Other Side of the
Tracks") for the radical news
weekly, The Guardian, has de
voted considerable time and en
ergy to this subject. However, it
has become pretty clear in his last
few columns that Julius has
strayed from developing these
thoughts with the not-inconsider
able revolutionary consciousness
that he possesses so that the
American public-at-large can now,
with increasing frequency, lay
claim to having pulled in another
brother behind its rubric—words,
lots of words, and enough emo
tional gut-wringing, but less and
less of the fires that stir within the
breasts of Black People.
This is very important when
any discussion, dialogue, or what
ever is to ensue between the white
American public and the Black re
porter. It is the white American
public that must face the facts as
only the Black reporter can relay
them (as Malcolm X once said,
"The most difficult fact that the
White Man will have to face in
these changing times will be ex
actly those deeds and acts that
have made him what he is to
day.")
Black Reporter
The Black reporter, and I
mention this because it is impor
tant that we begin, or lay the
foundations for any sort of future
dialogue between the black and
white peoples of this country,

must keep himself aware at all
times that it is not for himself, the
reporter as some sort of self-styled
ego, but the peoples from whom
he comes and is in fact a part of,
that he must bear witness to.
Yes, this had its extensions—it
is the same credo under which the
White nations of the world oper
ate; it is the same credo according
to which the Soviet-dominated
countries of the world adhere to;
it is the same doctrine that the
Red Chinese-oriented countries of
the world follow; it is the same
perspective out of which African
and Asiatic countries base and
shape policy, image, and position.
All of this need be said for
certain very definite reasons, not
the least among which is that
there is a change of tradewinds in
the air, there has been a new Presi
dent of these United States inaug
urated, and the Black Movement
has taken giant strides since 1961
when those brothers and sisters
behind the Cotton Curtain sat-in
and so opened the door to a new
sense of time and history alto
gether where Black people in
America are concerned.
Leadership Change
Today, Stanford University is
undergoing changes in leadership
at almost every conceivable level—
from its still all-white administra
tive and trustee make-up on down
through its various student inter
est groups, among these being
SDS, the New Left, the Black Stu
dents Union, the Young Conserva
tives, and the "Straights" (ASSU
Prexy Denis Hayes and Com
pany).
This does not mean that Stan
ford as a corporate image is going
to change. It does not even mean
that change, as such, is desired. If
so, then much work still remains
to be carried through, and not all
of it, or even a major portion,
being centered in the SDS de
mands that this University, as "Pri

vate Enterprise Personified," with
draw its holdings, its vested inter
ests, from Southeast Asia.
Black Growth
I say this not only as a reporter,
but as a member of one of the
aforementioned interest groups. I
am Commissioner of Black Arts for
this institutions's Black Students
Union (Afro-West as such is no
more) and among the facts and
issues that I have uncovered in this
office specifically concerning what
Stanford University can do for Us
(and We, for Them) are some
whose import and relevance to the
growth of the Black Student in the
white world cannot be over
stressed.
In a sense, private middleclass
(understood-to-be-white, read or
ask about Mark Weinberger's
column which ran Monday, Jan.
20, in which he details the plight of
the white reporter in the Black
world for a concise white-oriented
report of what I am talking about)
universities like Stanford are prov
ing-grounds for what future racial
and social relations will be in this
country, so much so until the old
adage about "Everything happens
faster in the Big City" has striking
parallels to our condition here.
When you read, or see over the
televisions in your offices and
homes that men such as Roy Innis
of CORE, Bayard Rustin, the Rev.
Jesse Bevel, Rap Brown, Stokeley
Carmichael, the Honorable Elijah
Muhammad, Eldridge Cleaver,
Bobby Seale and others are taking
stances all across the country on
any number of issues ranging from
Black Capitalism to Counter-
Revolutionary activity on down
through the sad shooting and
murdering of the two Black
Panthers in Los Angeles (there we
go again, only time now has us
doing one another in on the college
campus, like I said, "Everything
happens faster in the Big City"),
then you can believe that there
exists an incredible amount of in
tellectual and ideological activity
going on in our world.
Don't Understand
True—at levels there are, and
shall for a long while yet remain,
White people who do not and will
not ever understand what is going
on. It is also true that the new
revolutionary consciousness and
initiative is manifesting itself more
and more so everyday as the posses
sion of Black peoples in America.
The strike by the American Fed
eration of Teachers, for instance,
no matter how well-publicized or
how bitterly attacked, is nothing
more than an off-shoot of the activ
ity engaged in by members of The
Movement at San Francisco State
College. Sure, we all hope that the
Mayor's office along with the labor
union bosses will be able to
hammer out some sort of agree
ment so that school can resume
but, this will never happen so long
as there exists within the white
community some notion of innate
superiority aud/or manifest des
tiny that enables them to decide
what terms will be negotiable, what

conditions black people and white
people will meet under.
Most insulting of all—the fact
that there exists literally millions
of white people in this country
who believe that they can separate
the needs of black peoples into two
opposing camps: one, that of the
"moderates"; and the other, that
belonging to those "radical extrem
ists" who have aligned themselves
with the Third World Liberation
Front.
You cannot serve God and
Mammon at the same time is what I
remember learning in that poor
Baptist church on 103 rd Street in
Watts that I once attended as a
young child. That lesson, drilled
into me on innumerable Sundays,
comes back now with what must be
a slightly ironic twist—a Change in
Leadership does not imply a
Change in Direction. We must be,
and will be at all times sensitive and
respectful of the wishes we know
lie in the hearts of our peoples.
Where our people have cause to
hate and burn, we must not only
know this, but have you white
readers know that this is the only
way it can go in this country for the
two of us—black and white.
We can only ask that you begin,
because you haven't even started
yet, to follow and support our
activity with the knowledge that
there does exist a sense of historical
destiny in the Black Movement
that no amount of philandering,
internecine warfare, and mealy
mouthed chauvinism can deter. As
Brother Huey stated quite cor
rectly, "The Will of the People is
Stronger than the Man's Technol
ogy"
Applied here, at Stanford, this
can mean but one thing—People
will have to start shaping up here,
and real soon. Stanford ought to
have learned from the lessons of
history already—the United States
even found that it could remain
forever "isolationist." The only
question that remains is how do we
deal with one another from here
(or, how politically conscious are
you afterall?).
