# Palo Alto Move
## Low-Cost Housing Approved 
### THOMAS C. DAWSON 
Low-cost housing may be com
ing to the Stanford area. The Palo
Alto City Council Monday night
voted to "reserve" a 6.15-acre
tract of land on El Camino Real
"for possible low-cost housing."
The "Corporation Yard" site,
owned by Stanford and leased to
the city, was offered to bidders
for private development last fall.
Eight plans were submitted for
the site, ranging from office build
ings to a Holiday Inn, and the
low-cost housing scheme.
Actual construction on the site
may be a long time in the future,
however, since the City Council
decided to postpone final action
on allocating the site until the re
sults of Stanford's low-cost hous
ing committee are published. The
committee, appointed by Acting
President Robert Glaser last
October, is slated to make its final
report to the Board of Trustees in
May or June.
One strong possibility is that
the Stanford committee will pro
pose a housing project, on Stan
ford land, for low- and middle
income residents, including stu
dents, University employees and
other area residents, not necessar
ily Stanford employees.
If this recommendation should
not be approved by the Board of
Trustees, the Palo Alto City
Council would then adopt the sec
ond-choice project, a "heavily
landscaped, rustic office center."
The vote by the City Council
was somewhat of a surprise to
many observers who had expected
the council to approve the office
center proposal. Stanford Univer
sity had gone on record as being
in favor of the low-cost housing
proposal. President Pitzer and Dr.
Glaser both wrote to the council
recommending the housing pro
ject.
The City Council held several
meetings in which the Corpora
tion Yard project was discussed.

At most of the meetings propon
ents of the low-cost housing plan
were well-represented by speakers,
who argued that Palo Alto has
slowly driven out the low-income
residents.
One speaker at Monday night's
meeting pointed out that only
nine homes priced under $25,000
are listed for sale in Palo Alto
while more than 80 are offered
for sale at prices more than
$25,000.
The proposal was opposed by
several groups that argued that the
Corporation Yard site, near the in
tersection of El Camino Real and
University Ave was too congested
with traffic and would pose a dan
ger to children of residents.
Other speakers also pointed
out that heavy tax burden that
would fall on the city since the
residents of the project would not
contribute significantly to the tax

revenue of the city while at the
same time making heavy use of
facilities like the schools.
This argument was countered
by speakers who said the city had
a moral obligation to help support
the people who had previously
been driven from the city by in
creasing rents. As one speaker at
Monday night's meeting com
mented, Palo Alto is "becoming a
community of older and wealthier
people. Our community has al
ways been a happy mix until re
cently."
In a City Council meeting in
September, a supporter of the
low-cost housing proposal,
Eleanor Heath, said the City has a
responsibility to the people who
"run their schools, service their
hospitals and operate City services
to give them an opportunity to
live in Palo Alto and send their
children to Palo Alto schools."

sity had gone on record as being
in favor of the low-cost housing
proposal. President Pitzer and Dr.
Glaser both wrote to the council
recommending the housing pro
ject.
The City Council held several
meetings in which the Corpora
tion Yard project was discussed.

At most of the meetings propon
ents of the low-cost housing plan
were well-represented by speakers,
who argued that Palo Alto has
slowly driven out the low-income
residents.
One speaker at Monday night's
meeting pointed out that only
nine homes priced under $25,000
are listed for sale in Palo Alto
while more than 80 are offered
for sale at prices more than
$25,000.
The proposal was opposed by
several groups that argued that the
Corporation Yard site, near the in
tersection of El Camino Real and
University Ave was too congested
with traffic and would pose a dan
ger to children of residents.
Other speakers also pointed
out that heavy tax burden that
would fall on the city since the
residents of the project would not
contribute significantly to the tax

revenue of the city while at the
same time making heavy use of
facilities like the schools.
This argument was countered
by speakers who said the city had
a moral obligation to help support
the people who had previously
been driven from the city by in
creasing rents. As one speaker at
Monday night's meeting com
mented, Palo Alto is "becoming a
community of older and wealthier
people. Our community has al
ways been a happy mix until re
cently."
In a City Council meeting in
September, a supporter of the
low-cost housing proposal,
Eleanor Heath, said the City has a
responsibility to the people who
"run their schools, service their
hospitals and operate City services
to give them an opportunity to
live in Palo Alto and send their
children to Palo Alto schools."
Low-cost housing may be com
ing to the Stanford area. The Palo
Alto City Council Monday night
voted to "reserve" a 6.15-acre
tract of land on El Camino Real
"for possible low-cost housing."
The "Corporation Yard" site,
owned by Stanford and leased to
the city, was offered to bidders
for private development last fall.
Eight plans were submitted for
the site, ranging from office build
ings to a Holiday Inn, and the
low-cost housing scheme.
Actual construction on the site
may be a long time in the future,
however, since the City Council
decided to postpone final action
on allocating the site until the re
sults of Stanford's low-cost hous
ing committee are published. The
committee, appointed by Acting
President Robert Glaser last
October, is slated to make its final
report to the Board of Trustees in
May or June.
One strong possibility is that
the Stanford committee will pro
pose a housing project, on Stan
ford land, for low- and middle
income residents, including stu
dents, University employees and
other area residents, not necessar
ily Stanford employees.
If this recommendation should
not be approved by the Board of
Trustees, the Palo Alto City
Council would then adopt the sec
ond-choice project, a "heavily
landscaped, rustic office center."
The vote by the City Council
was somewhat of a surprise to
many observers who had expected
the council to approve the office
center proposal. Stanford Univer
