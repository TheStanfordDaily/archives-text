# Mr. Doan:
## Is the top of the corporate ladder worth the pressure? 
### 
Dear Mr. Doan:
I question whether a business
career will allow me to attain
what I would consider a proper
balance among all aspects of my
life. Is business today so
demanding that one would have
time for little else? A job is a
major part of life but not the
whole of it. Raising a family is a
very important part of most
people's future plans. Therefore,
of prime concern would be the
possible adverse effects a career
in business might have on an
individual's family obligations.
Are basic family ties weakened
as a result of a preoccupation
with business? With respect to
family ties, Dr. Feinberg in the
January 1968 Dun's Review says,
"In the family of the typical
business executive there is very
little knitting together of
diverse environments." It would
appear that an executive cannot
adequately fulfill his role as a
husband and father. The family
unit is subordinated to his job.
A preoccupation with business
can mean more than just a lack
of time to spend with one's
family. In the same article. Dr.
Feinberg says, "Many youngsters
feel that their fathers know the
price of everything and the value
of nothing." There appears to be
the tendency to emphasize the
economic side of life and to
ignore the equally important
personal side.
My question is whether being a
good husband and father will
necessarily conflict with being a
good businessman. Draw on
your own personal experience,
Mr. Doan. Can you honestly say
that en route to becoming a
successful businessman, you
were an equally successful
husband and father? Need these
roles be contradictory? If not,
how did you resolve the conflict?

Dear Mr. Butler:
You ask about conflict between
the time demands of a job in
industry and the time we need
for our family life.
Well, first of all, I'm not sure
there's any real difference
between this problem as it occurs
in business and as it occurs in
any other occupation ; the same
problem occurs in education, in
government, or in the ministry.
In any field —and this is the basic
problem—the more responsibility
you assume the less time you'll
have for your family.
In many cases this factor has a
built-in balance: the heaviest
responsibility usually comes to
us at an age when our children
have grown up, so that in an
idealized sense there may be no
problem at all.
My own view is that you can
have both a satisfying career and
a good family life, but I
recognize that for the young
business executive this is a very
real problem, and one that
requires some choices to be made
— consciously or unconsciously.
You are perfectly right that you
cannot carry a very large
business or educational or
governmental responsibility and
also have an ideal family life —
particularly from the standpoint
of time. Perhaps the saving
grace of this dilemma is that
each of us can make our choice
as to what we want.
When Dr. Feinberg says that
many parents "know the price of
everything and the value of
nothing" he is right, but I'm
sure this phenomenon is not
exclusive to businessmen. It is
more a condemnation of
individuals than it is of the
business system. There are great
numbers of businessmen who
have excellent value systems, and
in many cases these are based on
a self-acquired liberal education.
The man who knows the value of
all things (and the price of
nothing) is invariably of more
value to the business system, just
as he is a more valuable man to
education or to the government.

anticipates graduate studies before
developing his career.
In the course of the entire Dialogue
Program, Stan Chess, Journalism
major at Cornell, also will probe
issues with Mr. Doan; as will Mark
Bookspan, a Chemistry major at Ohio
State, and David G. Clark, in
graduate studies at Stanford, with
Mr. DeYoung; and similarly, Arthur
M. Klebanoff, in Liberal Arts at Yale,
7 and Arnold Shelby, Latin American
Studies at Tulane, with Mr. Galvin.

On the personal side, to some
extent I am a victim of the
problem you pose. Having raised
a family in an imperfect and, I
suppose, shorthanded (in the
sense of lack of time) way, I can
readily agree that there are
conflicts. But, having raised a
family, I'm convinced as well that
no one has an idea how this
really should be done. It may well
be that more time would not
have solved problems that were
personal short-comings in
the first place.
In any event, the central point is
that we are free people with
free wills. If you want to work a
40-hour or a 30-hour week so
that you can spend more time
with your family, that is a noble
goal and one you can probably
achieve —if your goal is not to
assume a large amount of
responsibility in your chosen field.
Your question is not related
solely to business, but to any
occupation ; and if you are wise
enough you can figure out your
own best balance in this matter.
But I think it should be perfectly
apparent to you that not many
people are this -visa, and that
this balance—like many of the
elements of Utopia —is not
really attainable.
To summarize: if you want to
achieve the maximum success in
any field you had better be
prepared to work long, hard,
dedicated hours. This kind of
advice admits a heavy imbalance
in the way you spend your time,
as I am quite aware, but the
choice is yours.

H. D. Doan, President,

sure this phenomenon is not
exclusive to businessmen. It is
more a condemnation of
individuals than it is of the
business system. There are great
numbers of businessmen who
have excellent value systems, and
in many cases these are based on
a self-acquired liberal education.
The man who knows the value of
all things (and the price of
nothing) is invariably of more
value to the business system, just
as he is a more valuable man to

On the personal side, to some

problem you pose. Having raised
a family in an imperfect and, I

sense of lack of time) way, I can
readily agree that there are
conflicts. But, having raised a
family, I'm convinced as well that
no one has an idea how this
really should be done. It may well
be that more time would not
have solved problems that were
personal short-comings in
the first place.
In any event, the central point is
that we are free people with
free wills. If you want to work a
40-hour or a 30-hour week so
that you can spend more time
with your family, that is a noble
goal and one you can probably
achieve —if your goal is not to
assume a large amount of
responsibility in your chosen field.
Your question is not related
solely to business, but to any
occupation ; and if you are wise
enough you can figure out your
own best balance in this matter.
But I think it should be perfectly
apparent to you that not many
people are this -visa, and that
this balance—like many of the
elements of Utopia —is not
really attainable.
To summarize: if you want to
achieve the maximum success in
any field you had better be
prepared to work long, hard,
dedicated hours. This kind of
advice admits a heavy imbalance
in the way you spend your time,
as I am quite aware, but the
choice is yours.

Dear Mr. Doan:
I question whether a business
career will allow me to attain
what I would consider a proper
balance among all aspects of my
life. Is business today so
demanding that one would have
time for little else? A job is a
major part of life but not the
whole of it. Raising a family is a
very important part of most
people's future plans. Therefore,
of prime concern would be the
possible adverse effects a career
in business might have on an
individual's family obligations.
Are basic family ties weakened
as a result of a preoccupation
with business? With respect to
family ties, Dr. Feinberg in the
January 1968 Dun's Review says,
"In the family of the typical
business executive there is very
little knitting together of
diverse environments." It would
appear that an executive cannot
adequately fulfill his role as a
husband and father. The family
unit is subordinated to his job.
A preoccupation with business
can mean more than just a lack
of time to spend with one's
family. In the same article. Dr.
Feinberg says, "Many youngsters
feel that their fathers know the
price of everything and the value
of nothing." There appears to be
the tendency to emphasize the
economic side of life and to
ignore the equally important
personal side.
My question is whether being a
good husband and father will
necessarily conflict with being a
good businessman. Draw on
your own personal experience,
Mr. Doan. Can you honestly say
that en route to becoming a
successful businessman, you
were an equally successful
husband and father? Need these
roles be contradictory? If not,
how did you resolve the conflict?

Dear Mr. Butler:
You ask about conflict between
the time demands of a job in
industry and the time we need
for our family life.
Well, first of all, I'm not sure
there's any real difference
between this problem as it occurs
in business and as it occurs in
any other occupation ; the same
problem occurs in education, in
government, or in the ministry.
In any field —and this is the basic
problem—the more responsibility
you assume the less time you'll
have for your family.
In many cases this factor has a
built-in balance: the heaviest
responsibility usually comes to
us at an age when our children
have grown up, so that in an
idealized sense there may be no
problem at all.
My own view is that you can
have both a satisfying career and
a good family life, but I
recognize that for the young
business executive this is a very
real problem, and one that
requires some choices to be made
— consciously or unconsciously.
You are perfectly right that you
cannot carry a very large
business or educational or
governmental responsibility and
also have an ideal family life —
particularly from the standpoint
of time. Perhaps the saving
grace of this dilemma is that
each of us can make our choice
as to what we want.
When Dr. Feinberg says that
many parents "know the price of
everything and the value of
nothing" he is right, but I'm

Dear Mr. Butler:
You ask about conflict between
the time demands of a job in
industry and the time we need
for our family life.
Well, first of all, I'm not sure
there's any real difference
between this problem as it occurs
in business and as it occurs in
any other occupation ; the same
problem occurs in education, in
government, or in the ministry.
In any field —and this is the basic
problem—the more responsibility
you assume the less time you'll
have for your family.
In many cases this factor has a
built-in balance: the heaviest
responsibility usually comes to
us at an age when our children
have grown up, so that in an
idealized sense there may be no
problem at all.
My own view is that you can
have both a satisfying career and
a good family life, but I
recognize that for the young
business executive this is a very
real problem, and one that
requires some choices to be made
— consciously or unconsciously.
You are perfectly right that you
cannot carry a very large
business or educational or
governmental responsibility and
also have an ideal family life —
particularly from the standpoint
of time. Perhaps the saving
grace of this dilemma is that
each of us can make our choice
as to what we want.
When Dr. Feinberg says that
many parents "know the price of
everything and the value of
nothing" he is right, but I'm
sure this phenomenon is not
exclusive to businessmen. It is
more a condemnation of
individuals than it is of the
business system. There are great
numbers of businessmen who
have excellent value systems, and
in many cases these are based on
a self-acquired liberal education.
The man who knows the value of
all things (and the price of
nothing) is invariably of more
value to the business system, just
as he is a more valuable man to
education or to the government.

anticipates graduate studies before
developing his career.
In the course of the entire Dialogue
Program, Stan Chess, Journalism
major at Cornell, also will probe
issues with Mr. Doan; as will Mark
Bookspan, a Chemistry major at Ohio
State, and David G. Clark, in
graduate studies at Stanford, with
Mr. DeYoung; and similarly, Arthur
M. Klebanoff, in Liberal Arts at Yale,
7 and Arnold Shelby, Latin American
Studies at Tulane, with Mr. Galvin.

On the personal side, to some
extent I am a victim of the
problem you pose. Having raised
a family in an imperfect and, I
suppose, shorthanded (in the
sense of lack of time) way, I can
readily agree that there are
conflicts. But, having raised a
family, I'm convinced as well that
no one has an idea how this
really should be done. It may well
be that more time would not
have solved problems that were
personal short-comings in
the first place.
In any event, the central point is
that we are free people with
free wills. If you want to work a
40-hour or a 30-hour week so
that you can spend more time
with your family, that is a noble
goal and one you can probably
achieve —if your goal is not to
assume a large amount of
responsibility in your chosen field.
Your question is not related
solely to business, but to any
occupation ; and if you are wise
enough you can figure out your
own best balance in this matter.
But I think it should be perfectly
apparent to you that not many
people are this -visa, and that
this balance—like many of the
elements of Utopia —is not
really attainable.
To summarize: if you want to
achieve the maximum success in
any field you had better be
prepared to work long, hard,
dedicated hours. This kind of
advice admits a heavy imbalance
in the way you spend your time,
as I am quite aware, but the
choice is yours.
Sincerely,

H. D. Doan, President,
The Dow Chemical Company

this publication, and other campus
newspapers across the country,

Dear Mr. Doan:
I question whether a business
career will allow me to attain
what I would consider a proper
balance among all aspects of my
life. Is business today so
demanding that one would have
time for little else? A job is a
major part of life but not the
whole of it. Raising a family is a
very important part of most
people's future plans. Therefore,
of prime concern would be the
possible adverse effects a career
in business might have on an
individual's family obligations.
Are basic family ties weakened
as a result of a preoccupation
with business? With respect to
family ties, Dr. Feinberg in the
January 1968 Dun's Review says,
"In the family of the typical
business executive there is very
little knitting together of
diverse environments." It would
appear that an executive cannot
adequately fulfill his role as a
husband and father. The family
unit is subordinated to his job.
A preoccupation with business
can mean more than just a lack
of time to spend with one's
family. In the same article. Dr.

extent I am a victim of the
problem you pose. Having raised
a family in an imperfect and, I
suppose, shorthanded (in the
sense of lack of time) way, I can
readily agree that there are
conflicts. But, having raised a
family, I'm convinced as well that
no one has an idea how this
really should be done. It may well
be that more time would not
have solved problems that were
personal short-comings in
the first place.
In any event, the central point is
that we are free people with
free wills. If you want to work a
40-hour or a 30-hour week so
that you can spend more time
with your family, that is a noble
goal and one you can probably
achieve —if your goal is not to
assume a large amount of
responsibility in your chosen field.
Your question is not related
solely to business, but to any
occupation ; and if you are wise
enough you can figure out your
own best balance in this matter.
But I think it should be perfectly
apparent to you that not many
people are this -visa, and that
this balance—like many of the
elements of Utopia —is not
really attainable.
To summarize: if you want to
achieve the maximum success in
any field you had better be
prepared to work long, hard,
dedicated hours. This kind of
advice admits a heavy imbalance
in the way you spend your time,
as I am quite aware, but the
choice is yours.
Sincerely,

H. D. Doan, President,
The Dow Chemical Company
