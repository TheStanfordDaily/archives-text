## Teach Yourself Counter-Insurgency 
### ANDREW MOSS 
What do these courses have in
common: Marxism (taught by a
Marxist); the black protest move
ment; the political economy of
corporate capitalism; imperalism?
For one thing, they are all rad
ical. For another, none of them is
available in the Stanford political
science department. They are, in
fact, four of the courses the politi
cal science students have been ask
ing for and have so far failed to
get. Even asking for them has
clearly put the faculty up against
the wall; to ask for a course on
imperialism suggests there is some
thing wrong with a department
that doesn't have one. This is at
tacking the faculty where they
live—in their professionalism.
"You expert professionals," the
students are saying, "are not do
ing your job right."
Academics
A lot of students don't have

much respect left for academics,
particularly those in and around
the social sciences. People who
have to fight t ff their draft boards
remember Wesley Fishel, the
political scienct professor from
Michigan State University, and his
fifty-four man academic advisory
group that fronted for the ClA's
aid to Ngo Dinh Diem. Stanford
students may have heard about
the pacification planning of
Eugene Staley, the SRI econ
omist. Or perhaps they know
about the sociologists and anthro
pologists of project AGILE, the
world-wide counter-insurgency
program, and CAMELOT, its
South American counterpart.
(There is something very sinister
about those bland, non-committal
names.) Not every social scientist
works for the defense department,
a few probably even work against
it, but a lot of distinguished (and
less distinguished) academics,
from Walt Rostow downwards,

are associated with causes that are
beginning to stink. One day, when
the radical researchers on this
campus get really organized, we
will all astound ourselves finding
out just who is paying who for
what in the social sciences.
Other Side
There are some people on the
other side. The professional as
sociations, those mountains of ir
relevance, began to stir back in
1965, when the war got escalated,
and a few have given birth to mild
statements of concern. (The phil
osophers on Vietnam were first;
then the anthropologists on
CAMELOT.) There is also a tiny
band of resisters, people who
refuse to sign loyalty oaths, who
won't take military money, who
shout about biological warfare,
and so forth. One thing is certain:
if you want to do any of that and
stay an academic, you had better
wait till you get tenure.
The worrying thing about the

social scientists, who, after all, are
innocents compared with the pure
scientists, or the trustees, is what
is happening to their disciplines.
You can get federal money for
counter-insurgency work. For pro
testing about it you get fired. (At
least you do if your protest is ef
fective rather than symbolic.)
What kind of effect does that have
on your sociology, your political
science, your economics?
One-Dimensionality
I have a pretty good idea.
Marcuse called it one-dimensional
ity —the sanctification of the
status quo. You end up with
academic disciplines that don't
have any capability for criticizing
the world around them. Political
science becomes pluralism, soci
ology becomes functionalism and
economics slides into the hands of
the businessmen. The social
sciences dissolve into a mass of
techniques and an obsession with
quantification. Any possibility of
living dangerously, criticising the
state of the world, is traded for a
steady supply of research funds.

How much of an exaggeration
is this?We won't know until the
conflicts that hide under the one
dimensionality come to the sur
face and bring what's taught
about the world into question.
The black revolts are doing it for
some fields, where they touch on
black history and its incorpora
tion into the rosy pluralist world
view. The same kind of re-creation
of the disciplines will have to
happen in other places.
Poly Sci Causes
A hundred and seventy people
signed up for those political
science courses, eleven of them in
all. A few of those people are rad
icals, most probably aren't. But a
lot of people seem to be finding
something unsatisfactory about
what is available in the political
science department and surely the
same kind of thing will happen in
other departments. After all, if all
those social scientists, with their
supposedly value-free technology,
can work in and teach counter
insurgency, they could also be
teaching revolution.
