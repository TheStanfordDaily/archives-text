# Letters From Mom
## On Confrontation 
### 
DEAR MOM:
What is your opinion of the
recent confrontation between
SDS and the Trustees at the Fac
ulty Club?
CURIOUS
OFFICE OF THE DEAN
DEAR CURIOUS:
Many of the schools on cam
pus, including the Business
School, have had annual softball
games between the faculty and
students. The poor trustees have
never been included. I think it was
thoughtful of the students in SDS
to play "door push" with the
Trustees. It proves they really are
for a democratic society.
While the students won this
year, I hear that the gym at the
Union-Pacific Club has been very
busy with Trustees in training for
next year's contest.
Also, there is a rumor that
Roosevelt Grier will be named to
replace David Packard, and a ser
ies of lectures by an encyclopae
dia salesman on "door entering" is
planned for future trustee meet
ings.
Good luck to both groups,
SPORTINGLY,
MOM
DEAR MOM:
I try to keep up with things on

campus but there are so many
committees. Can you help me?
CONFUSED
DEAR CONFUSED:
Let me describe a few of them:
The Committee of Fifteen: It
is made up of students, faculty,
and administrators (I forget the
exact number of members). To
call them C-15 is misleading be
cause they have closed meetings
and you can't really see them.)
The Committee of Fourteen:
This meets when one of the mem
bers of the Committee of Fifteen
is sick.
There is the Student Conduct
Legislative Committee (SCLC),
not to be confused with the Stu
dent Judicial Council (SJC),
which is not the same as the facul

ty advisory group on campus dis
ruption (FAGCD). In addition to
this there is Denis Hayes' Cabinet
Committee, also the new commit
tee of trustees, faculty and stu
dents. Added to this are several
others like the Committee on
Committees, and the SES commit
tee. It doesn't really matter what
the committees do: the purpose
of them is to make everyone feel
involved and important. Each par
ticipant of every committee
knows that his is the most import
ant committee on campus. But we
need still more committees as
there are four or five people who
aren't on one. I'm starting a Com
mittee Whom Only a Mother
Could Love.
LOVINGLY,
MOM
