## Albee 'Balance' Engrossing 
### ANDREA HINE 
Edward Albee has done it
again! He has created an en
grossing dissection of human re
lationships and the potential de
structiveness of love entitled A
Delicate Balance now playing a
limited run (through Friday) at
the American Conservatory
Theatre. In the brutal manner
made famous in Who's Afraid, of
Virginia Woolf, Albee cuts below
the surface of his characters to ex
pose their bleeding insides, like a
skilled surgeon who performs an
operation with a jagged saw in
stead of a scalpel.
The foremost conflict is be
tween an ineffectual and passive
husband and his dominating wife
who attempts like a drill sergeant
to maintain the "delicate balance"
between love and hate, sanity and
insanity in her family, by sheer
force of will and icily controlled
emotion.

Add to this set-up her alcoholic
younger sister who delights in
taunting the couple mercilessly
(so she will not have to face her
own weaknesses), and their four
times divorced daughter who has
come home after her latest marital
disaster only to discover that
another couple has inexplicably
moved into the house; and we
have more than enough ingredi
ents for a harrowing psycho
drama.
This not-so-delicate balance of
relationships is tipped up and
down as the characters are forced
to examine their ties of love and
friendship, hate and hostility
while the audience, sometimes al
most embarrassed to be witnessing
such painful honesty, watches
fascinated for three hours.
The actors are magnificent, and
all deserve praise in their strong
interpretations of the weak
characters on stage. The wife is

portrayed by Josephine Nichols as
a woman who is watching her
youth pass away into "rust and
bones" while the impotence and
ambivalence of her husband
(Robert Derringer) forces her to
be the decision maker, or the
fulcrum in the balance. Derringer
is convincingly pitiable as he is
caught in the vicious battle of wits
between his forceful wife and her
sensual younger sister (Michael
Learned), who is a delight to
watch on stage as she baits the
characters and then sits back,
drink after drink in hand, to
watch the results.
Confrontation
Their daughter is somewhat
melodramatically played by Dana
Larson as a spoiled and selfish
brat whose four marriages have
not been enough to make her a
woman. Last but not least is the
other couple, played by Robert

Lanchester and Patricia
Falkenhain as held together for
forty years by inertia and the
prospect of the loneliness which
finally confronts them.
The image of a delicate balance
is skillfully handled throughout
the production, through the lines
themselves, the stage setting (a
long couch with a car behind to
which the characters frequently
turn—over thirty drinks were con
sumed!), and the movements of
the actors. (This was often done
in tableaux of the characters on
opposite sides of the stage,
showing shifts in power from one
to another, with a third caught be
tween.)
At the end of the long night,
which is a culmination of long
years of frustration, sexual inade
quacy, infidelity, alcoholism and
loss of trust, the pieces of the six
characters in search of their soul
lie at our feet. As in Virginia
Woolf, the daybreak is supposed
to signal a new beginning. Life
must go on—it can be no worse.
The antagonists are exhausted,
as are the audience who have
undergone this ordeal with them,
If the underlying conflicts are not
resolved, at least everyone has un
burdened his conscience and can
begin a new and hopefully
balanced—albeit delicately—day.
