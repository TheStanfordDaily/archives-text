Contemporary paintings collected by Stanford alumni, most of
them too large for private showing yet expressive of today's art, will
be exhibited at the Art Museum for the next two months.
The exhibition, titled "Alumni Collect Contemporary Paintings,"
was organized by Art Prof. Albert Elsen, who comments: "The show
will bring to the University and the community some of the new and
exciting developments in recent painting on both the East and West
Coasts."
He adds, "Most of the paintings that will be shown are too big to
be hung in private homes. Large art museum galleries are ideal for
their display. One of the joys and dilemmas of collecting
contemporary painting is that one may own but not possess a large
canvas because of the scale.
"The oversize canvas is not adopted by painters out of perversity,
but out of necessity (for) the esthetic effects they seek to achieve
with color. This particular exhibition will partially answer the
question, 'art for what'?
"Mural size paintings by Stella, Olitski, Ron Davis, Avedisian, and
others are meant for public as well as private pleasure. It is part of the
long range art program of this University to attract loans and gifts of
major works of art on all scales to transform for the better not only
the Museum and the new Stanford Art Building, but the campus in
