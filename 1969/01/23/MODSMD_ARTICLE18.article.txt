# SES Report: End Of TA's
## 
### 
"The Role of the Graduate
Student in Teaching at Stanford
University" is the topic today of a
program presented by the
Graduate Student Association
(GSA) at 4:15 p.m. in Tresidder
Large Lounge.
Much of the discussion is
expected to focus on Teaching
Assistantships, a program that has
generated a great deal of
controversy recently.
As Barry Askinis, organizer of
the GSA, explained, "Before the
SES report, the rationalization of
the administration was that teach
ing is 'good (often required) ex
perience' for graduate students,
and it certainly is less expensive
than paying professors.
"Since the SES report, the
most constant remedy prescribed
for the ills of the freshman year
has been to raise the quality of
the classes by having only full pro
fessors teach frosh courses,"
Askinis claimed.
"How, then, will graduate stu
dents get their character-building
experience, and what has happen
ed to the 'greater rapport' the
graduate student is said to have
with the undergraduate?
The panel, moderated by Dick
Miles, a graduate student in Elec
trical Engineering, includes Vice
Provost E. Howard Brooks; Frank
Cady, Teaching Assistant in Eng
lish; Physics Prof. Walter Meyer
hof; and Andrew Moss of the
Stanford AFT.
Today's program will be fol
lowed by several others later in
the quarter.
