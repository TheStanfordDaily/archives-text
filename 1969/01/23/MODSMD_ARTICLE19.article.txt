# Packer To Junior Faculty
## SES Report 'Essentially Conservative' 
### 
Stanford should stop imposing
general education via the regis
trar's office, "get rid of rule
ridden education," and unleash
creative talent that now polices a
"byzantine" curricular structure if
it wants to help undergraduates
learn at the University.
This view was presented
Tuesday by Vice Provost Herbert
Packer, steering committee chair
man of the Study of Education at
Stanford, to about 40 Junior Facul
ty Forum members.
The SES report on under
graduate education provides some
"entering wedges" for change in
the structure of the University,
Packer said. But the report on
governance, due out in about
three weeks, "says pretty tough
things to departments about
democratizing their procedures."
Essentially Conservative
However, he called the SES
report "essentially a conservative
document." "We tried to figure
out how, without tearing the
place to pieces, we can maximize
the educational opportunities it
offers," Packer declared.

"SES quite deliberately did not
identify the addressees of our
recommendations. The consti
tutional law of the University is
not that well developed. SES
would lose whatever persuasive
power it had were it to suggest
how its recommendations should
be acted upon.
"The SES group is now inter
ested bystanders as the power
struggle goes on. We're in for a lot
of turbulence and ferment. That's
a very healthy process." He
added, "All we can do is recom
mend. You can agitate. I think
you should."
Student Body President Denis
Hayes called for a joint student
faculty vote on SES recom
mendations. He told the Forum
he was "not hung up" on the
number of students who should
vote with the Senate.
The real fear among under
graduates is that certain desirable
changes desired by the students
may be stymied within the facul
ty, he indicated.
Explains Proposals
Packer explained to the Forum
the rationale of SES recom
mendations. "Given the present
fragmented state of knowledge,
we felt the best strategy for
achieving general education would
be to force specialists to relate

their interests to broader con
cerns."
He suggested freshman tutori
als as a means of achieving this
end. "The professor would be en
couraged to say, here is what
fascinates me, and why," giving
the student a chance to see "the
mature mind at work" in a
broader context of meaning.
The tutorial program would be
open to younger professors, he
said permitting them to move for
ward in areas of knowledge which
interest them without being
forced to teach as many broad
survey courses.
Civ Proposal Opposed
Although SES has proposed a
one semester or two-quarter
sequence for Western Civ, a letter
introduced at the meeting stated
that the overwhelming majority of
Western Civ instructors favored a
one-year requirement for histori
cal studies.
A Western Civ instructor in the
audience did agree with the spirit
of SES proposals, however, by
commenting that there's no one
on the Western Civ staff who likes
teaching from a common, staff
compiled syllabus. In fact, they
like to do their own thing."
Rather than "covering 20
centuries an eighth of an inch
deep," Packer said, the SES
recommendations would permit

deeper study in a narrower field,
such as the history of science.
No Foreign Language
Responding to criticism of the
suggested abolition of a university
wide foreign language re
quirement, he said he hoped and
expected the vast majority of
students would study a foreign
language.
The upcoming report on over
seas campus programs will call for
"much greater study of the
language, literature, and culture"
of the host country, he indicated.
This will provide a carrot rather
than a stick for an incentive in
foreign language study.
He also commented on the SES
recommendation that Stanford
change to the semester system.
The main reason for the change he
explained is the "extraordinary
difficulty" of providing for an
adequate reading period under the
quarter system.
"You just barely get crankcd
up before the quarter is over and
you rush off to something else,"
he commented.
Previous checks of faculty
opinion have shown that humani
ties and the social sciences favor
the semester system, while natural
sciences and engineering feel a
quarterly calendar is better suited
to their needs, he said.
