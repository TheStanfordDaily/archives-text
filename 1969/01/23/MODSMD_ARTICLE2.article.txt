# Endorsement Reversed
## Black History Nixed As Civ Substitute 
### BARBARA HYLAND 
This spring a course on African
Civilizations, History 47, will be
offered at Stanford for the first
time. But it will not be offered as
a substitute for Western Civili
zation, History 3, as previously
thought.
The General Studies Com
mittee accepted the substitution
proposal without realizing that it
had not been accepted by the
history department itself. When
the committee discovered that the
proposal lacked the endorsement
of the history faculty, at its meet
ing of Jan. 8, it reversed its previ
ous decision and withdrew its ap
proval.
Asst. Prof, G. Wesley Johnson
of history brought the proposal to

the committee because he thought
the history department had earlier
"approved the idea in principle."
Last June 14 the history de
partment voted to accept an
undergraduate major in African
and Afro-american Studies based
on an African Civilization course.
Stanford was the first university
to set up this type of major, not
Yale as falsely publicized.
When the major was accepted,
the department approved the pro
posal to substitute African Civili
zation for one quarter of Western
Civilization as part of the general

proposal. Johnson explained that
the history department "was
aware of the proposal, but not
aware of the details."
Mistakenly interpreting the de
partment's position as support,
Johnson presented the sub
stitution proposal to the General
Studies Committee.
The committee "at first voiced
skepticism, but did respond af
firmatively," Johnson stated.
Johnson then brought the sub
stitution proposal to the history
department after its acceptance
by General Studies,

The Department "took a more
conservative view," Johnson ad
mitted, and voted down the pro
posal. He was quick to add that
the "majority of the department
is very much interested in this
course and its success." He specu
lated that the reason for the pro
posal's rejection was that Western
Civilization courses had already
been set up for this spring and the
substitution proposal "might dis
rupt" the previous plans.
When the General Studies
Committee was told the history
department had voted down the
proposal, it withdrew its previous
approval. The course will still be
offered this spring although not as
a substitute for Western Civili
zation.
The Study of Education at
Stanford (SES) has recommended
modifying the general studies
history requirement so that
Western Civilization will no longer
be mandatory.

MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING—The Stanford P.T.A. (Protestors, Troublemakers, and Anarchists) tried to
hold a free jitterbug dance last night at the Community Coffeehouse "in honor of Spiro and Dick." But
manager Richard Elmore would have none of it, and closed the coffeehouse when five couples began to
dance. PTA member Marc Heller, looking natty in an orange jump suit, commented "This is a typical
middle-class Stanford coffee house. They have a format mind, and I have a free mind."

When the General Studies
Committee was told the history
department had voted down the
proposal, it withdrew its previous
approval. The course will still be
offered this spring although not as
a substitute for Western Civili
zation.
The Study of Education at
Stanford (SES) has recommended
modifying the general studies
history requirement so that
Western Civilization will no longer
be mandatory.

MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING—The Stanford P.T.A. (Protestors, Troublemakers, and Anarchists) tried to
hold a free jitterbug dance last night at the Community Coffeehouse "in honor of Spiro and Dick." But
manager Richard Elmore would have none of it, and closed the coffeehouse when five couples began to
dance. PTA member Marc Heller, looking natty in an orange jump suit, commented "This is a typical
middle-class Stanford coffee house. They have a format mind, and I have a free mind."
This spring a course on African
Civilizations, History 47, will be
offered at Stanford for the first
time. But it will not be offered as
a substitute for Western Civili
zation, History 3, as previously
thought.
The General Studies Com
mittee accepted the substitution
proposal without realizing that it
had not been accepted by the
history department itself. When
the committee discovered that the
proposal lacked the endorsement
of the history faculty, at its meet
ing of Jan. 8, it reversed its previ
ous decision and withdrew its ap
proval.
Asst. Prof, G. Wesley Johnson
of history brought the proposal to

the committee because he thought
the history department had earlier
"approved the idea in principle."
Last June 14 the history de
partment voted to accept an
undergraduate major in African
and Afro-american Studies based
on an African Civilization course.
Stanford was the first university
to set up this type of major, not
Yale as falsely publicized.
When the major was accepted,
the department approved the pro
posal to substitute African Civili
zation for one quarter of Western
Civilization as part of the general

proposal. Johnson explained that
the history department "was
aware of the proposal, but not
aware of the details."
Mistakenly interpreting the de
partment's position as support,
Johnson presented the sub
stitution proposal to the General
Studies Committee.
The committee "at first voiced
skepticism, but did respond af
firmatively," Johnson stated.
Johnson then brought the sub
stitution proposal to the history
department after its acceptance
by General Studies,

The Department "took a more
conservative view," Johnson ad
mitted, and voted down the pro
posal. He was quick to add that
the "majority of the department
is very much interested in this
course and its success." He specu
lated that the reason for the pro
posal's rejection was that Western
Civilization courses had already
been set up for this spring and the
substitution proposal "might dis
rupt" the previous plans.
