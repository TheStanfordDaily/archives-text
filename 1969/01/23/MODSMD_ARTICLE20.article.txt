SOPH STANDOUTS-A horde of talented sophomores sparked Stan
ford's swimming team to three straight dual meet victories last week.
Bob Jamison (above) and John Ferris (below) were two of the sophs
most instrumental in the Stanford wins. Jamison shattered two
Canadian national records Thursday at Simon Fraser University, bet
tering the 50 meter freestyle mark with a 25.1 clocking, and topping
the 100 freestyle standard by leading off the 400 medley relay with a
time of 54.2. Ferris was sensational in all three meets, checking in
with a 2:01.3 IM Friday at Washington, one of the top 10 times in the
nation this year.
