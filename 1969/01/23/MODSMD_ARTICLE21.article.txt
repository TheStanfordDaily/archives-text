After three games Stanford
guard Don Griffin ranks second in
the Pacific-8 in scoring, behind
UCLA's Lew Alcindor.
Griffin has tallied 60 points in
the Tribe's three conference out
ings, for an even 20-point average.
Alcindor has buried 56 points in
two games for a 28-per-game
mark.
Junior center Bill Palmer and
senior forward Mai McElwain are
tied for eighth in the league in re
bounding, averaging 8.7 per game.
Sophomore guard Dennis
O'Neill is the best percentage
shooter on the Tribe quintet, both
from the floor and from the foul
line. O'Neill is fourth in the con
ference in free throw shooting,
with 89 per cent, and has made 60
per cent of his shots from the
field.
Teamwise, the Indians (0-3) are
not doing too well in Pac-8 statis
tics. Coach Howie Dallmar's club
is next to last in both offense and
defense. The Tribe has allowed an
average of 73.3 points per game in
league play, while scoring at only
a 63.3 clip.
Stanford is last in the circuit in
field goal percentage (38.1) and
sixth in rebounding (39.7 per
game). Things should get better.
