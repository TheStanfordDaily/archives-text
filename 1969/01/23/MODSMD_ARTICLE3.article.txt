# New Berkeley Strike Resembles SF State's
## 
### MARSHALL SCHWARTZ 
BERKELEY—It could just as well have been two weeks earlier and
15 miles to the southwest. The demands were the same, the chants were
the same—even some of the people were the same.
Only this time it was the University of California at Berkeley rather
than San Francisco State.
The Third World Liberation front and the American Federation of
Teachers both went on strike yesterday, but the only way you could
tell the scene from SF State, San Jose State, or a half-dozen other
colleges across California was by the buildings in the background.
Again the Third World students are demanding a separate curriculum
of ethnic studies under their own control, as well as more administra
tors from minority groups and large amounts of financial aid for Third
Worlders.
And again, the administration is saying, "We're going as fast as we
can."
The AFT, this time, is not a participant in the struggle. Its
walkout yesterday—which was not at all effective-was merely in
sympathy with the 28 San Jose State professors who were fired for
striking there.
They will be back at work today—but many of the minority group
students will not.
They will be out again at Telegraph Avenue, at Sather Gate, and at
Sproul Hall, shouting the war cry of SF State: "On Strike, Shut It
Down." And Chancellor Roger Heyns will continue to sound like Gov
ernor Ronald Reagan and S. I. Hayakawa: "We will keep the University
functioning as an educational institution in whatever way needed."
But the violence which generated great support for the strikers at
State was completely lacking yesterday at Cal—and the UC administra
tion intends to maintain that situation for as long as possible.
They were especially careful yesterday to avoid any possible inci
dent. At noon several hundred picketers circled in front of Sather
Gate—through which several thousand students pass each lunchtime.
They limited passage to two narrow aisles on either side of the gate.
