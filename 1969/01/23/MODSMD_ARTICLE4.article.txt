WASHINGTON (AP>-Repub
lican senators defended secretary
of the Interior-designate Walter
Hickel as "consumer oriented"
Wednesday while critics con
tended he is unfit for the job.
But it appeared virtually cer
tain the Alaskan governor will be
confirmed by a substantial margin
when his nomination is voted on
Thursday, a day after the 11 other
members of President Nixon's
Cabinet were sworn into office.
Democratic Leader Mike Mans
field obtained unanimous consent
for a vote on Hickel at 1 p.m.
Thursday. Some 10 to 20 senators
are expected to vote against the
nominee.
Action on Hickel will be fol
lowed by consideration of another
disputed Nixon nomination, that
of California industrialist David
Packard to be deputy secretary of
defense.
Sen. Albert Gore, D-Tenn., has
urged rejection, contending that
Packard has a conflict of interest
because of his $300 million of
stock in an electronics firm that
does business with the Pentagon.
• Pueblo Chief Guilty?
CORONADO, CALIF. (AP)-
The Navy told the captain of the
USS Pueblo Wednesday that he is
suspected of violating military law
when North Koreans seized the in
telligence ship. The Navy also
warned that anything he says

about certain aspects of its cap
ture could be held against him.
But Cmdr. Lloyd Bucher said
he would continue telling a court
of inquiry "full details" of the
capture, death of a crewman and
imprisonment of others. Capt.
William Newsome, counsel for the
Navy, quoted this regulation to
Bucher: "The commanding officer
shall not permit his command to
be searched by any person repre
senting a foreign state nor permit
his command to be removed from
the command by such a person, so
long as he has the power to re
sist."
Bucher had testified that the
Pueblo surrendered to North Kor
ean gunboats after being fired up
on and followed them into one of
that nation's ports without man
ning his ship's guns or otherwise
resisting. He said resistance would
have caused needless deaths from
enemy guns at point blank range.
"At the time the North Kor
eans first set foot on your ship did
you any longer have the power to
resist?" asked Bucher's civilian
attorney, Miles Harvey.
"No, I did not," Bucher re
plied.
Under questioning by New
some, the Navy attorney, Bucher
conceded that in giving up his
men he yielded some of the most
highly classified secret material on
his ship.
He said he gave priority during
the attack to, first, radioing his
situation to higher authorities
and, second, to destroying secret
equipment and documents.

Draft Case Delayed
WASHINGTON (AP>~The
Supreme Court has postponed a
decision on whether college stu
dents may be drafted for protest
ing the Vietnam war.
The major test of Selective Ser
vice policy was dismissed at the
Justice Department's request. The
case was returned to federal court
in Brooklyn, N.Y., where the
court will try to force induction
of a 25-year-old Cornell graduate
who turned in his draft card.
•Flood Disaster Relief
WASHINGTON (AP>~Three
California legislators in Washing
ton urged quick federal action if
needed to aid rain and flood
stricken parts of California.
Rep. Harold T. Johnson, D-
Calif., asked President Nixon to
declare rain-ravaged regions of the
state disaster areas.
Such a presidential proclama
tion would make the state eligible
for emergency federal assistance
in restoring flood-damaged streets
and other public facilities.
Gov. Reagan has made no such
request yet, but has declared a
"state of emergency," allowing
quick use of emergency state
funds for rain and flood relief.
•Volunteer Army Bill
WASHINGTON (AP)-A bill
abolish the draft and provide in
ducements to establish and main
tain a volunteer professional
Army was reintroduced, in revised
form, in the Senate Wednesday.
Sen. Mark O. Hatfield, R-Ore.,
principal sponsor of the measure,
called the draft system "militarily
inefficient" and "a drastic invas
ion of individual liberty." He was
joined by a bipartisan group of
eight cosponsors.
Hatfield noted that President
Nixon has supported the idea of
an all-volunteer Army. But Nixon
called for a goal of doing so after
the Vietnam war ends.
The Oregon senator said the
volunteer service system, bol
stered by pay raises of $100 a
month for enlisted personnel and
improvements in educational,
social and recreational opportuni
ties, "would provide an efficient
military force with emphasis on
quality rather than quantity."
In addition to pay raises, the
bill would provide for in-service
education for enlistees at techni

cal, vocational and college levels.
There would be increased empha
sis on officer training for men in
the ranks and reduction of time in
grade and in service for promotion
eligibility.
Another provision would accel
erate substitution of civilians for
non-combat military personnel.
Under the proposal, the draft
would end six months after its en
actment, but registration would
continue and the draft could be
reinstated by Congress in an emer
gency, upon recommendation by
the president.

Action on Hickel will be fol

Packard has a conflict of interest

• Pueblo Chief Guilty?
CORONADO, CALIF. (AP)-
The Navy told the captain of the
USS Pueblo Wednesday that he is
suspected of violating military law
when North Koreans seized the in
telligence ship. The Navy also
warned that anything he says

about certain aspects of its cap
ture could be held against him.
But Cmdr. Lloyd Bucher said
he would continue telling a court
of inquiry "full details" of the
capture, death of a crewman and
imprisonment of others. Capt.
William Newsome, counsel for the
Navy, quoted this regulation to
Bucher: "The commanding officer
shall not permit his command to
be searched by any person repre
senting a foreign state nor permit
his command to be removed from
the command by such a person, so
long as he has the power to re
sist."
Bucher had testified that the
Pueblo surrendered to North Kor
ean gunboats after being fired up
on and followed them into one of
that nation's ports without man
ning his ship's guns or otherwise
resisting. He said resistance would
have caused needless deaths from
enemy guns at point blank range.
"At the time the North Kor
eans first set foot on your ship did
you any longer have the power to
resist?" asked Bucher's civilian
attorney, Miles Harvey.
"No, I did not," Bucher re
plied.
Under questioning by New
some, the Navy attorney, Bucher
conceded that in giving up his
men he yielded some of the most
highly classified secret material on
his ship.
He said he gave priority during
the attack to, first, radioing his
situation to higher authorities
and, second, to destroying secret
equipment and documents.

Draft Case Delayed
WASHINGTON (AP>~The
Supreme Court has postponed a
decision on whether college stu
dents may be drafted for protest
ing the Vietnam war.
The major test of Selective Ser
vice policy was dismissed at the
Justice Department's request. The
case was returned to federal court
in Brooklyn, N.Y., where the
court will try to force induction
of a 25-year-old Cornell graduate
who turned in his draft card.
•Flood Disaster Relief
WASHINGTON (AP>~Three
California legislators in Washing
ton urged quick federal action if
needed to aid rain and flood
stricken parts of California.
Rep. Harold T. Johnson, D-
Calif., asked President Nixon to
declare rain-ravaged regions of the
state disaster areas.
Such a presidential proclama
tion would make the state eligible
for emergency federal assistance
in restoring flood-damaged streets
and other public facilities.
Gov. Reagan has made no such
request yet, but has declared a
"state of emergency," allowing
quick use of emergency state
funds for rain and flood relief.
•Volunteer Army Bill
WASHINGTON (AP)-A bill
abolish the draft and provide in
ducements to establish and main
tain a volunteer professional
Army was reintroduced, in revised
form, in the Senate Wednesday.
Sen. Mark O. Hatfield, R-Ore.,
principal sponsor of the measure,
called the draft system "militarily
inefficient" and "a drastic invas
ion of individual liberty." He was
joined by a bipartisan group of
eight cosponsors.
Hatfield noted that President
Nixon has supported the idea of
an all-volunteer Army. But Nixon
called for a goal of doing so after
the Vietnam war ends.
The Oregon senator said the
volunteer service system, bol
stered by pay raises of $100 a
month for enlisted personnel and
improvements in educational,
social and recreational opportuni
ties, "would provide an efficient
military force with emphasis on
quality rather than quantity."
In addition to pay raises, the
bill would provide for in-service
education for enlistees at techni

cal, vocational and college levels.
There would be increased empha
sis on officer training for men in
the ranks and reduction of time in
grade and in service for promotion
eligibility.
Another provision would accel
erate substitution of civilians for
non-combat military personnel.
Under the proposal, the draft
would end six months after its en
actment, but registration would
continue and the draft could be
reinstated by Congress in an emer
gency, upon recommendation by
the president.

• Pueblo Chief Guilty?
CORONADO, CALIF. (AP)-
The Navy told the captain of the
USS Pueblo Wednesday that he is
suspected of violating military law
when North Koreans seized the in
telligence ship. The Navy also
warned that anything he says

about certain aspects of its cap
ture could be held against him.
But Cmdr. Lloyd Bucher said
he would continue telling a court
of inquiry "full details" of the
capture, death of a crewman and
imprisonment of others. Capt.
William Newsome, counsel for the
Navy, quoted this regulation to
Bucher: "The commanding officer
shall not permit his command to
be searched by any person repre
senting a foreign state nor permit
his command to be removed from
the command by such a person, so
long as he has the power to re
sist."
Bucher had testified that the
Pueblo surrendered to North Kor
ean gunboats after being fired up
on and followed them into one of
that nation's ports without man
ning his ship's guns or otherwise
resisting. He said resistance would
have caused needless deaths from
enemy guns at point blank range.
"At the time the North Kor
eans first set foot on your ship did
you any longer have the power to
resist?" asked Bucher's civilian
attorney, Miles Harvey.
"No, I did not," Bucher re
plied.
Under questioning by New
some, the Navy attorney, Bucher
conceded that in giving up his
men he yielded some of the most
highly classified secret material on
his ship.
He said he gave priority during
the attack to, first, radioing his
situation to higher authorities
and, second, to destroying secret
equipment and documents.

Draft Case Delayed
WASHINGTON (AP>~The
Supreme Court has postponed a
decision on whether college stu
dents may be drafted for protest
ing the Vietnam war.
The major test of Selective Ser
vice policy was dismissed at the
Justice Department's request. The
case was returned to federal court
in Brooklyn, N.Y., where the
court will try to force induction
of a 25-year-old Cornell graduate
who turned in his draft card.
•Flood Disaster Relief
WASHINGTON (AP>~Three
California legislators in Washing
ton urged quick federal action if
needed to aid rain and flood
stricken parts of California.
Rep. Harold T. Johnson, D-
Calif., asked President Nixon to
declare rain-ravaged regions of the
state disaster areas.
Such a presidential proclama
tion would make the state eligible
for emergency federal assistance
in restoring flood-damaged streets
and other public facilities.
Gov. Reagan has made no such
request yet, but has declared a
"state of emergency," allowing
quick use of emergency state
funds for rain and flood relief.
•Volunteer Army Bill
WASHINGTON (AP)-A bill
abolish the draft and provide in
ducements to establish and main
tain a volunteer professional
Army was reintroduced, in revised
form, in the Senate Wednesday.
Sen. Mark O. Hatfield, R-Ore.,
principal sponsor of the measure,
called the draft system "militarily
inefficient" and "a drastic invas
ion of individual liberty." He was
joined by a bipartisan group of
eight cosponsors.
Hatfield noted that President
Nixon has supported the idea of
an all-volunteer Army. But Nixon
called for a goal of doing so after
the Vietnam war ends.
The Oregon senator said the
volunteer service system, bol
stered by pay raises of $100 a
month for enlisted personnel and
improvements in educational,
social and recreational opportuni
ties, "would provide an efficient
military force with emphasis on
quality rather than quantity."
In addition to pay raises, the
bill would provide for in-service
education for enlistees at techni

cal, vocational and college levels.
There would be increased empha
sis on officer training for men in
the ranks and reduction of time in
grade and in service for promotion
eligibility.
Another provision would accel
erate substitution of civilians for
non-combat military personnel.
Under the proposal, the draft
would end six months after its en
actment, but registration would
continue and the draft could be
reinstated by Congress in an emer
gency, upon recommendation by
the president.
WASHINGTON (AP>-Repub
lican senators defended secretary
of the Interior-designate Walter
Hickel as "consumer oriented"
Wednesday while critics con
tended he is unfit for the job.
But it appeared virtually cer
tain the Alaskan governor will be
confirmed by a substantial margin
when his nomination is voted on
Thursday, a day after the 11 other
members of President Nixon's
Cabinet were sworn into office.
Democratic Leader Mike Mans
field obtained unanimous consent
for a vote on Hickel at 1 p.m.
Thursday. Some 10 to 20 senators
are expected to vote against the
nominee.
Action on Hickel will be fol
lowed by consideration of another
disputed Nixon nomination, that
of California industrialist David
Packard to be deputy secretary of
defense.
Sen. Albert Gore, D-Tenn., has
urged rejection, contending that
Packard has a conflict of interest
because of his $300 million of
stock in an electronics firm that
does business with the Pentagon.
