WASHINGTON (AP>-Repub
lican senators defended secretary
of the Interior-designate Walter
Hickel as "consumer oriented"
Wednesday while critics con
tended he is unfit for the job.
But it appeared virtually cer
tain the Alaskan governor will be
confirmed by a substantial margin
when his nomination is voted on
Thursday, a day after the 11 other
members of President Nixon's
Cabinet were sworn into office.
Democratic Leader Mike Mans
field obtained unanimous consent
for a vote on Hickel at 1 p.m.
Thursday. Some 10 to 20 senators
are expected to vote against the
nominee.
Action on Hickel will be fol
lowed by consideration of another
disputed Nixon nomination, that
of California industrialist David
Packard to be deputy secretary of
defense.
Sen. Albert Gore, D-Tenn., has
urged rejection, contending that
Packard has a conflict of interest
because of his $300 million of
stock in an electronics firm that
does business with the Pentagon.
• Pueblo Chief Guilty?
CORONADO, CALIF. (AP)-
The Navy told the captain of the
USS Pueblo Wednesday that he is
suspected of violating military law
when North Koreans seized the in
telligence ship. The Navy also
warned that anything he says

about certain aspects of its cap
ture could be held against him.
But Cmdr. Lloyd Bucher said
he would continue telling a court
of inquiry "full details" of the
capture, death of a crewman and
imprisonment of others. Capt.
William Newsome, counsel for the
Navy, quoted this regulation to
Bucher: "The commanding officer
shall not permit his command to
be searched by any person repre
senting a foreign state nor permit
his command to be removed from
the command by such a person, so
long as he has the power to re
sist."
Bucher had testified that the
Pueblo surrendered to North Kor
ean gunboats after being fired up
on and followed them into one of
that nation's ports without man
ning his ship's guns or otherwise
resisting. He said resistance would
have caused needless deaths from
enemy guns at point blank range.
"At the time the North Kor
eans first set foot on your ship did
you any longer have the power to
resist?" asked Bucher's civilian
attorney, Miles Harvey.
"No, I did not," Bucher re
plied.
Under questioning by New
some, the Navy attorney, Bucher
conceded that in giving up his
men he yielded some of the most
highly classified secret material on
his ship.
