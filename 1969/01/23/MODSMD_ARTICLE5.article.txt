# Overseas Report Slashes Program, Asks Individual Campus Direction
## 
### MICHAEL KUHL 
The present organization of the
Stanford Overseas Campus Pro
gram and its administrative struc
ture come under direct and
slashing attack in the Study of
Education at Stanford (SES)
Study Abroad subcommittee re
port, scheduled for release to
morrow.
Proposals for autonomous indi
vidual campuses directed by five
separate "overseas campus com
mittees" would diminish the
authority which Prof. Robert
Walker, director of the Overseas
Campus Program, has held since
the inception of the program in
1956.
The committee further suggests
that the program be removed
from under the control of the
General Studies Committee,
which Walker also heads, and
placed under an assistant dean in
the office of the proposed Dean
of Undergraduate Studies.
Although the study refers to
the system "the best of any
American university," it adds that
"there are areas where we think
the program can and should be
improved."

The report urges steps "to
develop maximum flexibility in
overseas study arrangements, both
to exploit opportunities peculiar
to individual countries and to al
low great scope for innovation at
each campus."
"Like other University re
sources, the overseas campuses
cannot provide all things to all
students," the study notes.
The study offers five inter
related judgments concerning the
future direction of the overseas
program:
Faculty And Students
"Policy direction should be the
direct responsibility of faculty
and students;
"Substantially great flexibility
is needed in the program, both to
meet students' diverse needs and
to take full advantage of the vari
ous resources of the different
overseas campuses;
"To accomplish these goals,
policy direction should be de
centralized in a separate com
mittee for each campus;
"The same high academic
standards found at the home
campus should apply to the over
seas campuses;
" . . .The Program justifies a
stronger claim on University
funds; its benefits also justify
greater demands on students, both
in prior preparation and in aca
demic standards at the overseas
campuses."
The five Campus Committees

would consist of three faculty
members, appointed by the Com
mittee on Committees of the Aca
demic Senate, and two students.
The chairmen of each Campus
Committee would comprise and
coordinating committee to coordi
nate intercampus activities.
Such a move is "essential to
the future success of the overseas
program," the study insists.
Anticipating objections, the
study notes, "A few, including
Prof. Walker, oppose the proposal
on the ground that overseas study
responsibilities would be too dif
fused."
Diffuseness Offset
"Most of those with whom we
talked, however, support our
judgment that the costs of an dif
fuseness would be more than off
set by gains in program flexibility,
faculty-student responsibility, and
academic quality," the study says.
Taking note of a past student
objection, the committee pro
poses, "Academic and social regu
lations at the overseas campuses
should not differ from those at
the home campus unless there are
compelling reasons for special
rules."
Several proposals deal with
faculty selection and the compo
sition of student groups attending
the campuses.
Plums For Faculty
"Temptations to view overseas
appointments as plums for deserv
ing faculty will be minimized if
the selection process is divorced
from administration of the pro
gram, and faculty independence
will be enhanced accordingly,"
says the study.
The report suggests partici
pating faculty members "hesitate
to make proposals for change in
fear that as a result they will not
be chosen."
Calling for faculty members
with a "working knowledge of the
relevant language and some
specialized knowledge of the host
country," the study suggests a
program where each campus is "a
focus of intellectual activity."
The theme for possible pro
grams by each of five campuses is
diversity. Accordingly, the study
suggests "different programs and
conditions may well call for dif
ferent students and different
orientation programs."
Selection on the basis of grade

point average would be abolished.
Those students participating
would be selected to meet the
situation of several different sug
gested arrangements.
Individual campus committees
could experiment, with year-long
programs or work programs,
where "a small group of students
use an overseas campus as a home
base."
Some students could live off
campus while participating in the
program. The study also suggests
"inviting an exchange of students
for residential and academic pur
poses" from a nearby university.
Committee Power
Power to appoint and remove

directors and instructors would
rest with each campus committee.
The report admits dominance
of the "themes of decentralization
and faculty primacy," but also
stresses "economies in avoidable
staff travel and communications
expenses."
Currently, "there is close home
campus administrative control of
the European campuses," the re
port notes. "Daily contact is
maintained by mail and Prof.
Walker makes three or four visits
per year to each campus."
"Selection of faculty is largely
informal and is handled primarily
through Prof. Walker," the report
adds.

"CALLED TO FREEDOM"â€”A "religious happening" will happen to
morrow night at 8 in Memorial Church with Father Clarence Rivers of
the Archdiocese of Cincinnati leading the service involving drama,
dance, music and the spoken word. Entitled "Called To Freedom," the
event is part of the world-wide observance of the Week of Prayer for
Christian Unity.
The present organization of the
Stanford Overseas Campus Pro
gram and its administrative struc
ture come under direct and
slashing attack in the Study of
Education at Stanford (SES)
Study Abroad subcommittee re
port, scheduled for release to
morrow.
Proposals for autonomous indi
vidual campuses directed by five
separate "overseas campus com
mittees" would diminish the
authority which Prof. Robert
Walker, director of the Overseas
Campus Program, has held since
the inception of the program in
1956.
The committee further suggests
that the program be removed
from under the control of the
General Studies Committee,
which Walker also heads, and
placed under an assistant dean in
the office of the proposed Dean
of Undergraduate Studies.
Although the study refers to
the system "the best of any
American university," it adds that
"there are areas where we think
the program can and should be
improved."

The report urges steps "to
develop maximum flexibility in
overseas study arrangements, both
to exploit opportunities peculiar
to individual countries and to al
low great scope for innovation at
each campus."
"Like other University re
sources, the overseas campuses
cannot provide all things to all
students," the study notes.
The study offers five inter
related judgments concerning the
future direction of the overseas
program:
Faculty And Students
"Policy direction should be the
direct responsibility of faculty
and students;
"Substantially great flexibility
is needed in the program, both to
meet students' diverse needs and
to take full advantage of the vari
ous resources of the different
overseas campuses;
"To accomplish these goals,
policy direction should be de
centralized in a separate com
mittee for each campus;
"The same high academic
standards found at the home
campus should apply to the over
seas campuses;
" . . .The Program justifies a
stronger claim on University
funds; its benefits also justify
greater demands on students, both
in prior preparation and in aca
demic standards at the overseas
campuses."
The five Campus Committees

would consist of three faculty
members, appointed by the Com
mittee on Committees of the Aca
demic Senate, and two students.
The chairmen of each Campus
Committee would comprise and
coordinating committee to coordi
nate intercampus activities.
Such a move is "essential to
the future success of the overseas
program," the study insists.
Anticipating objections, the
study notes, "A few, including
Prof. Walker, oppose the proposal
on the ground that overseas study
responsibilities would be too dif
fused."
Diffuseness Offset
"Most of those with whom we
talked, however, support our
judgment that the costs of an dif
fuseness would be more than off
set by gains in program flexibility,
faculty-student responsibility, and
academic quality," the study says.
Taking note of a past student
objection, the committee pro
poses, "Academic and social regu
lations at the overseas campuses
should not differ from those at
the home campus unless there are
compelling reasons for special
rules."
Several proposals deal with
faculty selection and the compo
sition of student groups attending
the campuses.
Plums For Faculty
"Temptations to view overseas
appointments as plums for deserv
ing faculty will be minimized if
the selection process is divorced
from administration of the pro
gram, and faculty independence
will be enhanced accordingly,"
says the study.
The report suggests partici
pating faculty members "hesitate
to make proposals for change in
fear that as a result they will not
be chosen."
Calling for faculty members
with a "working knowledge of the
relevant language and some
specialized knowledge of the host
country," the study suggests a
program where each campus is "a
focus of intellectual activity."
The theme for possible pro
grams by each of five campuses is
diversity. Accordingly, the study
suggests "different programs and
conditions may well call for dif
ferent students and different
orientation programs."
Selection on the basis of grade

point average would be abolished.
Those students participating
would be selected to meet the
situation of several different sug
gested arrangements.
Individual campus committees
could experiment, with year-long
programs or work programs,
where "a small group of students
use an overseas campus as a home
base."
Some students could live off
campus while participating in the
program. The study also suggests
"inviting an exchange of students
for residential and academic pur
poses" from a nearby university.
Committee Power
Power to appoint and remove

directors and instructors would
rest with each campus committee.
The report admits dominance
of the "themes of decentralization
and faculty primacy," but also
stresses "economies in avoidable
staff travel and communications
expenses."
Currently, "there is close home
campus administrative control of
the European campuses," the re
port notes. "Daily contact is

programs or work programs,
where "a small group of students
use an overseas campus as a home
base."
Some students could live off
campus while participating in the
program. The study also suggests
"inviting an exchange of students
for residential and academic pur
poses" from a nearby university.
Committee Power
Power to appoint and remove

directors and instructors would
rest with each campus committee.
The report admits dominance
of the "themes of decentralization
and faculty primacy," but also
stresses "economies in avoidable
staff travel and communications
expenses."
Currently, "there is close home
campus administrative control of
the European campuses," the re
port notes. "Daily contact is
maintained by mail and Prof.
Walker makes three or four visits
per year to each campus."
"Selection of faculty is largely
informal and is handled primarily
through Prof. Walker," the report
adds.

"CALLED TO FREEDOM"â€”A "religious happening" will happen to
morrow night at 8 in Memorial Church with Father Clarence Rivers of
the Archdiocese of Cincinnati leading the service involving drama,
dance, music and the spoken word. Entitled "Called To Freedom," the
event is part of the world-wide observance of the Week of Prayer for
Christian Unity.
The present organization of the
Stanford Overseas Campus Pro
gram and its administrative struc
ture come under direct and
slashing attack in the Study of
Education at Stanford (SES)
Study Abroad subcommittee re
port, scheduled for release to
morrow.
Proposals for autonomous indi
vidual campuses directed by five
separate "overseas campus com
mittees" would diminish the
authority which Prof. Robert
Walker, director of the Overseas
Campus Program, has held since
the inception of the program in
1956.
The committee further suggests
that the program be removed
from under the control of the
General Studies Committee,
which Walker also heads, and
placed under an assistant dean in
the office of the proposed Dean
of Undergraduate Studies.
Although the study refers to
the system "the best of any
American university," it adds that
"there are areas where we think
the program can and should be
improved."

The report urges steps "to
develop maximum flexibility in
overseas study arrangements, both
to exploit opportunities peculiar
to individual countries and to al
low great scope for innovation at
each campus."
"Like other University re
sources, the overseas campuses
cannot provide all things to all
students," the study notes.
The study offers five inter
related judgments concerning the
future direction of the overseas
program:
Faculty And Students
"Policy direction should be the
direct responsibility of faculty
and students;
"Substantially great flexibility
is needed in the program, both to
meet students' diverse needs and
to take full advantage of the vari
ous resources of the different
overseas campuses;
"To accomplish these goals,
policy direction should be de
centralized in a separate com
mittee for each campus;
"The same high academic
standards found at the home
campus should apply to the over
seas campuses;
" . . .The Program justifies a
stronger claim on University
funds; its benefits also justify
greater demands on students, both
in prior preparation and in aca
demic standards at the overseas
campuses."
The five Campus Committees

would consist of three faculty
members, appointed by the Com
mittee on Committees of the Aca
demic Senate, and two students.
The chairmen of each Campus
Committee would comprise and
coordinating committee to coordi
nate intercampus activities.
Such a move is "essential to
the future success of the overseas
program," the study insists.
Anticipating objections, the
study notes, "A few, including
Prof. Walker, oppose the proposal
on the ground that overseas study
responsibilities would be too dif
fused."
Diffuseness Offset
"Most of those with whom we
talked, however, support our
judgment that the costs of an dif
fuseness would be more than off
set by gains in program flexibility,
faculty-student responsibility, and
academic quality," the study says.
Taking note of a past student
objection, the committee pro
poses, "Academic and social regu
lations at the overseas campuses
should not differ from those at
the home campus unless there are
compelling reasons for special
rules."
Several proposals deal with
faculty selection and the compo
sition of student groups attending
the campuses.
Plums For Faculty
"Temptations to view overseas
appointments as plums for deserv
ing faculty will be minimized if
the selection process is divorced
from administration of the pro
gram, and faculty independence
will be enhanced accordingly,"
says the study.
The report suggests partici
pating faculty members "hesitate
to make proposals for change in
fear that as a result they will not
be chosen."
Calling for faculty members
with a "working knowledge of the
relevant language and some
specialized knowledge of the host
country," the study suggests a
program where each campus is "a
focus of intellectual activity."
The theme for possible pro
grams by each of five campuses is
diversity. Accordingly, the study
suggests "different programs and
conditions may well call for dif
ferent students and different
orientation programs."
Selection on the basis of grade

point average would be abolished.
Those students participating
would be selected to meet the
situation of several different sug
gested arrangements.
Individual campus committees
could experiment, with year-long
programs or work programs,
where "a small group of students
use an overseas campus as a home
base."
Some students could live off
campus while participating in the
program. The study also suggests
