# Campus To Have US Neighbors
## 
### JAMES PERLOFF FELICITY BARRINGER 
HARLAXTON MANOR,
ENGLAND—Stanford In Britain
will have another American Uni
versity as its neighbor at Cliveden
The International University of
San Diego (lUSD).
lUSD bought the property im
mediately across the road from
Stanford's new British campus, it
was announced in the 'Times' and
the 'Guardian', Britain's two lead
ing newspapers.
The lUSD was formerly Cali
fornia Western University of San
Diego. It paid over $600,000 for
its new campus, Dropmore, the
eighteenth-century home of Lord
Kehsley.
The Daily has learned that
Stanford University will be paying
$6,000 a year for 21 years for the
privilege of using Cliveden, Lord
Astor's former home. Cliveden is
now owned by the British govern
ment.
Stanford is currently paying
$24,000 a year for the use of Har
laxton Manor. Stanford's lease at
the Manor has seven years to run,
although the administration of
Stanford-In-Britain is confident of
subleasing the palatial nineteenth
century house.
"It's the Pits"
Reactions from the students
concerning their new neighbors
was swift and violent. "It's the
pits," commented one member of
the current group in Britain. His
disgust and that of other members
of the group centered on the fact
that an American colony is grow
ing up in the beautiful country be
tween Oxford and London.
Oliver Thorold, one of the resi
dent tutors at the campus also ex
pressed dismay. "I should imagine
that fairly soon after we move to
Cliveden, baseball games between
the two campuses will start. After
that, each group will adopt a mas
cot."
The present Stanford-In-Britain
group, Britain VII, will move into
Cliveden in April of this year.
"The Guardian," in an article
about the lUSD group expressed
doubts about Stanford's current
overseas program. "There seems
to be no reason why a university
like Stanford cannot form a part
nership with a British university
so that the US students are taught
by British staff in facilities fi
nanced by the US partner."

In reply to this statement, Dr.
Robert Walker, the director of the
Stanford Overseas Program said
that the greatest barrier to putting
this idea in effect is the incompat
ibility of scheduling.
"British universities don't even
have a clean semester system,"
Walker explained. "Most foreign
students have to stay an entire
academic year."
One advantage of Stanford's
program, Walker pointed out, is
that the students who attend can
stay for no more than a quarter, if
they want, and still receive credit.
Merging this schedule with that of
a British university would be
prohibitively difficult.
Work Must Be Reviewed
Another difficulty Walker
mentioned, was that Stanford de
partments will not automatically
accept work done at a foreign uni
versity as credit toward gradua
tion. The work must be reviewed
by the student's major depart
ment. Work at one of the Stan
ford overseas campuses, however,
does automatically count toward
graduation from Stanford.

mediately across the road from
Stanford's new British campus, it
was announced in the 'Times' and
the 'Guardian', Britain's two lead
ing newspapers.
The lUSD was formerly Cali
fornia Western University of San
Diego. It paid over $600,000 for
its new campus, Dropmore, the
eighteenth-century home of Lord
Kehsley.
The Daily has learned that
Stanford University will be paying
$6,000 a year for 21 years for the
privilege of using Cliveden, Lord
Astor's former home. Cliveden is
now owned by the British govern
ment.
Stanford is currently paying
$24,000 a year for the use of Har
laxton Manor. Stanford's lease at
the Manor has seven years to run,
although the administration of
Stanford-In-Britain is confident of
subleasing the palatial nineteenth
century house.
"It's the Pits"
Reactions from the students
concerning their new neighbors
was swift and violent. "It's the
pits," commented one member of
the current group in Britain. His
disgust and that of other members
of the group centered on the fact
that an American colony is grow
ing up in the beautiful country be
tween Oxford and London.
Oliver Thorold, one of the resi
dent tutors at the campus also ex
pressed dismay. "I should imagine
that fairly soon after we move to
Cliveden, baseball games between
the two campuses will start. After
that, each group will adopt a mas
cot."
The present Stanford-In-Britain
group, Britain VII, will move into
Cliveden in April of this year.
"The Guardian," in an article
about the lUSD group expressed
doubts about Stanford's current
overseas program. "There seems
to be no reason why a university
like Stanford cannot form a part
nership with a British university
so that the US students are taught
by British staff in facilities fi
nanced by the US partner."

In reply to this statement, Dr.
Robert Walker, the director of the
Stanford Overseas Program said
that the greatest barrier to putting
this idea in effect is the incompat
ibility of scheduling.
"British universities don't even
have a clean semester system,"
Walker explained. "Most foreign
students have to stay an entire
academic year."
One advantage of Stanford's
program, Walker pointed out, is
that the students who attend can
stay for no more than a quarter, if
they want, and still receive credit.
Merging this schedule with that of
a British university would be
prohibitively difficult.
Work Must Be Reviewed
Another difficulty Walker
mentioned, was that Stanford de
partments will not automatically
accept work done at a foreign uni
versity as credit toward gradua
tion. The work must be reviewed
by the student's major depart
ment. Work at one of the Stan
ford overseas campuses, however,
does automatically count toward
graduation from Stanford.
