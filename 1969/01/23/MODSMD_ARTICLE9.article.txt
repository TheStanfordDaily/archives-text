•Big Brother Is Watching
Editor, THE DAILY:
I am pleased to inform you
( that all actions on campus are
I now under surveillance by the

only truly omnipotent and
omniscient group around: The
Committee on Retribution and
Community Control, affection
ately called Thropasa Kair, whose
first action has been to complain

to the Santa Clara County
Sheriff's Office about Virginia
Linsley's obscene letter in Mon
day's Daily. A copy of the letter
has also been sent to her parents.

•The Definition Of A Pig
Editor, THE DAILY:
There's just one thing I cannot
dig.
The definition of a PIG,
As told to us by SDS (i.e., Cary
Dictor);
It seems to me is quite a mess.
For those who look and live
and act
As PIGS seem to ignore the
fact
That they are also PIGS.

•The Liberal Rap
Editor, THE DAILY:
The liberal rap
Is a lot of crap.

•SDS Taeties
Editor, THE DAILY:
Soon the gavel of justice will
be heard and, no doubt, objectiv
ity, moderation and value free
ness will have their day. A few

SDS'ers have put themselves on
the line in their own bizarre
manner and gave the Establish
ment its big chance to prove how
truly devout it is in the pursuit of
justice and how adamant it is in
its quest to root out violence from
the human heart.
Perhaps a mistake was made in
setting them up like that. But
those who were at the Trustee
meeting had something else on
their minds which they thought
should be quite clear to anyone
who honestly considers the
matter: that the Trustees, those
splendorous and dignified princes
of the realm, should also submit
themselves to judgement insofar
as their activities are of public
concern.
It seems, however, that they
would rather let history be their
judge: but history can never give
us anything but an elaborate post
mortem on the outrages perpetra
ted by the powerful upon the
powerless.
SDS has nothing to hide: they
hate oppressors. Perhaps if they
were sensible they would discuss
this only late at night in dark
rooms. It will be interesting to see
who is going to cast the first
stone.

•Joins Condemnation
Editor, THE DAILY:
I would like to join Judith
Sloth in her condemnation of the
recent activities of the Stanford
SDS.
The inane comments by
Virginia Linsley in the same issue
provide ample evidence of the
kind of mentality which motivates
such actions.
If YOU oppose such tactics
and verbal hog-wash then say so.
Sign petitions, write The Daily, if
nothing else, stand up and
scream-BULLSHIT!

•Letter Stunk
Editor, THE DAILY:
This letter does not represent
the viewpoint of the majority, the
viewpoint of the minority nor the
viewpoint of the mediocrity, al
though the last is open to ques
tion. It is my own personal evalua
tion of Miss Virginia Linsley's
letter that appeared in this peri
odical Jan. 20, 1969. Therefore I
hope that Miss Linsley will not
use this as being representative of
the "motherfucking" group—or
any other group.
Briefly, and in the kindest
terms possible, the letter stunk. It
was a mishmash of fuzzy thinking
of the purest ray serene. Devasta
ting totally devastating in its in
congruities. I will not attempt to
argue any points with her, as I am
convinced that she was emotion
ally wrought up when she wrote
it.
However, I think her main
themes are violence and respect
and I want to say something
about these two words in a non
semantic fashion. Repeating again,
these thoughts are products of my
very own personal neural syn
apses.
It was reported that a few of
the people present at that now
famous lunch meeting were physi
cally handled. No injuries were re
ported. However, I cannot believe
that an injury has to occur in
order to label an action violent.
My interpretation of violence is
extremely limited. I hold no dis
tinction between a deliberate
shove done in an unfriendly
manner and a punch which causes
a bruise. In both cases I will

answer with a shove and/or a
punch.
Miss Linsley may not agree
with this, but I'm just a poor
human animal with no training
about semantics and no practice
in waiting two seconds to find out
what comes after the shove.
She also referred to respect or
to a lack of it. Unfortunately, I
got completely lost in this part of
the letter. She seems to refer to
losing total respect for people
who won't discuss relevant issues.
I'm assuming that Miss Linsley
leads a more or less ordered life,
with time set aside to do this and
time set aside to do the other
thing.
Business meetings, committee
meetings and the other trappings
of bureaucracy were designed to
meet the need to deal with things
in an orderly manner. Whether the
topics to be covered at a meeting
are completely worthless or
whether they have some relevance
is a value judgement that has to be
made on an individual basis.
However, .total disruption of a
meeting accomplishes precious
little in an absolute sense.
Whether my business at hand is as
trivial as getting a severe case of
beer-mug elbow or as important
(to me) as working over notes, I
do not appreciate anybody
bugging me with things that I
would rather consider under a dif
ferent set of circumstances.
A third repetition—these are
my viewpoints. A final plea—those
of you who feel as I do, or feel
differently may find it a cathartic
experience to express it to all and
sundry.

•Can 't Overlook Style
Editor, THE DAILY:
I must take issue with the edi
torial plea in The Daily urging lib
erals to "overlook" the "personal
and collective style" that charac
terizes SDS confrontations such as
the disruption of the Trustee's
meeting. It is my understanding
that for SDS members style and
conviction are inseparable—that
confrontation is viewed by SDS as
the sole effective means of bring
ing about the kinds of revolution
ary change SDS envisions.
I do not see why understanding
the convictions that motivate SDS
members should compel liberals
to overlook their tactics. Condon
ing forcible disruption of univer
sity activities when one supports a
cause, but opposing it when one
does not, makes for a very
tenuous personal value system one
which to hang ground rules for
the conduct of members of a uni
versity community.
I do not feel that the liberals of
this community can abrogate their
responsibility by being silent on
this issue, or by excusing tactics
because they understand convic
tions. (Presumably if they really
shared SDS convictions they
would have taken part in the dis
ruption.) On the contrary, when
penal sanction is brought against
the students who disobeyed uni
versity regulations and disrupted
the meeting, liberals should lend
their support to its enforcement.
