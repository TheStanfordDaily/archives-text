The lirst step is to see a Renault dealer
before you go.
Step 2 is to arrange a meeting placeâ€”a
European city, an airport or dockside Le
Havre.
The final step is the rendezvous be
tween you and your Renault.
Then, you can drive all around Europe
in a roomy 4-seater car that has 13 cu. ft. of
luggage space, 4-wheel disc brakes, cruises at
80 mph, and averages mpg.
A car that can be serviced by any one
of more than 6000 Renault dealers all over
Europe.
You can buy the Renault 10 just to use
in Europe, and we'll buy it back when you're
ready to come home. (Ask about our financed
purchase-repurchase plan.)
Or, you can buy the Renault 10, use it
in Europe and for only $1495 you'll have it
with all the required U. S. specifications.
And vou'll have a 2nd Reunion when
