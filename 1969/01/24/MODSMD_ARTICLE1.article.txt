# Architects Struggle, But Survive
## 
### BARBARA HYLAND 
In comparison to Berkeley, the
"Goliath," with 1200 architecture
students, "here we are, David,
with 5 0," Stanford Professor
Victor Thanpson noted be
musedly.
Thompson, Chairman of the
Division of Architecture, spoke
enthusiastically of his department
despite its being handicapped by a
low budget. "We've done a terrific
job on a shoestring because we've
had such good students and the
contribution of such good facul
ty."
Severe Financial Handicaps
However financial limitations
cannot be ignored. There are only
two and a half full-time professors
in the department (one is shared
by the Art Department). They are
aided by 25 city planners, archi
tects, and lawyers who work half
a day a week on an honorarium
status of $1 a day.
The Department offers only
ten undergraduate architecture
courses because "we can't afford
to teach any more," admitted
Thompson. Introductory and
General Study courses are lacking.
Thompson said there was a
"revolution" three years ago when
students came to him and com
plained about the "Introduction
to Architecture" course. They
claimed it was "too general for
architecture majors." Since then
the courses have been more tech
nical. Thompson recalled that
there has only been that one "sit
in," and that's a degree of some
sort of success," he added.
Non accreditation
Yet courses, staff, and facilities
have not met the standards es

tablished by the Association of
Collegiate Schools of Architecture
(ACSA). The department is not
nationally accredited and has
never applied for accreditation.
The ACSA bases its decision on
the quality of the library, the
teaching space, and the staff. A
minimum staff of eight full time
professors or the equivalent is re
quired for accreditation.
Thompson said that many
students interested in architecture
are deterred from coming as fresh
men to Stanford because the de
partment is not accredited. There
are presently twenty-five under
graduates majoring in this field.
In the undergraduate program,
the student spends two years
specializing in architecture for his
B.A. degree. About half the archi
tecture majors will go to schools
in the East, while the other half
will remain at Stanford for their
graduate study.
Reputation Among Graduates
He was quick to emphasize
that despite nonaccreditation,
Stanford's architecture depart
ment has "established a repu
tation that draws graduates," of
which there are 25. After two
years of graduate work they re
ceive an M.A. in Architecture.
Stanford graduate students
have a "higher than national aver
age in becoming licensed archi
tects," Thompson claimed. A
larger percentage of Stanford
graduates become licensed than
those at Berkeley, the largest
architecture school in the English
speaking world.
After completing his graduate
work, a student must take a state
examination. Thompson admitted
that "the lack of accreditation re

quires the student to spend be
tween one and two years more as
an apprentice before taking the
second half of the examination."
"The record on passing the exam
is excellent" he declared.
Practice and Theory
The view of Kathy Egger, a
graduate student, that Stanford's
nonaccreditation "doesn't make
much difference," was echoed by
her fellow students. They came to
Stanford because its program
combines practice and theory.
The program "forced upon us
by low-budget," Thompson siad,
has proved to be advantageous. In
the Internship Program, a student
works in an office and concurrent
ly takes a seminar that discusses

Today is Friday, Jan. 24, 1969, election
day at The Stanford Daily, wherein a new
editor will be chosen from among a noble
band of candidates consisting of Associate
Editor Philip Taubman and Managing Editor
Mark Weinberger. Let those on the staff
come to the office between 1 and 4 p.m.
today to cast their ballots.

the problems he encounters. The
seminars are often taught by inter
ested, city planners and architects.
Some, like Aaron Green who is
plannig the Hunters Point
project, are national figures.
Working in architects' studios
and at construction sites lends "an
atmosphere of excitement and
contact," Thompson said. Jim
Brenner, a graduate student, ex
plained that the program puts the
student "in touch with the real
world. He's not really dealing with
an ivory tower professor."
Kathy Egger, praised the pro
gram for "providing some contact
with the outside. If you just go to
school and don't work, you don't
know what's going on."

Stanford also has a Community
Planning Program that gives
students the opportunity to tackle
real problems in nearby cities.
Presently some are studying the
lower Bay front and its pollution,
while others are redeveloping
Concord in Palo Alto.
The cities request the students'
help and often pay for their
services. Thompson said that
"cities are concerned enough that
they are making a contribution to
study."
Besides the Internship and
Community Planning programs,
many students spoke of their con
tentment with the small classes
and the freedom in curriculum.
Roberto De Uriarte, a graduate,
said, "I've liked the small size
group and great freedom we have
to choose what we're interested
in. Dave Wheeler also mentioned
"the freedom to direct yourself
rather than being directed by the
department or curriculum."
Contact with professors is un
avoidable in the small class situ
ation. There are between five and
twenty students in each class.
Since many students work for the
architects who teach their classes,
they have the opportunity to
know them as teachers and em
ployers.

DRAWING ON EXPERIENCE â€”Two of Jtanford's twenty-five under
graduate architecture majors put in time at the drawing board. "We've
ione a terrific job on a shoestring because we've had such good stu
dents and the contribution of such good faculty," noted Prof. Victor
Thompson, chairman of the department.
Kathy Egger mentioned the
"small, intimate atmosphere" in
the department. Thompson said
that the department is "a little bit
unique" in this sense. Each gradu
ate has his own desk and key to
the building which gives him a
"sense of identity," according to
Thompson. He often spoke of the
strong morale among the students.
Thompson is optimistic about
the future. Presently the under
graduates study in two art studios
while the graduates work in the
Tower House. The Tower House is
an old landmark building at the
end of Escondido. Soon the
graduates and undergraduates will
be located in Building 310 which
will be the first time that both
undergraduates and graduates will
be in one building.
Thompson's plans include
putting greater emphasis on city
planning at the graduate level and
strengthening the undergraduate

courses in engine *ing. This, he
feels, would greatly improve both
graduate and undergraduate pro
grams.
'A Tragedy'
He hopes to have the archi
tecture division separate from the
Art Department. It would become
a department known as "Archi
tecture and Environmental
Design." It has only been in the
past two years that the .archi
tecture division has not had to
share its budget with the Art De
partment. The Art Department
under Professor Eitner has been
expanding rapidly, but Thompson
said, "Architecture has not been
able to grow."
The cause for this is that "no
one has felt the issue of archi
tecture at the decision-making
level." He maintained that "It's a
tragedy" because Stanford as a
landowner should focus on city
planning and urban renewal.

Victor Thanpson noted be
musedly.
Thompson, Chairman of the
Division of Architecture, spoke
enthusiastically of his department
despite its being handicapped by a
low budget. "We've done a terrific
job on a shoestring because we've
had such good students and the
contribution of such good facul
ty."
Severe Financial Handicaps
However financial limitations
cannot be ignored. There are only
two and a half full-time professors
in the department (one is shared
by the Art Department). They are
aided by 25 city planners, archi
tects, and lawyers who work half
a day a week on an honorarium
status of $1 a day.
The Department offers only
ten undergraduate architecture
courses because "we can't afford
to teach any more," admitted
Thompson. Introductory and
General Study courses are lacking.
Thompson said there was a
"revolution" three years ago when
students came to him and com
plained about the "Introduction
to Architecture" course. They
claimed it was "too general for
architecture majors." Since then
the courses have been more tech
nical. Thompson recalled that
there has only been that one "sit
in," and that's a degree of some
sort of success," he added.
Non accreditation
Yet courses, staff, and facilities
have not met the standards es

tablished by the Association of
Collegiate Schools of Architecture
(ACSA). The department is not
nationally accredited and has
never applied for accreditation.
The ACSA bases its decision on
the quality of the library, the
teaching space, and the staff. A
minimum staff of eight full time
professors or the equivalent is re
quired for accreditation.
Thompson said that many
students interested in architecture
are deterred from coming as fresh
men to Stanford because the de
partment is not accredited. There
are presently twenty-five under
graduates majoring in this field.
In the undergraduate program,
the student spends two years
specializing in architecture for his
B.A. degree. About half the archi
tecture majors will go to schools
in the East, while the other half
will remain at Stanford for their
graduate study.
Reputation Among Graduates
He was quick to emphasize
that despite nonaccreditation,
Stanford's architecture depart
ment has "established a repu
tation that draws graduates," of
which there are 25. After two
years of graduate work they re
ceive an M.A. in Architecture.
Stanford graduate students
have a "higher than national aver
age in becoming licensed archi
tects," Thompson claimed. A
larger percentage of Stanford
graduates become licensed than
those at Berkeley, the largest
architecture school in the English
speaking world.
After completing his graduate
work, a student must take a state
examination. Thompson admitted
that "the lack of accreditation re

quires the student to spend be
tween one and two years more as
an apprentice before taking the
second half of the examination."
"The record on passing the exam
is excellent" he declared.
Practice and Theory
The view of Kathy Egger, a
graduate student, that Stanford's
nonaccreditation "doesn't make
much difference," was echoed by
her fellow students. They came to
Stanford because its program
combines practice and theory.
The program "forced upon us
by low-budget," Thompson siad,
has proved to be advantageous. In

seminars are often taught by inter
ested, city planners and architects.
Some, like Aaron Green who is
plannig the Hunters Point
project, are national figures.
Working in architects' studios
and at construction sites lends "an
atmosphere of excitement and
contact," Thompson said. Jim
Brenner, a graduate student, ex
plained that the program puts the
student "in touch with the real
world. He's not really dealing with
an ivory tower professor."
Kathy Egger, praised the pro
gram for "providing some contact
with the outside. If you just go to
school and don't work, you don't
know what's going on."

Stanford also has a Community
Planning Program that gives
students the opportunity to tackle
real problems in nearby cities.
Presently some are studying the
lower Bay front and its pollution,
while others are redeveloping
Concord in Palo Alto.
The cities request the students'
help and often pay for their
services. Thompson said that
"cities are concerned enough that
they are making a contribution to
study."
Besides the Internship and
Community Planning programs,
many students spoke of their con
tentment with the small classes
and the freedom in curriculum.
Roberto De Uriarte, a graduate,
said, "I've liked the small size
group and great freedom we have
to choose what we're interested
in. Dave Wheeler also mentioned
"the freedom to direct yourself
rather than being directed by the
department or curriculum."
Contact with professors is un
avoidable in the small class situ

DRAWING ON EXPERIENCE â€”Two of Jtanford's twenty-five under
graduate architecture majors put in time at the drawing board. "We've
ione a terrific job on a shoestring because we've had such good stu
dents and the contribution of such good faculty," noted Prof. Victor
Thompson, chairman of the department.
Kathy Egger mentioned the
"small, intimate atmosphere" in
the department. Thompson said
that the department is "a little bit
unique" in this sense. Each gradu
ate has his own desk and key to
the building which gives him a
"sense of identity," according to
Thompson. He often spoke of the
strong morale among the students.
Thompson is optimistic about
the future. Presently the under
graduates study in two art studios
while the graduates work in the
Tower House. The Tower House is
an old landmark building at the
end of Escondido. Soon the
graduates and undergraduates will
be located in Building 310 which
will be the first time that both
undergraduates and graduates will
be in one building.
Thompson's plans include
putting greater emphasis on city
planning at the graduate level and
strengthening the undergraduate

courses in engine *ing. This, he
feels, would greatly improve both
graduate and undergraduate pro
grams.
'A Tragedy'
He hopes to have the archi
tecture division separate from the
Art Department. It would become
a department known as "Archi
tecture and Environmental
Design." It has only been in the
past two years that the .archi
tecture division has not had to
share its budget with the Art De
partment. The Art Department
under Professor Eitner has been
expanding rapidly, but Thompson
said, "Architecture has not been
able to grow."
The cause for this is that "no
one has felt the issue of archi
tecture at the decision-making
level." He maintained that "It's a
tragedy" because Stanford as a
landowner should focus on city
planning and urban renewal.

low budget. "We've done a terrific
job on a shoestring because we've
had such good students and the
contribution of such good facul
ty."
Severe Financial Handicaps
However financial limitations
cannot be ignored. There are only
two and a half full-time professors
in the department (one is shared
by the Art Department). They are
aided by 25 city planners, archi
tects, and lawyers who work half
a day a week on an honorarium
status of $1 a day.
The Department offers only
ten undergraduate architecture
courses because "we can't afford
to teach any more," admitted
Thompson. Introductory and
General Study courses are lacking.
Thompson said there was a
"revolution" three years ago when
students came to him and com
plained about the "Introduction
to Architecture" course. They
claimed it was "too general for
architecture majors." Since then
the courses have been more tech
nical. Thompson recalled that
there has only been that one "sit
in," and that's a degree of some
sort of success," he added.
Non accreditation
Yet courses, staff, and facilities
have not met the standards es

tablished by the Association of
Collegiate Schools of Architecture
(ACSA). The department is not
nationally accredited and has
never applied for accreditation.
The ACSA bases its decision on
the quality of the library, the
teaching space, and the staff. A
minimum staff of eight full time
professors or the equivalent is re
quired for accreditation.
Thompson said that many
students interested in architecture
are deterred from coming as fresh
men to Stanford because the de
partment is not accredited. There
are presently twenty-five under
graduates majoring in this field.
In the undergraduate program,
the student spends two years
specializing in architecture for his
B.A. degree. About half the archi
tecture majors will go to schools
in the East, while the other half
will remain at Stanford for their
graduate study.
Reputation Among Graduates
He was quick to emphasize
that despite nonaccreditation,
Stanford's architecture depart
ment has "established a repu
tation that draws graduates," of
which there are 25. After two
years of graduate work they re
ceive an M.A. in Architecture.
Stanford graduate students
have a "higher than national aver
age in becoming licensed archi
tects," Thompson claimed. A
larger percentage of Stanford
graduates become licensed than
those at Berkeley, the largest
architecture school in the English
speaking world.
After completing his graduate
work, a student must take a state
examination. Thompson admitted
that "the lack of accreditation re

quires the student to spend be
tween one and two years more as
an apprentice before taking the
second half of the examination."
"The record on passing the exam
is excellent" he declared.
Practice and Theory
The view of Kathy Egger, a
graduate student, that Stanford's
nonaccreditation "doesn't make
much difference," was echoed by
her fellow students. They came to
Stanford because its program
combines practice and theory.
The program "forced upon us

has proved to be advantageous. In

seminars are often taught by inter

Some, like Aaron Green who is
plannig the Hunters Point
project, are national figures.
Working in architects' studios
and at construction sites lends "an
atmosphere of excitement and
contact," Thompson said. Jim
Brenner, a graduate student, ex
plained that the program puts the
student "in touch with the real
world. He's not really dealing with
an ivory tower professor."
Kathy Egger, praised the pro
gram for "providing some contact
with the outside. If you just go to
school and don't work, you don't
know what's going on."

Stanford also has a Community
Planning Program that gives
students the opportunity to tackle
real problems in nearby cities.
Presently some are studying the
lower Bay front and its pollution,
while others are redeveloping
Concord in Palo Alto.
The cities request the students'
help and often pay for their
services. Thompson said that
"cities are concerned enough that
they are making a contribution to
study."
Besides the Internship and
Community Planning programs,
many students spoke of their con
tentment with the small classes
and the freedom in curriculum.
Roberto De Uriarte, a graduate,
said, "I've liked the small size
group and great freedom we have
to choose what we're interested
in. Dave Wheeler also mentioned
"the freedom to direct yourself

DRAWING ON EXPERIENCE â€”Two of Jtanford's twenty-five under
graduate architecture majors put in time at the drawing board. "We've
ione a terrific job on a shoestring because we've had such good stu
dents and the contribution of such good faculty," noted Prof. Victor
Thompson, chairman of the department.
Kathy Egger mentioned the
"small, intimate atmosphere" in
the department. Thompson said
that the department is "a little bit
unique" in this sense. Each gradu
ate has his own desk and key to
the building which gives him a
"sense of identity," according to
Thompson. He often spoke of the
strong morale among the students.
Thompson is optimistic about
the future. Presently the under
graduates study in two art studios
while the graduates work in the
Tower House. The Tower House is
an old landmark building at the
end of Escondido. Soon the
graduates and undergraduates will
be located in Building 310 which
will be the first time that both
undergraduates and graduates will
be in one building.
Thompson's plans include
putting greater emphasis on city
planning at the graduate level and
strengthening the undergraduate

courses in engine *ing. This, he
feels, would greatly improve both
graduate and undergraduate pro
grams.
'A Tragedy'
He hopes to have the archi
tecture division separate from the
Art Department. It would become
a department known as "Archi
tecture and Environmental
Design." It has only been in the
past two years that the .archi
tecture division has not had to
share its budget with the Art De
partment. The Art Department
under Professor Eitner has been
expanding rapidly, but Thompson
said, "Architecture has not been
able to grow."
The cause for this is that "no
one has felt the issue of archi
tecture at the decision-making
level." He maintained that "It's a
tragedy" because Stanford as a
landowner should focus on city
planning and urban renewal.
In comparison to Berkeley, the
"Goliath," with 1200 architecture
students, "here we are, David,
with 5 0," Stanford Professor
Victor Thanpson noted be
musedly.

Severe Financial Handicaps
However financial limitations
cannot be ignored. There are only
two and a half full-time professors
in the department (one is shared
by the Art Department). They are
aided by 25 city planners, archi
tects, and lawyers who work half
a day a week on an honorarium
status of $1 a day.
The Department offers only
ten undergraduate architecture
courses because "we can't afford
to teach any more," admitted
Thompson. Introductory and
General Study courses are lacking.
Thompson said there was a
"revolution" three years ago when
students came to him and com
plained about the "Introduction
to Architecture" course. They
claimed it was "too general for
architecture majors." Since then
the courses have been more tech
nical. Thompson recalled that
there has only been that one "sit
in," and that's a degree of some
sort of success," he added.
Non accreditation
Yet courses, staff, and facilities
have not met the standards es

tablished by the Association of
Collegiate Schools of Architecture
(ACSA). The department is not
nationally accredited and has
never applied for accreditation.
The ACSA bases its decision on
the quality of the library, the
teaching space, and the staff. A
minimum staff of eight full time
professors or the equivalent is re
quired for accreditation.
Thompson said that many
students interested in architecture
are deterred from coming as fresh
men to Stanford because the de
partment is not accredited. There
are presently twenty-five under
graduates majoring in this field.
In the undergraduate program,
the student spends two years
specializing in architecture for his
B.A. degree. About half the archi
tecture majors will go to schools
in the East, while the other half
will remain at Stanford for their
graduate study.
Reputation Among Graduates
He was quick to emphasize
that despite nonaccreditation,
Stanford's architecture depart
ment has "established a repu
tation that draws graduates," of
which there are 25. After two
years of graduate work they re
ceive an M.A. in Architecture.
Stanford graduate students
have a "higher than national aver
age in becoming licensed archi
tects," Thompson claimed. A
larger percentage of Stanford
graduates become licensed than
those at Berkeley, the largest
architecture school in the English
speaking world.
After completing his graduate
work, a student must take a state
examination. Thompson admitted
that "the lack of accreditation re

quires the student to spend be
tween one and two years more as
an apprentice before taking the
second half of the examination."
"The record on passing the exam
is excellent" he declared.
Practice and Theory
The view of Kathy Egger, a
graduate student, that Stanford's
nonaccreditation "doesn't make
much difference," was echoed by
her fellow students. They came to
Stanford because its program
combines practice and theory.
The program "forced upon us
by low-budget," Thompson siad,
has proved to be advantageous. In
the Internship Program, a student
works in an office and concurrent
ly takes a seminar that discusses

Today is Friday, Jan. 24, 1969, election
day at The Stanford Daily, wherein a new
editor will be chosen from among a noble
band of candidates consisting of Associate

Mark Weinberger. Let those on the staff
come to the office between 1 and 4 p.m.
today to cast their ballots.

the problems he encounters. The
seminars are often taught by inter
ested, city planners and architects.
Some, like Aaron Green who is
plannig the Hunters Point
project, are national figures.
Working in architects' studios
and at construction sites lends "an
atmosphere of excitement and
contact," Thompson said. Jim
Brenner, a graduate student, ex
plained that the program puts the
student "in touch with the real
world. He's not really dealing with
an ivory tower professor."
Kathy Egger, praised the pro
gram for "providing some contact
with the outside. If you just go to
school and don't work, you don't
know what's going on."

Stanford also has a Community
Planning Program that gives
students the opportunity to tackle
real problems in nearby cities.
Presently some are studying the
lower Bay front and its pollution,
while others are redeveloping
Concord in Palo Alto.
The cities request the students'
help and often pay for their
services. Thompson said that
"cities are concerned enough that
they are making a contribution to
study."
Besides the Internship and
Community Planning programs,
many students spoke of their con
tentment with the small classes
and the freedom in curriculum.
Roberto De Uriarte, a graduate,
said, "I've liked the small size
group and great freedom we have
to choose what we're interested
in. Dave Wheeler also mentioned
"the freedom to direct yourself
rather than being directed by the
department or curriculum."
Contact with professors is un
avoidable in the small class situ
ation. There are between five and
twenty students in each class.
Since many students work for the
architects who teach their classes,
they have the opportunity to
know them as teachers and em
ployers.

DRAWING ON EXPERIENCE â€”Two of Jtanford's twenty-five under
graduate architecture majors put in time at the drawing board. "We've
ione a terrific job on a shoestring because we've had such good stu
dents and the contribution of such good faculty," noted Prof. Victor
Thompson, chairman of the department.
Kathy Egger mentioned the
"small, intimate atmosphere" in
the department. Thompson said
that the department is "a little bit
unique" in this sense. Each gradu
ate has his own desk and key to
the building which gives him a
"sense of identity," according to
Thompson. He often spoke of the
strong morale among the students.
Thompson is optimistic about
the future. Presently the under
graduates study in two art studios
while the graduates work in the
Tower House. The Tower House is
an old landmark building at the
end of Escondido. Soon the
graduates and undergraduates will
be located in Building 310 which
will be the first time that both
undergraduates and graduates will
be in one building.
Thompson's plans include
putting greater emphasis on city
planning at the graduate level and
strengthening the undergraduate

courses in engine *ing. This, he
feels, would greatly improve both
graduate and undergraduate pro
grams.
'A Tragedy'
He hopes to have the archi
tecture division separate from the
Art Department. It would become
a department known as "Archi
tecture and Environmental
Design." It has only been in the
past two years that the .archi
tecture division has not had to
share its budget with the Art De
partment. The Art Department
under Professor Eitner has been
expanding rapidly, but Thompson
said, "Architecture has not been
able to grow."
The cause for this is that "no
one has felt the issue of archi
tecture at the decision-making
level." He maintained that "It's a
tragedy" because Stanford as a
landowner should focus on city
planning and urban renewal.
In comparison to Berkeley, the
"Goliath," with 1200 architecture
students, "here we are, David,
with 5 0," Stanford Professor
Victor Thanpson noted be
musedly.
Thompson, Chairman of the
Division of Architecture, spoke
enthusiastically of his department
despite its being handicapped by a
low budget. "We've done a terrific
job on a shoestring because we've
had such good students and the
contribution of such good facul
ty."
