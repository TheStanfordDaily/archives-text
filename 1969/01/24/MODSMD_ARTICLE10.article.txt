# A 						Small Conspiracy
## What Of Self-Determination Now? 
### JEFFREY BLUM 
The modern University pays lip
service to the idea of self
determination—that a person
should be able to decide for him
self what he wants to do—but ig
nores it in practice.
Instead the University channels
students toward occupations
deemed necessary by those who
control the society. Universities,
and Stanford in particular, choose
not to criticize seriously the es
tablished institutions of society.
Preferring comfortable funding to
humanitarian ideals, the Uni
versity serves the technical needs
of these institutions and ulti
mately their manpower needs, at
the expense of students' chances
for self-determination.
To the sincerely committed
student interested in expanding
human freedom and promoting
humanitarian social change, the
University must appear as a
bastion of malevolence. While it
may tolerate or even support
token reforms in society, it
stau-nchly opposes any major
change by supporting with men
and materials the very institutions
that would have to be replaced or
at least stripped of their power for
meaningful change to come about.
Destruction Of The University
The student who ponders the
University's role in society and
holds to his humanitarian ideals
faces a dilemma. He can rightfully
will that the University be de
stroyed by having its governing
hierarchy overthrown. Blatant
hypocrisy such as occurs in the
University which designs weapons
to be used in Vietnam while most
of its students and faculty oppose
the Vietnam war intensifies the
urge for destruction. But, what
will follow destruction is an open
question. Whether it will be a new
University dedicated to improving
society and maximizing freedom
or brutal repression and universal
military training is uncertain. We
can anxiously watch the situation
at SF State for indications.
Alternatives to destruction
consist of passively accepting the
University with all its injustices, as
opposed to singling out especially
obnoxious features and combat
ting them with rallies in White
Plaza and sporatic demonstrations
of militancy. The first route is
clearly a cop-out; the second has
been ineffective so far. Students
who have both conscience and

awareness must feel tremendous
frustration over what goes on at
Stanford. Those who feel only
apathy or antagonism toward radi
cals have not perhaps spent
enough time listening to what the
radicals are saying.
Irony
In the context of a University
which opposes meaningful social
change and student self
determination, outcries against
radical protest such as, "We don't
want our education interfered
with," are ironic. Such haters of
"interference" are like cows on a
conveyor belt leading to the
slaughter, who, because they have
never thought that there were any
other possible futures for them
selves, complain bitterly when the
conveyor belt is slowed for a
moment. One can pity them, hate
them, or try to enlighten them.

Reacting against these
students, though, accomplishes
nothing; trying to convince them
is difficult and usually ends in
failure.
Analyze
I can make only one recom
mendation without qualification:
that students analyze, ponder, and
try to understand how the Uni
versity functions both in society
and for them as students,
Consciousness, while it is often
painful, affords the only hope for
improving conditions. When
enough students become aware of
their situation, perhaps it will
change.
In the meantime, individuals
should try to maximize self
determination for themselves.
Awareness of the repressive
functions of grading might pro

vide some liberation from the
tedious academic grind. Students
who know the University's limi
tations can search elsewhere for
personal alternatives.

And there's always pot, liquor,
and sex whose worth has been
diminished, but not negated, by
the oppressive nature of the Uni
versity.
