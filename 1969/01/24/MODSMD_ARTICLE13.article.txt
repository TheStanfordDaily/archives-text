# Freshmen On Vacation
## Going Home Can Be A Shock 
### FELICITY BARRINGER 
Freshmen are often told before
they leave for college that they
are about to experience something
new, different and exciting. What
they are seldom told is the nov
elty of the experience of going
home for vacation.Something has
usually changed when they come
back for their first long vacation.
Freshmen occasionally find
themselves celebrities when they
return. They are beseiged by older
relatives, parents' friends, neigh
bors, old teachers and younger
friends who all want to know how
they like college.
But this is the most innocuous
of the questions. Sometimes they
are more pointed. "I found myself
suddenly responsible for every
thing college students all over the
country were doing", said one
freshman. Even the friendliest of
relatives want to know how wide
spread the 'drug problem' is on
campus, how the revolutionary
movement is organized, and
"What is it about these co-ed
dorms? The freshman has to be
an expert on the problems of
youth of today.
Communication Problems
Often the freshman finds that
his parents and he are not com
municating as well as they had
before the autumn quarter. "I'd
keep using campus slang and for
get that they didn't know what
Mem Chu was." The language the
student uses is not his greatest
problem, however. Perhaps his

ideas have changed more than he
realizes until he talks to someone
who's ideas have not been chang
ing.
Some students who had had
trouble talking to their parents
before they left, found that the
lines of communication had
broken down almost entirely. But
this is not always the case. "It was
easier to talk to my parents. They
wanted to find out what I thought
about things." Occasionally par
ents start bringing back their own
college stories, as the freshman
tells them about his.
"I had to be careful"
"I had to be really careful that
I didn't let them think I had
changed," one freshman re
marked. "I had to watch the little
things I did, the way I dressed, the
way I acted." Another found that
"I had to keep reassuring my par
ents that I was still a member of
the family. Not in words, but by
how I acted."
What is even more of a shock
to many freshmen than the reac
tions of their elders to their new
status, is the distance that has
grown between them and their
high school friends. Beyond the
superficial questions of "How're
you doing?", "Work's pretty hard,
isn't it?" and perhaps "It's differ
ent, isn't it?" there is not really
that much to say.
You have grown up with these
friends, you've only been away
for three months, yet the amount
that happens in those three

months has put you at a consider
able distance from one another.
The freshman does not go
home at Christmas to a hostile
world. On the contrary, if any
thing people are more friendly.
But, "I wondered if their friend
liness and interest were really
real," commented one freshman.
"Here was everybody I knew, all
asking the same questions and
getting the same answers from me
as they got from everybody else
and not seeming to mind." The
pleasantries of "How is it?"
"Fine." and "Hard, isn't it?"
"Yeah." become frightening in
their regularity.
"Unreality"
During Christmas vacation,
freshmen also have their first op
portunity to look at the university
from the outside world. "I saw
the unreality in the university
once I got away from it," a fresh
man said.
The difference between life at
home and life at college can be so
great that students wonder which
one is real. After a certain amount
of time at college, it very easily
becomes the center of life. Espec
ially when the university is set off
from the community, as Stanford
is, the problem of readjusting to
'civilian life' for the first time is
considerable.
When a freshman goes off to
college for the first time, he
knows at least in part what to ex
pect. The shock of going home,
readjusting to the people and the
life there, is not as well-cushioned
It is not very surprising that
some freshmen seem anxious to
get back to school, to the people
who know about the changes you
have made, to the people you
don't have to adjust to, and who
don't have to adjust to you.
Vacation can turn out to be a
prolonged reunion. It's nice seeing
people, but you don't have any
thing to say to them. Perhaps
that's why many freshmen felt as
if they were coming home after
vacation, not going back to
school.

are more pointed. "I found myself
suddenly responsible for every
thing college students all over the
country were doing", said one
freshman. Even the friendliest of
relatives want to know how wide
spread the 'drug problem' is on
campus, how the revolutionary
movement is organized, and
"What is it about these co-ed
dorms? The freshman has to be
an expert on the problems of
youth of today.
Communication Problems
Often the freshman finds that
his parents and he are not com
municating as well as they had
before the autumn quarter. "I'd
keep using campus slang and for
get that they didn't know what
Mem Chu was." The language the
student uses is not his greatest
problem, however. Perhaps his

ideas have changed more than he
realizes until he talks to someone
who's ideas have not been chang
ing.
Some students who had had
trouble talking to their parents
before they left, found that the
lines of communication had
broken down almost entirely. But
this is not always the case. "It was
easier to talk to my parents. They
wanted to find out what I thought
about things." Occasionally par
ents start bringing back their own
college stories, as the freshman
tells them about his.
"I had to be careful"
"I had to be really careful that
I didn't let them think I had
changed," one freshman re
marked. "I had to watch the little
things I did, the way I dressed, the
way I acted." Another found that
"I had to keep reassuring my par
ents that I was still a member of
the family. Not in words, but by
how I acted."
What is even more of a shock
to many freshmen than the reac
tions of their elders to their new
status, is the distance that has
grown between them and their
high school friends. Beyond the
superficial questions of "How're
you doing?", "Work's pretty hard,
isn't it?" and perhaps "It's differ
ent, isn't it?" there is not really
that much to say.
You have grown up with these
friends, you've only been away
for three months, yet the amount
that happens in those three

months has put you at a consider
able distance from one another.
The freshman does not go
home at Christmas to a hostile
world. On the contrary, if any
thing people are more friendly.
But, "I wondered if their friend
liness and interest were really
real," commented one freshman.
"Here was everybody I knew, all
asking the same questions and
getting the same answers from me
as they got from everybody else
and not seeming to mind." The
pleasantries of "How is it?"
"Fine." and "Hard, isn't it?"
"Yeah." become frightening in
their regularity.
"Unreality"
During Christmas vacation,
freshmen also have their first op
portunity to look at the university
from the outside world. "I saw
the unreality in the university
once I got away from it," a fresh
man said.
The difference between life at
home and life at college can be so
great that students wonder which
one is real. After a certain amount
of time at college, it very easily
becomes the center of life. Espec
ially when the university is set off
from the community, as Stanford
is, the problem of readjusting to
'civilian life' for the first time is
considerable.
When a freshman goes off to
college for the first time, he
knows at least in part what to ex
pect. The shock of going home,
readjusting to the people and the
life there, is not as well-cushioned
It is not very surprising that
some freshmen seem anxious to
get back to school, to the people
who know about the changes you
have made, to the people you
don't have to adjust to, and who
don't have to adjust to you.
Vacation can turn out to be a
prolonged reunion. It's nice seeing
people, but you don't have any
thing to say to them. Perhaps
that's why many freshmen felt as
if they were coming home after
vacation, not going back to
school.

get that they didn't know what
Mem Chu was." The language the
student uses is not his greatest
problem, however. Perhaps his

ideas have changed more than he
realizes until he talks to someone
who's ideas have not been chang
ing.
Some students who had had
trouble talking to their parents
before they left, found that the
lines of communication had
broken down almost entirely. But
this is not always the case. "It was
easier to talk to my parents. They
wanted to find out what I thought
about things." Occasionally par
ents start bringing back their own
college stories, as the freshman
tells them about his.
"I had to be careful"
"I had to be really careful that
I didn't let them think I had
changed," one freshman re
marked. "I had to watch the little
things I did, the way I dressed, the
way I acted." Another found that
"I had to keep reassuring my par
ents that I was still a member of
the family. Not in words, but by
how I acted."
What is even more of a shock
to many freshmen than the reac
tions of their elders to their new
status, is the distance that has
grown between them and their
high school friends. Beyond the
superficial questions of "How're
you doing?", "Work's pretty hard,
isn't it?" and perhaps "It's differ
ent, isn't it?" there is not really
that much to say.
You have grown up with these
friends, you've only been away
for three months, yet the amount
that happens in those three

months has put you at a consider
able distance from one another.
The freshman does not go
home at Christmas to a hostile
world. On the contrary, if any
thing people are more friendly.
But, "I wondered if their friend
liness and interest were really
real," commented one freshman.
"Here was everybody I knew, all
asking the same questions and
getting the same answers from me
as they got from everybody else
and not seeming to mind." The
pleasantries of "How is it?"
"Fine." and "Hard, isn't it?"
"Yeah." become frightening in
their regularity.
"Unreality"
During Christmas vacation,
freshmen also have their first op
portunity to look at the university
from the outside world. "I saw
the unreality in the university
once I got away from it," a fresh
man said.
The difference between life at
home and life at college can be so
great that students wonder which
one is real. After a certain amount
of time at college, it very easily
becomes the center of life. Espec
ially when the university is set off
from the community, as Stanford
is, the problem of readjusting to
'civilian life' for the first time is
considerable.
When a freshman goes off to
college for the first time, he
knows at least in part what to ex
pect. The shock of going home,
readjusting to the people and the
life there, is not as well-cushioned
It is not very surprising that
some freshmen seem anxious to
get back to school, to the people
who know about the changes you
have made, to the people you
don't have to adjust to, and who
don't have to adjust to you.
Vacation can turn out to be a
prolonged reunion. It's nice seeing
people, but you don't have any
thing to say to them. Perhaps
that's why many freshmen felt as
if they were coming home after
vacation, not going back to
school.

Freshmen are often told before
they leave for college that they
are about to experience something
new, different and exciting. What
they are seldom told is the nov
elty of the experience of going
home for vacation.Something has
usually changed when they come
back for their first long vacation.
Freshmen occasionally find
themselves celebrities when they
return. They are beseiged by older
relatives, parents' friends, neigh
bors, old teachers and younger
friends who all want to know how
they like college.
But this is the most innocuous
of the questions. Sometimes they
are more pointed. "I found myself
suddenly responsible for every
thing college students all over the
country were doing", said one
freshman. Even the friendliest of
relatives want to know how wide
spread the 'drug problem' is on
campus, how the revolutionary
movement is organized, and
"What is it about these co-ed
dorms? The freshman has to be
an expert on the problems of
youth of today.
Communication Problems
Often the freshman finds that
his parents and he are not com
municating as well as they had
before the autumn quarter. "I'd
keep using campus slang and for
get that they didn't know what
Mem Chu was." The language the
student uses is not his greatest
problem, however. Perhaps his

ideas have changed more than he
