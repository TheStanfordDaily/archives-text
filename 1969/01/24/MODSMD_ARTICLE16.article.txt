# Total Music Show Tonight
## 
### 
An experimental symphony of
lights, music, projections and
sounds from nature will be per

formed tonight at San Francisco's
Grace Cathedral as part of their
continuing concert series.
Called "Four Thousand
Years," the "sensorium" was com
missioned by the Cathedral; its
composers and participants are
anonymous.
Most of the instruments to be
used are new to the symphony
form: tapes, tape recorders, elec
tric guitars, and lasers. Projections
of scenes from nature and other
light effects will follow the cycles
of birth and death. The organ of
the Cathedral will play a duet
with a rock band as various pro
cessions of light and dance move
in complement to the architec
tural structure of the Cathedral.
Writers, poets, dancers, singers
and musicians, some from the
Stanford community, have joined
together to produce this perfor
mance, which will be given only
once, tonight at 8:30.
