# Favorites Role
## Tribe Set For USF 
### FRED MANN 
For the first time in weeks,
Stanford will go into a basketball
game as the favorite to win. They
will not be much of a favorite, but
they will be, nevertheless, a favor
ite.
The Tribe faces the University
of San Francisco tonight in Ros
coe Maples Pavilion. Tip off is at
8:00 p.m.
It is the first trip for USF to
the new basketball home of the
Indians, but far from their first
encounter with Stanford. The riv
alry dates back to 1914, with the
Cards leading commandingly in
the series, 36-13.
USF, a perennial power on the
court ever since the Bill Russell,
NCAA championship days' is
having its troubles this season.
The Dons are 5-7 thus far, and are
playing below their potential.
Picked as a threat to mighty Santa
Clara for league honors, the team
has not been able to put it all to
gether so far, and is hardly a chal
langer anymore.
The Dons are led by 6-9 center
Pete Cross, a tough rebounder
with a good shooting eye. Cross
figures to give Stanford's Bill
Palmer a hard time tonight at
both ends of the court.
Palmer, perhaps the hardest
worker on the Indian squad, was
somewhat stymied by California's
Bob Presley in the Tribe's 73-65

loss to the Bears last week. If
Palmer can move the ball inside
against Cross, Coach Howie Dal
lmar's offense should prove to be
more potent than usual.
Last weekend, USF was up
ended by San Jose State, 71-58,
and also stopped by U.C. Santa
Barbara, 62-59.
If last week's games provide
any psychological advantages, the
edge must go to Stanford.
The Indians went against the
Bears at Berkeley as large under
dogs, and nearly pulled off a huge
upset. They gave Cal a real scare
in Harmon Gym before falling in
the closing moments.

The Tribe had three opportun
ities to take the lead within the
last minute of play but missed on
two layups and also failed to con
nect on a one and one situation at
the free throw line.
Five of the Stanford losses this
season have seen the Cards within
two points of their opponents in
the last minute of play without
once being able to salvage a vic
tory.
Bill HaJligan will open at the
forward spot again with Mai
McElwain holding down the other
corner. Don Griffin, the team high
scorer and Dennis O'Neill will
patrol the backcourt.


LITTLE MAN MOVES IN—6-2 Dennis O'Neill drives the lane for a
layup in action in the Roscoe Maples Pavilion. O'Neill, with the top
shooting percentage on the club, will lead the Tribe against the Dons
of USF tonight at 8:00 p.m.

The Tribe faces the University
of San Francisco tonight in Ros
coe Maples Pavilion. Tip off is at
8:00 p.m.
It is the first trip for USF to
the new basketball home of the
Indians, but far from their first
encounter with Stanford. The riv
alry dates back to 1914, with the
Cards leading commandingly in
the series, 36-13.
USF, a perennial power on the
court ever since the Bill Russell,
NCAA championship days' is
having its troubles this season.
The Dons are 5-7 thus far, and are
playing below their potential.
Picked as a threat to mighty Santa
Clara for league honors, the team
has not been able to put it all to
gether so far, and is hardly a chal
langer anymore.
The Dons are led by 6-9 center
Pete Cross, a tough rebounder
with a good shooting eye. Cross
figures to give Stanford's Bill
Palmer a hard time tonight at
both ends of the court.
Palmer, perhaps the hardest
worker on the Indian squad, was
somewhat stymied by California's
Bob Presley in the Tribe's 73-65

loss to the Bears last week. If
Palmer can move the ball inside
against Cross, Coach Howie Dal
lmar's offense should prove to be
more potent than usual.
Last weekend, USF was up
ended by San Jose State, 71-58,
and also stopped by U.C. Santa
Barbara, 62-59.
If last week's games provide
any psychological advantages, the
edge must go to Stanford.
The Indians went against the
Bears at Berkeley as large under
dogs, and nearly pulled off a huge
upset. They gave Cal a real scare
in Harmon Gym before falling in
the closing moments.

The Tribe had three opportun
ities to take the lead within the
last minute of play but missed on
two layups and also failed to con
nect on a one and one situation at
the free throw line.
Five of the Stanford losses this
season have seen the Cards within
two points of their opponents in
the last minute of play without
once being able to salvage a vic
tory.
Bill HaJligan will open at the
forward spot again with Mai
McElwain holding down the other
corner. Don Griffin, the team high
scorer and Dennis O'Neill will
patrol the backcourt.


LITTLE MAN MOVES IN—6-2 Dennis O'Neill drives the lane for a
layup in action in the Roscoe Maples Pavilion. O'Neill, with the top
shooting percentage on the club, will lead the Tribe against the Dons
of USF tonight at 8:00 p.m.
For the first time in weeks,
Stanford will go into a basketball
game as the favorite to win. They
will not be much of a favorite, but
they will be, nevertheless, a favor
ite.
