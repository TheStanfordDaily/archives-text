# Panel Agrees
## TA's Benefit University 
### KIM THORBURN 
"Teaching assistantships are
beneficial to both graduate stu
dents and the University" main
tained physics Prof. Walter Meyer
hof yesterday at a panel discus
sion on "The Role of the Gradu
ate Student in Teaching at
Stanford."
Meyerhof said that TA's are
forced to learn the subject matter
of their specialized fields more
thoroughly when forced to return
to the books to answer questions
raised by their students. The Uni
versity benefits from the TA pro
gram, he continued, because its
teaching obligation may be in part
fulfilled by grad students.
Other members of the panel in
cluded Vice Provost E. Howard
Brooks, English TA Frank Cady,
and Andrew Moss of the Stanford
American Federation of Teachers
(AFT). Dick Miles, graduate stu
dent in Electrical Engineering, was
moderator. About twenty-five
graduates representing various de
partments were present.
Help Undergrads
Cady pointed out that the TA
program in the English Depart
ment also benefits the undergrad
uate. It is easier for the TA to
develop a one-to-one relationship
with his students because he is
younger and, more important,
because he too, is still learning.
As a result of the Study of
Education at Stanford (SES) re
ports, the trend has been toward
using full professors for under
graduate courses. This often re
sults in a lack of intimacy in the
student-professor relationship,
which is not in the spirit of SES
recommendations.
Vice Provost Brooks said that
the threat of a TA strike last fall
brought the needs of graduate stu
dents to the administration's
attention. Because of the various
conditions, the different depart
ments each have their own TA
programs.
Exploitation
Last fall's activities showed a
need for broad and flexible all-
University standards in TA pro
grams to guard against exploita
tion of each department's gradu
ates, he continued. In some de
partments TA's have full teaching
responsibilities, while in other de

partments the TA is no more than
a glorified reader. There need to
be standardized hours and pay,
allowing for variations in the de
partment.
AFT representative Andrew
Moss called for explicit proced
ures whereby graduates can pre
sent their grievances to the admin
istration. It took the AFT one and
a half years to get the administra
tion to recognize the graduates'
problems.
In many departments the TA is
insecure and often this affects his
efficiency as a teacher. He is
driven to accept a teaching assist

antship because of financial need,
but, at the same time, must work
under the pressures of his studies.
Often he is afraid to express his
grievances because it may result in
losing his job.
Dilemma
"Publish or perish" is another
dilemma that the grad student
faces. If he publishes a good orig
inal thesis, he is guaranteed better
job offers. Research assistantships
are often preferred to teaching
assistantships because the re
searcher gets his name in a journal
and can add it to his list of pub
lished works.

uate. It is easier for the TA to
develop a one-to-one relationship
with his students because he is
younger and, more important,
because he too, is still learning.
As a result of the Study of
Education at Stanford (SES) re
ports, the trend has been toward
using full professors for under
graduate courses. This often re
sults in a lack of intimacy in the
student-professor relationship,
which is not in the spirit of SES
recommendations.
Vice Provost Brooks said that
the threat of a TA strike last fall
brought the needs of graduate stu
dents to the administration's
attention. Because of the various
conditions, the different depart
ments each have their own TA
programs.
Exploitation
Last fall's activities showed a
need for broad and flexible all-
University standards in TA pro
grams to guard against exploita
tion of each department's gradu
ates, he continued. In some de
partments TA's have full teaching
responsibilities, while in other de

partments the TA is no more than
a glorified reader. There need to
be standardized hours and pay,
allowing for variations in the de
partment.
AFT representative Andrew
Moss called for explicit proced
ures whereby graduates can pre
sent their grievances to the admin
istration. It took the AFT one and
a half years to get the administra
tion to recognize the graduates'
problems.
In many departments the TA is
insecure and often this affects his
efficiency as a teacher. He is
driven to accept a teaching assist

antship because of financial need,
but, at the same time, must work
under the pressures of his studies.
Often he is afraid to express his
grievances because it may result in
losing his job.
Dilemma
"Publish or perish" is another
dilemma that the grad student
faces. If he publishes a good orig
inal thesis, he is guaranteed better
job offers. Research assistantships
are often preferred to teaching
assistantships because the re
searcher gets his name in a journal
and can add it to his list of pub
lished works.

SITTING PANEL—"The Hole of the Graduate Student in Teaching at
Stanford" was the topic for the first Graduate Student Association
discussion. Members of the panel are, from left to right, Andrew Moss
of the Stanford AFT, physics Prof. Walter Meyerhof, and electrical
engineering grad student Dick Miles. Other participants were Vice Pro
vost E. Howard Brooks and English TA Frank Cady.
"Teaching assistantships are
beneficial to both graduate stu
dents and the University" main
tained physics Prof. Walter Meyer
hof yesterday at a panel discus
sion on "The Role of the Gradu
ate Student in Teaching at
Stanford."
Meyerhof said that TA's are
forced to learn the subject matter
of their specialized fields more
thoroughly when forced to return
to the books to answer questions
raised by their students. The Uni
versity benefits from the TA pro
gram, he continued, because its
teaching obligation may be in part
fulfilled by grad students.
Other members of the panel in
cluded Vice Provost E. Howard
Brooks, English TA Frank Cady,
and Andrew Moss of the Stanford
American Federation of Teachers
(AFT). Dick Miles, graduate stu
dent in Electrical Engineering, was
moderator. About twenty-five
graduates representing various de
partments were present.
Help Undergrads
Cady pointed out that the TA
program in the English Depart
ment also benefits the undergrad
uate. It is easier for the TA to
develop a one-to-one relationship
with his students because he is
younger and, more important,
because he too, is still learning.
