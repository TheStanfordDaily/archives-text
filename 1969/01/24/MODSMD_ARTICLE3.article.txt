# D.A. Nixes Bustee Charges
## 
### CRAIG WILSON 
The prosecuting attorney in
the recent arrest of Stanford
student John Lanthier has cate
gorically denied all charges that
the Santa Clara County D.A.'s
office has assumed a new "hard
line policy" against marijuana
users at Stanford.
Attorney Susan Convery
sloughed off the charges saying
"he must be paranoid or some
thing."
The charges were leveled by
Lanthier earlier this week follow
ing his January 13 arrest by Santa
Clara county sheriff's deputies as
he allegedly tried to pick up a
briefcase full of marijuana from
his desk locker in Meyer Library.
Mrs. Convery said simply,
"There is no truth to that. We
have too many criminal cases to
concentrate on narcotics. We have
no time to stake out anything."
Accidental Arrests
"Our office issues criminal
complaints, she pointed out. The
vast majority of marijuana arrests
are purely accidental, she added.
Most of the time they occur as the
result of another offense when
officers accidentally stumble upon
marijuana.
When asked about the alle
gation that all charges would be
dropped if Lanthier helped the
Sheriff's Department <*t hip

source, Mrs. Convery individually
asked each attorney in the North
Santa Clara County Office.
After polling all present she
said firmly, "the answer is no."
She said that if the defendent
offers his aid there are occasions
when the detective will speak to
the district attorney asking for
leniency. But she said in no
ciscumstance will the D.A. make
an offer to the defendent.

A police report written oy
deputy Richard Saldiver has dis
closed that the briefcase found in
Lanthier's locker contained 38
lids of marijuana.
According to the report "each
lid was individually wrapped in a
thin plastic material of 'baggie'
sandwich variety "
Also found on Lanthier was a
light blue capsule containing
white powder. It was identified as
a barbiturate commonly called
"blue heaven." The report also
said a package of zigzag cigarette
paper was found in his vest
pocker.
After he reached the locker
Saldiver said "he suddenly stood
upright and had the look of
amazement and then anger on his
face."
Lanthier claimed that when he
was arrested an officer threatened
him with a gun saying in effect
that if he ran he would shoot.
Convery said "this is entirely
possible. It is common practice if
an officer has apprehended an
individual to tell him he will shoot
if they think he will run. Whether
they shoot or not is a different
question."
Lanthier said that currently his
attorney, Rudy Hoffman of San
Francisco, is trying to get him in
juvmile court. But this says
Lanthier is "highly unlikely."
