## BSU Demands Resignation Of Prof For 'Racist' Admissions Interview 
### PHILIP TAUBMAN 
The Stanford Black Students
Union (BSU) last night issued a
broad denunciation of "racist" at
titudes in University departments
and schools, including a specific
demand for the immediate resig
nation of an Education School as
sistant professor.
Calling for "no apologies" and
"no equivocating", the BSU
presses for the dismissal of Robert
Koff, claiming he exhibited racist
behavior during a recent admis
sions interview with a black
female applicant.
According to the BSU, Koff,
who is director of the Secondary
Teacher Education Program
(STEP) asked the applicant,
whether she had, "ever not had
enough money to buy tampax or
sanitary napkins" and whether she
had, "ever not had a piece of meat

on the table for a period of
months."
The applicant, who is from
East Palo Alto and is presently at
tending Loretto Heights College in
Denver, left the interview and im
mediately tried to contact Frank
Satterwhite, a student in the edu
cation school and active member
of the BSU. She reached Satter
white five days later, and he wrote
a letter of protest to University
officials, incluaing President
Kenneth Pitzer.
Satterwhite met with Koff and
University officials a week later.
Following the meeting, Koff
wrote a letter of apology to the
applicant, Clarissa Stevenson.
Applicant Comments
Contacted in Denver last night,
Miss Stevenson reported she had
received the letter from Koff,
"but had not yet decided what to
reply." She said, "I am easy to
placate but the question is not ap
peasing one individual. My experi
ence reveals something about the
institution that employs someone
like Mr. Koff."
The BSU complains in its state
ment that no University official
informed the BSU about the inci
dent, but instead worked behind
the scenes, "to slap the man's
hand."
The BSU reports that other
questions asked by Koff included.
"Have you ever experienced life in
a real ghetto? Have you ever ex
perienced the total despair that a
black man in Philadelphia or Balti
more experiences? Have you ever
not had enough money to see a
dentist or a doctor?"
Koff said yesterday that his
questions were asked in the con
text of philosophical examination
of "socio-economic indices of

ghetto life" and that he never in
tended to insult Miss Stevenson.
Koff further remarked, "Our dis
cussion was meant to be purely
academic and I am extremely
sorry about the misunder
standing."
BSU Statement
According to the BSU docu
ment, Miss Stevenson left the
interview "in both humiliation
and shame after having been sub
jected to the most provocative
and goddamned of inquiries."
The BSU statement demands
that Koff be replaced by a black
professor and administrator. The
BSU says to "look for direct
action" if a black man is not se
lected immediately.
Beyond the Koff incident, the
BSU lashes out at other compara
ble "racist remarks" made on
campus. No other individual refer
ences are made. The statement
briefly refers to examples in the
Medical School, the Spanish de
partment, the Psychology depart
ment, and the History depart
ment.
"We are still waiting" for some
action in all areas, comments the
BSU. The document avoids indi
vidual names to "show our good
faith." It states, however, that
"Good faith lasts but for so long."
STATEMENT OF
THE BLACK STUDENTS UNION
It is OUR opinion, the Stan
ford University Black Students
Union, that a certain faction with
in this institution's hierarchy have
willfully and maliciously withheld
from the students, faculty, and
administrators the occurrences of
a recent interview held on this
campus in which a young Afro-
American girl was subjected to
psychological abuse and subtle
racist innuendo while attempting
to enter the Secondary Teachers
Education Program.
This interview took place on
January 6 at 8:30 am and in
volved Miss Clarissa C. Stevenson,
who grew up in the black ghetto
of East Palo Alto, and Dr. Robert
H. Koff, representative for the
program at Stanford University.
Miss Stevenson, who will be
finishing her undergraduate work

this school year in Colorado, hav
ing won a scholarship while at
tending high school in EPA, had
applied to Stanford after having
heard that there now existed a
good chance for her admittance in
the wake of Stanford's moving to
correct its sad racial imbalances.
Unfortunately, our Soul Sister
found out once she arrived here
that fateful day that "All that
glitters is not gold" could be on
certain occasions and was in this
instance a painfully true observa
tion on the machinations of
human behavior.

At the end of her interview
with Dr. Koff, this young girl left
in both humiliation and shame
after having been subjected to (we
are now told, "unconsciously")
the most provocative and god
damned of inquiries. It is our posi
tion, as Black People functioning
in a world quite accurately des
cribed by the Kerner Report as
"White Racist," that this man
Koff be relieved of his position.
Make no mistake. It is the posi
tion of Stanford University's
Black Students Union that Dr.
Robert H. Koff be taken from his
present position. We want no
apologies, none of the equivoca
ting, not the sleight-of-hand that
resulted, for instance, in the intel
ligence which we have on this situ
ation, which was the property of
Prexy Pitzer (whom, we were led
to believe, wished to establish
racial harmony here at Stanford),
Messrs. Lyman (who, when talking
to MASC on meeting Chicano de
mands for equality said that he
was "quite aware of the problems,
for instance, that black people
have"), Rosenzweig (who had
promised "Good Faith" to us),
Bacchetti, Hess, Black Provost Jim
Simmons, as well as Drs. Elizabeth
Cohen and Byron Sher (slated to
hold forth on the nature of
"Racism and Prejudice" in the
course called by the same name).
Not a one of these people or
parties at any time made any ef
forts to relate or alleviate these
conditions before us, the Execu
tive Committee. Rather, they
went behind the scenes, or so we
are told, to "slap the man's
hand." Not that we are saying
that those parties involved were
not on their jobs; in fact, they
moved quite speedily. Our bitch is
that this happened, that we were
not informed as the official body
of Black People on this campus,
that in fact were it not for the
sensitive response of one man in
fact who did care, we would not
have known anything at all.
For the information of Con
cerned Peoples, here are some of
the statements made that day to a
young girl who was only attempt
ing to apply for Higher Educat..3n
(and, in a roundabout sort of way,
we guess Miss Stevenson now does
possess a "Higher Education").
"Have you ever experienced
life in a real ghetto?"
It appears that Dr. Koff con
ceptualizes ghettoes only in such
visions as Detroit, Newark, South
Philly, Washington, D.C., Watts,
and Harlem burning. Perhaps he
need be told that a black ghetto is
not simply condemned housing,
or long welfare lists dominated by
black women, or unproportion
ately high illegitimacy rates.
In East Palo Alto, for instance,
you are dealing with a black com
munity with a fifth grade reading
level, without any efficient news
service, with a predominantly
black population whose jobs are
in more examples than not the
domestic services. Perhaps not
only Dr. Koff, but a good many
administrators and people in high
places here at Stanford are not
aware that last quarter, for in
stance, the Black Students Union
at Ravenswood High School
mustered the support and muscle
to oust its white principal, Mal
colm Taylor, and replace him
with black principal Earl Mene
weather.
"Have you ever not had a piece
of meat on the table for a period
of months?"
Justice
After having bitten our tongues
for so long, Dear Stanford, and we
speak quite knowledgeably as the
Administration at this institution
well knows, it is time that we re
veal to this school just what is
going on at this school and, more
over, what we want insofar as
Justice is concerned.
Mr. Koff's final statement, as
far as we are now concerned, was
the following. "Have you ever not
had enough money to buy
Tampax or Sanitary Napkins?"
We think it is clear what our
response to this sort of "inter
viewing" is. The facts speak for
themselves. Replace this man with
someone who has, or possesses, a
good more discretion and respect
in these sort of situations. We
want a black man in that post,
and we want one now. If there is
any hedging, look for direct
action on our part.

Racist remarks have also been
made on this campus to minority
students. We wish to refer to the
Medical School Incident, which
we have, on our own part, respect
fully withheld from publicizing,
showing our good faith. We are
still waiting.
Reparations
We wish the Spanish Depart
ment to remember that we are
looking for reparations in .the in
cident in which Our People were
slurred by a member of its teach
ing staff. We are still waiting.
We wish the Department of
Psychology to take heed of our
awareness of one of its teachers,
who again slurred Black People,
and that we are waiting for repara
tions. Good Faith lasts but for so
long. We are still waiting.
We wish for the History De
partment and those concerned
with SES to understand that the
affront to Afro-American dignity
in the slighting of African Civiliza
tion will not be taken lightly and
that we are awaiting reparations.
We will not wait long. Our Broth
ers of the Third World all across
the country are on the move,
making Justice where staid Ad
ministrations have shown them
selves incapable of moving to
make change.
It is quite clear that, for in
stance, were a Black Man to have
accosted a White Woman in this
fashion at Stanford University, he
would be run out of town by sun
down. If this had taken place in
the South, without the shadows
of school buildings, that Black
Man would by now undoubtedly
be hanging by his neck, castrated,
and madv.* a "lesson" for Black
People to remember.
Matches Cheaper
No white woman has been
asked these sort of questions in
applying for admission to any
graduate school anyplace in this
country. If you want to know just
how much we do mean business,
keep in mind that rope for hang
ing black men is a good deal more
expensive than matches that start
fires. Irrational action can only be
met by dealing in the language the
irrational understand.
We leave a way out. We want
Black People in these positions to
avoid these sort of incidents. It
also works as a two-way street.
These same Black People, should
they show these sort of manner
isms, we will move on quickly to
have taken out of those posts.
But there is a need, and a glar
ing one at that, for Black People
in the aforementioned depart
ments, quite definitely in Dr.
Koff's position, and elsewhere in
this institution. We want Black
Administrators, we want Black In
terviewers, we want Black Faculty
Professors, we want Black People
period involved in this school's
functioning or else the whole of
the Stanford experience ranks
only as a farce.
'Erroneous' Mistakes
Do not expect us to sit idly by
while Black courses are shoved off
the boards in the names of "erron
eous" mistakes as was reported in
the handling of African Civiliza
tion. Too many other schools of
far lesser name than Stanford are
making strides to establish Black
Studies Departments for us to be
placated by rationalizations, ali
bis, and plain-and-simple ad
libbing by people who quite clear
ly do not know that they are
dealing with People who have as
much on the ball as they.
Keep this in mind. One profes
sor here stated, on Wednesday,
that "Black people are 200,000
years behind Whites." He just
might believe that and be able to
summon evidence to support his
assertions. But when all of the
talking is over, we are still going
to have our Justice, we are going
to have our Freedom, and nothing
is going to deter us.

tive Committee. Rather, they
went behind the scenes, or so we
are told, to "slap the man's
hand." Not that we are saying
that those parties involved were
not on their jobs; in fact, they
moved quite speedily. Our bitch is
that this happened, that we were
not informed as the official body
of Black People on this campus,
that in fact were it not for the
sensitive response of one man in
fact who did care, we would not
have known anything at all.
For the information of Con
cerned Peoples, here are some of
the statements made that day to a
young girl who was only attempt
ing to apply for Higher Educat..3n
(and, in a roundabout sort of way,
we guess Miss Stevenson now does
possess a "Higher Education").
"Have you ever experienced
life in a real ghetto?"
It appears that Dr. Koff con
ceptualizes ghettoes only in such
visions as Detroit, Newark, South
Philly, Washington, D.C., Watts,
and Harlem burning. Perhaps he
need be told that a black ghetto is
not simply condemned housing,
or long welfare lists dominated by
black women, or unproportion
ately high illegitimacy rates.
In East Palo Alto, for instance,
you are dealing with a black com
munity with a fifth grade reading
level, without any efficient news
service, with a predominantly
black population whose jobs are
in more examples than not the
domestic services. Perhaps not
only Dr. Koff, but a good many
administrators and people in high
places here at Stanford are not
aware that last quarter, for in
stance, the Black Students Union
at Ravenswood High School
mustered the support and muscle
to oust its white principal, Mal
colm Taylor, and replace him
with black principal Earl Mene
weather.
"Have you ever not had a piece
of meat on the table for a period
of months?"
Justice
After having bitten our tongues
for so long, Dear Stanford, and we
speak quite knowledgeably as the
Administration at this institution
well knows, it is time that we re
veal to this school just what is
going on at this school and, more
over, what we want insofar as
Justice is concerned.
Mr. Koff's final statement, as
far as we are now concerned, was
the following. "Have you ever not
had enough money to buy
Tampax or Sanitary Napkins?"
We think it is clear what our
response to this sort of "inter
viewing" is. The facts speak for
themselves. Replace this man with
someone who has, or possesses, a
good more discretion and respect
in these sort of situations. We
want a black man in that post,
and we want one now. If there is
any hedging, look for direct
action on our part.

Racist remarks have also been
made on this campus to minority
students. We wish to refer to the
Medical School Incident, which
we have, on our own part, respect
fully withheld from publicizing,
showing our good faith. We are
still waiting.
Reparations
We wish the Spanish Depart
ment to remember that we are
looking for reparations in .the in
cident in which Our People were
slurred by a member of its teach
ing staff. We are still waiting.
We wish the Department of
Psychology to take heed of our
awareness of one of its teachers,
who again slurred Black People,
and that we are waiting for repara
tions. Good Faith lasts but for so
long. We are still waiting.
We wish for the History De
partment and those concerned
with SES to understand that the
affront to Afro-American dignity
in the slighting of African Civiliza
tion will not be taken lightly and
that we are awaiting reparations.
We will not wait long. Our Broth
ers of the Third World all across
the country are on the move,
making Justice where staid Ad
ministrations have shown them
selves incapable of moving to
make change.
It is quite clear that, for in
stance, were a Black Man to have
accosted a White Woman in this
fashion at Stanford University, he
would be run out of town by sun
down. If this had taken place in
the South, without the shadows
of school buildings, that Black
Man would by now undoubtedly
be hanging by his neck, castrated,
and madv.* a "lesson" for Black
People to remember.
Matches Cheaper
No white woman has been
asked these sort of questions in
applying for admission to any
graduate school anyplace in this
country. If you want to know just
how much we do mean business,
keep in mind that rope for hang
ing black men is a good deal more
expensive than matches that start
fires. Irrational action can only be
met by dealing in the language the
irrational understand.
We leave a way out. We want
Black People in these positions to
avoid these sort of incidents. It
also works as a two-way street.
These same Black People, should
they show these sort of manner
isms, we will move on quickly to
have taken out of those posts.
But there is a need, and a glar
ing one at that, for Black People
in the aforementioned depart
ments, quite definitely in Dr.
Koff's position, and elsewhere in
this institution. We want Black
Administrators, we want Black In
terviewers, we want Black Faculty
Professors, we want Black People
period involved in this school's
functioning or else the whole of
the Stanford experience ranks
only as a farce.
'Erroneous' Mistakes
Do not expect us to sit idly by
while Black courses are shoved off
the boards in the names of "erron
eous" mistakes as was reported in
the handling of African Civiliza
tion. Too many other schools of
far lesser name than Stanford are
making strides to establish Black
Studies Departments for us to be
placated by rationalizations, ali
bis, and plain-and-simple ad
libbing by people who quite clear
ly do not know that they are
dealing with People who have as
much on the ball as they.
Keep this in mind. One profes
sor here stated, on Wednesday,
that "Black people are 200,000
years behind Whites." He just
might believe that and be able to
summon evidence to support his
assertions. But when all of the
talking is over, we are still going
to have our Justice, we are going
to have our Freedom, and nothing
is going to deter us.
The Stanford Black Students
Union (BSU) last night issued a
broad denunciation of "racist" at
titudes in University departments
and schools, including a specific
demand for the immediate resig
nation of an Education School as
sistant professor.
Calling for "no apologies" and
"no equivocating", the BSU
presses for the dismissal of Robert
Koff, claiming he exhibited racist
behavior during a recent admis
sions interview with a black
female applicant.
According to the BSU, Koff,
who is director of the Secondary
Teacher Education Program
(STEP) asked the applicant,
whether she had, "ever not had
enough money to buy tampax or
sanitary napkins" and whether she
had, "ever not had a piece of meat

on the table for a period of
months."
The applicant, who is from
East Palo Alto and is presently at
tending Loretto Heights College in
Denver, left the interview and im
mediately tried to contact Frank
Satterwhite, a student in the edu
cation school and active member
of the BSU. She reached Satter
white five days later, and he wrote
a letter of protest to University
officials, incluaing President
Kenneth Pitzer.
Satterwhite met with Koff and
University officials a week later.
Following the meeting, Koff
wrote a letter of apology to the
applicant, Clarissa Stevenson.
Applicant Comments
Contacted in Denver last night,
Miss Stevenson reported she had
received the letter from Koff,
"but had not yet decided what to
reply." She said, "I am easy to
placate but the question is not ap
peasing one individual. My experi
ence reveals something about the
institution that employs someone
like Mr. Koff."
The BSU complains in its state
ment that no University official
informed the BSU about the inci
dent, but instead worked behind
the scenes, "to slap the man's
hand."
The BSU reports that other
questions asked by Koff included.
"Have you ever experienced life in
a real ghetto? Have you ever ex
perienced the total despair that a
black man in Philadelphia or Balti
more experiences? Have you ever
not had enough money to see a
dentist or a doctor?"
Koff said yesterday that his
questions were asked in the con
text of philosophical examination
of "socio-economic indices of

ghetto life" and that he never in
tended to insult Miss Stevenson.
Koff further remarked, "Our dis
cussion was meant to be purely
academic and I am extremely
sorry about the misunder
standing."
BSU Statement
According to the BSU docu
ment, Miss Stevenson left the
interview "in both humiliation
and shame after having been sub
jected to the most provocative
and goddamned of inquiries."
The BSU statement demands
that Koff be replaced by a black
professor and administrator. The
BSU says to "look for direct
action" if a black man is not se
lected immediately.
Beyond the Koff incident, the
BSU lashes out at other compara
ble "racist remarks" made on
campus. No other individual refer
ences are made. The statement
briefly refers to examples in the
Medical School, the Spanish de
partment, the Psychology depart
ment, and the History depart
ment.
"We are still waiting" for some
action in all areas, comments the
BSU. The document avoids indi
vidual names to "show our good
faith." It states, however, that
"Good faith lasts but for so long."
STATEMENT OF
THE BLACK STUDENTS UNION
It is OUR opinion, the Stan
ford University Black Students
Union, that a certain faction with
in this institution's hierarchy have
willfully and maliciously withheld
from the students, faculty, and
administrators the occurrences of
a recent interview held on this
campus in which a young Afro-
American girl was subjected to
psychological abuse and subtle
racist innuendo while attempting
to enter the Secondary Teachers
Education Program.
This interview took place on
January 6 at 8:30 am and in
volved Miss Clarissa C. Stevenson,
who grew up in the black ghetto
of East Palo Alto, and Dr. Robert
H. Koff, representative for the
program at Stanford University.
Miss Stevenson, who will be
finishing her undergraduate work

this school year in Colorado, hav
ing won a scholarship while at
tending high school in EPA, had
applied to Stanford after having
heard that there now existed a
good chance for her admittance in
the wake of Stanford's moving to
correct its sad racial imbalances.
Unfortunately, our Soul Sister
found out once she arrived here
that fateful day that "All that
glitters is not gold" could be on
certain occasions and was in this
instance a painfully true observa
tion on the machinations of
human behavior.

At the end of her interview
with Dr. Koff, this young girl left
in both humiliation and shame
after having been subjected to (we
are now told, "unconsciously")
the most provocative and god
damned of inquiries. It is our posi
tion, as Black People functioning
in a world quite accurately des
cribed by the Kerner Report as
"White Racist," that this man
Koff be relieved of his position.
Make no mistake. It is the posi
tion of Stanford University's
Black Students Union that Dr.
Robert H. Koff be taken from his
present position. We want no
apologies, none of the equivoca
ting, not the sleight-of-hand that
resulted, for instance, in the intel
ligence which we have on this situ
ation, which was the property of
Prexy Pitzer (whom, we were led
to believe, wished to establish
racial harmony here at Stanford),
Messrs. Lyman (who, when talking
to MASC on meeting Chicano de
mands for equality said that he
was "quite aware of the problems,
for instance, that black people
have"), Rosenzweig (who had
promised "Good Faith" to us),
Bacchetti, Hess, Black Provost Jim
Simmons, as well as Drs. Elizabeth
Cohen and Byron Sher (slated to
hold forth on the nature of
"Racism and Prejudice" in the
course called by the same name).
Not a one of these people or
parties at any time made any ef
forts to relate or alleviate these
conditions before us, the Execu
tive Committee. Rather, they
went behind the scenes, or so we
are told, to "slap the man's
hand." Not that we are saying
that those parties involved were
not on their jobs; in fact, they
moved quite speedily. Our bitch is
that this happened, that we were
not informed as the official body
of Black People on this campus,
that in fact were it not for the
sensitive response of one man in

have known anything at all.
For the information of Con

(and, in a roundabout sort of way,
we guess Miss Stevenson now does
possess a "Higher Education").
"Have you ever experienced
life in a real ghetto?"
It appears that Dr. Koff con
ceptualizes ghettoes only in such
visions as Detroit, Newark, South
Philly, Washington, D.C., Watts,
and Harlem burning. Perhaps he
need be told that a black ghetto is
not simply condemned housing,
or long welfare lists dominated by
black women, or unproportion
ately high illegitimacy rates.
In East Palo Alto, for instance,
you are dealing with a black com
munity with a fifth grade reading

black population whose jobs are
in more examples than not the
domestic services. Perhaps not

We leave a way out. We want

to have our Justice, we are going
to have our Freedom, and nothing
is going to deter us.
The Stanford Black Students
Union (BSU) last night issued a
broad denunciation of "racist" at
titudes in University departments
and schools, including a specific
demand for the immediate resig
nation of an Education School as
sistant professor.
Calling for "no apologies" and
"no equivocating", the BSU
presses for the dismissal of Robert
Koff, claiming he exhibited racist
behavior during a recent admis
sions interview with a black
female applicant.
According to the BSU, Koff,
who is director of the Secondary
Teacher Education Program
(STEP) asked the applicant,
whether she had, "ever not had
enough money to buy tampax or
sanitary napkins" and whether she
had, "ever not had a piece of meat

on the table for a period of
months."
The applicant, who is from
East Palo Alto and is presently at
tending Loretto Heights College in
Denver, left the interview and im
mediately tried to contact Frank
Satterwhite, a student in the edu
cation school and active member
of the BSU. She reached Satter
white five days later, and he wrote
a letter of protest to University
officials, incluaing President
Kenneth Pitzer.
Satterwhite met with Koff and
University officials a week later.
Following the meeting, Koff
wrote a letter of apology to the
applicant, Clarissa Stevenson.
Applicant Comments
Contacted in Denver last night,
Miss Stevenson reported she had
received the letter from Koff,
"but had not yet decided what to
reply." She said, "I am easy to
placate but the question is not ap
peasing one individual. My experi
ence reveals something about the
institution that employs someone
like Mr. Koff."
The BSU complains in its state
ment that no University official
informed the BSU about the inci
dent, but instead worked behind
the scenes, "to slap the man's
hand."
The BSU reports that other
questions asked by Koff included.
"Have you ever experienced life in
a real ghetto? Have you ever ex
perienced the total despair that a
black man in Philadelphia or Balti
more experiences? Have you ever
not had enough money to see a
dentist or a doctor?"
Koff said yesterday that his
questions were asked in the con
text of philosophical examination
of "socio-economic indices of

ghetto life" and that he never in
tended to insult Miss Stevenson.
Koff further remarked, "Our dis
cussion was meant to be purely
academic and I am extremely
sorry about the misunder
standing."
BSU Statement
According to the BSU docu
ment, Miss Stevenson left the
interview "in both humiliation
and shame after having been sub
jected to the most provocative
and goddamned of inquiries."
The BSU statement demands
that Koff be replaced by a black
professor and administrator. The
BSU says to "look for direct
action" if a black man is not se
lected immediately.
Beyond the Koff incident, the
BSU lashes out at other compara
ble "racist remarks" made on
campus. No other individual refer
ences are made. The statement
briefly refers to examples in the
Medical School, the Spanish de
partment, the Psychology depart
ment, and the History depart
ment.
"We are still waiting" for some
action in all areas, comments the
BSU. The document avoids indi
vidual names to "show our good
faith." It states, however, that
"Good faith lasts but for so long."
STATEMENT OF
THE BLACK STUDENTS UNION
It is OUR opinion, the Stan
ford University Black Students
Union, that a certain faction with
in this institution's hierarchy have
willfully and maliciously withheld
from the students, faculty, and
administrators the occurrences of
a recent interview held on this
campus in which a young Afro-
American girl was subjected to
psychological abuse and subtle
racist innuendo while attempting
to enter the Secondary Teachers
Education Program.
This interview took place on
January 6 at 8:30 am and in
volved Miss Clarissa C. Stevenson,
who grew up in the black ghetto
of East Palo Alto, and Dr. Robert
H. Koff, representative for the
program at Stanford University.
Miss Stevenson, who will be
finishing her undergraduate work

this school year in Colorado, hav
ing won a scholarship while at
tending high school in EPA, had
applied to Stanford after having
heard that there now existed a
good chance for her admittance in
the wake of Stanford's moving to
correct its sad racial imbalances.
Unfortunately, our Soul Sister
found out once she arrived here
that fateful day that "All that
glitters is not gold" could be on
certain occasions and was in this
instance a painfully true observa
tion on the machinations of
human behavior.

At the end of her interview
with Dr. Koff, this young girl left
in both humiliation and shame
after having been subjected to (we
are now told, "unconsciously")
the most provocative and god
damned of inquiries. It is our posi
tion, as Black People functioning
in a world quite accurately des
cribed by the Kerner Report as
"White Racist," that this man
Koff be relieved of his position.
Make no mistake. It is the posi
tion of Stanford University's
Black Students Union that Dr.
Robert H. Koff be taken from his
present position. We want no
apologies, none of the equivoca
ting, not the sleight-of-hand that
resulted, for instance, in the intel
ligence which we have on this situ
ation, which was the property of
Prexy Pitzer (whom, we were led
to believe, wished to establish
racial harmony here at Stanford),
Messrs. Lyman (who, when talking
to MASC on meeting Chicano de
mands for equality said that he
was "quite aware of the problems,
for instance, that black people
have"), Rosenzweig (who had
promised "Good Faith" to us),
Bacchetti, Hess, Black Provost Jim
Simmons, as well as Drs. Elizabeth
Cohen and Byron Sher (slated to
hold forth on the nature of
"Racism and Prejudice" in the
course called by the same name).
Not a one of these people or
parties at any time made any ef
forts to relate or alleviate these
conditions before us, the Execu
tive Committee. Rather, they
went behind the scenes, or so we
are told, to "slap the man's
hand." Not that we are saying
that those parties involved were
not on their jobs; in fact, they
moved quite speedily. Our bitch is
that this happened, that we were
not informed as the official body
of Black People on this campus,
that in fact were it not for the
sensitive response of one man in
fact who did care, we would not
have known anything at all.
For the information of Con
cerned Peoples, here are some of
the statements made that day to a
young girl who was only attempt
ing to apply for Higher Educat..3n
(and, in a roundabout sort of way,
we guess Miss Stevenson now does
possess a "Higher Education").
"Have you ever experienced
life in a real ghetto?"
It appears that Dr. Koff con
ceptualizes ghettoes only in such
visions as Detroit, Newark, South
Philly, Washington, D.C., Watts,
and Harlem burning. Perhaps he
need be told that a black ghetto is
not simply condemned housing,
or long welfare lists dominated by
black women, or unproportion
ately high illegitimacy rates.
In East Palo Alto, for instance,
you are dealing with a black com
munity with a fifth grade reading
level, without any efficient news
service, with a predominantly
black population whose jobs are
in more examples than not the
domestic services. Perhaps not
only Dr. Koff, but a good many
administrators and people in high
places here at Stanford are not
aware that last quarter, for in
stance, the Black Students Union
at Ravenswood High School
mustered the support and muscle
to oust its white principal, Mal
colm Taylor, and replace him
with black principal Earl Mene
weather.
"Have you ever not had a piece
of meat on the table for a period
of months?"
Justice
After having bitten our tongues
for so long, Dear Stanford, and we
speak quite knowledgeably as the
Administration at this institution
well knows, it is time that we re
veal to this school just what is
going on at this school and, more
over, what we want insofar as
Justice is concerned.
Mr. Koff's final statement, as
far as we are now concerned, was
the following. "Have you ever not
had enough money to buy
Tampax or Sanitary Napkins?"
We think it is clear what our
response to this sort of "inter
viewing" is. The facts speak for
themselves. Replace this man with
someone who has, or possesses, a
good more discretion and respect
in these sort of situations. We
want a black man in that post,
and we want one now. If there is
any hedging, look for direct
action on our part.

Racist remarks have also been
made on this campus to minority
students. We wish to refer to the
Medical School Incident, which
we have, on our own part, respect
fully withheld from publicizing,
showing our good faith. We are
still waiting.
Reparations
We wish the Spanish Depart
ment to remember that we are
looking for reparations in .the in
cident in which Our People were
slurred by a member of its teach
ing staff. We are still waiting.
We wish the Department of
Psychology to take heed of our
awareness of one of its teachers,
who again slurred Black People,
and that we are waiting for repara
tions. Good Faith lasts but for so
long. We are still waiting.
We wish for the History De
partment and those concerned
with SES to understand that the
affront to Afro-American dignity
in the slighting of African Civiliza
tion will not be taken lightly and
that we are awaiting reparations.
We will not wait long. Our Broth
ers of the Third World all across
the country are on the move,
making Justice where staid Ad
ministrations have shown them
selves incapable of moving to
make change.
It is quite clear that, for in
stance, were a Black Man to have
accosted a White Woman in this
fashion at Stanford University, he
would be run out of town by sun
down. If this had taken place in
the South, without the shadows
of school buildings, that Black
Man would by now undoubtedly
be hanging by his neck, castrated,
and madv.* a "lesson" for Black
People to remember.
Matches Cheaper
No white woman has been
asked these sort of questions in
applying for admission to any
graduate school anyplace in this
country. If you want to know just
how much we do mean business,
keep in mind that rope for hang
ing black men is a good deal more
expensive than matches that start
fires. Irrational action can only be
met by dealing in the language the
irrational understand.
We leave a way out. We want
Black People in these positions to
avoid these sort of incidents. It
also works as a two-way street.
These same Black People, should
they show these sort of manner
isms, we will move on quickly to
have taken out of those posts.
But there is a need, and a glar
ing one at that, for Black People
in the aforementioned depart
ments, quite definitely in Dr.
Koff's position, and elsewhere in
this institution. We want Black
Administrators, we want Black In
terviewers, we want Black Faculty
Professors, we want Black People
period involved in this school's
functioning or else the whole of
the Stanford experience ranks
only as a farce.
'Erroneous' Mistakes
Do not expect us to sit idly by
while Black courses are shoved off
the boards in the names of "erron
eous" mistakes as was reported in
the handling of African Civiliza
tion. Too many other schools of
far lesser name than Stanford are
making strides to establish Black
Studies Departments for us to be
placated by rationalizations, ali
bis, and plain-and-simple ad
libbing by people who quite clear
ly do not know that they are
dealing with People who have as
much on the ball as they.
Keep this in mind. One profes
sor here stated, on Wednesday,
that "Black people are 200,000
years behind Whites." He just
might believe that and be able to
summon evidence to support his
assertions. But when all of the
talking is over, we are still going
to have our Justice, we are going
to have our Freedom, and nothing
is going to deter us.

forts to relate or alleviate these
conditions before us, the Execu
tive Committee. Rather, they
went behind the scenes, or so we
are told, to "slap the man's
hand." Not that we are saying
that those parties involved were
not on their jobs; in fact, they
moved quite speedily. Our bitch is
that this happened, that we were
not informed as the official body
of Black People on this campus,
that in fact were it not for the
sensitive response of one man in
fact who did care, we would not
have known anything at all.
For the information of Con
cerned Peoples, here are some of
the statements made that day to a
young girl who was only attempt
ing to apply for Higher Educat..3n
(and, in a roundabout sort of way,
we guess Miss Stevenson now does
possess a "Higher Education").
"Have you ever experienced
life in a real ghetto?"
It appears that Dr. Koff con
ceptualizes ghettoes only in such
visions as Detroit, Newark, South
Philly, Washington, D.C., Watts,
and Harlem burning. Perhaps he
need be told that a black ghetto is
not simply condemned housing,
or long welfare lists dominated by
black women, or unproportion
ately high illegitimacy rates.
In East Palo Alto, for instance,
you are dealing with a black com
munity with a fifth grade reading
level, without any efficient news
service, with a predominantly
black population whose jobs are
in more examples than not the
domestic services. Perhaps not
only Dr. Koff, but a good many
administrators and people in high
places here at Stanford are not
aware that last quarter, for in
stance, the Black Students Union
at Ravenswood High School
mustered the support and muscle
to oust its white principal, Mal
colm Taylor, and replace him
with black principal Earl Mene
weather.
"Have you ever not had a piece
of meat on the table for a period
of months?"
Justice
After having bitten our tongues
for so long, Dear Stanford, and we
speak quite knowledgeably as the
Administration at this institution
well knows, it is time that we re
veal to this school just what is
going on at this school and, more
over, what we want insofar as
Justice is concerned.
Mr. Koff's final statement, as
far as we are now concerned, was
the following. "Have you ever not
had enough money to buy
Tampax or Sanitary Napkins?"
We think it is clear what our
response to this sort of "inter
viewing" is. The facts speak for
themselves. Replace this man with
someone who has, or possesses, a
good more discretion and respect
in these sort of situations. We
want a black man in that post,
and we want one now. If there is
any hedging, look for direct
action on our part.

Racist remarks have also been
made on this campus to minority
students. We wish to refer to the
Medical School Incident, which
we have, on our own part, respect
fully withheld from publicizing,
showing our good faith. We are
still waiting.
Reparations
We wish the Spanish Depart
ment to remember that we are
looking for reparations in .the in
cident in which Our People were
slurred by a member of its teach
ing staff. We are still waiting.
We wish the Department of
Psychology to take heed of our
awareness of one of its teachers,
who again slurred Black People,
and that we are waiting for repara
tions. Good Faith lasts but for so
long. We are still waiting.
We wish for the History De
partment and those concerned
with SES to understand that the
affront to Afro-American dignity
in the slighting of African Civiliza
tion will not be taken lightly and
that we are awaiting reparations.
We will not wait long. Our Broth
ers of the Third World all across
the country are on the move,
making Justice where staid Ad
ministrations have shown them
selves incapable of moving to
make change.
It is quite clear that, for in
stance, were a Black Man to have
accosted a White Woman in this
fashion at Stanford University, he
would be run out of town by sun
down. If this had taken place in
the South, without the shadows
of school buildings, that Black
Man would by now undoubtedly
be hanging by his neck, castrated,
and madv.* a "lesson" for Black
People to remember.
Matches Cheaper
No white woman has been
asked these sort of questions in
applying for admission to any
graduate school anyplace in this
country. If you want to know just
how much we do mean business,
keep in mind that rope for hang
ing black men is a good deal more
expensive than matches that start
fires. Irrational action can only be
met by dealing in the language the
irrational understand.
We leave a way out. We want
Black People in these positions to
avoid these sort of incidents. It
also works as a two-way street.
These same Black People, should
they show these sort of manner
isms, we will move on quickly to
have taken out of those posts.
But there is a need, and a glar
ing one at that, for Black People
in the aforementioned depart
ments, quite definitely in Dr.
Koff's position, and elsewhere in
this institution. We want Black
Administrators, we want Black In
terviewers, we want Black Faculty
Professors, we want Black People
period involved in this school's
functioning or else the whole of
the Stanford experience ranks
only as a farce.
'Erroneous' Mistakes
Do not expect us to sit idly by
while Black courses are shoved off
the boards in the names of "erron
eous" mistakes as was reported in
the handling of African Civiliza
tion. Too many other schools of
far lesser name than Stanford are
making strides to establish Black
Studies Departments for us to be
placated by rationalizations, ali
bis, and plain-and-simple ad
libbing by people who quite clear
ly do not know that they are
dealing with People who have as
much on the ball as they.
Keep this in mind. One profes
sor here stated, on Wednesday,
that "Black people are 200,000
years behind Whites." He just
might believe that and be able to
summon evidence to support his
assertions. But when all of the
talking is over, we are still going
to have our Justice, we are going
to have our Freedom, and nothing
is going to deter us.
The Stanford Black Students
Union (BSU) last night issued a
broad denunciation of "racist" at
titudes in University departments
and schools, including a specific
demand for the immediate resig
nation of an Education School as
sistant professor.
Calling for "no apologies" and
"no equivocating", the BSU
presses for the dismissal of Robert
Koff, claiming he exhibited racist
behavior during a recent admis
sions interview with a black
female applicant.
According to the BSU, Koff,
who is director of the Secondary
Teacher Education Program
(STEP) asked the applicant,
whether she had, "ever not had
enough money to buy tampax or
sanitary napkins" and whether she
had, "ever not had a piece of meat

on the table for a period of
months."
The applicant, who is from
East Palo Alto and is presently at
tending Loretto Heights College in
Denver, left the interview and im
mediately tried to contact Frank
Satterwhite, a student in the edu
cation school and active member
of the BSU. She reached Satter
white five days later, and he wrote
a letter of protest to University
officials, incluaing President
Kenneth Pitzer.
Satterwhite met with Koff and
University officials a week later.
Following the meeting, Koff
wrote a letter of apology to the
applicant, Clarissa Stevenson.
Applicant Comments
Contacted in Denver last night,
Miss Stevenson reported she had
received the letter from Koff,
"but had not yet decided what to
reply." She said, "I am easy to
placate but the question is not ap
peasing one individual. My experi
ence reveals something about the
institution that employs someone
like Mr. Koff."
The BSU complains in its state
ment that no University official
informed the BSU about the inci
dent, but instead worked behind
the scenes, "to slap the man's
hand."
The BSU reports that other
questions asked by Koff included.
"Have you ever experienced life in
a real ghetto? Have you ever ex
perienced the total despair that a
black man in Philadelphia or Balti
more experiences? Have you ever
not had enough money to see a
dentist or a doctor?"
Koff said yesterday that his
questions were asked in the con
text of philosophical examination
of "socio-economic indices of

ghetto life" and that he never in
tended to insult Miss Stevenson.
Koff further remarked, "Our dis
cussion was meant to be purely
academic and I am extremely
sorry about the misunder
standing."
BSU Statement
According to the BSU docu
ment, Miss Stevenson left the
interview "in both humiliation
and shame after having been sub
jected to the most provocative
and goddamned of inquiries."
The BSU statement demands
that Koff be replaced by a black
professor and administrator. The
BSU says to "look for direct
action" if a black man is not se
lected immediately.
Beyond the Koff incident, the
BSU lashes out at other compara
ble "racist remarks" made on
campus. No other individual refer
ences are made. The statement
briefly refers to examples in the
Medical School, the Spanish de
partment, the Psychology depart
ment, and the History depart
ment.
"We are still waiting" for some
action in all areas, comments the
BSU. The document avoids indi
vidual names to "show our good
faith." It states, however, that
"Good faith lasts but for so long."
STATEMENT OF
THE BLACK STUDENTS UNION
It is OUR opinion, the Stan
ford University Black Students
Union, that a certain faction with
in this institution's hierarchy have
willfully and maliciously withheld
from the students, faculty, and
administrators the occurrences of
a recent interview held on this
campus in which a young Afro-
American girl was subjected to
psychological abuse and subtle
racist innuendo while attempting
to enter the Secondary Teachers
Education Program.
This interview took place on
January 6 at 8:30 am and in
volved Miss Clarissa C. Stevenson,
who grew up in the black ghetto
of East Palo Alto, and Dr. Robert
H. Koff, representative for the
program at Stanford University.
Miss Stevenson, who will be
finishing her undergraduate work

this school year in Colorado, hav
ing won a scholarship while at
tending high school in EPA, had
applied to Stanford after having
heard that there now existed a
good chance for her admittance in
the wake of Stanford's moving to
correct its sad racial imbalances.
Unfortunately, our Soul Sister
found out once she arrived here
that fateful day that "All that
glitters is not gold" could be on
certain occasions and was in this
instance a painfully true observa
tion on the machinations of
human behavior.

At the end of her interview
with Dr. Koff, this young girl left
in both humiliation and shame
after having been subjected to (we
are now told, "unconsciously")
the most provocative and god
damned of inquiries. It is our posi
tion, as Black People functioning
in a world quite accurately des
cribed by the Kerner Report as
"White Racist," that this man
Koff be relieved of his position.
Make no mistake. It is the posi
tion of Stanford University's
Black Students Union that Dr.
Robert H. Koff be taken from his
present position. We want no
apologies, none of the equivoca
ting, not the sleight-of-hand that
resulted, for instance, in the intel
ligence which we have on this situ
ation, which was the property of
Prexy Pitzer (whom, we were led
to believe, wished to establish
racial harmony here at Stanford),
Messrs. Lyman (who, when talking
to MASC on meeting Chicano de
mands for equality said that he
was "quite aware of the problems,
for instance, that black people
have"), Rosenzweig (who had
promised "Good Faith" to us),
Bacchetti, Hess, Black Provost Jim
Simmons, as well as Drs. Elizabeth
Cohen and Byron Sher (slated to
hold forth on the nature of
"Racism and Prejudice" in the
course called by the same name).
Not a one of these people or
parties at any time made any ef
forts to relate or alleviate these
conditions before us, the Execu
tive Committee. Rather, they
went behind the scenes, or so we
are told, to "slap the man's
hand." Not that we are saying
that those parties involved were
not on their jobs; in fact, they
moved quite speedily. Our bitch is
that this happened, that we were
not informed as the official body

(and, in a roundabout sort of way,
we guess Miss Stevenson now does
possess a "Higher Education").
"Have you ever experienced
life in a real ghetto?"
It appears that Dr. Koff con
ceptualizes ghettoes only in such
visions as Detroit, Newark, South
Philly, Washington, D.C., Watts,
and Harlem burning. Perhaps he
need be told that a black ghetto is
not simply condemned housing,
or long welfare lists dominated by
black women, or unproportion
ately high illegitimacy rates.
In East Palo Alto, for instance,
you are dealing with a black com
munity with a fifth grade reading

We leave a way out. We want

The Stanford Black Students
Union (BSU) last night issued a
broad denunciation of "racist" at
titudes in University departments
and schools, including a specific
demand for the immediate resig
nation of an Education School as
sistant professor.
Calling for "no apologies" and
"no equivocating", the BSU
presses for the dismissal of Robert
Koff, claiming he exhibited racist
behavior during a recent admis
sions interview with a black
female applicant.
According to the BSU, Koff,
who is director of the Secondary
Teacher Education Program
(STEP) asked the applicant,
whether she had, "ever not had
enough money to buy tampax or
sanitary napkins" and whether she
had, "ever not had a piece of meat

on the table for a period of
months."
The applicant, who is from
East Palo Alto and is presently at
tending Loretto Heights College in
Denver, left the interview and im
mediately tried to contact Frank
Satterwhite, a student in the edu
cation school and active member
of the BSU. She reached Satter
white five days later, and he wrote
a letter of protest to University
officials, incluaing President
Kenneth Pitzer.
Satterwhite met with Koff and
University officials a week later.
Following the meeting, Koff
wrote a letter of apology to the
applicant, Clarissa Stevenson.
Applicant Comments
Contacted in Denver last night,
Miss Stevenson reported she had
received the letter from Koff,
"but had not yet decided what to
reply." She said, "I am easy to
placate but the question is not ap
peasing one individual. My experi
ence reveals something about the
institution that employs someone
like Mr. Koff."
The BSU complains in its state
ment that no University official
informed the BSU about the inci
dent, but instead worked behind
the scenes, "to slap the man's
hand."
The BSU reports that other
questions asked by Koff included.
"Have you ever experienced life in
a real ghetto? Have you ever ex
perienced the total despair that a
black man in Philadelphia or Balti
more experiences? Have you ever
not had enough money to see a
dentist or a doctor?"
Koff said yesterday that his
questions were asked in the con
text of philosophical examination
of "socio-economic indices of

ghetto life" and that he never in
tended to insult Miss Stevenson.
Koff further remarked, "Our dis
cussion was meant to be purely
academic and I am extremely
sorry about the misunder
standing."
BSU Statement
According to the BSU docu
ment, Miss Stevenson left the
interview "in both humiliation
and shame after having been sub
jected to the most provocative
and goddamned of inquiries."
The BSU statement demands
that Koff be replaced by a black
professor and administrator. The
BSU says to "look for direct
action" if a black man is not se
lected immediately.
Beyond the Koff incident, the
BSU lashes out at other compara
ble "racist remarks" made on
campus. No other individual refer
ences are made. The statement
briefly refers to examples in the
Medical School, the Spanish de
partment, the Psychology depart
ment, and the History depart
ment.
"We are still waiting" for some
action in all areas, comments the
BSU. The document avoids indi
vidual names to "show our good
faith." It states, however, that
"Good faith lasts but for so long."
STATEMENT OF
THE BLACK STUDENTS UNION
It is OUR opinion, the Stan
ford University Black Students
Union, that a certain faction with
in this institution's hierarchy have
willfully and maliciously withheld
from the students, faculty, and
administrators the occurrences of
a recent interview held on this
campus in which a young Afro-
American girl was subjected to
psychological abuse and subtle
racist innuendo while attempting
to enter the Secondary Teachers
Education Program.
This interview took place on
January 6 at 8:30 am and in
volved Miss Clarissa C. Stevenson,
who grew up in the black ghetto
of East Palo Alto, and Dr. Robert
H. Koff, representative for the
program at Stanford University.
Miss Stevenson, who will be
finishing her undergraduate work

this school year in Colorado, hav
ing won a scholarship while at
tending high school in EPA, had
applied to Stanford after having
heard that there now existed a
good chance for her admittance in
the wake of Stanford's moving to
correct its sad racial imbalances.
Unfortunately, our Soul Sister
found out once she arrived here
that fateful day that "All that
glitters is not gold" could be on
certain occasions and was in this
instance a painfully true observa
tion on the machinations of
human behavior.

At the end of her interview
with Dr. Koff, this young girl left
in both humiliation and shame
after having been subjected to (we
are now told, "unconsciously")
the most provocative and god
damned of inquiries. It is our posi
tion, as Black People functioning
in a world quite accurately des
cribed by the Kerner Report as
"White Racist," that this man
Koff be relieved of his position.
Make no mistake. It is the posi
tion of Stanford University's
Black Students Union that Dr.
Robert H. Koff be taken from his
present position. We want no
apologies, none of the equivoca
ting, not the sleight-of-hand that
resulted, for instance, in the intel
ligence which we have on this situ
ation, which was the property of
Prexy Pitzer (whom, we were led
to believe, wished to establish
racial harmony here at Stanford),
Messrs. Lyman (who, when talking
to MASC on meeting Chicano de
mands for equality said that he
was "quite aware of the problems,
for instance, that black people
have"), Rosenzweig (who had
promised "Good Faith" to us),
Bacchetti, Hess, Black Provost Jim
Simmons, as well as Drs. Elizabeth
Cohen and Byron Sher (slated to
hold forth on the nature of
"Racism and Prejudice" in the
course called by the same name).
Not a one of these people or
parties at any time made any ef
forts to relate or alleviate these
conditions before us, the Execu
tive Committee. Rather, they
went behind the scenes, or so we
are told, to "slap the man's
hand." Not that we are saying
that those parties involved were
not on their jobs; in fact, they
moved quite speedily. Our bitch is
that this happened, that we were
not informed as the official body
of Black People on this campus,
that in fact were it not for the
sensitive response of one man in
fact who did care, we would not
have known anything at all.
For the information of Con
cerned Peoples, here are some of
the statements made that day to a
young girl who was only attempt
ing to apply for Higher Educat..3n
(and, in a roundabout sort of way,
we guess Miss Stevenson now does
possess a "Higher Education").
"Have you ever experienced
life in a real ghetto?"
It appears that Dr. Koff con
ceptualizes ghettoes only in such
visions as Detroit, Newark, South
Philly, Washington, D.C., Watts,
and Harlem burning. Perhaps he
need be told that a black ghetto is
not simply condemned housing,
or long welfare lists dominated by
black women, or unproportion
ately high illegitimacy rates.
In East Palo Alto, for instance,
you are dealing with a black com
munity with a fifth grade reading
level, without any efficient news
service, with a predominantly
black population whose jobs are
in more examples than not the
domestic services. Perhaps not
only Dr. Koff, but a good many
administrators and people in high
places here at Stanford are not
aware that last quarter, for in
stance, the Black Students Union
at Ravenswood High School
mustered the support and muscle
to oust its white principal, Mal
colm Taylor, and replace him
with black principal Earl Mene
weather.
"Have you ever not had a piece
of meat on the table for a period
of months?"
Justice
After having bitten our tongues
for so long, Dear Stanford, and we
speak quite knowledgeably as the
Administration at this institution
well knows, it is time that we re
veal to this school just what is
going on at this school and, more
over, what we want insofar as
Justice is concerned.
Mr. Koff's final statement, as
far as we are now concerned, was
the following. "Have you ever not
had enough money to buy
Tampax or Sanitary Napkins?"
We think it is clear what our
response to this sort of "inter
viewing" is. The facts speak for
themselves. Replace this man with
someone who has, or possesses, a
good more discretion and respect
in these sort of situations. We
want a black man in that post,
and we want one now. If there is
any hedging, look for direct
action on our part.

Racist remarks have also been
made on this campus to minority
students. We wish to refer to the
Medical School Incident, which
we have, on our own part, respect
fully withheld from publicizing,
showing our good faith. We are
still waiting.
Reparations
We wish the Spanish Depart
ment to remember that we are
looking for reparations in .the in
cident in which Our People were
slurred by a member of its teach
ing staff. We are still waiting.
We wish the Department of
Psychology to take heed of our
awareness of one of its teachers,
who again slurred Black People,
and that we are waiting for repara
tions. Good Faith lasts but for so
long. We are still waiting.
We wish for the History De
partment and those concerned
with SES to understand that the
affront to Afro-American dignity
in the slighting of African Civiliza
tion will not be taken lightly and
that we are awaiting reparations.
We will not wait long. Our Broth
ers of the Third World all across
the country are on the move,
making Justice where staid Ad
ministrations have shown them
selves incapable of moving to
make change.
It is quite clear that, for in
stance, were a Black Man to have
accosted a White Woman in this
fashion at Stanford University, he
would be run out of town by sun
down. If this had taken place in
the South, without the shadows
of school buildings, that Black
Man would by now undoubtedly
be hanging by his neck, castrated,
and madv.* a "lesson" for Black
People to remember.
Matches Cheaper
No white woman has been
asked these sort of questions in
applying for admission to any
graduate school anyplace in this
country. If you want to know just
how much we do mean business,
keep in mind that rope for hang
ing black men is a good deal more
expensive than matches that start
fires. Irrational action can only be
met by dealing in the language the
irrational understand.
We leave a way out. We want
Black People in these positions to
avoid these sort of incidents. It
also works as a two-way street.
These same Black People, should
they show these sort of manner
isms, we will move on quickly to
have taken out of those posts.
But there is a need, and a glar
ing one at that, for Black People
in the aforementioned depart
ments, quite definitely in Dr.
Koff's position, and elsewhere in
this institution. We want Black
Administrators, we want Black In
terviewers, we want Black Faculty
Professors, we want Black People
period involved in this school's
functioning or else the whole of
the Stanford experience ranks
only as a farce.
'Erroneous' Mistakes
Do not expect us to sit idly by
while Black courses are shoved off
the boards in the names of "erron
eous" mistakes as was reported in
the handling of African Civiliza
tion. Too many other schools of
far lesser name than Stanford are
making strides to establish Black
Studies Departments for us to be
placated by rationalizations, ali
bis, and plain-and-simple ad
libbing by people who quite clear
ly do not know that they are
dealing with People who have as
much on the ball as they.
Keep this in mind. One profes
sor here stated, on Wednesday,
that "Black people are 200,000
years behind Whites." He just
might believe that and be able to
summon evidence to support his
assertions. But when all of the
talking is over, we are still going
to have our Justice, we are going
to have our Freedom, and nothing
is going to deter us.

parties at any time made any ef
forts to relate or alleviate these
conditions before us, the Execu
tive Committee. Rather, they
went behind the scenes, or so we
are told, to "slap the man's
hand." Not that we are saying
that those parties involved were
not on their jobs; in fact, they
moved quite speedily. Our bitch is
that this happened, that we were
not informed as the official body
of Black People on this campus,
that in fact were it not for the
sensitive response of one man in
fact who did care, we would not
have known anything at all.
For the information of Con
cerned Peoples, here are some of
the statements made that day to a
young girl who was only attempt
ing to apply for Higher Educat..3n
(and, in a roundabout sort of way,
we guess Miss Stevenson now does
possess a "Higher Education").
"Have you ever experienced
life in a real ghetto?"
It appears that Dr. Koff con
ceptualizes ghettoes only in such
visions as Detroit, Newark, South
Philly, Washington, D.C., Watts,
and Harlem burning. Perhaps he
need be told that a black ghetto is
not simply condemned housing,
or long welfare lists dominated by
black women, or unproportion
ately high illegitimacy rates.
In East Palo Alto, for instance,
you are dealing with a black com
munity with a fifth grade reading
level, without any efficient news
service, with a predominantly
black population whose jobs are
in more examples than not the
domestic services. Perhaps not
only Dr. Koff, but a good many
administrators and people in high
places here at Stanford are not
aware that last quarter, for in
stance, the Black Students Union
at Ravenswood High School
mustered the support and muscle
to oust its white principal, Mal
colm Taylor, and replace him
with black principal Earl Mene
weather.
"Have you ever not had a piece
of meat on the table for a period
of months?"
Justice
After having bitten our tongues
for so long, Dear Stanford, and we
speak quite knowledgeably as the
Administration at this institution
well knows, it is time that we re
veal to this school just what is
going on at this school and, more
over, what we want insofar as
Justice is concerned.
Mr. Koff's final statement, as
far as we are now concerned, was
the following. "Have you ever not
had enough money to buy
Tampax or Sanitary Napkins?"
We think it is clear what our
response to this sort of "inter
viewing" is. The facts speak for
themselves. Replace this man with
someone who has, or possesses, a
good more discretion and respect
in these sort of situations. We
want a black man in that post,
and we want one now. If there is
any hedging, look for direct
action on our part.

Racist remarks have also been
made on this campus to minority
students. We wish to refer to the
Medical School Incident, which
we have, on our own part, respect
fully withheld from publicizing,
showing our good faith. We are
still waiting.
Reparations
We wish the Spanish Depart
ment to remember that we are
looking for reparations in .the in
cident in which Our People were
slurred by a member of its teach
ing staff. We are still waiting.
We wish the Department of
Psychology to take heed of our
awareness of one of its teachers,
who again slurred Black People,
and that we are waiting for repara
tions. Good Faith lasts but for so
long. We are still waiting.
We wish for the History De
partment and those concerned
with SES to understand that the
affront to Afro-American dignity
in the slighting of African Civiliza
tion will not be taken lightly and
that we are awaiting reparations.
We will not wait long. Our Broth
ers of the Third World all across
the country are on the move,
making Justice where staid Ad
ministrations have shown them
selves incapable of moving to
make change.
It is quite clear that, for in
stance, were a Black Man to have
accosted a White Woman in this
fashion at Stanford University, he
would be run out of town by sun
down. If this had taken place in
the South, without the shadows
of school buildings, that Black
Man would by now undoubtedly
be hanging by his neck, castrated,
and madv.* a "lesson" for Black
People to remember.
Matches Cheaper
No white woman has been
asked these sort of questions in
applying for admission to any
graduate school anyplace in this
country. If you want to know just
how much we do mean business,
keep in mind that rope for hang
ing black men is a good deal more
expensive than matches that start
fires. Irrational action can only be
met by dealing in the language the
irrational understand.
We leave a way out. We want
Black People in these positions to
avoid these sort of incidents. It
also works as a two-way street.
These same Black People, should
they show these sort of manner
isms, we will move on quickly to
have taken out of those posts.
But there is a need, and a glar
ing one at that, for Black People
in the aforementioned depart
ments, quite definitely in Dr.
Koff's position, and elsewhere in
this institution. We want Black
Administrators, we want Black In
terviewers, we want Black Faculty
Professors, we want Black People
period involved in this school's
functioning or else the whole of
the Stanford experience ranks
only as a farce.
'Erroneous' Mistakes
Do not expect us to sit idly by
while Black courses are shoved off
the boards in the names of "erron
eous" mistakes as was reported in
the handling of African Civiliza
tion. Too many other schools of
far lesser name than Stanford are
making strides to establish Black
Studies Departments for us to be
placated by rationalizations, ali
bis, and plain-and-simple ad
libbing by people who quite clear
ly do not know that they are
dealing with People who have as
much on the ball as they.
Keep this in mind. One profes
sor here stated, on Wednesday,
that "Black people are 200,000
years behind Whites." He just
might believe that and be able to
summon evidence to support his
assertions. But when all of the
talking is over, we are still going
to have our Justice, we are going
to have our Freedom, and nothing
is going to deter us.
The Stanford Black Students
Union (BSU) last night issued a
broad denunciation of "racist" at
titudes in University departments
and schools, including a specific
demand for the immediate resig
nation of an Education School as
sistant professor.
Calling for "no apologies" and
"no equivocating", the BSU
presses for the dismissal of Robert
Koff, claiming he exhibited racist
behavior during a recent admis
sions interview with a black
female applicant.
According to the BSU, Koff,
who is director of the Secondary
Teacher Education Program
(STEP) asked the applicant,
whether she had, "ever not had
enough money to buy tampax or
sanitary napkins" and whether she
had, "ever not had a piece of meat

on the table for a period of
months."
The applicant, who is from
East Palo Alto and is presently at
tending Loretto Heights College in
Denver, left the interview and im
mediately tried to contact Frank
Satterwhite, a student in the edu
cation school and active member
of the BSU. She reached Satter
white five days later, and he wrote
a letter of protest to University
officials, incluaing President
Kenneth Pitzer.
Satterwhite met with Koff and
University officials a week later.
Following the meeting, Koff
wrote a letter of apology to the
applicant, Clarissa Stevenson.
Applicant Comments
Contacted in Denver last night,
Miss Stevenson reported she had
received the letter from Koff,
"but had not yet decided what to
reply." She said, "I am easy to
placate but the question is not ap
peasing one individual. My experi
ence reveals something about the
institution that employs someone
like Mr. Koff."
The BSU complains in its state
ment that no University official
informed the BSU about the inci
dent, but instead worked behind
the scenes, "to slap the man's
hand."
The BSU reports that other
questions asked by Koff included.
"Have you ever experienced life in
a real ghetto? Have you ever ex
perienced the total despair that a
black man in Philadelphia or Balti
more experiences? Have you ever
not had enough money to see a
dentist or a doctor?"
Koff said yesterday that his
questions were asked in the con
text of philosophical examination
of "socio-economic indices of

ghetto life" and that he never in
tended to insult Miss Stevenson.
Koff further remarked, "Our dis
cussion was meant to be purely
academic and I am extremely
sorry about the misunder
standing."
BSU Statement
According to the BSU docu
ment, Miss Stevenson left the
interview "in both humiliation
and shame after having been sub
jected to the most provocative
and goddamned of inquiries."
The BSU statement demands
that Koff be replaced by a black
professor and administrator. The
BSU says to "look for direct
action" if a black man is not se
lected immediately.
Beyond the Koff incident, the
BSU lashes out at other compara
ble "racist remarks" made on
campus. No other individual refer
ences are made. The statement
briefly refers to examples in the
Medical School, the Spanish de
partment, the Psychology depart
ment, and the History depart
ment.
"We are still waiting" for some
action in all areas, comments the
BSU. The document avoids indi
vidual names to "show our good
faith." It states, however, that
"Good faith lasts but for so long."
STATEMENT OF
THE BLACK STUDENTS UNION
It is OUR opinion, the Stan
ford University Black Students
Union, that a certain faction with
in this institution's hierarchy have
willfully and maliciously withheld
from the students, faculty, and
administrators the occurrences of
a recent interview held on this
campus in which a young Afro-
American girl was subjected to
psychological abuse and subtle
racist innuendo while attempting
to enter the Secondary Teachers
Education Program.
This interview took place on
January 6 at 8:30 am and in
volved Miss Clarissa C. Stevenson,
who grew up in the black ghetto
of East Palo Alto, and Dr. Robert
H. Koff, representative for the
program at Stanford University.
Miss Stevenson, who will be
finishing her undergraduate work

this school year in Colorado, hav
ing won a scholarship while at
tending high school in EPA, had
applied to Stanford after having
heard that there now existed a
good chance for her admittance in
the wake of Stanford's moving to
correct its sad racial imbalances.
Unfortunately, our Soul Sister
found out once she arrived here
that fateful day that "All that
glitters is not gold" could be on
certain occasions and was in this
instance a painfully true observa
tion on the machinations of
human behavior.

At the end of her interview
with Dr. Koff, this young girl left
in both humiliation and shame
after having been subjected to (we
are now told, "unconsciously")
the most provocative and god
damned of inquiries. It is our posi
tion, as Black People functioning
in a world quite accurately des
cribed by the Kerner Report as
"White Racist," that this man
Koff be relieved of his position.
Make no mistake. It is the posi
tion of Stanford University's
Black Students Union that Dr.
Robert H. Koff be taken from his
present position. We want no
apologies, none of the equivoca
ting, not the sleight-of-hand that
resulted, for instance, in the intel
ligence which we have on this situ
ation, which was the property of
Prexy Pitzer (whom, we were led
to believe, wished to establish
racial harmony here at Stanford),
Messrs. Lyman (who, when talking
to MASC on meeting Chicano de
mands for equality said that he
was "quite aware of the problems,
for instance, that black people
have"), Rosenzweig (who had
promised "Good Faith" to us),
Bacchetti, Hess, Black Provost Jim
Simmons, as well as Drs. Elizabeth
Cohen and Byron Sher (slated to
hold forth on the nature of
"Racism and Prejudice" in the
course called by the same name).
Not a one of these people or
parties at any time made any ef
forts to relate or alleviate these
conditions before us, the Execu
tive Committee. Rather, they
went behind the scenes, or so we
are told, to "slap the man's
hand." Not that we are saying
that those parties involved were
