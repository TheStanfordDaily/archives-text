## BSU Demands Resignation Of Prof For 'Racist' Admissions Interview 
### PHILIP TAUBMAN 
The Stanford Black Students
Union (BSU) last night issued a
broad denunciation of "racist" at
titudes in University departments
and schools, including a specific
demand for the immediate resig
nation of an Education School as
sistant professor.
Calling for "no apologies" and
"no equivocating", the BSU
presses for the dismissal of Robert
Koff, claiming he exhibited racist
behavior during a recent admis
sions interview with a black
female applicant.
According to the BSU, Koff,
who is director of the Secondary
Teacher Education Program
(STEP) asked the applicant,
whether she had, "ever not had
enough money to buy tampax or
sanitary napkins" and whether she
had, "ever not had a piece of meat

on the table for a period of
months."
The applicant, who is from
East Palo Alto and is presently at
tending Loretto Heights College in
Denver, left the interview and im
mediately tried to contact Frank
Satterwhite, a student in the edu
cation school and active member
of the BSU. She reached Satter
white five days later, and he wrote
a letter of protest to University
officials, incluaing President
Kenneth Pitzer.
Satterwhite met with Koff and
University officials a week later.
Following the meeting, Koff
wrote a letter of apology to the
applicant, Clarissa Stevenson.
Applicant Comments
Contacted in Denver last night,
Miss Stevenson reported she had
received the letter from Koff,
"but had not yet decided what to
reply." She said, "I am easy to
placate but the question is not ap
peasing one individual. My experi
ence reveals something about the
institution that employs someone
like Mr. Koff."
The BSU complains in its state
ment that no University official
informed the BSU about the inci
dent, but instead worked behind
the scenes, "to slap the man's
hand."
The BSU reports that other
questions asked by Koff included.
"Have you ever experienced life in
a real ghetto? Have you ever ex
perienced the total despair that a
black man in Philadelphia or Balti
more experiences? Have you ever
not had enough money to see a
dentist or a doctor?"
Koff said yesterday that his
questions were asked in the con
text of philosophical examination
of "socio-economic indices of

ghetto life" and that he never in
tended to insult Miss Stevenson.
Koff further remarked, "Our dis
cussion was meant to be purely
academic and I am extremely
sorry about the misunder
standing."
BSU Statement
According to the BSU docu
ment, Miss Stevenson left the
interview "in both humiliation
and shame after having been sub
jected to the most provocative
and goddamned of inquiries."
The BSU statement demands
that Koff be replaced by a black
professor and administrator. The
BSU says to "look for direct
action" if a black man is not se
lected immediately.
Beyond the Koff incident, the
BSU lashes out at other compara
ble "racist remarks" made on
campus. No other individual refer
ences are made. The statement
briefly refers to examples in the
Medical School, the Spanish de
partment, the Psychology depart
ment, and the History depart
ment.
"We are still waiting" for some
action in all areas, comments the
BSU. The document avoids indi
vidual names to "show our good
faith." It states, however, that
"Good faith lasts but for so long."
STATEMENT OF
THE BLACK STUDENTS UNION
It is OUR opinion, the Stan
ford University Black Students
Union, that a certain faction with
in this institution's hierarchy have
willfully and maliciously withheld
from the students, faculty, and
administrators the occurrences of
a recent interview held on this
campus in which a young Afro-
American girl was subjected to
psychological abuse and subtle
racist innuendo while attempting
to enter the Secondary Teachers
Education Program.
This interview took place on
January 6 at 8:30 am and in
volved Miss Clarissa C. Stevenson,
who grew up in the black ghetto
of East Palo Alto, and Dr. Robert
H. Koff, representative for the
program at Stanford University.
Miss Stevenson, who will be
finishing her undergraduate work

this school year in Colorado, hav
ing won a scholarship while at
tending high school in EPA, had
applied to Stanford after having
heard that there now existed a
good chance for her admittance in
the wake of Stanford's moving to
correct its sad racial imbalances.
Unfortunately, our Soul Sister
found out once she arrived here
that fateful day that "All that
glitters is not gold" could be on
certain occasions and was in this
instance a painfully true observa
tion on the machinations of
human behavior.

At the end of her interview
with Dr. Koff, this young girl left
in both humiliation and shame
after having been subjected to (we
are now told, "unconsciously")
the most provocative and god
damned of inquiries. It is our posi
tion, as Black People functioning
in a world quite accurately des
cribed by the Kerner Report as
"White Racist," that this man
Koff be relieved of his position.
Make no mistake. It is the posi
tion of Stanford University's
Black Students Union that Dr.
