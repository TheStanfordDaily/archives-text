### 
SAN FRANCISCO (AP)-
Police arrested 380 demonstrators
at strike-troubled San Francisco
State College Thursday in a clash
which began with rock-throwing
and club-swinging and ended in a
three-hour-long shuttle of van
loads of prisoners.
Among those hauled away was
Dr. Nathan Hare, Negro instructor
newly named to head a Black
Studies Department, created to
placate strikers who have kept the
campus in violent turmoil since
last Nov. 6.
The Thursday afternoon arrests
were the first on a massive scale
since the Black Students Union
and the Third World Liberation
Front began the strike.
Some 260 police quickly sur
rounded participants in a for
bidden rally and arrested everyone
inside the ring.
Several heads were bloodied by
nightsticks as police hauled dem

onstrators from the packed ma.
of nearly 400 around the speak
ers' platform on the central cam
pus, but none required hospitali
zation.
One unidentified demonstrator
threw to the ground a fully loaded
.22-caliber pistol.
Rocks sailed from the crowd
and an occasional cherry bomb
exploded over the heads of police
men as they methodically made
arrests and clubbed those who re
sisted .
A parade of patrol wagons and
a large sheriff's van hauled loads
of prisoners away and returned
for more.
Many of the trapped demon
strators waited quietly. Others
screamed obscenities over the
platform loudspeaker.
Across the central campus,
about 50 militants attempted a
diversion.
