# Senate Suggests Joint SES Study
## 
### 
The Academic Senate yester
day called for joint sessions with a
representative student group for
presentation and discussion of
recommendations from the Study
of Education at Stanford (SES).
The 31-4 vote followed a
nearly three-hour discussion, in
cluding a presentation by six
students of the "modest pro
posal" adopted last week by the
student legislature.
The Steering Committee of the
Senate will hold a special meeting
today to draft an official com
munication to ASSU President
Denis Hayes and Legislature
Speaker Yale Braunstein on the
action.
This will include a request
from the Senate to the Legislature
for an opportunity for a small
group of faculty representatives to
present information on the Senate
action to the Legislature, pending
an official response.
Efforts Commended
By unanimous vote, the Senate
commended student efforts now
under way to promote organized
discussion of SES proposals and
urged faculty members to parti
cipate.
The Senate also voted unani
mously to "encourage each facul
ty member to give serious con

sideration to the desirability of
alternate scheduling or the dis
missing of his classes on Tuesday,
Feb. 11, for the purpose of en
abling his students to attend and
participate in organized discussion
of SES proposals."
Last week, the Legislature ap
proved a $100 special appropri
ation requested by Hayes to help
publicize a conference on edu
cational objectives Feb. 10-11.
Now being organized by a volun
teer group headed by John
Kramer, a junior in political
science, the conference program
would include Prof. David
Riesman, co-author of "The Aca
demic Revolution" among its
featured speakers.
Resolutions
In a series of unanimous
actions, the Senate also resolved
that:
Portions of Senate meetings oc
cupied by debate and voting on
SES would be made public to all
faculty, students, and staff. This
action shall not extend to the
right of voice or vote, except for
arrangements by student-faculty
floor management teams made to
further debate on the proposals.
Closed circuit TV would trans
mit these deliberations to Bishop
Auditorium, with broadcasts by
KZSU and direct press coverage.
No votes will be taken on any
SES recommendations prior to
the Senate meeting Feb. 27.
Without dissent, the Senate
also called for creation of a Con
ference Committee to help resolve
differences in action on SES
recommendations between the
Senate and the representative
student group.
The conference committee
would be composed of four
members from each of the two
bodies, chaired by a ninth person
selected by the members. When
the two groups failed to concur,
the differences would be referred
to the conference committee,
whose proposals would then be
placed early on the agendas of
each body for reconsideration.
The group wouiu nave the right
to name the student members of
floor management teams for the
SES proposals. The team for the
first block of SES proposals will
include four students and four
faculty. Proposals concern gradu
ation requirements and policy,
and are now scheduled for presen
tation Feb. 13.
