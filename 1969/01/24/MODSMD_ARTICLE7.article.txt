• SES Debate
Editor, THE DAILY:
At Monday's panel on SES,
some of the debate seemed to
direct the issue into the apparent
conflict between concerning our
selves with the manifestations of
US imperialism in Stanford re
search or concerning ourselves

with education at Stanford, as if
the two were somehow separate.
This apparent (and artificial)
dichotomy needs to be further
looked into.
Norton Barkin made a signifi
cant but confused point when he
said that the University will be
successful if it turns out responsi
ble individuals. Responsible to
whom? Responsible to the world's
population and responsive to their
social needs, or responsible to the
corporate class interests that
finance the education. President
Kenneth Pitzer, for example, as a
man who helped develop the
E-Bomb, and as a director of the
Rand Corporation, is a perfectly
responsible individual—but not to
the NLF (Ho Chi Minh's type of
responsibility would be bad for
the endowment). This is under
standable considering the iiature
of Pitzer's employers (Trustees
and friends). Their vital investment
in the university corporation is
contingent on the financial bene
fits accrued.
This means utilizing Stanford's
physical resources for their needs
(SRI, the Industrial Park, DOD re
search, etc.)
But it also means using edu
cation to serve these same inter
ests: such as emphasizing science
and engineering to train future
technicians; business and law
schools for professional corporate
and government management
training; a social science that em
phasizes acceptance of the status
quo and trains social researchers
for ruling class service; restricting
advanced study to certain areas so
that the students who attain the
professional "academic qualifi
cations" to be hired as professors
will almost automatically be in
the same ideological bag.
After 5,000 years of "prog
ress", profit maximization has be
come the new criterion for
measuring educational quality.
It used to be thought that the
University was supposed to be the
leading institution of social criti
cism, whose chief function was
the "negative" task of en
couraging individual self-criticism
and of making critical and funda
mental analysis of the society and
its over-all needs. It now seems to
me that we are being led off in
other directions, especially when I
hear Robert Walker, head of
general studies, tell David Pugh
that it is "immature" to under
take the task of considering the
role of education in society, an
epistemological and metaphysical
question of the utmost im
portance to every great thinker in
our heritage since Socrates; or
when I hear Sanford Dornbusch,
of the sociology department, com
ment that the most important
things to be considered about SES
are the "nit-picking" details, a
viewpoint which coincides with
his education methods (training
his students to study nit-picking
behavioral social tendencies that
the ruling class just happens to be
interested in and finding out
about, rather than doing, ideologi
cal social analysis).
We have got to start re
developing this critical spirit in
the University, both in thought
and action. Which means asking
yourself what basically needs to
be changed in order for budget
priorities to be re-defined, rather

than just accepting the fact that
we can't get the money now. It
means asking how course content
is indirectly controlled, how pro
fessors are hired, how budgetary
decisions are made— fundamently
and abstractly.
It means not trying to figure
out how to tolerate the present
set-up, but asking how best we
can "negate" the present, build a
new more "responsible" set of
power relationships, and start
building a critical institution and a
critical society, that serves all
human interests and attacks social
problems at their roots. We must
end the old before we can begin
the new.

• Helping SDS
Editor, THE DAILY:
1 don't know if you think we
get some sort of psychological ful
fillment or catharsis out of inci
dents like last Tuesday or what.
Personally, I hate demonstrations
and confrontations.
But, as I understand it, there is
a war going on. One of its lo
cations is Vietnam, where nine
out of ten people killed by SRI
research and by the products of
our trustees' corporations are ci
vilians. The tenth is a member of
the NLF, an organization guilty of
such crimes as driving out foreign
armies and distributing land taken
from absentee landlords to the
peasants. But you know all of
this. Let us put it quite brutally:
if you are against this war, you
should be helping us get rid of the
tools that make it.
Another location of this war is
Thailand, where the same old
story continues. A military dic
tatorship propped up by U.S. aid
ignores the starvation of its
people. Labor unions are out
lawed; thus, the costs are kept low
for Trustee Arbuckle's Utah Con
struction and Mining investment
in Thailand. To make sure that
Thailand's version of the NLF
doesn't change this scenario, SRI
has a fifty-five man counter
insurgency office in Thailand and
is developing "people sniffers"
for use against the rebels.
We have tried to be nice. Last
year at another school, I made a
laughably polite personal protest
and was laughably fluffed off.
Similar attempts have failed here.
The research goes on.
It is obvious that forty people
will not be able to stop this re
search. (Stopping the research, by
the way, is not just another SDS
crybaby hangup. It can be an ef
fective move in conjunction with
the other campuses that have
stopped their war research to
undermine the present war effort.
The demand on the trustees is no
less practical. People with an
interest in the war, if they have
the power, can, will, and have
used university facilities to further
that interest.' We need more
people.
This is very serious. Some of
you idiots are still wearing
McCarthy buttons under your
perma-pressed collars. But the re
search goes on.
It's the type of thing that can
dry up your sense of humor and
strangle your last line of poetry.
