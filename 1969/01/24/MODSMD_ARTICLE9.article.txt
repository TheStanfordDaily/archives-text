## Letter From A Black Part-Time Betty Coed 
### JEANETTE McDONALD 
I've been so fuckin' maternal to white people all my life. Must have
been one of those traits inherited by osmosis from dead black Mam
mies everywhere and through every when. You know when they insult
you and you remind yourself that they're ignorant of how it feels to
be black and really mean you no harm so you shouldn't scream and
alienate them but answer quietly and politely, then carry your cop
out shamefully away? Usually it's the ones you consider your friends,
or who have ingratiated themselves, who do this to you. That means
the mothafuckers must suspect the insult, so they only ask "safe"
niggers.
That night with Nancy makes me understand a lot: why black
white relationships cease whenever the black stops being white. How
it infuriates me to have Nancy say she doesn't really understand the
black problem because she realizes she has never suffered as much and
how she really can't think in black and white terms but that every
body's human to her and just have human problems which are univer
sal and basic and real hang ups!! She can't understand this hatred bit.
She loves. She wishes everybody would love and not go on these
"sociological abstract idealistic problems." All right, she can under
stand why I need to find my blackness, approves it as part of a valid
personal quest, but she's just people, her problems aren't white prob
lems, just people problems. Nancy's right. White is her frame of refer
ence so she can't see white. She doesn't need to find her whiteness
because it doesn't exist in her world, just people exist and then some
colored people. Nancy doesn't understand how this insults me. (May
be integration means both sides sharing both frames of reference.)
Nancy wishes I would concern myself with "universal" "people"
problems like I used to before my "racist" thing, such as an inability
to feel, to express oneself nonverbally, to be sexually and otherwise
uninhibited, to pick up and express the rythmns of the universe, how
to stop aggression in Vietnam, how to make "shy" boys feel aggres
sive, how to escape placidity with job and educational security, how
to retain a sense of individuality in a rising economy, ad infinitum.
UPPER MIDDLE CLASS WHITE HANG UPS!! Shared only by upper
middle class white colored people around the world. NOT UNIVER
SAL ETERNAL HUMAN HANG UPS!! Hmm.
How to get Nancy out of her frame of reference . . . without cop
ping out by going back into hers and explaining coherently, and
cogently to her? Talking black puts her up "tight. But she doesn't
recognize that tension as getting in touch with her whiteness. She
refuses to acknowledge her fear at the thought of finding her white

ness. That tension is only her irritation at you (me) becoming a
myopic racist, and after all the universals we shared together! After all
the times we were real and "just people," sharing "human" hang ups.
Am I to believe that Nancy and I have nothing in common? Am I
to believe that she can't relate to my blackness, my hate, my con
fusion? Am I to believe Nancy doesn't hate, never hated, is incapable
of fear and hate, untouched by the sun that created us, distorted
images of each other? AM I TO UNDERSTAND THAT THERE IS
ONLY A BLACK PROBLEM, that there is no "universal people" or
WHITE PROBLEM?? How monstrous that thought is to me.
I live in a vacuum. There is no equal and opposite in this system.
Nancy has no white problem. She has divorced herself from what her
ancestors perpetrated on me; having realized the inadequacy of guilt
she has absolved herself from feeling it and consequently has nothing
in relation to me, no sense of anything with which to confront my
blackness. She feels satisfied to share the "universals" with me and
wish that I would understand that she understands and sympathizes
with me about that "other" "sociological abstract" problem, but of
course it has little to do with her personal hang ups.
Nancy ( wants to know what good will it do for her to feel whiteâ€”to
go down and identify with that muck? Why do I want her to suffer?
She already felt it once when she was 11, another time at 16. Why
should she dwell on it now, although she'll excuse me for dwelling on
mine. Nancy says she doesn't feel white, could I tell her what it is
she's supposed to feel? What shall I tell Nancy? Is it fear I want her to
feel? Is it hate? Am I just jealous that she can always be basic, univer
sal people while I have this other awareness to deal with? Or do I
believe that she has something locked away inside of her which can
confront my blackness? Nancy is mad that I can't tell her specifically
what it is I want from her. She insinuates that if I can't tell her what
she should feel being white and she's never felt it is adequate proof
that it doesn't exist. Now does it, Jeanette? After all, she never profes
sed to know in the first place, so if you black person can't even
articulate what you want from her whose fault is it? She smirks tri
umphantly. Anyway, according to Nancy, Hesse says in "Steppen
wolf" that people must be prepared to accept and integrate within
themselves all aspects of the basic schizophrenia of the world. She has.
Why can't I? She has accepted the world as is. That is why she per
sonally loves and can't see the difference between black and white.
And that is why I personally hate, as well as love, and know the
difference. That is the difference.
