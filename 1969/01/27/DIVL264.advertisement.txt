WHO AM I?
Is legal education really "education" or is it simply practical training with a
dose of theory here, a hit of bar preparation there?
The answer depends on the questions a law schoo! asks.
Not: What are Vs rights when li misappropriates v, is goods? Or: Does
Miranda apply when the accused confesses on hit? • «y to the police station?
Or, even: What are the differences hetwc-* tiie jurisprudence of Jeremy
llentharn and of 11.L.A. Hart?
All of these arc questions that might be asked.
I)iit they arc not enough—if legal training is to be an education, a process of
growth, lichind all of these questions must stand the persistent inquiries:
Who is man? What are his needs? Mow can he go about understanding them?
Arc there ways by which he might satisfy them?
It legal education does not help us to understand who we are, if it does not
bring to bear the wisdom of the past and the skeptical intelligence of the
present; if it does not make a contribution to the life of intellect, as it does
to the life of practical reason: if it fails to develop the capacity to feel, as it
does the capacity to dispute and arrange; if it neglects to treat its
characteristic conundrums as problems of cpistcmology and psychology and
economics and art; then, no matter how it may satisfy the traditional
criteria, it is not education; indeed, its not even law.
