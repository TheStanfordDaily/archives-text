# Blackout Hits Campus
## 
### 
At 10:44 last night lights
flickered across the Stanford
campus. Less than 30 seconds
later the lights went out.
The power failure hit the
whole campus. Not until
12:15 a.m. did they return. â™¦
But the Stanford Hospital
was not affected. There were
no emergency situations on
campus.
Students greeted the sud
den darkness with impulsive
behavior in many campus
residences. At Wilbur, only
minutes after the lights went
out, men swarmed into
Arroyo, an all freshmen
women's dorm. It took 20
minutes to clear out the men.
Firecrackers sparked
throughout the Wilbur and
Branner complex. Students
followed one another about,
their way lighted by candles
and flashlights.
