## Yet Another Big Week For Films 
### TODD McCARTHY 
To put it quite simply, this is
another big week for films on
campus, with the pictures being of
exceptionally high quality and

representing a large spectrum of
period and origin.
There are now two film series
operating on a Tuesday-Wednes
day basis. This week in Geology
320, Clive Miller is showing three
American films of the early '40's.
"The Magnificent Ambersons"
was Orson Welles' second film and
though some of the classic Welles
touches, such as the Baroque at
mosphere, several-minute takes
and complex tracking shots, are
evident, the film was taken away
from Welles in the cutting stages
and it shows; the picture seems
hurried and compressed in its final
third. Nonetheless, it is very much
worth seeing and the end titles are
inspired. "High Sierra" gives us
Humphrey Bogart in his first star
ring role in a top-budget Warner
Bros, gangster film. Along for the
ride are Ida Lupino, Arthur Ken
nedy and Cornel Wilde. In addi
tion, there is "Calling All Girls," a
twenty-minute "musical retros
pective" by Busby Berkeley. All
in all, it's a fun program.
The history department has
instituted a film series in conjunc
tion with its freshman Western Civ
course but the pictures are any
thing but basic. This week brings
us "Cyrano de Bergerac." The
wonderful play is somewhat di
luted for Hollywood but Jose
Ferrer turns in a tour de force per-

formance which won him an
Academy Award. The film will be
shown in Cubberley on Tuesday
at 7 :30 and on Wednesday at 4:15
and 7:30 for no admission charge.
The I â€”Center's film this week
is "Dead Birds," a 1963 color doc
umentary on the Neolithic civili
zations of Western New Guinea.
To be shown at Cubberley on
Thursday at 8:15, the film studies
a culture which is founded upon
an intricate system of warfare and
revenge.
On Friday, Saturday and Sun
day, part two of the "New Cin
ema" series will be shown in Cub
berley. This program consists of
nine short films and among them
are "All the Boys are Called
Patrick," an early film of God
ard's, "The Apple," by George
Dunning, director of "Yellow
Submarine," two films by
Borowczyk and a revealing cinema
verite' documentary on Hugh Hef
ner called "The Most."
Tresidder's Friday night com
edy is Buster Keaton's "The Gen
eral." Perhaps the epitome of all
chase films, it demonstrates
Keaton's genius for the sight gag
and comic timing.
Judging from the overflow
crowds, Tresidder's Experimental
Film series on Friday at 11 p.m.
in Geology 320 is a smash hit.

This week, seven films will be
shown. Bruce Baillie's "Quixote"
contains some interesting visual
touches but on the whole is too
rambling and unaffecting. His two
short films, however, "Cosmic
Ray" and "Vivian," are supposed
to be total gross-outs. Three films
by Dadaist Man Ray, "Mystery of
the Chateau of Dice," "Return to
Reason" and "Emak Bakia," will
be shown. These shorts were made
in the '20's and are the forerun
ners of today's underground films.
Stan Brakhage's "Blue Moses,"
made in 1962, is, according to
Sheldon Renan in his superb
book, "An Introduction to Ameri
can Underground Film,"a "curious
examination of the relationship
between life in the flesh and life
on the screen."
Movie-goers on Saturday night
have a perplexing choice between
seeing either one of the finest
films ever to come out of France
or Japan; Tresidder's French Film
series is presenting Jean Renoir's
"Rules of the Game" and, due to
rescheduling, "Chusingura" will
be shown this week at Memorial
Auditorium. "Rules of the
Game," released in 1939, stands
as one of the landmarks of French
cinema and is, in its own way, a
forerunner of recent films present
ing cross-sections of a decadent
society, such as "La Dolce Vita"
and "Darling." Be patient with
the film during the first half-hour,
for as it builds it becomes increas
ingly engrossing and revealing.
Renoir himself gives a superb per
formance in a leading role.
"Chusingura," as I noted last
week, is the ultimate in samurai
films and is visually striking. It
will be shown just once at 7:30.
"Cool Hand Luke" is this
week's Sunday flick. A very solid,
entertaining if somewhat flawed
picture, "Luke" offers uniformly
excellent performances by Paul
Newman, George Kennedy
