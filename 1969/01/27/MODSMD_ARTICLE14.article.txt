• Koff A Good Teacher
Editor,THE DAILY:
September 25 was the first day
of my educational psych class-
Education 215, a graduate course.
There was the teacher- black suit,
horn-rimmed glasses, and the most
sour face I have ever set eyes on.
Ugh. Up-tight Koff. I felt a slight
shiver of dread. The feeling grew
when class started. Up-tight Koff
sat on the back of his chair, feet on
the seat: "How many of you are.
undergraduates?" We raised our
hands timidly. "You are aware, of
course, that this is a graduate
course?" Gulp. "What is the title of
this course?" "Would someone tell
me what the title means?" Snap!
Snap! We sputtered along like
guilty elementary-school kids who
were taking an oral quiz and were
being nabbed for not having done
the homework. Anxiety levels rose
as we groped for definitions of edu
cation. Koff never said "right" or
"wrong," "good" or "bad." When
our pulse rates were sufficiently
high, Koff clicked on the tape
recorder and we listened to that
moving interview of the 34-year
old black guy—student, father of
seven. The tape was extremely
powerful, and the class was dead
silent for seconds after Koff
clicked the stop button. Quietly
and soberly: "The title of the
course is 'Psychological Founda
tions of Education'." Somehow I
felt he made his point. Then he
flamed to our class about edu
cation today and how it was
dysfunctional. When we left the
room, people were talking about
getting out of the course, possibili
ties of pass-fail, etc. I shook my
head. "Gawd, an angry young man.
Just what I need!"
Angry young Koff's got an un
nerving style. He hardly lectured in
class, never "told" us anything. We
did a lot of different projects and
exercises—role playing, games,
movies, discussions. As on the first
day, there was no right or wrong.

We felt when a point was made; and
it might have been a different point
for different people. Some criti
cized his class for being un
structured. It was interesting to
view myself and the rest of the
class—very unsure. "Koff, what do
you want?" He never told us. We
could never be sure of him. The
only security came in being sure of
ourselves. Whenever someone tried
to pin him down, the reply was,
"That depends on your learning
team . . .Whatever you decide on."
His group-oriented approach to
learning and other innovative ideas
were likewise criticized by much of
the class. "What's Koff trying to
prove? What's he getting at?" Years
of schooling had made it difficult
(impossible?) for us to perform in
any situation that wasn't ex
plicitly mapped out for us. We had
forgotten how to think. That was
one of his points about
dysfunctional education.
Angry young Koff was hitting
us in the nose with this . . .learning
through confrontation. We felt dis
oriented, confused, unsure, intimi
dated. The man seemed to have
such a condescending manner.
When I caught myself pondering
whether I should get out of the
course or take it pass-fail, I
tightened and determined, "Damn
you, Koff, you're not scaring me
away!" After the initial fear turned
to spite (which is what kept me in
the class at first), I then became
tremendously fascinated by this
man. It's interesting to watch him
confront people. Unfortunately,
some can't take the confrontation.
Consequently, Koff is not among
the most popular of instructors on
Quad.
The guy is rather unapproach
able. Cold, intellectual, abrupt,
blunt—lacking not so much the
public, but moreso the human rela
tions know-how. At the same time,
he is invaluable in terms of edu
cational philosophy and practice.
Good ideas, good organizer, good
worker.

The questions asked in the
Stevenson interview did not shock
or surprise me. Koff would boggle
someone in just that way, and sin
cerely mean it to be "purely aca
demic." What surprises me is how
the school of education could
allow him to serve as an inter
viewer. I find myself torn between
admiring the man greatly for his
educational principles and feeling
sorry for him for his insensitivity
(to everybody). I do not despise
him for being racist. I don't believe
he is.
Learning through confrontation
might work in a classroom or in
STEP; but confrontation tactics
are threatening, if not destructive,
in a one-to-one interview situation
(if Koff's doing the confronting).
Koff should have known that. Per
haps he knows it now. Dismissing
him as director for STEP would be
a blow to our intern program.
Hiring a black interviewer, or any
one else with more public-human
relations skill, would be a solution,
for the alienation problem would
be solved without creating a bigger
problem— finding a replacement
for Koff as director of STEP—no
easy task.
The BSU's demand that Koff be
dismissed disturbs me greatly. I see
him as being invaluable to the
teacher education program. If he
goes, the losers will be STEP and,
indirectly, the children who will be
taught by STEP interns.
Professionally, the man is ex
citing, dynamic— and I really place
him on a pedestal for being the
only teacher who dared us to think
and to care. Personally, he turned
me off at first; but one gets used to
the intellectual cool air after a
while, with a little effort, good will
and/or spite. And if one is sincere
in his concern for improving our
dysfunctional education, one
could actually become very at
tached to Robert H. Koff, strange
as that may seem.

• Call For Resignation
Editor,THE DAILY:
Dr. Koff's recent interview with
Clarissa Stevenson, who had ap
plied to the University as a prospec
tive student, is most distressing. I
find it hard to believe that a
supposedly educated man, nay, a
Stanford professor, would ask an
interviewee such insulting and
stupid questions.
If he is not a racist, Dr. Koff is
obviously not equipped with suf
ficient intelligence to hold his
present job. Tenure or not, I would
agree with the Black Student's
Union's request for his immediate
dismissal. His demonstrated lack of r
sensitivity reflects poorly on the
University.

• Errors In History Story
Editor, THE DAILY:
The article under Barbara
Hyland's byline in the January 23,
1969 issue of the Daily fails ac
curately to report the current situ
ation respecting the status of
History 47, African Civilizations,
in relation to proposals that
students enrolled in that course
might be excused from taking
History 3, a General Studies re
quirement, during the upcoming
Spring quarter.
As a preface to what follows, I
would like to note some of the
more serious factual errors in the
story. 1) It was not the Department
of History, but the Academic
Council of the University that
voted last June 14th to accept an
undergraduate major in African
and Afro-American Studies. 2) The
Department of History did not
"when the major was accepted"
vote on a proposal to substitute
African Civilizations for one
quarter of Western Civilization as a
part of the general proposal. 3) The
entire Department, not just a
majority of the Department, is very

much interested in History 47 and
its success.
At the Department meeting on
May 16, 1968 Professor G.W. John
son proposed that the History De
partment plan to initiate a course
analogous to Western Civilization
entitled African Civilizations. The
Department unanimously ap
proved a motion to support this
proposal in principal.
At the Department meeting on
December 9, 1968 the Department
discussed, for the first time, the
proposal to substitute African Civi
lizations for one quarter of Western
Civilization and voted to recom
mend to the General Studies Com

mittee that it not make the substi
tution of History 47 for History 3
an option open to all students
during Spring quarter of this year.
The Department recommended
that individuals who enroll for the
course might petition the General
Studies Committee for permission
to substitute History 47 for
History 3. Further, the Depart
ment expressed the hope that the
committee might give such peti
tions a sympathetic hearing. The
Department of History was in
formed by the Chairman of the
General Studies Committee that
the committee had voted on Janu
ary 8, 1969 that any student who
takes History 47 and wishes to peti
tion, through normal channels, to
substitute that course for History
3, may do so. Such petitions would
normally go to a General Studies
sub-committee on individual
student petitions to be considered
as all other student petitions are,
on their merits.

• Against Biafra Relief
Editor,THE DAILY:
I respectfully urge the Stanford
community not to support the ef
forts of the Committee for
Biafran-Nigerian Relief. The starva
tion in Biafria is merely a prelude
to mass starvation in Africa in the
near future. The mothers of those
who will die in the great famine
have already been born. The world
cannot feed its next generation of
children.
The money that will be col
lected during the week of January
27—February 2 for the Biafran-
Nigerian relief funds should be
given instead to the United Nations
World Health Organization. The
WHO is working to reduce the mass
starvation of the future in Africa,
Asis, and Central America through
food research and education.
I realize the overpowering
emotional impact of the starving
children in Biafria and Nigeria, but
this terrible starvation will be many
times worse a few years from now.

our pulse rates were sufficiently
high, Koff clicked on the tape
recorder and we listened to that
moving interview of the 34-year
old black guy—student, father of
seven. The tape was extremely
powerful, and the class was dead
silent for seconds after Koff
clicked the stop button. Quietly
and soberly: "The title of the
course is 'Psychological Founda
tions of Education'." Somehow I
felt he made his point. Then he
flamed to our class about edu
cation today and how it was
dysfunctional. When we left the
room, people were talking about
getting out of the course, possibili
ties of pass-fail, etc. I shook my
head. "Gawd, an angry young man.
Just what I need!"
Angry young Koff's got an un
nerving style. He hardly lectured in
class, never "told" us anything. We
did a lot of different projects and
exercises—role playing, games,
movies, discussions. As on the first
day, there was no right or wrong.

We felt when a point was made; and
it might have been a different point
for different people. Some criti
cized his class for being un
structured. It was interesting to
view myself and the rest of the
class—very unsure. "Koff, what do
you want?" He never told us. We
could never be sure of him. The
only security came in being sure of
ourselves. Whenever someone tried
to pin him down, the reply was,
"That depends on your learning
team . . .Whatever you decide on."
His group-oriented approach to
learning and other innovative ideas
were likewise criticized by much of
the class. "What's Koff trying to
prove? What's he getting at?" Years
of schooling had made it difficult
(impossible?) for us to perform in
any situation that wasn't ex
plicitly mapped out for us. We had
forgotten how to think. That was
one of his points about
dysfunctional education.
Angry young Koff was hitting
us in the nose with this . . .learning
through confrontation. We felt dis
oriented, confused, unsure, intimi
dated. The man seemed to have
such a condescending manner.
When I caught myself pondering
whether I should get out of the
course or take it pass-fail, I
tightened and determined, "Damn
you, Koff, you're not scaring me
away!" After the initial fear turned
to spite (which is what kept me in
the class at first), I then became
tremendously fascinated by this
man. It's interesting to watch him
confront people. Unfortunately,
some can't take the confrontation.
Consequently, Koff is not among
the most popular of instructors on
Quad.
The guy is rather unapproach
able. Cold, intellectual, abrupt,
blunt—lacking not so much the
public, but moreso the human rela
tions know-how. At the same time,
he is invaluable in terms of edu
cational philosophy and practice.
Good ideas, good organizer, good
worker.

The questions asked in the
Stevenson interview did not shock
or surprise me. Koff would boggle
someone in just that way, and sin
cerely mean it to be "purely aca
demic." What surprises me is how
the school of education could
allow him to serve as an inter
viewer. I find myself torn between
admiring the man greatly for his
educational principles and feeling
sorry for him for his insensitivity
(to everybody). I do not despise
him for being racist. I don't believe
he is.
Learning through confrontation
might work in a classroom or in
STEP; but confrontation tactics
are threatening, if not destructive,
in a one-to-one interview situation
(if Koff's doing the confronting).
Koff should have known that. Per
haps he knows it now. Dismissing
him as director for STEP would be
a blow to our intern program.
Hiring a black interviewer, or any
one else with more public-human
relations skill, would be a solution,
for the alienation problem would
be solved without creating a bigger
problem— finding a replacement
for Koff as director of STEP—no
easy task.
The BSU's demand that Koff be
dismissed disturbs me greatly. I see
him as being invaluable to the
teacher education program. If he
goes, the losers will be STEP and,
indirectly, the children who will be
taught by STEP interns.
Professionally, the man is ex
citing, dynamic— and I really place
him on a pedestal for being the
only teacher who dared us to think
and to care. Personally, he turned
me off at first; but one gets used to
the intellectual cool air after a
while, with a little effort, good will
and/or spite. And if one is sincere
in his concern for improving our
dysfunctional education, one
could actually become very at
tached to Robert H. Koff, strange
as that may seem.

• Call For Resignation
Editor,THE DAILY:
Dr. Koff's recent interview with
Clarissa Stevenson, who had ap
plied to the University as a prospec
tive student, is most distressing. I
find it hard to believe that a
supposedly educated man, nay, a
Stanford professor, would ask an
interviewee such insulting and
stupid questions.
If he is not a racist, Dr. Koff is
obviously not equipped with suf
ficient intelligence to hold his
present job. Tenure or not, I would
agree with the Black Student's
Union's request for his immediate
dismissal. His demonstrated lack of r
sensitivity reflects poorly on the
University.

• Errors In History Story
Editor, THE DAILY:
The article under Barbara
Hyland's byline in the January 23,
1969 issue of the Daily fails ac
curately to report the current situ
ation respecting the status of
History 47, African Civilizations,
in relation to proposals that
students enrolled in that course
might be excused from taking
History 3, a General Studies re
quirement, during the upcoming
Spring quarter.
As a preface to what follows, I
would like to note some of the
more serious factual errors in the
story. 1) It was not the Department
of History, but the Academic
Council of the University that
voted last June 14th to accept an
undergraduate major in African
and Afro-American Studies. 2) The
Department of History did not
"when the major was accepted"
vote on a proposal to substitute
African Civilizations for one
quarter of Western Civilization as a
part of the general proposal. 3) The
entire Department, not just a
majority of the Department, is very

much interested in History 47 and
its success.
At the Department meeting on
May 16, 1968 Professor G.W. John
son proposed that the History De
partment plan to initiate a course
analogous to Western Civilization
entitled African Civilizations. The
Department unanimously ap
proved a motion to support this
proposal in principal.
At the Department meeting on
December 9, 1968 the Department
discussed, for the first time, the
proposal to substitute African Civi
lizations for one quarter of Western
Civilization and voted to recom
mend to the General Studies Com

mittee that it not make the substi
tution of History 47 for History 3
an option open to all students
during Spring quarter of this year.
The Department recommended
that individuals who enroll for the
course might petition the General
Studies Committee for permission
to substitute History 47 for
History 3. Further, the Depart
ment expressed the hope that the
committee might give such peti
tions a sympathetic hearing. The
Department of History was in
formed by the Chairman of the
General Studies Committee that
the committee had voted on Janu
ary 8, 1969 that any student who
takes History 47 and wishes to peti
tion, through normal channels, to
substitute that course for History
3, may do so. Such petitions would
normally go to a General Studies
sub-committee on individual
student petitions to be considered
as all other student petitions are,
on their merits.

• Against Biafra Relief
Editor,THE DAILY:
I respectfully urge the Stanford
community not to support the ef
forts of the Committee for
Biafran-Nigerian Relief. The starva
tion in Biafria is merely a prelude
to mass starvation in Africa in the
near future. The mothers of those
who will die in the great famine
have already been born. The world
cannot feed its next generation of
children.
The money that will be col
lected during the week of January
27—February 2 for the Biafran-
Nigerian relief funds should be
given instead to the United Nations
World Health Organization. The
WHO is working to reduce the mass
starvation of the future in Africa,
Asis, and Central America through
food research and education.
I realize the overpowering
emotional impact of the starving
children in Biafria and Nigeria, but
this terrible starvation will be many
times worse a few years from now.

• Koff A Good Teacher
Editor,THE DAILY:
September 25 was the first day
of my educational psych class-
Education 215, a graduate course.
There was the teacher- black suit,
horn-rimmed glasses, and the most
sour face I have ever set eyes on.
Ugh. Up-tight Koff. I felt a slight
shiver of dread. The feeling grew
when class started. Up-tight Koff
sat on the back of his chair, feet on
the seat: "How many of you are.
undergraduates?" We raised our
hands timidly. "You are aware, of
course, that this is a graduate
course?" Gulp. "What is the title of
this course?" "Would someone tell
me what the title means?" Snap!
Snap! We sputtered along like
guilty elementary-school kids who
were taking an oral quiz and were
being nabbed for not having done
the homework. Anxiety levels rose
as we groped for definitions of edu

We felt when a point was made; and
it might have been a different point
for different people. Some criti
cized his class for being un
structured. It was interesting to
view myself and the rest of the
class—very unsure. "Koff, what do
you want?" He never told us. We
could never be sure of him. The
only security came in being sure of
ourselves. Whenever someone tried
to pin him down, the reply was,
"That depends on your learning
team . . .Whatever you decide on."
His group-oriented approach to
learning and other innovative ideas
were likewise criticized by much of
the class. "What's Koff trying to
prove? What's he getting at?" Years
of schooling had made it difficult
(impossible?) for us to perform in
any situation that wasn't ex
plicitly mapped out for us. We had
forgotten how to think. That was
one of his points about
dysfunctional education.
Angry young Koff was hitting
us in the nose with this . . .learning
through confrontation. We felt dis
oriented, confused, unsure, intimi
dated. The man seemed to have
such a condescending manner.
When I caught myself pondering
whether I should get out of the
course or take it pass-fail, I
tightened and determined, "Damn
you, Koff, you're not scaring me
away!" After the initial fear turned
to spite (which is what kept me in
the class at first), I then became
tremendously fascinated by this
man. It's interesting to watch him
confront people. Unfortunately,
some can't take the confrontation.
Consequently, Koff is not among
the most popular of instructors on
Quad.
The guy is rather unapproach
able. Cold, intellectual, abrupt,
blunt—lacking not so much the
public, but moreso the human rela
tions know-how. At the same time,
he is invaluable in terms of edu
cational philosophy and practice.
Good ideas, good organizer, good
worker.

The questions asked in the
Stevenson interview did not shock
or surprise me. Koff would boggle
someone in just that way, and sin
cerely mean it to be "purely aca
demic." What surprises me is how
the school of education could
allow him to serve as an inter
viewer. I find myself torn between
admiring the man greatly for his
educational principles and feeling
sorry for him for his insensitivity
(to everybody). I do not despise
him for being racist. I don't believe
he is.
Learning through confrontation
might work in a classroom or in
STEP; but confrontation tactics
are threatening, if not destructive,
in a one-to-one interview situation
(if Koff's doing the confronting).
Koff should have known that. Per
haps he knows it now. Dismissing
him as director for STEP would be
a blow to our intern program.
Hiring a black interviewer, or any
one else with more public-human
relations skill, would be a solution,
for the alienation problem would
be solved without creating a bigger
problem— finding a replacement
for Koff as director of STEP—no
easy task.
The BSU's demand that Koff be
dismissed disturbs me greatly. I see
him as being invaluable to the
teacher education program. If he
goes, the losers will be STEP and,
indirectly, the children who will be
taught by STEP interns.
Professionally, the man is ex
citing, dynamic— and I really place
him on a pedestal for being the
only teacher who dared us to think
and to care. Personally, he turned
me off at first; but one gets used to
the intellectual cool air after a
while, with a little effort, good will
and/or spite. And if one is sincere
in his concern for improving our
dysfunctional education, one
could actually become very at
tached to Robert H. Koff, strange
as that may seem.

• Call For Resignation
Editor,THE DAILY:
Dr. Koff's recent interview with
Clarissa Stevenson, who had ap
plied to the University as a prospec
tive student, is most distressing. I
find it hard to believe that a
supposedly educated man, nay, a
Stanford professor, would ask an
interviewee such insulting and
stupid questions.
If he is not a racist, Dr. Koff is
obviously not equipped with suf
ficient intelligence to hold his
present job. Tenure or not, I would
agree with the Black Student's
Union's request for his immediate
dismissal. His demonstrated lack of r
sensitivity reflects poorly on the
University.

• Errors In History Story
Editor, THE DAILY:
The article under Barbara
Hyland's byline in the January 23,
1969 issue of the Daily fails ac
curately to report the current situ
ation respecting the status of
History 47, African Civilizations,
in relation to proposals that
students enrolled in that course
might be excused from taking
History 3, a General Studies re
quirement, during the upcoming
Spring quarter.
As a preface to what follows, I
would like to note some of the
more serious factual errors in the
story. 1) It was not the Department
of History, but the Academic
Council of the University that
voted last June 14th to accept an
undergraduate major in African
and Afro-American Studies. 2) The
Department of History did not
"when the major was accepted"
vote on a proposal to substitute
African Civilizations for one
quarter of Western Civilization as a
part of the general proposal. 3) The
entire Department, not just a
majority of the Department, is very

much interested in History 47 and
its success.
At the Department meeting on
May 16, 1968 Professor G.W. John
son proposed that the History De
partment plan to initiate a course
analogous to Western Civilization
entitled African Civilizations. The
Department unanimously ap
proved a motion to support this
proposal in principal.
At the Department meeting on
December 9, 1968 the Department
discussed, for the first time, the
proposal to substitute African Civi
lizations for one quarter of Western
Civilization and voted to recom
mend to the General Studies Com

mittee that it not make the substi
tution of History 47 for History 3
an option open to all students
during Spring quarter of this year.
The Department recommended
that individuals who enroll for the
course might petition the General
Studies Committee for permission
to substitute History 47 for
History 3. Further, the Depart
ment expressed the hope that the
committee might give such peti
tions a sympathetic hearing. The
Department of History was in
formed by the Chairman of the
General Studies Committee that
the committee had voted on Janu
ary 8, 1969 that any student who
takes History 47 and wishes to peti
tion, through normal channels, to
substitute that course for History
3, may do so. Such petitions would
normally go to a General Studies
sub-committee on individual
student petitions to be considered
as all other student petitions are,
on their merits.

• Against Biafra Relief
Editor,THE DAILY:
I respectfully urge the Stanford
community not to support the ef
forts of the Committee for
Biafran-Nigerian Relief. The starva
tion in Biafria is merely a prelude
to mass starvation in Africa in the
near future. The mothers of those
who will die in the great famine
have already been born. The world
cannot feed its next generation of
children.
The money that will be col
lected during the week of January
27—February 2 for the Biafran-
Nigerian relief funds should be
given instead to the United Nations
World Health Organization. The
WHO is working to reduce the mass
starvation of the future in Africa,
Asis, and Central America through
food research and education.
I realize the overpowering
emotional impact of the starving
children in Biafria and Nigeria, but
this terrible starvation will be many
times worse a few years from now.

• Koff A Good Teacher
Editor,THE DAILY:
September 25 was the first day
of my educational psych class-
Education 215, a graduate course.
There was the teacher- black suit,
horn-rimmed glasses, and the most
sour face I have ever set eyes on.
Ugh. Up-tight Koff. I felt a slight
shiver of dread. The feeling grew
when class started. Up-tight Koff
sat on the back of his chair, feet on
the seat: "How many of you are.
undergraduates?" We raised our
hands timidly. "You are aware, of
course, that this is a graduate
course?" Gulp. "What is the title of
this course?" "Would someone tell
me what the title means?" Snap!
Snap! We sputtered along like
guilty elementary-school kids who
were taking an oral quiz and were
being nabbed for not having done
the homework. Anxiety levels rose
as we groped for definitions of edu
cation. Koff never said "right" or
"wrong," "good" or "bad." When
our pulse rates were sufficiently
high, Koff clicked on the tape
recorder and we listened to that
moving interview of the 34-year
old black guy—student, father of
seven. The tape was extremely
powerful, and the class was dead
silent for seconds after Koff
clicked the stop button. Quietly
and soberly: "The title of the
course is 'Psychological Founda
tions of Education'." Somehow I
felt he made his point. Then he
flamed to our class about edu
cation today and how it was
dysfunctional. When we left the
room, people were talking about
getting out of the course, possibili
ties of pass-fail, etc. I shook my
head. "Gawd, an angry young man.
Just what I need!"
Angry young Koff's got an un
nerving style. He hardly lectured in
class, never "told" us anything. We
did a lot of different projects and
exercises—role playing, games,
movies, discussions. As on the first
day, there was no right or wrong.

We felt when a point was made; and
it might have been a different point

oriented, confused, unsure, intimi
dated. The man seemed to have
such a condescending manner.
When I caught myself pondering
whether I should get out of the
course or take it pass-fail, I
tightened and determined, "Damn
you, Koff, you're not scaring me
away!" After the initial fear turned
to spite (which is what kept me in
the class at first), I then became
tremendously fascinated by this
man. It's interesting to watch him
confront people. Unfortunately,
some can't take the confrontation.
Consequently, Koff is not among
the most popular of instructors on
Quad.
The guy is rather unapproach
able. Cold, intellectual, abrupt,
blunt—lacking not so much the
public, but moreso the human rela
tions know-how. At the same time,
he is invaluable in terms of edu
cational philosophy and practice.
Good ideas, good organizer, good
worker.

The questions asked in the
Stevenson interview did not shock
or surprise me. Koff would boggle
someone in just that way, and sin
cerely mean it to be "purely aca
demic." What surprises me is how
the school of education could
allow him to serve as an inter
viewer. I find myself torn between
admiring the man greatly for his
educational principles and feeling
sorry for him for his insensitivity
(to everybody). I do not despise
him for being racist. I don't believe
he is.
Learning through confrontation
might work in a classroom or in
STEP; but confrontation tactics
are threatening, if not destructive,
in a one-to-one interview situation
(if Koff's doing the confronting).
Koff should have known that. Per
haps he knows it now. Dismissing
him as director for STEP would be
a blow to our intern program.
Hiring a black interviewer, or any
one else with more public-human
relations skill, would be a solution,
for the alienation problem would
be solved without creating a bigger
problem— finding a replacement
for Koff as director of STEP—no
easy task.
The BSU's demand that Koff be
dismissed disturbs me greatly. I see
him as being invaluable to the
teacher education program. If he
goes, the losers will be STEP and,
indirectly, the children who will be
taught by STEP interns.
Professionally, the man is ex
citing, dynamic— and I really place
him on a pedestal for being the
only teacher who dared us to think
and to care. Personally, he turned
me off at first; but one gets used to
the intellectual cool air after a
while, with a little effort, good will
and/or spite. And if one is sincere
in his concern for improving our
dysfunctional education, one
could actually become very at
tached to Robert H. Koff, strange
as that may seem.

• Call For Resignation
Editor,THE DAILY:
Dr. Koff's recent interview with
Clarissa Stevenson, who had ap
plied to the University as a prospec
tive student, is most distressing. I
find it hard to believe that a
supposedly educated man, nay, a
Stanford professor, would ask an
interviewee such insulting and
stupid questions.
If he is not a racist, Dr. Koff is
obviously not equipped with suf
ficient intelligence to hold his
present job. Tenure or not, I would
agree with the Black Student's
Union's request for his immediate
dismissal. His demonstrated lack of r
sensitivity reflects poorly on the
University.

• Errors In History Story
Editor, THE DAILY:
The article under Barbara
Hyland's byline in the January 23,
1969 issue of the Daily fails ac
curately to report the current situ
ation respecting the status of
History 47, African Civilizations,
in relation to proposals that
students enrolled in that course
might be excused from taking
History 3, a General Studies re
quirement, during the upcoming
Spring quarter.
As a preface to what follows, I
would like to note some of the
more serious factual errors in the
story. 1) It was not the Department
of History, but the Academic
Council of the University that
voted last June 14th to accept an
undergraduate major in African
and Afro-American Studies. 2) The
Department of History did not
"when the major was accepted"
vote on a proposal to substitute
African Civilizations for one
quarter of Western Civilization as a
part of the general proposal. 3) The
entire Department, not just a
majority of the Department, is very

much interested in History 47 and
its success.
At the Department meeting on
May 16, 1968 Professor G.W. John
son proposed that the History De
partment plan to initiate a course
analogous to Western Civilization
entitled African Civilizations. The
Department unanimously ap
proved a motion to support this
proposal in principal.
At the Department meeting on
December 9, 1968 the Department
discussed, for the first time, the
proposal to substitute African Civi
lizations for one quarter of Western
Civilization and voted to recom
mend to the General Studies Com

mittee that it not make the substi
tution of History 47 for History 3
an option open to all students
during Spring quarter of this year.
The Department recommended
that individuals who enroll for the
course might petition the General
Studies Committee for permission
to substitute History 47 for
History 3. Further, the Depart
ment expressed the hope that the
committee might give such peti
tions a sympathetic hearing. The
Department of History was in
formed by the Chairman of the
General Studies Committee that
the committee had voted on Janu
ary 8, 1969 that any student who
takes History 47 and wishes to peti
tion, through normal channels, to
substitute that course for History
3, may do so. Such petitions would
normally go to a General Studies
sub-committee on individual
student petitions to be considered
as all other student petitions are,
on their merits.

• Against Biafra Relief
Editor,THE DAILY:
I respectfully urge the Stanford
community not to support the ef
forts of the Committee for
Biafran-Nigerian Relief. The starva
tion in Biafria is merely a prelude
to mass starvation in Africa in the
near future. The mothers of those
who will die in the great famine
have already been born. The world
cannot feed its next generation of
children.
The money that will be col
lected during the week of January
27—February 2 for the Biafran-
Nigerian relief funds should be
given instead to the United Nations
World Health Organization. The
WHO is working to reduce the mass
starvation of the future in Africa,
Asis, and Central America through
food research and education.
I realize the overpowering
emotional impact of the starving
children in Biafria and Nigeria, but
this terrible starvation will be many
times worse a few years from now.

• Koff A Good Teacher
Editor,THE DAILY:
September 25 was the first day
of my educational psych class-
Education 215, a graduate course.
There was the teacher- black suit,
horn-rimmed glasses, and the most
sour face I have ever set eyes on.
Ugh. Up-tight Koff. I felt a slight
shiver of dread. The feeling grew
when class started. Up-tight Koff
sat on the back of his chair, feet on
the seat: "How many of you are.
undergraduates?" We raised our
hands timidly. "You are aware, of
course, that this is a graduate
course?" Gulp. "What is the title of
this course?" "Would someone tell
me what the title means?" Snap!
Snap! We sputtered along like
guilty elementary-school kids who
were taking an oral quiz and were
being nabbed for not having done
the homework. Anxiety levels rose
as we groped for definitions of edu
cation. Koff never said "right" or
"wrong," "good" or "bad." When
our pulse rates were sufficiently
high, Koff clicked on the tape
recorder and we listened to that
moving interview of the 34-year
old black guy—student, father of
seven. The tape was extremely
powerful, and the class was dead
silent for seconds after Koff
clicked the stop button. Quietly
and soberly: "The title of the
course is 'Psychological Founda
tions of Education'." Somehow I
felt he made his point. Then he
flamed to our class about edu
cation today and how it was
dysfunctional. When we left the
room, people were talking about
getting out of the course, possibili
ties of pass-fail, etc. I shook my
head. "Gawd, an angry young man.
Just what I need!"
Angry young Koff's got an un
nerving style. He hardly lectured in
class, never "told" us anything. We
did a lot of different projects and
exercises—role playing, games,
movies, discussions. As on the first
day, there was no right or wrong.

We felt when a point was made; and
it might have been a different point
for different people. Some criti
cized his class for being un
structured. It was interesting to
view myself and the rest of the
class—very unsure. "Koff, what do
you want?" He never told us. We
could never be sure of him. The
only security came in being sure of
ourselves. Whenever someone tried
to pin him down, the reply was,
"That depends on your learning
team . . .Whatever you decide on."
His group-oriented approach to
learning and other innovative ideas
were likewise criticized by much of
the class. "What's Koff trying to
prove? What's he getting at?" Years
of schooling had made it difficult
(impossible?) for us to perform in
any situation that wasn't ex
plicitly mapped out for us. We had
forgotten how to think. That was
one of his points about
dysfunctional education.
Angry young Koff was hitting
us in the nose with this . . .learning

someone in just that way, and sin
cerely mean it to be "purely aca
demic." What surprises me is how
the school of education could
allow him to serve as an inter
viewer. I find myself torn between
admiring the man greatly for his
educational principles and feeling
sorry for him for his insensitivity
(to everybody). I do not despise
him for being racist. I don't believe
he is.
Learning through confrontation
might work in a classroom or in
STEP; but confrontation tactics
are threatening, if not destructive,
in a one-to-one interview situation
(if Koff's doing the confronting).
Koff should have known that. Per
haps he knows it now. Dismissing
him as director for STEP would be
a blow to our intern program.
Hiring a black interviewer, or any
one else with more public-human
relations skill, would be a solution,
for the alienation problem would
be solved without creating a bigger
problem— finding a replacement
for Koff as director of STEP—no
easy task.
The BSU's demand that Koff be
dismissed disturbs me greatly. I see
him as being invaluable to the
teacher education program. If he
goes, the losers will be STEP and,
indirectly, the children who will be
taught by STEP interns.
Professionally, the man is ex
citing, dynamic— and I really place
him on a pedestal for being the
only teacher who dared us to think
and to care. Personally, he turned
me off at first; but one gets used to
the intellectual cool air after a
while, with a little effort, good will
and/or spite. And if one is sincere
in his concern for improving our
dysfunctional education, one
could actually become very at
tached to Robert H. Koff, strange
as that may seem.

• Call For Resignation
Editor,THE DAILY:
Dr. Koff's recent interview with
Clarissa Stevenson, who had ap
plied to the University as a prospec
tive student, is most distressing. I
find it hard to believe that a
supposedly educated man, nay, a
Stanford professor, would ask an
interviewee such insulting and
stupid questions.
If he is not a racist, Dr. Koff is
obviously not equipped with suf
ficient intelligence to hold his
present job. Tenure or not, I would
agree with the Black Student's
Union's request for his immediate
dismissal. His demonstrated lack of r
sensitivity reflects poorly on the
University.

• Errors In History Story
Editor, THE DAILY:
The article under Barbara
Hyland's byline in the January 23,
1969 issue of the Daily fails ac
curately to report the current situ
ation respecting the status of
History 47, African Civilizations,
in relation to proposals that
students enrolled in that course
might be excused from taking
History 3, a General Studies re
quirement, during the upcoming
Spring quarter.
As a preface to what follows, I
would like to note some of the
more serious factual errors in the
story. 1) It was not the Department
of History, but the Academic
Council of the University that
voted last June 14th to accept an
undergraduate major in African
and Afro-American Studies. 2) The
Department of History did not
"when the major was accepted"
vote on a proposal to substitute
African Civilizations for one
quarter of Western Civilization as a
part of the general proposal. 3) The
entire Department, not just a
majority of the Department, is very

much interested in History 47 and
its success.
At the Department meeting on
May 16, 1968 Professor G.W. John
son proposed that the History De
partment plan to initiate a course
analogous to Western Civilization
entitled African Civilizations. The
Department unanimously ap
proved a motion to support this
proposal in principal.
At the Department meeting on
December 9, 1968 the Department
discussed, for the first time, the
proposal to substitute African Civi
lizations for one quarter of Western
Civilization and voted to recom
mend to the General Studies Com

mittee that it not make the substi
tution of History 47 for History 3
an option open to all students
during Spring quarter of this year.
The Department recommended
that individuals who enroll for the
course might petition the General
Studies Committee for permission
to substitute History 47 for
History 3. Further, the Depart
ment expressed the hope that the
committee might give such peti
tions a sympathetic hearing. The
Department of History was in
formed by the Chairman of the
General Studies Committee that
the committee had voted on Janu
ary 8, 1969 that any student who
takes History 47 and wishes to peti
tion, through normal channels, to
substitute that course for History
3, may do so. Such petitions would
normally go to a General Studies
sub-committee on individual
student petitions to be considered
as all other student petitions are,
on their merits.

• Against Biafra Relief
Editor,THE DAILY:
I respectfully urge the Stanford
community not to support the ef
forts of the Committee for
Biafran-Nigerian Relief. The starva
tion in Biafria is merely a prelude
to mass starvation in Africa in the
near future. The mothers of those
who will die in the great famine
have already been born. The world
cannot feed its next generation of
children.
The money that will be col
lected during the week of January
27—February 2 for the Biafran-
Nigerian relief funds should be
given instead to the United Nations
World Health Organization. The
WHO is working to reduce the mass
starvation of the future in Africa,
Asis, and Central America through
food research and education.
I realize the overpowering
emotional impact of the starving
children in Biafria and Nigeria, but
this terrible starvation will be many
times worse a few years from now.

• Koff A Good Teacher
Editor,THE DAILY:
September 25 was the first day
of my educational psych class-
Education 215, a graduate course.
There was the teacher- black suit,
horn-rimmed glasses, and the most
sour face I have ever set eyes on.
Ugh. Up-tight Koff. I felt a slight
shiver of dread. The feeling grew
when class started. Up-tight Koff
sat on the back of his chair, feet on
the seat: "How many of you are.
undergraduates?" We raised our
hands timidly. "You are aware, of
course, that this is a graduate
course?" Gulp. "What is the title of
this course?" "Would someone tell
me what the title means?" Snap!
Snap! We sputtered along like
guilty elementary-school kids who
were taking an oral quiz and were
being nabbed for not having done
the homework. Anxiety levels rose
as we groped for definitions of edu
cation. Koff never said "right" or
"wrong," "good" or "bad." When
our pulse rates were sufficiently
high, Koff clicked on the tape
recorder and we listened to that
moving interview of the 34-year
old black guy—student, father of
seven. The tape was extremely
powerful, and the class was dead
silent for seconds after Koff
clicked the stop button. Quietly
and soberly: "The title of the
course is 'Psychological Founda
tions of Education'." Somehow I
felt he made his point. Then he
flamed to our class about edu
cation today and how it was
dysfunctional. When we left the
room, people were talking about
getting out of the course, possibili
ties of pass-fail, etc. I shook my
head. "Gawd, an angry young man.
Just what I need!"
Angry young Koff's got an un
nerving style. He hardly lectured in
class, never "told" us anything. We
did a lot of different projects and
exercises—role playing, games,
movies, discussions. As on the first
day, there was no right or wrong.

We felt when a point was made; and
it might have been a different point
for different people. Some criti
cized his class for being un
structured. It was interesting to
view myself and the rest of the
class—very unsure. "Koff, what do
you want?" He never told us. We
could never be sure of him. The
only security came in being sure of
ourselves. Whenever someone tried
to pin him down, the reply was,
"That depends on your learning
team . . .Whatever you decide on."
His group-oriented approach to
learning and other innovative ideas
were likewise criticized by much of
the class. "What's Koff trying to
prove? What's he getting at?" Years
of schooling had made it difficult
(impossible?) for us to perform in
any situation that wasn't ex
plicitly mapped out for us. We had
forgotten how to think. That was
one of his points about
dysfunctional education.
Angry young Koff was hitting
us in the nose with this . . .learning
through confrontation. We felt dis
oriented, confused, unsure, intimi
dated. The man seemed to have
such a condescending manner.
When I caught myself pondering
whether I should get out of the
course or take it pass-fail, I
tightened and determined, "Damn
you, Koff, you're not scaring me
away!" After the initial fear turned
to spite (which is what kept me in
the class at first), I then became
tremendously fascinated by this
man. It's interesting to watch him
confront people. Unfortunately,
some can't take the confrontation.
Consequently, Koff is not among
the most popular of instructors on
Quad.
The guy is rather unapproach
able. Cold, intellectual, abrupt,
blunt—lacking not so much the
public, but moreso the human rela
tions know-how. At the same time,
he is invaluable in terms of edu
cational philosophy and practice.
Good ideas, good organizer, good
worker.

The questions asked in the
Stevenson interview did not shock
or surprise me. Koff would boggle
someone in just that way, and sin
cerely mean it to be "purely aca
demic." What surprises me is how
the school of education could
allow him to serve as an inter
viewer. I find myself torn between
admiring the man greatly for his
