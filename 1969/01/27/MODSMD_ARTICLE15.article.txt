### PAUL RUPERT 
After years of silence, hun
dreds upon hundreds of Stanford
students and faculty have recently
rallied to condemn what they call
the "Gestapo tactics" of that
"neo-Nazi" hybrid of the New
Left, the Stanford SDS. I question
the semantic, political and empiri
cal sense of the critics in this case.
But they have at least come out
against an abstract "violence"
which many of us have condem
ned in many places for years. And
were it true that these men were
really the foes of all tyranny and
injustice, the defenders of a peace
ful order, I might be exceeding
glad.
But somehow, I have real
doubts that all is what it seems. In
my more gracious moments, I
think that such critics might really
be against any violence, anytime,
anyplace—they just don't see it in
all the places we do. So to us the
university perfects and rational
izes the means and ends of vio
lence for a price; to many it seems
a quiet, pleasant place staffed
with gentle people—an empirical
dis-agreement, no doubt. No
doubt.
But in my more cynical mo
ments, I don't think the critics are
really bothered by violence at all.
It is merely a convenient stick
with which to beat the Left over
the head. Any incident, error or
quirk would do. But a small push
comes-to-shove demonstration
does nicely, and all the fears and
angers and guilts of years surface
for a massive, if shaky attack.

This might all be whimsical sur
mise, the incident would blow
over, and no conclusions would be
drawn—except that I am a Stan
ford graduate, a veteran of the
hypothetical, experiment building
social sciences of the many aca
demic technicians who serve up
their tentative findings to us every
quarter. Thus I am led to con
struct an experiment: a relatively
clear-cut case of violence which is
part of a systematic, daily pattern
of inhuman brutality; and a
chance to personally and publicly
condemn it—although, sadly,
there is little chance to affect it.
The test will lie in my personal
count of the number of healthy,
Stanford faces in evidence at an
upcoming demonstration.
General Brutality
The scene of the general brutal
ity, and of the specific incident
which is at hand, is the Presidio in
San Francisco—rolling green
scenic home of the Sixth Army.
The Presidio has little but admin
istrative offices and the SPD
(Special Processing Detachment)
and its stockade. The stockade
presently holds over three times
the men it should, most awaiting
charges and trial for being
AWOL—many for reasons of con
scientious objection to war. The
conditions, according to escapees,
guards, visitors and inmates, are
intolerable. A list of suicide at
tempts for the last few months,
far from complete, includes wrist
cutting, hanging, neck-cutting,
taking poison, metal polish, lye,

liquid detergent, oven cleaner and
shampoo. Only one was success
ful; the others were all treated and
returned to their cells, often for a
second attempt.
The successful one was Private
Richard Bunch, 19. Imprisoned
for going AWOL, Bunch was con
sidered suicidal by his close
friends and mother. She asked in
September, after flying out here
to visit him, that he be released
and committed to an institution.
The Army refused, as is their right
and practice—they being a police
state—without explanation. On
October 11, while on a work de
tail, Bunch asked a guard if he
would shoot him if he tried to es
cape. The guard said he'd have to
try it to find out. Bunch asked
him to aim for his head. Later in
the day Bunch walked away from
his work detail, ignored an order
to halt, and was killed by a shot
gun blast to the head. Suicide
notes were scrawled all over the
walls of Bunch's cell.
Guard Innocent
Three days later, the guard was
found innocent of any wrong
doing, his act was called "justifi
able homicide," and he received
his bonus in cash and leave time,
for apprehending an escapee. Thus
Oct. 14 27 inmates of the stock
ade sat down and refused to move ■
to their work detail in protest of
Bunch's death, stockade condi
tions, and untrained, armed
guards. They were charged with
mutiny—a crime carrying a pos
sible life sentence in times of

"peace," death in times of de
clared war.
Before the hearing of the first
six, a psychiatrist saw five of
them, and recommended that
they be discharged, and given ex
tended psychiatric help. No com
ment. The hearing officer, Capt.
Richard Millard, recommended
that mutiny charges be dropped,
and that all 27 be tried for a crime
which carried a six-month sen
tence.
He said, "To charge these men
with mutiny for demonstrating
against conditions which exist in
the Stockade is, in my opinion, a
miscarriage of justice."
Mutiny Stuck
No one on top agreed. The
mutiny charges stuck, all the way
up to General Larsen, Commander
of the Sixth Army. The trial of
the first six begins on Tuesday,
with the rest to follow in Febru
ary. In the last similar case we
know of, sentence was fifty years.
So, for the champions of peace
in the face of tyranny and injus
tice, there will be a demonstration
on Tuesday, Jan. 28 at noon, at
the corner of Lyon and Lombard
Streets, the Presidio gates.
I expect there will be over a
thousand people there from Stan
ford, given our hatred of violence.

for going AWOL, Bunch was con
sidered suicidal by his close
friends and mother. She asked in
September, after flying out here
to visit him, that he be released
and committed to an institution.
The Army refused, as is their right
and practice—they being a police
state—without explanation. On
October 11, while on a work de
tail, Bunch asked a guard if he
would shoot him if he tried to es
cape. The guard said he'd have to
try it to find out. Bunch asked
him to aim for his head. Later in
the day Bunch walked away from
his work detail, ignored an order
to halt, and was killed by a shot
gun blast to the head. Suicide
notes were scrawled all over the
walls of Bunch's cell.
Guard Innocent
Three days later, the guard was
found innocent of any wrong
doing, his act was called "justifi
able homicide," and he received
his bonus in cash and leave time,
for apprehending an escapee. Thus
Oct. 14 27 inmates of the stock
ade sat down and refused to move ■
to their work detail in protest of
Bunch's death, stockade condi
tions, and untrained, armed
guards. They were charged with
mutiny—a crime carrying a pos
sible life sentence in times of

"peace," death in times of de
clared war.
Before the hearing of the first
six, a psychiatrist saw five of
them, and recommended that
they be discharged, and given ex
tended psychiatric help. No com
ment. The hearing officer, Capt.
Richard Millard, recommended
that mutiny charges be dropped,
and that all 27 be tried for a crime
which carried a six-month sen
tence.
He said, "To charge these men
with mutiny for demonstrating
against conditions which exist in
the Stockade is, in my opinion, a
miscarriage of justice."
Mutiny Stuck
No one on top agreed. The
mutiny charges stuck, all the way
up to General Larsen, Commander
of the Sixth Army. The trial of
the first six begins on Tuesday,
with the rest to follow in Febru
ary. In the last similar case we
know of, sentence was fifty years.
So, for the champions of peace
in the face of tyranny and injus
tice, there will be a demonstration
on Tuesday, Jan. 28 at noon, at
the corner of Lyon and Lombard
Streets, the Presidio gates.
I expect there will be over a
thousand people there from Stan
ford, given our hatred of violence.
After years of silence, hun
dreds upon hundreds of Stanford
students and faculty have recently
rallied to condemn what they call
the "Gestapo tactics" of that
"neo-Nazi" hybrid of the New
Left, the Stanford SDS. I question
the semantic, political and empiri
cal sense of the critics in this case.
But they have at least come out
against an abstract "violence"
which many of us have condem
ned in many places for years. And
were it true that these men were
really the foes of all tyranny and
injustice, the defenders of a peace
ful order, I might be exceeding
glad.
But somehow, I have real
doubts that all is what it seems. In
my more gracious moments, I
think that such critics might really
be against any violence, anytime,
anyplace—they just don't see it in
all the places we do. So to us the
university perfects and rational
izes the means and ends of vio
lence for a price; to many it seems
a quiet, pleasant place staffed
with gentle people—an empirical
dis-agreement, no doubt. No
doubt.
But in my more cynical mo
ments, I don't think the critics are
really bothered by violence at all.
It is merely a convenient stick
with which to beat the Left over
the head. Any incident, error or
quirk would do. But a small push
comes-to-shove demonstration
does nicely, and all the fears and
angers and guilts of years surface
for a massive, if shaky attack.

This might all be whimsical sur
mise, the incident would blow
over, and no conclusions would be
drawn—except that I am a Stan
ford graduate, a veteran of the
hypothetical, experiment building
social sciences of the many aca
demic technicians who serve up
their tentative findings to us every
quarter. Thus I am led to con
struct an experiment: a relatively
clear-cut case of violence which is
part of a systematic, daily pattern
of inhuman brutality; and a
chance to personally and publicly
condemn it—although, sadly,
there is little chance to affect it.
The test will lie in my personal
count of the number of healthy,
Stanford faces in evidence at an
upcoming demonstration.
General Brutality
The scene of the general brutal
ity, and of the specific incident
which is at hand, is the Presidio in
San Francisco—rolling green
scenic home of the Sixth Army.
The Presidio has little but admin
istrative offices and the SPD
(Special Processing Detachment)
and its stockade. The stockade
presently holds over three times
the men it should, most awaiting
charges and trial for being
AWOL—many for reasons of con
scientious objection to war. The
conditions, according to escapees,
guards, visitors and inmates, are
intolerable. A list of suicide at
tempts for the last few months,
far from complete, includes wrist
cutting, hanging, neck-cutting,
taking poison, metal polish, lye,

liquid detergent, oven cleaner and
shampoo. Only one was success
ful; the others were all treated and
returned to their cells, often for a
second attempt.

doubts that all is what it seems. In
my more gracious moments, I
think that such critics might really
be against any violence, anytime,
anyplace—they just don't see it in
all the places we do. So to us the
university perfects and rational
izes the means and ends of vio
lence for a price; to many it seems
a quiet, pleasant place staffed
with gentle people—an empirical
dis-agreement, no doubt. No
doubt.
But in my more cynical mo
ments, I don't think the critics are
really bothered by violence at all.
It is merely a convenient stick
with which to beat the Left over
the head. Any incident, error or
quirk would do. But a small push
comes-to-shove demonstration
does nicely, and all the fears and
angers and guilts of years surface
for a massive, if shaky attack.

This might all be whimsical sur
mise, the incident would blow
over, and no conclusions would be
drawn—except that I am a Stan
ford graduate, a veteran of the
hypothetical, experiment building
social sciences of the many aca
demic technicians who serve up
their tentative findings to us every
quarter. Thus I am led to con
struct an experiment: a relatively
clear-cut case of violence which is
part of a systematic, daily pattern
of inhuman brutality; and a
chance to personally and publicly
condemn it—although, sadly,
there is little chance to affect it.
The test will lie in my personal
count of the number of healthy,
Stanford faces in evidence at an
upcoming demonstration.
General Brutality
The scene of the general brutal
ity, and of the specific incident
which is at hand, is the Presidio in
San Francisco—rolling green
scenic home of the Sixth Army.
The Presidio has little but admin
istrative offices and the SPD
(Special Processing Detachment)
and its stockade. The stockade
presently holds over three times
the men it should, most awaiting
charges and trial for being
AWOL—many for reasons of con
scientious objection to war. The
conditions, according to escapees,
guards, visitors and inmates, are
intolerable. A list of suicide at
tempts for the last few months,
far from complete, includes wrist
cutting, hanging, neck-cutting,
taking poison, metal polish, lye,

liquid detergent, oven cleaner and
shampoo. Only one was success
ful; the others were all treated and
returned to their cells, often for a
second attempt.
The successful one was Private
Richard Bunch, 19. Imprisoned
for going AWOL, Bunch was con
sidered suicidal by his close
friends and mother. She asked in
September, after flying out here
to visit him, that he be released
and committed to an institution.
The Army refused, as is their right
and practice—they being a police
state—without explanation. On
October 11, while on a work de
tail, Bunch asked a guard if he
would shoot him if he tried to es
cape. The guard said he'd have to
try it to find out. Bunch asked
him to aim for his head. Later in
the day Bunch walked away from
his work detail, ignored an order
to halt, and was killed by a shot
gun blast to the head. Suicide
notes were scrawled all over the
walls of Bunch's cell.
Guard Innocent
Three days later, the guard was
found innocent of any wrong
doing, his act was called "justifi
able homicide," and he received
his bonus in cash and leave time,
for apprehending an escapee. Thus
Oct. 14 27 inmates of the stock
ade sat down and refused to move ■
to their work detail in protest of
Bunch's death, stockade condi
tions, and untrained, armed
guards. They were charged with
mutiny—a crime carrying a pos
sible life sentence in times of

"peace," death in times of de
clared war.
Before the hearing of the first
six, a psychiatrist saw five of
them, and recommended that
they be discharged, and given ex
tended psychiatric help. No com
ment. The hearing officer, Capt.
Richard Millard, recommended
that mutiny charges be dropped,
and that all 27 be tried for a crime
which carried a six-month sen
tence.
He said, "To charge these men
with mutiny for demonstrating
against conditions which exist in
the Stockade is, in my opinion, a
miscarriage of justice."
Mutiny Stuck
No one on top agreed. The
mutiny charges stuck, all the way
up to General Larsen, Commander
of the Sixth Army. The trial of
the first six begins on Tuesday,
with the rest to follow in Febru
ary. In the last similar case we
know of, sentence was fifty years.
So, for the champions of peace
in the face of tyranny and injus
tice, there will be a demonstration
on Tuesday, Jan. 28 at noon, at
the corner of Lyon and Lombard
Streets, the Presidio gates.
I expect there will be over a
thousand people there from Stan
ford, given our hatred of violence.
After years of silence, hun
dreds upon hundreds of Stanford
students and faculty have recently
rallied to condemn what they call
the "Gestapo tactics" of that
"neo-Nazi" hybrid of the New
Left, the Stanford SDS. I question
the semantic, political and empiri
cal sense of the critics in this case.
But they have at least come out
against an abstract "violence"
which many of us have condem
ned in many places for years. And
were it true that these men were
really the foes of all tyranny and
injustice, the defenders of a peace
ful order, I might be exceeding
glad.
But somehow, I have real
doubts that all is what it seems. In
my more gracious moments, I
think that such critics might really
