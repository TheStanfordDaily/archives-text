# Legislature Stymied In Stormy Session
## 
### 
Amid the fiery declarations of speaker Yale Braunstein, the insis
tings of a concerned Denis Hayes, and the angry conflicts of several of
its members, the Stanford student legislature (LASSU) in a special
session last Thursday tried in vain to decide on the procedure for
choosing students to the newly-formed SES Education Council.
According to the proposal to set up the group which was approved
by the Academic Senate last Wednesday, the representative student
body will meet in joint sessions with the Senate for presentation and
discussion of SES recommendations.
After nearly three hours of debate, a motion to choose the 53
student members by a general election of the student body was tabled
until further deliberation.
Opposition to the motion came from members who felt that an
election for such a large number would be unfeasible because of the
usual campus apathy regarding elections.
A selection committee, on the other hand, would be able to judge
candidates by application forms which include explanations of
candidates' activities and a 250-word statement required from each
dealing with some substantive aspect of SES.
, Others felt that the power to decide on the members of such a vital
council rightfully belongs to the associated students and not to a small
selection committee.
The composition of the student committee, in addition, was
extensively deliberated. Member Jim Spickard proposed that the
election be organized by the Hare system of proportional
representation to choose 26 undergraduates and 27 graduate students
to the committee. The students would be elected from their respective
schools, also designating the undergraduate general studies program as
a separate school.
A compromise amendment approved stating that all 53 members
would be elected at large by the Hare system, with no specifications as
to undergraduate-graduate composition or equivalent representation
from the various fields of study.
Alternate proposals will also be discussed at the next LASSU
meeting this Wednesday at 7 :30 p.m. in room 370.
