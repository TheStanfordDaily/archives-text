# SF State Crisis
## Smith Warns Of Closure 
### 
San Francisco State College
will probably be closed for spring
semester unless someone finds a
way to move the current dispute
from stalemate, former President
Robert R. Smith told a Stanford
audience Friday noon.
Prof. Smith was a guest of the
Stanford Education Association,
an organization of graduate stu
dents in the School of Education.
Someone should set up an
"organized locus" as a hub around
which negotiations could revolve,
he said, and supply them with
enough money to accomplish
something.
In answer to a question from
the audience, Prof. Smith said he
had no other solutions to the
problem of the embattled campus,
because the dispute now encom
passes "Gov. Reagan, the State
Superintendent of Public Instruc
tion, the legislature, the faculty
and students, organized labor and
the Bay Area community."
"Unless the governor and the
legislature take some positive
action," the former SF State pres
ident told about 200 persons in
Cubberley Auditorium, "we will
be in an attrition-bred stalemate
that cannot be coped with and
may well spread to all other 18
state colleges.
"Business As Usual"
Prof. Smith reviewed his six
months' tenure as president, from
last May to November, and said he
quit because "the problems and

the danger were so acute, and the
responses to my pleas for help
from the trustees were 'business as
usual.' "
He indicated that retaliation
against his college was in payment
for the alleged embarrassment of
the entire system and that Califor
nia's right and left political wings
had selected S.F. State as the bat
tleground.
Added to this is the factor that
"you can't change anything in ed
ucation without getting into the
basic social issues of our time,"
and the fact that the state college
trustees still think they are dealing
with 18-year-olds instead of
young adults of 24 or 25.
"Cultural Reappraisal"
Prof. Smith stressed the dire
need of a "cultural reappraisal" of
the needs of all the people who
have been excluded from higher
education, a need for adminis
trative changes on a five-year
cycle, and the need for the use of
state colleges' own institutional
research facilities on the study of
human relations.
The state system also needs a
separation of the functions of the
dean of students' office from
social control of the campus, and
the managing of complaints "with
a tough sense of justice" like the
larger society, he suggested. "Sup
portive activities" should be sepa
rated from all the others on
campus.
A strong effort must be made

to include those who feel power
less, he added. "We made some
moves in that direction, but they
were not sufficient."
His frustrating experiences with
the State College Board of
Trustees included their refusal to
boost his budget by $1 million,
"dispensable, at his discretion, to
relieve some of the tensions." The
trustees also rejected a new
student union, money for cultural
activities, and giving him power to
handle the George Murray issue.

and students, organized labor and
the Bay Area community."
"Unless the governor and the
legislature take some positive
action," the former SF State pres
ident told about 200 persons in
Cubberley Auditorium, "we will
be in an attrition-bred stalemate
that cannot be coped with and
may well spread to all other 18
state colleges.
"Business As Usual"
Prof. Smith reviewed his six
months' tenure as president, from
last May to November, and said he
quit because "the problems and

the danger were so acute, and the
responses to my pleas for help
from the trustees were 'business as
usual.' "
He indicated that retaliation
against his college was in payment
for the alleged embarrassment of
the entire system and that Califor
nia's right and left political wings
had selected S.F. State as the bat
tleground.
Added to this is the factor that
"you can't change anything in ed
ucation without getting into the
basic social issues of our time,"
and the fact that the state college
trustees still think they are dealing
with 18-year-olds instead of
young adults of 24 or 25.
"Cultural Reappraisal"
Prof. Smith stressed the dire
need of a "cultural reappraisal" of
the needs of all the people who
have been excluded from higher
education, a need for adminis
trative changes on a five-year
cycle, and the need for the use of
state colleges' own institutional
research facilities on the study of
human relations.
The state system also needs a
separation of the functions of the
dean of students' office from
social control of the campus, and
the managing of complaints "with
a tough sense of justice" like the
larger society, he suggested. "Sup
portive activities" should be sepa
rated from all the others on
campus.
A strong effort must be made

to include those who feel power
less, he added. "We made some
moves in that direction, but they
were not sufficient."
His frustrating experiences with
the State College Board of
Trustees included their refusal to
boost his budget by $1 million,
"dispensable, at his discretion, to
relieve some of the tensions." The
trustees also rejected a new
student union, money for cultural
activities, and giving him power to
handle the George Murray issue.
San Francisco State College
will probably be closed for spring
semester unless someone finds a
way to move the current dispute
from stalemate, former President
Robert R. Smith told a Stanford
audience Friday noon.
Prof. Smith was a guest of the
Stanford Education Association,
an organization of graduate stu
dents in the School of Education.
Someone should set up an
"organized locus" as a hub around
which negotiations could revolve,
he said, and supply them with
enough money to accomplish
something.
In answer to a question from
the audience, Prof. Smith said he
had no other solutions to the
problem of the embattled campus,
because the dispute now encom
passes "Gov. Reagan, the State
Superintendent of Public Instruc
tion, the legislature, the faculty
and students, organized labor and
the Bay Area community."
