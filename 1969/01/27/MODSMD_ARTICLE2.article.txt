# Colleges Discuss Adding Females

"Stanford is a model upon
which we would like to pattern
ourselves," according to John
Wilkinson, Associate Dean of Yale
College. Such was the general
agreement among several school
administrators who recently held
a special conference here at
Stanford.
These men, a collection of
deans, directors, and provosts,
met January 23-24 to compare
notes in several common problem
areas. Chicago, Columbia, Cornell,
Yale, Harvard, M.1.T., Princeton,
and Stanford each had a repre
sentative. Discussions topics
ranged from grading practices to
student designed curricula.
However, most interesting to
many of the administrators is the
co-ed atmosphere here at Stan
ford. Yale, Princeton, and Harvard
are all planning to go co-ed next
year and look to Stanford as an
example of the problems and
promises of such a pattern in a
large private university.
All three schools are looking
forward to the switch and do not
anticipate any major problems in
adjustment. Most are not taking a
too cautious approach and will
leave much of the decisions over
any new regulations to the
students themselves.
Dean Wilkinson, for example,
favors the absence of all regu
lations for women. He diligently
searched for any official regu
lations "for women only" at
Stanford and found none. He also
disclosed that at Yale letters have
been written to all clubs, includ
ing secret societies, recommending
that they admit women to their
ranks.
Edward Wilcox, Director of
General Education at Harvard,
sees co-ed living as a welcome
complication in student life. "It
should make the campus more
interesting, differentiated, and
rich—a more fruitful environment
for human living."
However, Georges May, Dean
of Yale College, feels that the
nominal 500 girls which Yale will
admit next fall will not do away

with the "mixer" atmosphere
which "smothers" Yale on week
ends. "I think there are some Yale
men who will treat Yale women as
Harvard does Radcliffe—they will
have nothing fo do with them."
But he wouldn't hesitate sending
his daughter to Yale—"l don't
think it matters that five men are
calling you up for a date, or two,
does it?"
Most thought that it will be the
women's colleges that will suffer
most in the switch to co-ed living,
and they envision a kind of rivalry
among Yale, Harvard, and Prince
ton for best female applicants.

ton for best female applicants.
"Stanford is a model upon
which we would like to pattern
ourselves," according to John
Wilkinson, Associate Dean of Yale
College. Such was the general
agreement among several school
administrators who recently held
a special conference here at
Stanford.
These men, a collection of
deans, directors, and provosts,
met January 23-24 to compare
notes in several common problem
areas. Chicago, Columbia, Cornell,
Yale, Harvard, M.1.T., Princeton,
and Stanford each had a repre
sentative. Discussions topics
ranged from grading practices to
student designed curricula.
However, most interesting to
many of the administrators is the
co-ed atmosphere here at Stan
ford. Yale, Princeton, and Harvard
are all planning to go co-ed next
year and look to Stanford as an
example of the problems and
promises of such a pattern in a
large private university.
All three schools are looking
forward to the switch and do not
anticipate any major problems in
adjustment. Most are not taking a
too cautious approach and will
leave much of the decisions over
any new regulations to the
students themselves.
Dean Wilkinson, for example,
favors the absence of all regu
lations for women. He diligently
searched for any official regu
lations "for women only" at
Stanford and found none. He also
disclosed that at Yale letters have
been written to all clubs, includ
ing secret societies, recommending
that they admit women to their
ranks.
Edward Wilcox, Director of
General Education at Harvard,
sees co-ed living as a welcome
complication in student life. "It
should make the campus more
interesting, differentiated, and
rich—a more fruitful environment
for human living."
However, Georges May, Dean
of Yale College, feels that the
nominal 500 girls which Yale will
admit next fall will not do away

with the "mixer" atmosphere
which "smothers" Yale on week
ends. "I think there are some Yale
men who will treat Yale women as
Harvard does Radcliffe—they will
have nothing fo do with them."
But he wouldn't hesitate sending
his daughter to Yale—"l don't
think it matters that five men are
calling you up for a date, or two,
does it?"
Most thought that it will be the
women's colleges that will suffer
most in the switch to co-ed living,
and they envision a kind of rivalry
among Yale, Harvard, and Prince
ton for best female applicants.
