will be trying to reach the entire
university community in their

In addition there will be a fast

only condition is that participa

short film called "Biafran Trag
edy" and, if he returns from the
scene in time, a short talk by Mr.

Much of the committees man
power and the financial support
for basic operational needs comes
from Serra, the Community
Action House in Stern Hall. Serra
has officially sponsored the com
mittee.
Donations
Other houses and living groups
are considering, or have already
donated money for the relief
fund. El Tigre eating club, and
Branner Hall have each given
$100.00.
All funds collected by the com
mittee will be channeled through
Church World Service, an agency
of the World Council of Churches.
It works in conjunction with:
CARITAS, The International
Catholic Relief Service; the Amer
ican Catholic Relief Service; the
Jewish Relief Service; and Nord
churchaid, a Scandinavian church
group.
Church World Service is being
used because the committee feels
that it is the most efficient organi
zation that serves the needs of the
people in both Biafran and Niger
ian controlled areas. It is also free
from political affiliations or imp
lications.
