# Dickson In Near Upset
## Cal Trims Tribe 
### GARY CAVALLI 
The California gymnastics team held a reunion in the Stanford
Pavilion Saturday night.
The occasion was the Bear-Indian gymnastics meet, pitting the deep,
experienced Cal contingent against the Indians of Coach Dan Millman,
the man who had led the Bears to their first NCAA championship one
year ago.
Despite losing their two best gynmasts—Millman and Sid
Freudenstein—off the 1968 squad—the Bears should once again be
national contenders. In George Greenfield they have one of the top
all-around men in the country, and No. 2 man Gary Diamond is not far
behind. They have depth in every event, and more importantly, they
have a winning attitude.
Going into the meet Cal was, understandably, the heavy favorite over
a thin, experienced Tribe team. Millman kiddingly suggested that a
Stanford upset would be "comparable to our second-string basketball
team beating UCLA with Lew Alcindor on a good night."
Yet the Indian gymnasts didn't roll over and play dead when the
powerful Bears strode into the old Pavilion. Knowing they had little
chance for a team victory, the Indians set out to earn a respectable score
against the defending NCAA champs, and to show that they were a team
to be reckoned with in the future. Millman's men accomplished both
objectives.
The final point spread was nearly 30 points (155.35-126.05), but it
was Stanford's highest team output of the season, "It was easily our best
effort," Millman said afterwards, "and it came against tough judging."
Team competition quickly faded into the background, however,
when it became apparent that Stanford's Craig Dickson might pull an
upset in the all-around. Prior to the meet Dickson was expected to battle
Diamond for second, with first place conceded to the brilliant
Greenfield. But Dickson had other ideas.
After five events Dickson was leading Greenfield 43.1 to 43.0, but
the final event—high bar—is Greenfield's strongest. The Cal sensation ran
through a nearly flawless routine, receiving a 9.4 from the judges. A
determined Dickson almost pulled it out, following with an excellent
8.95 exhibition, but fell ,35 point short. The final totals were 52.4 for
Greenfield, 52.05 for Dickson.
Overall, Dickson's was a more consistent performance. He placed in
every event—taking third in free exercise (8.8), second on the side horse
(7.9), third on the still rings (8.9), third in vaulting (8.45), and second on
the parallel bars (9.05), before his 8.95 third-place finish on the high bar.
Greenfield faltered on the side horse (7.4) and still rings (8.25), but
more than made up for it by taking firsts in the remaining four events,
with 9.1 in free exercise, 9.05 in vaulting, 9.2 on the parallel bars, and
the decisive 9.4 on the high bar.
Millman, of course, was extremely pleased with Dickson's effort,
which was a three-point improvement over his previous best. "Beating
Greenfield—one of the best all-around gymnasts in the nation—would've
been just tremendous," Stanford's first-year coach enthused. "But after
tonight's performance, Craig will be nationally-ranked in the all-around.
He was fantastic."
Another highlight for Stanford was the outstanding still rings routine
by sophomore Steve Rochell, who took first place with 9.4.
With Dickson, a junior, and Rochell coming back in 1970, Millman's
next confrontation with his former teammates may be even more
encouraging.

the man who had led the Bears to their first NCAA championship one
year ago.
Despite losing their two best gynmasts—Millman and Sid
Freudenstein—off the 1968 squad—the Bears should once again be
national contenders. In George Greenfield they have one of the top
all-around men in the country, and No. 2 man Gary Diamond is not far
behind. They have depth in every event, and more importantly, they
have a winning attitude.
Going into the meet Cal was, understandably, the heavy favorite over
a thin, experienced Tribe team. Millman kiddingly suggested that a
Stanford upset would be "comparable to our second-string basketball
team beating UCLA with Lew Alcindor on a good night."
Yet the Indian gymnasts didn't roll over and play dead when the
powerful Bears strode into the old Pavilion. Knowing they had little
chance for a team victory, the Indians set out to earn a respectable score
against the defending NCAA champs, and to show that they were a team
to be reckoned with in the future. Millman's men accomplished both
objectives.
The final point spread was nearly 30 points (155.35-126.05), but it
was Stanford's highest team output of the season, "It was easily our best
effort," Millman said afterwards, "and it came against tough judging."
Team competition quickly faded into the background, however,
when it became apparent that Stanford's Craig Dickson might pull an
upset in the all-around. Prior to the meet Dickson was expected to battle
Diamond for second, with first place conceded to the brilliant
Greenfield. But Dickson had other ideas.
After five events Dickson was leading Greenfield 43.1 to 43.0, but
the final event—high bar—is Greenfield's strongest. The Cal sensation ran
through a nearly flawless routine, receiving a 9.4 from the judges. A
determined Dickson almost pulled it out, following with an excellent
8.95 exhibition, but fell ,35 point short. The final totals were 52.4 for
Greenfield, 52.05 for Dickson.
Overall, Dickson's was a more consistent performance. He placed in
every event—taking third in free exercise (8.8), second on the side horse
(7.9), third on the still rings (8.9), third in vaulting (8.45), and second on
the parallel bars (9.05), before his 8.95 third-place finish on the high bar.
Greenfield faltered on the side horse (7.4) and still rings (8.25), but
more than made up for it by taking firsts in the remaining four events,
with 9.1 in free exercise, 9.05 in vaulting, 9.2 on the parallel bars, and
the decisive 9.4 on the high bar.
Millman, of course, was extremely pleased with Dickson's effort,
which was a three-point improvement over his previous best. "Beating
Greenfield—one of the best all-around gymnasts in the nation—would've
been just tremendous," Stanford's first-year coach enthused. "But after
tonight's performance, Craig will be nationally-ranked in the all-around.
He was fantastic."
Another highlight for Stanford was the outstanding still rings routine
by sophomore Steve Rochell, who took first place with 9.4.
With Dickson, a junior, and Rochell coming back in 1970, Millman's
next confrontation with his former teammates may be even more
encouraging.
The California gymnastics team held a reunion in the Stanford
Pavilion Saturday night.
The occasion was the Bear-Indian gymnastics meet, pitting the deep,
experienced Cal contingent against the Indians of Coach Dan Millman,
the man who had led the Bears to their first NCAA championship one
year ago.
