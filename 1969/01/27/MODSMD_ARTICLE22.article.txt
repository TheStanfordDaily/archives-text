# Shelley Sets Record
## 
### 
A pouring rain could not stop
either the varsity or Freshman di
visions of the Stanford swimming
program from breaking records and
defeating opponents over the
weekend.
Coach Jim Gaughran's water
men came through in fine fashion
Saturday in a double dual meet in
volving the Tribe varsity, FrosTi,
the Santa Clara Swim Club, and the
Foothill Aquatic Club.
The varsity won against both
Santa Clara and Foothill by
healthy margins. Santa Clara fell,
70-43, while Foothill lost by an
even bigger score, 78-35.
It was individual efforts on the
Frosh side that brightened the
gloomy day, rather than team vic
tories. SCSC beat the freshmen,
68-37, as did Foothill, 62-43.
Freshman Mark Shelley set a
new NCAA freshman record in the
1000 yard freestyle event with a
time of 10:01.1. Shelley also
missed another record in the 200
breaststroke by only .1 of a second.
He swam a 2:12.9 to win the event.

Bob Bebb splashed in with a
22.3 time in the 50 yard freestyle
to take a second for the Frosh.
The varsity was by no means
slighted by the young Indians, as
they themselves turned in out
standing performances.
John Ferris won the 200 indi
vidual medley in 1:59.6, with
teammate Pete Siebert right behind
him with a 2:01.1. Bob Jamison
took the 200 free in 1:47.2.
The Stanford swimmers now
hold down the fastest times in the
nation for the 200, 500,1000, and
200 breaststroke.
