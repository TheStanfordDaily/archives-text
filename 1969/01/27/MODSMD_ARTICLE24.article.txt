### 
The Stanford ice hockey team
continued its winning ways Friday
night with a close 12-10 win over
the Peninsula Hockey Club. The
game, played at the Belmont Ice
land ran the Indians' record to 3-0
in their first season of play.
The outcome of the contest was
in doubt until the final minutes of
play when Bob Kadlec and Bob
Stoller each pushed in goals to
"ice" the game.
Defensive lapses were costly for

Stanford, as they have been in
every game so far this year. Though
the defense is improving, it is clear
that it will have to tighten up as
tougher competition is faced. More
experienced squads play the Tribe
in the near future.
The game against Menlo College
scheduled for Tuesday night has
been postponed due to exams at
Menlo. Instead, the hour, begin
ning at 9:15 p.m. will be used for
