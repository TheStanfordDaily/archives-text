# Palmer, Griff Star
## Cagers Destroy Dons 
### FRED MANN 
The University of San Francisco
basketball squad came on to the
court Friday night in their green
uniforms and high top black tennis
shoes. Visions of Bill Russell,
former USF great and star of the
green-clad Boston Celtics filled the
new Roscoe Maples Pavilion.
Unfortunately for USF, the
glory of Russell has long since
faded, and although they may have
come on the floor looking like the
Celtics, the Dons left looking more
like an elementary school team.
Bill Palmer, Don Griffin, and
Dennis O'Neill took control of the
game from the opening tip, and
totally desecrated USF, 81-48, be
fore 3,610 fans.
Stanford played another out
standing game, just as they have for
the past two weeks, but this time
they were blessed with a weak op
ponent. Griffin funneled in 25
points for high point honors, and
moved into the fifth spot on the
Indians' All-Time leading scorers
list. Number four on the list is the
great Hank Luisetti ('36-'3B) who
hit 1,191 points in his career. Griff
has 1,059 currently and must main
tain his better than 20 point per
game average to take over the
fourth spot.
Friday night, the co-captain
clicked on 10 of 18 shots from the
floor and 5 of 7 free throws for his

25 tallies. He also sat out six
minutes of the contest when the
game was in the bag for the Cards.
The finest effort of the evening
was turned in by Stanford's big
center Bill Palmer. The 6-7 strong
man totally dominated the game
underneath the basket on both
ends of the court. USF'sonly hope
for victory was 6-9 middle man
Pete Cross. But he was stopped by
Palmer time and again and was
held to only 8 points.
Cross left the game holding his
right ankle midway through the
second half with the Dons trailing
by 26. It was a combination of the
ankle and Palmer that hurt him all
night.
On offense, Palmer came up
with a couple of unbelievable re
cerse layups, and fed his teammates
beautifully. At the other end, he
was busy blocking shots and
sweeping the defensive boards
along with Mai McElwain and Mike
Michel. Stanford had 55 rebounds
to USF's 36.
O'Neill continued his, accurate
shooting, clicking on 6 of 8 shots
from all over the court. He was 3-3
from the charity line for his 15
points.
Bill Halligan followed with 9,
McElwain with 8, and Palmer with
7 for the winners.
Howie Dallmar's contingent hit
a solid 48.6 per cent during the ball

game, while a tough Indian defense
and poor USF shooting held the
losers to 28.1 percent.
Ron Santos and Curtis Hinton
popped 11 apiece for the Dons,
whose season record slipped to
4-12. The Tribe is now 5-10, but
still seeking their first Pacific Eight
victory.
Coach Dallmar went to his
bench early in the game and used
his reserves freely in this, the first
laugher the Cards have been in all
year. Dave Druliner sparked the
late game action for Stanford, and
Fred Green provided the muscle.
The Indians jumped out to an
early lead as the Dons just could
not get a shot off. After nine
minutes, they found themselves
down by 12 with only 9 points
showing on the board. USF's
Charlie Dullea could not handle
Griffin, who constantly got himself
open for shots from every di
rection.
More than just his shooting,
Griffin directed the Stanford win
with expert passing, hitting open
men underneath the bucket all
evening.
The Cards ran their opponents
crazy and utilized numerous long
passes for fast break layups. If an
outside jumper was missed, one of
the Stanford big men was always
there for the rebound and second
shot.
