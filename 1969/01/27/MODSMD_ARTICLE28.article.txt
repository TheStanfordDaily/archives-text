# Wage, Grievance Problems
## Employees Explain Demands 
### LYNNE McCALLISTER 
"We have met with the Establishment," said
Mike Fineo, President of the Stanford Employees
Association (SEA), at a meeting last Tuesday night
in Bishop Auditorium. The meeting was called to
discuss SEA's recent demands to the Stanford
Administration, and the formulation of a new
grievance procedure for members of the
organization.
SEA was founded last June, according to Dan
West, director of the Public Relations Committee,
because of difficulties in the University corporation
yard. Since then they have joined the California
School Employees Association (CSEA), which has
helped them to organize.
The members of SEA are all non-academic
Stanford personnel. Since June, the membership has
grown to 800.
Demands Explained
Mike Fineo explained the five demands which
SEA has made to the Stanford Administration.
These include the designation of SEA and Stanford
representatives to discuss employer-employee
relationships, the formation of a joint SEA-Stanford
Committee to deal with grievances, and a wage and
classification survey of all non-academic positions.

Payroll deduction of dues and office space for SEA
are also requested.
Fineo told the members of the advances that have
been made so far. SEA officials met with Daryl
Dawson, Associate Staff Council for Business Affairs,
Dwight Adams, Business Manager, and Joseph
Scroggs, Director of Personnel. Adams has agreed to
write a letter to all employees recognizing SEA as an
organization.
"Nice Titles"
"We have a grievance program," said Fineo.
Grievances include poor working conditions,
complaints about bosses, and low pay. "They give
you nice titles, but no salary," explained West.
Fineo assured the members that"no member, if he
files a grievance, will be persecuted for it. No one has
to be afraid. We have had a few cases of grievances
now, and they have changed their tune quite a bit."
Robert Mills, head of SEA's research committee,
said that they had talked to all personnel directors
asking for a central clearing office, "so that when a
man is laid off he can Â£et a job somewhere else in the
University."
Fineo stressed the importance of a recruiting
program now going on. He asked current members to
spread the word to other employees.
