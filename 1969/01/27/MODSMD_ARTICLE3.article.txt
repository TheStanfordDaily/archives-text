# Overseas Study
## Critics Laud SES Report 
### MARGIE WOLF 
Extensive overseas campus re
forms proposed by the Study of
Education are receiving applause
from several students involved in
the programs.
Will Hobbs, who was active last
fall in a student counter-orien
tation to official University prepa
ration for an overseas stay, praised
the SES study.

"It's basically pretty good," he
said, noting especially the em
phasis on language, independent
study, and granting each campus
more autonomy.
The report suggests replacing
the broad authority of Overseas
Campus Director Robert Walker
with five campus governing com
mittees. Each committee would
include three faculty members

and students, and would send
its chairman to an inter-campus
coordinating committee.
Another proposal would re
move control of overseas
campuses from the General
Studies Committee, which Walker
also heads, and place the program
under an assistant dean in the
office of the proposed Dean of
Undergraduate Studies.
The Stanford system is "the
best of any American university,"
the report says, but "there are
areas where we think the program
can and should be improved."
"The thing that really upsets
me," Hobbs said, "is that the
program is now run like a pleasure
cruise for dolts—it's not challeng
ing at all. Students have no say.
It's really nice for a while. Then
you say, 'What have I done?' It
has worked so far because
students only go for six months.
If they went longer, they would
get sick of it."
Hobbs, a member of the Ger
many XX group, explained the
importance of campus autonomy
in taking full advantage of living
in a foreign country. "As a united
thing, overseas campuses can't
work," he judged.
Mark Edwards, student member
of the SES Overseas Campus
Committee, related a "remarkable
agreement from the beginning"
within the committee.
He predicted students would
support the committee because it
produced one of the most liberal
reports. Faculty members would
also concur, he guessed, because
they had been seeking a greater
say in the program for some time.
Walker seemed to be the only
one with a stake in keeping the
present system, Edwards said,
"and he doesn't seem to have
much of a chance."
The Daily will probe Walker's
reaction to the report tomorrow.


STORM DAMAGE—State officials estimated yesterday that storm dam
age in California has been roughly $35 million in the past nine days.
Here passers-by help lift a tree near the bookstore which had been
blown over this weekend by the rain-laden wind. President Richard
Nixon has proclaimed the state a national disaster area because of the
ravages of water and wind.
Charles Simpson, chief of the California Disaster Office, praised the
effectiveness of the state's dams but said Riverside and San Bernardino
counties faced "one of the worst events in their history in terms of
flooding.
