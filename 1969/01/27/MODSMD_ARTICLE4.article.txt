# Physics Theorist Leads Senate
## 
### SUSAN SWARD 
Leonard Schiff is a soft-spoken man who
is known for several roles he plays within the
Stanford community.
His colleagues generally speak of him as
"Stanford's high-powered physics theorist."
This year he is also the focus of attention in
his position as Chairman of the Academic
Senate. He also sits on the President's Advis
ory Board and on the Study of Education at
Stanford (SES) Steering Committee.
Schiff, who came to Stanford in 1947 as
an associate professor of physics, said, "I
have been Chairman of the Senate since its
inception last July. It's actually a dual job-
Chairman of the Senate and Chairman of the
Senate Steering Committee."
The Steering Committee, according to
Schiff, sets the agenda for the Academic
Senate meetings. Most items get on the
agenda in a "natural fashion"—either be
cause they are old business or because they
are matters attended to by committees with
in the Senate.
Senate Action
If a faculty member petitions to put
something on the agenda which the Steering
Committee does not consider appropriate
for hearing by the Senate, the faculty mem
ber may introduce the item from the floor
under "new business." A faculty or non
faculty person may petition to put an item
on the agenda under the section entitled
"For the Good of the University."
This possibility of petition "is an impor
tant mode of expression for people who
want to be heard by the Senate," Schiff said.
As Chairman of the Senate, Schiff pre
sides over the body when it is in session.
"The chairman is the focus of all sorts of
matters people think are worthy of attention
by the Senate. I try to recognize people on
the floor to speak in the order in which they
ask for recognition.
To Be Fair
"One of the hardest things is trying to be
fair in the recognition of people from the
floor," Schiff admitted. "Of course, there

are always those who speak out more than
others."
Speaking about the function the Aca
demic Senate has within the University,
Schiff said, "So far the Senate has fulfilled
its role as a representative action body of the
faculty. I see no reason why it shouldn't
continue succeeding in this fashion."
Schiff is not new to the administrative
problems he meets as Senate Chairman.
From 1948 to 1966, he was head of the
physics department. Even with this previous
experience, Schiff finds the work load facing
the Academic Senate (o be very heavy. He
isolates several reasons for the amount of
work before the Senate.
Backlog
"There is a backlog of things that have to
be done," he said. "There is the growing
activism of students, and as a result, more
and more questions have been brought to
the faculty for consideration. And finally,
there is the SES report."
When questioned about the role of stu
dents in the consideration of the SES re
ports, Schiff replied, "I don't think this is a
very substantive issue, but instead it is a
matter of form. The Senate view is that the
Senate is responsible to the Academic Coun
cil and that the Senate is perfectly happy to
meet with student representatives for discus
sion.
"But the Senate should be voting by it
self, and students should be voting by them
selves. The Senate was set up to represent
faculty and not faculty-and-students. There
fore, it should vote as a faculty body."
Room for Discussion
Schiff went on to point out, "This leaves
all the room in the world for discussion be
tween faculty and students on the commit
tee the Academic Senate has moved to set
up."
The Chairman of the Senate is not overly
optimistic when he discusses how long it will
take the Senate to get through the SES pro
posals.

"I can't imagine we'll get through much
more than the first and second volume by
the end of this year," Schiff remarked.
"Hopefully sometime by the end of the next
academic year we'll be done with our consid
erations on the proposals.
With so many demands on his time,
Schiff has little time to himself.
"I would like much more time for what
the kids call 'free reading.' For exercise I
swim every day steadily for twenty minutes.
The weather doesn't matter once you get in
the water. I'Ve been swimming sometimes
when I lift my hand out of the water for a
stroke and it practically freezes."
Schiff states that he longs "for the days
of just teaching and research." Next year his
dream may be realized when he goes on sab
batical from Stanford to the University of
London. There he will be involved primarily
with research in the fields of high energy
physics and general relativity.

Leonard Schiff is a soft-spoken man who
is known for several roles he plays within the
Stanford community.
His colleagues generally speak of him as
"Stanford's high-powered physics theorist."
This year he is also the focus of attention in
his position as Chairman of the Academic
Senate. He also sits on the President's Advis
ory Board and on the Study of Education at
Stanford (SES) Steering Committee.
Schiff, who came to Stanford in 1947 as
an associate professor of physics, said, "I
have been Chairman of the Senate since its
inception last July. It's actually a dual job-
Chairman of the Senate and Chairman of the
Senate Steering Committee."
The Steering Committee, according to
Schiff, sets the agenda for the Academic
Senate meetings. Most items get on the
agenda in a "natural fashion"—either be
cause they are old business or because they
are matters attended to by committees with
in the Senate.
Senate Action
If a faculty member petitions to put
something on the agenda which the Steering
Committee does not consider appropriate
for hearing by the Senate, the faculty mem
ber may introduce the item from the floor
under "new business." A faculty or non
faculty person may petition to put an item
on the agenda under the section entitled
"For the Good of the University."
This possibility of petition "is an impor
tant mode of expression for people who
want to be heard by the Senate," Schiff said.
As Chairman of the Senate, Schiff pre
sides over the body when it is in session.
"The chairman is the focus of all sorts of
matters people think are worthy of attention
by the Senate. I try to recognize people on
the floor to speak in the order in which they
ask for recognition.
To Be Fair
"One of the hardest things is trying to be
fair in the recognition of people from the
floor," Schiff admitted. "Of course, there

are always those who speak out more than
others."
Speaking about the function the Aca
demic Senate has within the University,
Schiff said, "So far the Senate has fulfilled
its role as a representative action body of the
faculty. I see no reason why it shouldn't
continue succeeding in this fashion."
Schiff is not new to the administrative
problems he meets as Senate Chairman.
From 1948 to 1966, he was head of the
physics department. Even with this previous
experience, Schiff finds the work load facing
the Academic Senate (o be very heavy. He
isolates several reasons for the amount of
work before the Senate.
Backlog
"There is a backlog of things that have to
be done," he said. "There is the growing
activism of students, and as a result, more
and more questions have been brought to
the faculty for consideration. And finally,
there is the SES report."
When questioned about the role of stu
dents in the consideration of the SES re
ports, Schiff replied, "I don't think this is a
very substantive issue, but instead it is a
matter of form. The Senate view is that the
Senate is responsible to the Academic Coun
cil and that the Senate is perfectly happy to
meet with student representatives for discus
sion.
"But the Senate should be voting by it
self, and students should be voting by them
selves. The Senate was set up to represent
faculty and not faculty-and-students. There
fore, it should vote as a faculty body."
Room for Discussion
Schiff went on to point out, "This leaves
all the room in the world for discussion be
tween faculty and students on the commit
tee the Academic Senate has moved to set
up."
The Chairman of the Senate is not overly
optimistic when he discusses how long it will
take the Senate to get through the SES pro
posals.

"I can't imagine we'll get through much
more than the first and second volume by
the end of this year," Schiff remarked.
"Hopefully sometime by the end of the next
academic year we'll be done with our consid
erations on the proposals.
With so many demands on his time,
Schiff has little time to himself.
"I would like much more time for what
the kids call 'free reading.' For exercise I
swim every day steadily for twenty minutes.
The weather doesn't matter once you get in
the water. I'Ve been swimming sometimes
when I lift my hand out of the water for a
stroke and it practically freezes."
Schiff states that he longs "for the days
of just teaching and research." Next year his
dream may be realized when he goes on sab
batical from Stanford to the University of
London. There he will be involved primarily
with research in the fields of high energy
physics and general relativity.
