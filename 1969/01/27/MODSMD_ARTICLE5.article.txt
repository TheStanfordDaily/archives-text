# Racist Charges To Be Investigated
## 
### MICHAEL KUHL 
The Human Relations Commis
sion will investigate charges of
alleged racism made against Edu
cation School Prof. Robert Koff
last Friday.
Commission Chairman Byron
Sher said the body will consider
the matter at its January 31
meeting. The investigation will be
made in reply to a request from
President Kenneth Pitzer and
Dean H. Thomas James of the
Education Department.
The Black Student Union
(BSU) called on the University
last Thursday night to replace
Koff for subjecting Clarissa
Stevenson, a black co-ed at
Loretto Heights College in

Denver, "to the most provocative
and goddamned of inquiries."
The matter was iirst taken
under consideration at its January
17 meeting, according to Sher.
The group decided at that time to
allow for a meeting between Koff
and Dean James, Vice-Provost
Herbert Packer, education grad
and BSU member student Frank
Satterwhite, Assistant Provost
James Simmons, and Warren
Hay man, a former student.
After allowing time for
Simmons to "report on the
information obtained at the ses
sion with Prof. Koff," Sher
reported to Pitzer on Saturday
that the gi'oup would begin
investigation of the case.
The case has stirred widespread
campus interest, as evidenced by
the volume of letters which
appear in today's Daily.
In an open letter to the
Stanford community which fol
lows this article, Pitzer and
Provost Richard Lyman character
ized Stanford's minority group
program as "one of substantial
progress combined with a firm
commitment to continue along
the road on which we have
started."
"This does not mean that there
are no problems or that we are
doing all that we want to do,"
they added.
The two top University ad
ministrators referred to threats of
violence in the official BSU
statement as not only "un
necessary," but "in fact counter
productive."
Various members of the Edu
cation Department have sought to
discount the "racist" charges
being leveled.
Lewis Knight, Coordinator of
Supervision in the Secondary
Teachers Education Program,
(STEP), referred to Koff in a
letter to the editor as "sensitive to
minority group concerns."
"Under his leadership, we have
established the recruiting and
admitting of minority groups as
definite priorities for the pro
gram," Knight said.
In December, two black
students were sent on a recruiting
trip to the Southeastern U.S.
Koff is also conducting a
research project in East Palo Alto
that includes tutoring of first
graders by sixth graders to im
prove reading skills.
To the Stanford Community:
The statement by the Black
Student Union printed in Friday
morning's Daily raises issues that
require a response to the entire
University community. With re
spect to the specific charge against
Prof. Robert Koff of the School
of Education, which is the im
mediate occasion of the BSU
statement, we want to report that
President Pitzer has asked the
Stanford Human Relations Com
mission to conduct a full investi
gation of the charges and to
report its conclusions and recom
mendations to him at the earliest

possible date. We understand that
Dean James of the School of
Education is addressing a parallel
request to the Commission. This is
the proper forum in which alle
gations of this kind ought to be
heard and it would be inappropri
ate for us to comment further on
the substance of the charges until
the Commission has made its
report.
It is important to put this
declaration of the Black Student
Union in the perspective of what
has happened at Stanford in the
last year. Earlier in this academic
year, Provost Lyman reported to
the community on developments
at Stanford with respect to
minority group students and pro
grams. It is fair to say that the
record is one of substantial
progress combined with a firm
commitment to continue along
the road on which we have
started.
That progress could not have
been made without the sustained
participation of the Black Student
Union and the Mexican-American
Student Confederation. Black and
brown students have worked hard
and well on our programs on the
understanding that the University
is serious about its commitment
and is genuinely moving forward.
It is particularly unfortunate in
the light of what has happened
over the last year that the BSU
statement contains language that
can only be described as threaten
ing. The fact is that the regular
processes of the University are
working. This does not mean that
there are no problems or that we
are doing all that we want to do.

It does mean that we will
continue to make progress only so
long as all of the elements of this
community—black, brown, and
white—work together coopera
tively.
Threats of violence not only are
unnecessary, they are in fact
counter-productive. We intend to
see that the regular processes of
the University are used in the
resolution of problems that arise
and to assure, furthermore, that
those processes work in a fair and
timely manner.
In the other charges that are
contained in the BSU statement,
there is one point of procedure
which ought to be clarified. The
letter which brought to the
attention of the administration
the allegation against Prof. Koff
was sent to Assistant Provost
James Simmons and copies of the
letter were sent to a number of
other people in the University
including an officer of the Black
Student Union. Two BSU mem
bers were present when faculty
members and administrators dis
cussed the letter with Prof. Koff
Jan. 17. A copy of his reply,
apologizing to Miss Stevenson,
was sent to the same BSU officer
who received the complaint. It
was assumed, therefore, that the
BSU was informed of the sub
stance of the charges and the
response to them, and it is
difficult to understand the BSU
statement that "we were not
informed as the official body of
Black people on this campus."

In addition to the charges
against Prof. Koff, the BSU
statement refers to a number of
other incidents on the campus.
The statement says "racist re
marks have also been made on this
campus to minority students." On
Nov. 27, 1968, Dr. Robert Glaser,
Prof. Leonard Schiff, and Mr.
Simmons joined us in a statement
to the community in which we
deplored any statements of this
kind by faculty or staff of the
University and made it clear that
such statements had no place in
this University.
The reference to the History
Department evidently concerns
the report in the Jan. 23 Daily
that the Department had declined
to approve the new course in
African Civilizations as a substi
tute for the third quarter of the
Western Civilization sequence. We
understand that the Department
of History will have a statement
of its own correcting errors in the
Daily story (see page 3).
Finally, it must be understood
by all that as the University moves
ahead to fulfill its commitments,
there will inevitably be conflict.
The varying perspectives of the
people involved insure this. The
question, then, is how these
conflicts are to be resolved. The
means are present in the Uni
versity to resolve them con
structively.

Richard Lyman, Provost
