## Doctors Alter Sex 
### MARSHALL KILDUFF 
Somewhere between male and
female lies the transsexual, a
deeply troubled "twilight person
ality" who possesses the body of
one sex but the mind of the other.
To help this individual, the Stan
ford Medical Center is considering
offering complete sex-change oper
ations, but so little is known about
transsexuals that doctors in this
controversial field are regarded as
saviors by some and quacks by
others.
Up to now the Med Center has
only treated four persons for minor
"adjustment" surgery to complete
treatments begun at other hospi
tals. Dr. Donald Laub, a plastic sur
geon and head of the rehabilitative
surgery department at the Med
Center, says, "We have not decided
yet if we are going to embark on
this program. That will depend on
further study."
Transsexuals have either a male
or female physique but feel emo
tionally like a member of the op
posite sex. Psychiatry apparently

does not help the confirmed trans
sexual.
There seems to be no consensus
on how to handle the problem. Dr.
Charles Socarides, a New York
psychoanalyst, says that the con
version operations are "pathetic
and unscientific." But the trans
sexual organization, C.O.G.
(Conversion Our Goal), seeks full
freedom to have whatever opera
tions are necessary.
Real Problem
Within these two poles, Laub
appears moderate. "Talking to
these patients makes you realize
that they have a real problem." But
many are able to partially adjust,
says Laub. "Almost all of these
patients are dressed as women and
carry out, to the fullest extent, a
life of the opposite sex."
* Roughly 90 per cent of trans
sexuals are men, who often want to
be women so badly they adopt
feminine names.
Laub is proceeding slowly in
this field. While he maintains that
transsexualism is a "diseasehe is

not sure what causes it. One ex
planation is that transsexualism is
present at birth in the person's
chromosomal structure. In other
words, it is not acquired during the
individual's adolescence as homo
sexuality often is.
As Dr. Laub points out, "Most
claim that ever since they can re
member they have had feminine
tendencies. They don't think that
they are male; they think they're
females."
A second explanation argues
that transsexuals have backgrounds
similar to many homosexuals.
They have acute family problems
or leel a drive tp escape paranoid
anxieties.
Laub is extremely shy about
publicity. Doctors working his this
field are regarded as quacks by
some physicians. In addition pub
licity attracts many more patients
than facilities can handle.
"Whenever there is publicity,
we get too many patients knocking
nt. t.ho H AnH f ho naiinriic u/n
get are the wrong type. They are so
desperate they'll do anything to
have an operation," s<jys Laub.
Police Counselor
Another authority on trans
sexuals is Elliott Blackstone, a San
Francisco police officer concerned
with community relations. His job
brings him into daily contact with
many of the residents of the city's
red-light district, the Tenderloin,
and its population of sexual
variants. As a counselor, he has
helped a number of transsexuals
obtain employment and also locate
doctors for conversion operations.
He estimates that there are 150
transsexuals in the city and 3000
nationally. He points out that laws
in California are becoming more
lenient since laws against imperson
ation (dressing as a member of the
opposite sex) were recently de
clared unconstitutional.
But life for the transsexual is
still deeply frustrating. "Some are
so horrified by their sex organs that
they will go as far as self
emasculation."

Different Level
According to Blackstone,
"Many transsexuals were failures as
men and want to be females. In this
sense the problem is actually a dif
ferent level of homosexuality."
To Blackstone and Laub, the
main difficulty in deciding on
whether to operate is deciding if
the individual is actually a trans
sexual. Many are confused trans
vestites, homosexual or hetero
sexual impersonators.
Blackstone suggests letting any
one who wants an operation have
it, but on the condition that the
person try living as a female for two
years and undergo psychotherapy
before making the final decision.
Psychiatric Tests
Dr. Laub explains that "the
whole thing is to choose the ones
who will benefit from those that
won't." During the treatment ex
tensive psychiatric tests are pro
vided to determine the patient's
situation.
But there are sharp criticisms of
this advice. Dr. Socarides says,
"The argument goes that if you
can't change an abnormal psyche

to fit the body, you change the
body to conform to anything.
After the operation . . .the psychic
problems are the same or worse."
What happens from the opera
tions "results inevitably in their
living as a castrated male who
hopes to convince himself and
others that he is an alluring
woman."
In addition to limited con
version operations done at Johns
Hopkins, Minnesota University and
UCLA, a person may have it done
privately in Tangier, Morocco,
Tijuana, Mexico, and Chicago.
However, the costs are astronomi
cal, ranging from $4000 to $7500.
The Moroccan doctor insists that
the fee be deposited in his Swiss
bank before he will examine the
patient.
The operation alters the male
sex organs to resemble female
organs, with some transsexuals
even having artificial vaginas. Hor
mones are also given so that the
person may have secondary sexual
characteristics as well.
In some cases patients have mar
ried, and a few have become
mothers through adoption.
