## Doctors Alter Sex 
### MARSHALL KILDUFF 
Somewhere between male and
female lies the transsexual, a
deeply troubled "twilight person
ality" who possesses the body of
one sex but the mind of the other.
To help this individual, the Stan
ford Medical Center is considering
offering complete sex-change oper
ations, but so little is known about
transsexuals that doctors in this
controversial field are regarded as
saviors by some and quacks by
others.
Up to now the Med Center has
only treated four persons for minor
"adjustment" surgery to complete
treatments begun at other hospi
tals. Dr. Donald Laub, a plastic sur
geon and head of the rehabilitative
surgery department at the Med
Center, says, "We have not decided
yet if we are going to embark on
this program. That will depend on
further study."
Transsexuals have either a male
or female physique but feel emo
tionally like a member of the op
posite sex. Psychiatry apparently

does not help the confirmed trans
sexual.
There seems to be no consensus
on how to handle the problem. Dr.
Charles Socarides, a New York
psychoanalyst, says that the con
version operations are "pathetic
and unscientific." But the trans
sexual organization, C.O.G.
(Conversion Our Goal), seeks full
freedom to have whatever opera
tions are necessary.
Real Problem
Within these two poles, Laub
appears moderate. "Talking to
these patients makes you realize
that they have a real problem." But
many are able to partially adjust,
says Laub. "Almost all of these
patients are dressed as women and
carry out, to the fullest extent, a
life of the opposite sex."
* Roughly 90 per cent of trans
sexuals are men, who often want to
be women so badly they adopt
feminine names.
Laub is proceeding slowly in
this field. While he maintains that
transsexualism is a "diseasehe is

not sure what causes it. One ex
planation is that transsexualism is
present at birth in the person's
chromosomal structure. In other
words, it is not acquired during the
individual's adolescence as homo
sexuality often is.
As Dr. Laub points out, "Most
claim that ever since they can re
member they have had feminine
tendencies. They don't think that
they are male; they think they're
females."
A second explanation argues
that transsexuals have backgrounds
similar to many homosexuals.
They have acute family problems
or leel a drive tp escape paranoid
anxieties.
Laub is extremely shy about
publicity. Doctors working his this
field are regarded as quacks by
some physicians. In addition pub
licity attracts many more patients
than facilities can handle.
"Whenever there is publicity,
we get too many patients knocking
