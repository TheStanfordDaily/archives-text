# The
						Magazine

### 
The Stanford daily magazine has not yet appeared so far
this quarter, and as with so many other things, the reason is
money.
This paper and its publishing board has not yet deter
mined the budget for the present quarter, and the place of
the magazine, unfortunately traditionally tenuous, is among
the first things to be questioned. We believe that our switch
over at the end of last quarter to a cold-type system of type
setting may in the long run produce money enough for us
consistently to guarantee the existence of the magazine. But
until those cost savings start being realized, it will no doubt
have to be a touch-and-go affair.
In addition the magazine is not highly regarded by the
business side of this newspaper, and no special efforts are
made to finance it.
In the meantime friends and reviewers for the magazine
can look for the news department to be printing reviews in
the newspaper itself.
The magazine is something we are proud of, but a good
magazine, because of the way we've been handling it in the
past, probably cannot be expected to make money. And the
question is whether we can afford to pay the difference.
A question a few weeks should be able to answer.
