Change and the consciousness
of change is a major part of our
historical heritage; the necessity
of change for its own sake or only
theoretical good is not. The SES
Report II posited change to over
come inadequacies in the present
General Studies requirement, of
which Civ is an essential part.
Such a reason for change cannot
be faulted, but the type of change
advocated in regard to Civ is not

means fuller individual student
development. Accordingly, the
committee seeks to abolish West

limit historical studies (vaguely

defined) to a one semester or two
quarter requirement.
The SES recommendations in
this regard are questionable, both
in theory and in reference to the
assumed desires of the students,
and they therefore should be re
considered on the following bases:

1. Civ is a contributor to intel
lectual perspective. One of the
most recurrent themes in the SES
report is the need for expanding
the horizons of students through
the creation of interdisciplinary
studies and the lessening of de

on, as well as history. Balanced
against the valid assertion that Civ
does so without probing such
problems with significant depth
should be the consideration that
the course is structured precisely
to introduce students to the West
ern heritage and thereby by defin
ition sacrifices depth for breadth.
But Civ does even more than
aid intellectual perspective by in-
