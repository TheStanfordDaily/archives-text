# Where Were You When The Lights Went Out?
## 
### JENNY MATTHEWS 
Terror, ecstasy, and over-all
amusement struck Stanford resi
dents Sunday night at 10:44 when
a massive power failure shut off
electricity across the campus.
The power failure was the re
sult of an interruption in a
220,000-volt Pacific Gas and Elec
tric line that was created when a
tree fell near La Honda.
It took the power company
nearly an hour and a half to re
route power and restore electrical
service to Stanford by temporary
lines.
The original broken line, how
ever, was not completely repaired
until Monday afternoon.
No Emergencies
The Stanford police depart
ment reports that no emergency
situations developed as a result of
the blackout. The atmosphere of
the campus, however, was far
from quiescent.
Exploding firecrackers, whoops
of delight, a mass walk-out from

the various domains of study, and
the creation of eccentric interim
activities in order to assuage in
sanity have provoked the ques
tion, "Just what do Stanford
students do when the lights go
out?"
Women's residences were uni
versally flooded with anxious
males who looked upon the black
out as an opportunity to catch up
on all the socialzing that "the
light of day" seems to have
stifled.
Self-Illumination
Elsewhere, according to one
turned-on student, "We all de
cided to drop acid to generate our
own lights."
Many students, undismayed by
their descent into the pioneer
days, huddled together in their
dorms, reading Edgar Allen Poe
stories, singing songs, and dancing
with the shadows on the walls.
All the supplies of Soto
House's candle-making workshop
rapidly melted away.

Makeshift square dance parties
were organized by Wilbur resi
dents in a massive attempt to al
leviate the boredom that the lack
of radios, stereos, and the last half
of "Sunday Night at the Movies"
had caused.
Bongos In Lag
Merry-makers in Lagunita
organized tribal dances with
bongo drums, guitars, and the ap
propriate pagan rituals. According
to one harried student who was
valiantly trying to read on the
floor above the brouhaha, "There
was a lot of raging."
Other groups of bored students
wandered aimlessly through the
dark campus streets feeling like
explorers in the wake of a wide
spreak disaster.
Pranksters were not at a loss
for activity, however. At Flo Mo,
bicycles were stacked into neat
piles and groups of men which
one co-ed termed "those crazy
frats" ascended to the roof-tops
to "terrorize" residents. The resi

dents, needless to say, were
elated.
Reactions to the cause of the
blackout were numerous. One
student contended that "the
anarchists had finally struck" and
confessed that as soon as the
lights went out, he locked his
door and hid under his bed.
Divine Warning
Others felt it was a divine
warning that the earthquake
which has been predicted since
1906 was finally at hand.
One radical, however, shook
his head sadly and said, "It was
probably Nixon trying to save
electricity."
Actual damage included some
ten trees blowing over by the
wind. Campus police were forced
to put up blinkers warning
passersby of the obstructions.
Six instances of flooding were
recorded including the law school
basement and the basement of the
new art building.
But all good things usually

come to an end after midnight,
and at 12:15 the magic of the
shadow dancers and the ghost
story tellers dissolved when the
power returned.
Several protesting Wilbur
students who were not yet ready
to return to the electrical age
rushed down to the Wilbur base
ment to turn off the main power
switch and reestablish the dark
euphoria.
Cries of "Boo" could be heard
throughout the relighted build
ings, as students trudged back to
their desks. The fact that every
ore's clock still said "10:44"
didn't cause too much merriment.
It was obvious to everyone
who had heard the screams of
ecstatic youths and the blasts of
firecrackers resounding in the
lightless sky, that simply going to
bed was a solution to the darkness
that few had considered.
Any rise in the birth rate in
about nine months, however, may
prove otherwise.

a massive power failure shut off
electricity across the campus.
The power failure was the re
sult of an interruption in a
220,000-volt Pacific Gas and Elec
tric line that was created when a
tree fell near La Honda.
It took the power company
nearly an hour and a half to re
route power and restore electrical
service to Stanford by temporary
lines.
The original broken line, how
ever, was not completely repaired
until Monday afternoon.
No Emergencies
The Stanford police depart
ment reports that no emergency
situations developed as a result of
the blackout. The atmosphere of
the campus, however, was far
from quiescent.
Exploding firecrackers, whoops
of delight, a mass walk-out from

the various domains of study, and
the creation of eccentric interim
activities in order to assuage in
sanity have provoked the ques
tion, "Just what do Stanford
students do when the lights go
out?"
Women's residences were uni
versally flooded with anxious
males who looked upon the black
out as an opportunity to catch up
on all the socialzing that "the
light of day" seems to have
stifled.
Self-Illumination
Elsewhere, according to one
turned-on student, "We all de
cided to drop acid to generate our
own lights."
Many students, undismayed by
their descent into the pioneer
days, huddled together in their
dorms, reading Edgar Allen Poe
stories, singing songs, and dancing
with the shadows on the walls.
All the supplies of Soto
House's candle-making workshop
rapidly melted away.

Makeshift square dance parties
were organized by Wilbur resi
dents in a massive attempt to al
leviate the boredom that the lack
of radios, stereos, and the last half
of "Sunday Night at the Movies"
had caused.
Bongos In Lag
Merry-makers in Lagunita
organized tribal dances with
bongo drums, guitars, and the ap
propriate pagan rituals. According
to one harried student who was
valiantly trying to read on the
floor above the brouhaha, "There
was a lot of raging."
Other groups of bored students
wandered aimlessly through the
dark campus streets feeling like
explorers in the wake of a wide
spreak disaster.
Pranksters were not at a loss
for activity, however. At Flo Mo,
bicycles were stacked into neat
piles and groups of men which
one co-ed termed "those crazy
frats" ascended to the roof-tops
to "terrorize" residents. The resi

dents, needless to say, were
elated.
Reactions to the cause of the
blackout were numerous. One
student contended that "the
anarchists had finally struck" and
confessed that as soon as the
lights went out, he locked his
door and hid under his bed.
Divine Warning
Others felt it was a divine
warning that the earthquake
which has been predicted since
1906 was finally at hand.
One radical, however, shook
his head sadly and said, "It was
probably Nixon trying to save
electricity."
Actual damage included some
ten trees blowing over by the
wind. Campus police were forced
to put up blinkers warning
passersby of the obstructions.
Six instances of flooding were
recorded including the law school
basement and the basement of the
new art building.
But all good things usually

come to an end after midnight,
and at 12:15 the magic of the
shadow dancers and the ghost
story tellers dissolved when the
power returned.
Several protesting Wilbur
students who were not yet ready
to return to the electrical age
rushed down to the Wilbur base
ment to turn off the main power
switch and reestablish the dark
euphoria.
Cries of "Boo" could be heard
throughout the relighted build
ings, as students trudged back to
their desks. The fact that every
ore's clock still said "10:44"
didn't cause too much merriment.
It was obvious to everyone
who had heard the screams of
ecstatic youths and the blasts of
firecrackers resounding in the
lightless sky, that simply going to
bed was a solution to the darkness
that few had considered.
Any rise in the birth rate in
about nine months, however, may
prove otherwise.
