## Nixon's First 5 1/2 
### ART BUCHWALD 
Richard Nixon has now been
President of the United States for
five and a half days, and so it is
not too early for historians to
judge what kind of President he
has been.
So far, the Nixon Adminis
tration has failed to make any
gains in the fight against crime. If
anything, the crime rate has gone
up since he has been in the White
House, and when historians write
about his first five and a half days,
they will have to say that Mr.
Nixon was unable to solve law and
order, the No. 1 problem in the
country.
Tax Reforms
As far as the economy goes,
President Nixon has not been able
to bring about any great tax re
forms during his first week in
office. But here he cannot be
solely to blame. A recalcitrant
Democratic Congress has been sit
ting on its hands since Tuesday
and has refused to take up any of
Mr. Nixon's legislation.
The peace talks have been
moving at a snail's pace in Paris,
and many Americans are disap
pointed that they may go on
another week. It was hoped that
when Nixon moved into the White
House we'd have a peace treaty
with the North Vietnamese by
Friday.
Also, President Nixon's
promise to improve relations with
the Soviet Union has yet to bear
fruit, Since he has been in office

the Russians have given no indi
cation that they want to talk
about mutual matters concerning
our countries. Critics of the Nixon
Administration feel something
should have been started by now,
and the big question they are ask
ing is: "How much time does he
need to get the ball rolling?"
We are no nearer the moon
today than we were when Mr.
Nixon was sworn in on Monday.
This has many people con
cerned, as it was hoped that we
would have an American on the
moon as soon as a Republican
President took office.
Middle East Crisis
When historians write their
books about President Nixon's
first week in office, they will also
point out that he was unable to
resolve the Middle East crisis by
Sunday. People close to President
Nixon say this was one of his big
gest disappointments, because he
wanted to get that part of the
world settled so he could go onto
other things.
Other areas where the Nixon
Administration has failed are
Latin America, Biafra and San
Francisco State. Defenders of the
Administration said that Mr.
Nixon would turn his attention to
these problems in his second
week. But opponents of the
Nixon policies say he's had
enough time to get them resolved
already.
On the plus side, Mr. Nixon's
relations with the press have been
excellent, and no President has
been treated as well during his
first five and a half days in office.
Nixon Tries
While his legislative record, so
far, leaves much to be desired,
when the history of these first five
and a half days is written, no one
will say that Mr. Nixon didn't try.
Mysterious, pragmatic, a loner,
devoted to his family, a man who
came back from the ashes of de
feat, Richard Nixon will go down
during his first week as a strong
President seeking to heal the
wounds of a nation wracked with
fear and despair.
With only 1,4 54-to days to go
in his term, the President can do
little more now than tidy up the
things he started in his first five
and a half days.
The question people are now
asking is whether Richard Nixon
will run again, or whether he is
fed up with the job that has made
so many demands on him. Those
who know him well say that he
believes he has a mission and de
spite the disappointment of the
first five and one-halfdays, he likes
the job and is thriving in it.
"Perhaps," said an aide, "after
a couple of weeks he may think
otherwise. But I can assure you
that if he had his first five and a
half days to do all over again,
Dick Nixon wouldn't have done
anything differently."

and a half days.
The question people are now
asking is whether Richard Nixon
will run again, or whether he is
fed up with the job that has made
so many demands on him. Those
who know him well say that he
believes he has a mission and de
spite the disappointment of the
first five and one-halfdays, he likes
the job and is thriving in it.
"Perhaps," said an aide, "after
a couple of weeks he may think
otherwise. But I can assure you
that if he had his first five and a
half days to do all over again,
Dick Nixon wouldn't have done
anything differently."
Richard Nixon has now been
President of the United States for
five and a half days, and so it is
not too early for historians to
judge what kind of President he
has been.
So far, the Nixon Adminis
tration has failed to make any
gains in the fight against crime. If
anything, the crime rate has gone
up since he has been in the White
House, and when historians write
about his first five and a half days,
they will have to say that Mr.
Nixon was unable to solve law and
order, the No. 1 problem in the
country.
Tax Reforms
As far as the economy goes,
President Nixon has not been able
to bring about any great tax re
forms during his first week in
office. But here he cannot be
solely to blame. A recalcitrant
Democratic Congress has been sit
ting on its hands since Tuesday
and has refused to take up any of
Mr. Nixon's legislation.
The peace talks have been
moving at a snail's pace in Paris,
and many Americans are disap
pointed that they may go on
another week. It was hoped that
when Nixon moved into the White
House we'd have a peace treaty
with the North Vietnamese by
Friday.
Also, President Nixon's
promise to improve relations with
the Soviet Union has yet to bear
fruit, Since he has been in office

the Russians have given no indi
cation that they want to talk
about mutual matters concerning
our countries. Critics of the Nixon
Administration feel something
should have been started by now,
and the big question they are ask
ing is: "How much time does he
need to get the ball rolling?"
We are no nearer the moon
today than we were when Mr.
Nixon was sworn in on Monday.
This has many people con
cerned, as it was hoped that we
would have an American on the
moon as soon as a Republican
President took office.
Middle East Crisis
When historians write their
books about President Nixon's
first week in office, they will also
point out that he was unable to
resolve the Middle East crisis by
Sunday. People close to President
Nixon say this was one of his big
gest disappointments, because he
wanted to get that part of the
world settled so he could go onto
other things.
Other areas where the Nixon
Administration has failed are
Latin America, Biafra and San
Francisco State. Defenders of the
Administration said that Mr.
Nixon would turn his attention to
these problems in his second
week. But opponents of the
Nixon policies say he's had
enough time to get them resolved
already.
On the plus side, Mr. Nixon's
relations with the press have been
excellent, and no President has
been treated as well during his
first five and a half days in office.
Nixon Tries
While his legislative record, so
far, leaves much to be desired,
when the history of these first five
and a half days is written, no one
will say that Mr. Nixon didn't try.
Mysterious, pragmatic, a loner,
devoted to his family, a man who
came back from the ashes of de
feat, Richard Nixon will go down
during his first week as a strong
President seeking to heal the
wounds of a nation wracked with
fear and despair.
With only 1,4 54-to days to go
in his term, the President can do
little more now than tidy up the
things he started in his first five
and a half days.
The question people are now
