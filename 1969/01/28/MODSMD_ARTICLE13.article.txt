• Defense of Koff
Editor, THE DAILY:
The first meeting of our 240 C
seminar in Problems in Secondary
Education Dr. Koff played for us
the tape-recording of a thirty-six
year old Black man articulating
the hate and frustration he felt for
his educational experiences. At
the second seminal - meeting Dr.
Koff gave us the assignment to at
tend the January 20th meeting of
the Palo Alto School Board, with
the express purpose of listening to
the discussion of the multi
cultural program now being imple
mented in Palo Alto schools under
the direction of Mr. Sidney
Walton. Dr. Koff wanted us to
understand the problems faced by
Black people in relation to the
white community and in schools
that are largely taught and ad
ministered by whites; he wanted
us to realize that as teachers these

problems were also our own. Dr.
Koff felt it was important for us
to know what Black people were
saying: I respectfully submit that
this is not racism, but education.

•Nut Racist
Editor, THE DAILY:
It is extremely unfortunate
that a direct attack on Dr. Robert
Koff has been leveled by the BSU.
If any educational leader should
be singled out for his attempts to
create better educational oppor
tunities for minority groups, Dr.
Koff should. He is not a "racist."
I have worked with Dr. Koff
since November, when he took
over the Directorship of the
Secondary Teacher Education
Program (STEP). Under his leader
ship, we have established the re
cruiting and admitting of minority
groups as definite priorities for
the program. One recruiting trip
was made by two black STEP
staff members to the southeastern
United States. Our admission
policy distinctly states a priority
for minority group students.
Further, Dr. Koff is conducting a
research project in East Palo Alto
that includes tutoring of Ist
graders by 6th graders to improve
reading skills. Dr. Koff has also
initiated procedures for closer ties
between Ravenswood and Stan
ford regarding the placement and
training of black interns.
Although the reporting <?f the
incident in The Daily may imply
insensitivity, the reverse is true in
Dr. Koff's case. For he is sensitive
to minority group concerns.
I feel strongly that the BSU
should act responsibly to recon
sider its position regarding Dr.
Koff.

• STEP
Editor, THE DAILY:
The Secondary Teacher Edu
cation Program (STEP) in the
School of Education seems news
worthy and here's some more:
STEP had the first black ad
ministrative assistant in the
School of Education.
STEP had TWO black Stanford
supervisors (last year) and has
ONE now.
STEP admitted FIVE black in
terns to the program for 1968-69.
STEP has the first black pro
fessor in teacher education.
STEP has a black Stanford
freshman office worker (not boy,
by the way).
STEP employed TWENTY
ONE black students in the micro
teaching clinic last summer.
Across the board, the BSU has
picked the wrong department to
attack. If possible, our proposed
administration under Dr. Robert
Koff will be even more multi
cultural in recruitment for next
year's class because of his beliefs
and actions in attracting and re
cruiting black students.
This is a good record to stand
on, and we propose to do it!

• Blum and Snell Article
Editor, THE DAILY:
The limited scope of Mr.
Blum's and Mr. Snell's analysis of
self-determination and its
function in the university, as well
as in society, results in a funda
mental discrepancy as to the pur
pose or role of all institutions and
their constituents. The dis
crepancy, perhaps a matter of se
mantics, lies in the distinction be
tween the moral and structural
roles of institutions.
The relationship between the
constituent and its whole, the em
ployee and his employer, the
student and his teacher, is bound
by the mutual understanding of
their roles and quest for accom
plishment in their respective
functions. Hence, the existence
for "prescribed roles" are neces
sary in that they comprise various
institutions which have a defini
tive and structural role in society.
The perennial inter-action of the
institutions, in turn, fulfill social
needs by performing their
structural roles.
The "structure complex"
which is binding Mr. Blum and
Mr. Snell enables them to see only
the perversive intentions of
"them"—the institutions, to
gobble up those pre-destined arti
facts of the university, only to di
gest them through their systems
and produce the fine excretory
finish of "respectable" examples.
Contrary to their view that Stan
ford pays lip-service to student
self-determination are the follow
ing examples: emphasis on inter
disciplinary programs by business
and medical schools is en

couraged; impending changes for
increase in independent study pro
grams, freshmen tutorials, seminar
programs due to increased output
of the student, undoubtedly a
cause of close faculty-student rela
tions; the Industrial-Affiliates pro
gram in Chemistry and Chemical
Engineering enabling the professor
and his students to work with a
large area of problems— not bound
by any strings that companies
could impose by how much
money they contribute.
Mr. Blum and Mr. Snell state
the university has abdicated its
moral role in society by not pro
moting social change. In regard to
thi6, the notion of political cul
ture and its effect on the political
system may be used to attempt
their proposition for the possi
bility of an essentially self
determined institution i.e., an in
stitution whose structural role in
society could be justified by its
concomitant moral role. In other
words, as they suggest, the uni
versity as an educational institu
tion, would commit itself entirely
to promoting social change by im
posing its moral role.
However, what would be the
university's moral stance?—with
all students now being self
determined and naturally all re
quiring or rather demanding dif
ferent sets of values, what would
result would be a blob of systems,
a chaotic picture of a dissolved
institution. It is inconceivable that
every student's desires, emotional
impulses or feelings could be satis
fied and represented by a viable
structural institution like Stan
ford. This situation could neither
be accepted nor tolerated because
of the university's primary
function to enable its members to
think freely and well.
For those students who think
that the university opposes social
change and student self
determination, Mr. Blum and Mr.
Snell suggest that they ponder its
societal role and that pervasive
consciousness will maybe change
the situation. However, as has
been shown, to ponder the role of
the university in this light, could
only lead to confusion and frus
tration, and to perhaps a last des
perate but unlikely attempt at
destroying the institution in the
hopes that a new one could solve
their identity crisis. No. The con
sequent vicious circle would only
leave them with the same struc
ture and the task of adapting
socially again within the societal
framework.
Then, what should be the role
of the university in society? It is
not so much what it should be
than what it is. The first report of
SES says"it preserves our com
mon intellectual and cultural tra
dition and transmits it to future
generations; it is the ground for
the creation of new values, new
knowledge, and a new culture."
The social relevance of the uni
versity thus, is realized through
constructive change, instituted by
its members. And while responsi
bility and change are manifested
by its function, so in turn is the
increased necessity for responsibil
ity among its members, not by
refutation and not by waiting and
pondering consciousness or iden
tity but by searching for new
ways of innovation.

• Thinking Vs. Feeling
Editor, THE DAILY:
It seems to me, with regard to
the dispute about thinking vs.
feeling which arose at Monday's
SES panel, that the University's
real function should be to en
courage students to both think
and feel. I don't believe, however,
that the University can force
students to feel any more than it
can force them to think.
Thinking and simultaneously
feeling does not preclude what
Vice-Provost Packer calls "dis
interested intellectual inquiry"
into a matter. For example, one
can make an unbiased analysis of
American slavery while feeling for
the slaves who had to live through
it and expressing this feeling. One
can think rationally and still show
feeling.
Thinking alone, as well as feel
ing alone, can be harmful. The
former can lead to logical, insane
actions whose efforts on human
beings are not considered such as
calculated torture or the use of
chemical and biological warfare.
The latter can lead to illogical,
mad acts whose rational conse
quences are not considered such
as lynchings. Through a combina
tion of thinking and feeling in in
tellectual inquiry and throughout
the rest of one's life, the problems
that arise from either thinking
alone or feeling alone can be, for
the most part, avoided.
