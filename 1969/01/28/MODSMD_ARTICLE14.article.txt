# Leaving Utopia?
## Coed Dorms Not Perfect 
### LINDA WINTHROP 
Why would anyone voluntarily
drop out of Utopia?
This is the question put to
those students, who, having sam
pled co-ed dormitory living, have
moved to a different living situa
tion.
It's noise. It's a lack of privacy.
It's a plethora of "meaningful re
lationships" and a scarcity of ro
mance.
These were some of the reasons
given to jusitfy the move from a
co-ed dorm to another type of
housing, all-male, all-female, fra
ternities, and off-campus. Of the
1150 students living in co-ed res
idences last quarter, 71 left at the
end of the quarter. As Sally
Mahoney, Associate Dean of Stu
dents, points out, "No one ever
asks why people move out of all
male or all-female houses."

Soto Dynamic
Suzanne Mackey, a senior pol
itical science major who moved to
Hoskins after a quarter in Soto,
first modified her decision by say
ing that "Soto was the most dyn
amic of all the groups I'd ever
lived in. I really like Soto and all
the people in it."
Her complaints? "It was hard
to meet people outside—they
assumed you had a self-contained
world." Her largest objection was
one held by most students inter
viewed who left co-ed dorms to
move off-campus "I wanted a
home rather than a room—a place
to have my independence."
A junior girl who moved from
Serra (Stern) to Granada (Lag
unita) objected to the lack of pri

vacy. "Their idea of freedom in
fringed on my idea of freedom."
'Play The Game'
Tony Sanchez, a sophomore,
veteran of freshman year in Bran
ner and fall quarter in Magnolia,
who moved to Kappa Sigma at the
end of the fall quarter: "Some of
the ridiculous illusions about the
opposite sex are broken up. This
is good and bad. I'm tired of
people saying, 'I'm sick of the
dating game! I think you need to
play that game for a while—you
get to know a girl slowly. I had
experienced the brother-sister re
lationship in high school, in Bran
ner, and in Magnolia (with Olivo
women) fall quarter. I was ready
for some social life."
Scott Jones, a sophomore who
chose the fraternity alternative
(ATO) after a quarter of Roble
living, stated that "I liked the in
formality of Roble, but people

formed groups very quickly and
then the informality stopped. Re
lationships were artificial." His
largest complaint, however, was to
dormitory living in general. "I was
tired of the dorm, tired of being
regimented into dinner."
Steve Berman, junior in
Psychology, echoed the senti
ments of many students who
moved off-campus. Now living in
Palo Alto, he explains why he left
Otero after one quarter, "I knew I
wanted a change. The dorm is just
too public, though at another
moment I might have enjoyed
that public life. When you live on
campus all you see of the world is
Stanford and Stanford people."
He added a qualification, "If I
lived in a dorm, I'd want to live in
a co-ed situation."
Co-ed living may not be Uto
pian, after all, at least not for
everyone. As Sally Mahoney indi
cates "We're not trying to make
co-ed housing the answer for
everyone. Some of the reasons for
leaving will be very personal."
The outlook for the continu
ation and possible expansion of
co-ed housing is bright, however.
Justifiably so, it would seem, ac
cording to Robert Rosch, Assis
tant Dean of Students, "Virtually
all spaces in the co-ed houses are
filled."

Why would anyone voluntarily
drop out of Utopia?
This is the question put to
those students, who, having sam
pled co-ed dormitory living, have
moved to a different living situa
tion.
It's noise. It's a lack of privacy.
It's a plethora of "meaningful re
lationships" and a scarcity of ro
mance.
These were some of the reasons
given to jusitfy the move from a
co-ed dorm to another type of
housing, all-male, all-female, fra
ternities, and off-campus. Of the
1150 students living in co-ed res
idences last quarter, 71 left at the
end of the quarter. As Sally
Mahoney, Associate Dean of Stu
dents, points out, "No one ever
asks why people move out of all
male or all-female houses."

Soto Dynamic
Suzanne Mackey, a senior pol
itical science major who moved to
Hoskins after a quarter in Soto,
first modified her decision by say
ing that "Soto was the most dyn
amic of all the groups I'd ever
lived in. I really like Soto and all
the people in it."
Her complaints? "It was hard
to meet people outside—they
assumed you had a self-contained
world." Her largest objection was
one held by most students inter
viewed who left co-ed dorms to
move off-campus "I wanted a
home rather than a room—a place
to have my independence."
A junior girl who moved from
Serra (Stern) to Granada (Lag
unita) objected to the lack of pri

vacy. "Their idea of freedom in
fringed on my idea of freedom."
'Play The Game'
Tony Sanchez, a sophomore,
veteran of freshman year in Bran
ner and fall quarter in Magnolia,
who moved to Kappa Sigma at the
end of the fall quarter: "Some of
the ridiculous illusions about the
opposite sex are broken up. This
is good and bad. I'm tired of
people saying, 'I'm sick of the
dating game! I think you need to
play that game for a while—you
get to know a girl slowly. I had
experienced the brother-sister re
lationship in high school, in Bran
ner, and in Magnolia (with Olivo
women) fall quarter. I was ready
for some social life."
Scott Jones, a sophomore who
chose the fraternity alternative
(ATO) after a quarter of Roble
living, stated that "I liked the in
formality of Roble, but people

formed groups very quickly and
then the informality stopped. Re
lationships were artificial." His
largest complaint, however, was to
dormitory living in general. "I was
tired of the dorm, tired of being
regimented into dinner."
Steve Berman, junior in
Psychology, echoed the senti
ments of many students who
moved off-campus. Now living in
Palo Alto, he explains why he left
Otero after one quarter, "I knew I
wanted a change. The dorm is just
too public, though at another
moment I might have enjoyed
that public life. When you live on
campus all you see of the world is
Stanford and Stanford people."
He added a qualification, "If I
lived in a dorm, I'd want to live in
a co-ed situation."
Co-ed living may not be Uto
pian, after all, at least not for
everyone. As Sally Mahoney indi
cates "We're not trying to make
co-ed housing the answer for
everyone. Some of the reasons for
leaving will be very personal."
The outlook for the continu
ation and possible expansion of
co-ed housing is bright, however.
Justifiably so, it would seem, ac
cording to Robert Rosch, Assis
tant Dean of Students, "Virtually
all spaces in the co-ed houses are
filled."
