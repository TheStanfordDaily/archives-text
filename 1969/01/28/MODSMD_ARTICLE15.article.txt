# Cal Tries Grade Experiment
## 
### KIM THORBURN 
In the midst of the current
movements for academic reforms,
students and educators are ques
tioning the value of the traditional
grading system as a means for
evaluating student work. Last
autumn the University of Califor
nia at Berkeley Law School, Boalt
Hall, initiated a new grading sys
tem called T—M—L.
Under this system "T" (signi
fying "top") must be given to the
top 10 per cent of the students in
a class of 25 or more students.
"M" (signifying "middle") must
be given to the middle 80% and
"L" (signifying "low" must be
given to the lowest 10%. A "D" or
an "F" may be added to an un
satisfactory "L".
Steve Kroll, president of the
Boalt Hall student association and
one of the students responsible
for the development of T—M—L,
says that the purpose of the sys
tem is to eliminate meaningless
competition.
Needless Competition
Under the traditional grading
system 76 per cent is better than
75 per cent says Kroll. Boalt
Hall's method strives to abolish
such competition.
It is hoped that T—M— L will
encourage students to take classes
just to learn. Students will be able
to take classes that interest them
without having to worry about
grades.
Samuel Abbott, another Berk
eley law student, is a critic of the
system. He feels that "T-M-L re
moves an important achievement
incentive." If a student fails to
achieve a "T", he finds him-indis
criminately lumped with 80 per
cent of the class. Upon accepting
the "M", he will do just enough to
avoid receiving an L.

According to Kroll T-M-L pro
vides a statistical evaluation rather
than a personal evaluation. How
ever the professor may still write
comments. Individual evaluation
doesn't range all over the board,
he adds.
Could Improve
Abbott says the system does
not "adequately reflect significant
improvement by students." Under
the previous system a student
could, for example, receive a 73
per cent average one semester and
improve to an 81 per cent average
the next semester. Both averages
would result in an "M" under the
new method.
The Stanford Law School is
watching the development of
T-M-L with interest. Norton
Tooby, second year law student at
Stanford, is on a student-faculty
committee on grading.
Tooby says that the Boalt Hall
innovation is a "definite improve
ment" over the present system
but it is "not perfect." T-M-L,
basically like the present system
but less specific, he feels, is an
advantage.
Issues Dodged
However, like the A-B-C-D-F
method, T-M-L, says Tooby, ac
cepts the assumption that a stu
dent may be evaluated merely by
his performance without consider
ing other factors, such as intelli
gence and number of hours spent
on a class.
The major advantage of the
Boalt Hall system is that it allows
the student more freedom in al
locating his time. If he is particu
larly interested in two out of five
classes he can achieve "M's" in the
other three with little effort. He
has more time to devote to the
classes that interest him.
In an effort to evaluate the

pass-fail system, a Stanford law
professor has randomly divided
his class in two. Half the students
will receive grades, the other half
is on the pass-fail system. He
hopes to find out if students work
as well under the pass-fail method.
