# Foundation Grant To Med School
## 
### 
The Louis B. Mayer Founda
tion of Los Angeles has made a
gift of $125,000 to the Stanford
University School of Medicine to
expand its cancer treatment facili
ties.
The Mayer gift brings the total
raised for expansion of Stanford's
radiation treatment facilities to
$870,000, still short of the
$955,000 goal.
When complete, the fund will
enable the Medical School to treat
the influx of cancer patients now
on waiting lists at the Medical
Center.
Planned are installation of a
third medical linear accelerator,
replacement of an old model, and
addition of support facilities such
as examining and dressing rooms.
Stanford's original radiother
apy facilities were built in 1959
around an experimental high-ener
gy physics device, the linear ac

celerator. Under the leadership of
Dr. Henry S. Kaplan, professor
and chairman of the Department
of Radiology, Stanford radiolo
gists adapted the supervoltage de
vice for medical application in the
treatment of malignant disease.
Today nearly 2,800 treatments
for various types of cancer are
given each month with existing
equipment and personnel oper
ating on a 10-hour basis each day.
The fund drive for the project
began last March under the dir
ection of Paul A. Bissinger, Sr.,
prominent San Francisco business
man.
Bissinger, a former cancer pa
tient himself who says he owes his
life to the treatment he received
at Stanford, organized the
"Friends of Radiology" in hope
of raising funds needed for expan
sion of the cancer treatment cen
ter.
