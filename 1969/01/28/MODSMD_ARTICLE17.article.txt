# New Institute Will Study Public Policy
## 
### 
The behavior and effectiveness
of government units from the
local to national level and their re
sponses to the complex needs and
problems of the people will be
studied by Stanford's new interdis
ciplinary Institute for Public Pol
icy Analysis.
It is the first such university
organization in the country to be
so focused. If successful in its
funding efforts, the institute will
be under way by January.
Prof. Julius Margolis, econ
omics, conceived of and directs
the new institute. His hope for it
is "social adjustment to change
that is smooth and peaceful."
"The institute," says Prof.
Margolis, "will be devoted to the
study of the behavior of govern
ment especially, but not exclusive
ly, in urban areas; the evaluation
of its operations; the development
of techniques by which govern
ment can improve its programs;
and eventually the training of
personnel to do research and
teaching in public policy analysis,
as well as to perform in the public
services."
Two seminars have begun as
the academic development of the
program gets started. One is led
by Law Prof. Lawrence Friedman
and is composed of 20 faculty
membersâ€”half from Law School
and the other half from econ
omics, business, sociology, and
the social sciences. This group is
working on an analysis of the
nature and operation of the U.S.

legal system and will develop a re
search program on its behavior.
The second interdisciplinary
seminar, composed of both facul
ty and graduate students, is con
cerned with an analysis of deci
sion making in government
bodies.
Prof. Margolis sees the new in
stitute as one which conducts
fundamental research relevant to
the formation of policies, to im
plementation, to evaluation; one
which will enable faculty of the
cooperating schools and depart
ments to better organize their re
search and training; one which
will forward innovation in meth
odology, theory, and understand
ing; and one which can become
"instrumental in improving our
future social milieu and behav
ior."
