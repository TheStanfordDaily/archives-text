# Hayes To Present Proposal For SES Education Council
## 
### 
ASSU President Denis Hayes
will present to the Student Legis
lature (LASSU) tomorrow evening
a proposal calling for a campus
wide election of members of the
new Education Council to study
SES proposals.
According to Hayes' resolu
tion, the campus-wide election
would "utilize the Hare system of
Proportional Representation for
the Educational Council."
The resolution further pro
posed that the Education Council
will have 44 members, distributed
over the range of academic levels
and academic disciplines.
Joint Sessions
According to the proposal to
set up the student Educational
Council which was approved by
the Academic Senate last week,
the representative student body
will meet in joint sessions with the
faculty Senate for presentation
and discussion of SES recommen
dations.
The Educational Council was
originally conceived as having 53
members to provide equal student
voice when the countil met in
joint voting sessions with the
53-member Academic Senate.
Since voting will be separate,
however, equality of represen
tation is no longer necessary, and
according to Hayes, proportions
work out better with the number
44.
Hayes' proposal sets the dates
for the election of Council mem
bers as February 18-19.
Hare System
Utilizing the Hare system to
elect a 44-member committee
from the Stanford student body,
the 6078 undergraduate students
(53% of the total) would be al
loted 23 representatives (52%)
and the 5244 graduate students
(47% of the total) would be en
titled to the remaining 21 repre
sentatives.
LASSU members clashed in
last week's meeting over whether
to have the Educational Council
members chosen by a selection
committee instead of a general
election.
According to LASSU member,
Tim Logan, "Any election would
be illegitimate because of tra

ditional campus apathy regarding
elections."
Better Judgment
Proponents of a selection com
mittee felt that a small group
would be able to better judge can
didates by utilizing application
forms which include explanations
of candidates' activities and a
250-word statement required
from each dealing with some sub
stantive aspect of SES.
Hayes contended, however,
that the Education Council "will be
perceived as a far more representa
tive body if it is elected by the
people."
In addition, the Hare System
of Proportional Representation
with a single transferable ballot in
an election, Hayes continued, is
the only way to insure that 51%
of the people don't elect all of the
representatives.
The Hayes proposal also sug
gests that the four ASSU officers
be included in the Council as
voting ex officio members. These
officers consist of ASSU presi
dent, ASSU Vice-president,
LASSU speaker and LASSU liason
officer.
Yes-No Vote
"In the same election," Hayes
statement continues, "the
students will be provided an op
portunity to vote 'Yes-No' on the
following propositions:
1. Stanford undergraduates
should be on a semester
system.
2. Each academic term should
include a unscheduled
"reading period" prior to the
final examination.
3. The present "D" and "F"
grades should be eliminated,
and the sole penalty for fail
ing to complete a course satis
factorily should be the loss of
credit toward graduation.
4. No limit should be placed on
the number of "pass" courses
that a student may take.
5. The freshman year should in
clude a writing experience
integrated with a course, a
course in historical studies,
and a tutorial taught by a

regular member of the facul
ty.
6. General studies requirements
should be reduced to the level
suggested in S.E.S.
End General Studies
7. General Studies requirements
should be abandoned alto
gether.
8. Each school or department
should be permitted to pre
scribe not more than one-half
of the undergraduate major's
total program, including
courses required to be taken
