# Drama Dept. Presents Ancient, Modern Plays
## 
### 
Two plays, separated by more
than 2400 years, will be presented
by the Department of Speech and
Drama at 8 p.m. Wednesday
through Saturday in the Nitery.
The Cyclops by Euripides and
Escurial by de Ghelderode are
being staged as Ph.D directing pro
jects. Admission is free.
The Cyclops is a cruel farce
adapted from a story in Homer's
Odyssey. It is one of two surviving
Greek Satyr plays. These were
presented as a sort of comic relief
during the Dionysian drama festi

vals in Athens. The Cyclops was
first performed about the same
time as Sophocles's Antigone (440
8.C.).

The director, Richard Geldark,
who worked with the translator,
William Arrowsmith, sees the play
as "a confrontation of civilized
brutality and natural savagery. It
explores the relationship between
sexuality and brutality."
The second drama, Escurial, is
written by the modern Flemish
playwright de Ghelderode. He is
probably best known as the
author of Pantagleize, staged by
the APA Repertory Company at
the Stanford Summer Festival last
year. He also wrote the play Bar
rabas which was televised last
Easter on' the Hallmark Hall of
Fame.
Escurial concerns a king ob
sessed with death who changes
roles with a clown only to dis
cover horrid truths about his
dying queen.
