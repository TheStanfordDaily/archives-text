# Robert Sears Resigns Humanities Dean Post
## 
### 
Stanford University has lost
still another administrator as
Robert Sears, Dean of the School
of Humanities and Sciences, has
added his name to a list which
continues to mount.
Sears, in a letter to President
Kenneth Pitzer requested to be
relieved of his administration
duties yesterday "at the earliest

convenient time" in order to re
turn to teaching and research.
He has served as Dean of the
school since 1961 and is on
sabbatical leave at the Center for
Advanced Study in the Behavioral
Sciences.
Sears is a nationally prominent
researcher in child psychology, an
area he intends to pursue when he
is relieved of his administrative
duties.
In the letter to Pitzer Sears ob
served that "quality is not won
without cost"and noted that "the
faculty of the School has carried a
heavy responsibility for its own
development."
Grateful for Help
He expressed special gratitude
to those who have worked as de
partment chairman and served in
his own office. "Without this
turn-taking, a School such as ours
simply would not be viable," he
said.
But as he explained, "By the
same token, professors can devote

themselves to administrative
duties for only so long without
losing that sense of intimate
knowledge and scholarly compe
tence in their own field that pro
vides the basic career satisfaction
for all professors.
"For this reason, after serving
as dean for a full term between
sabbaticals, I am now anxious to
return to my teaching and re
search. I am confident that the
coming years will continue to see
the kind of growth and develop
ment to which the faculty of our
School has happily become ac
customed."
Sears, a 1929 Stanford gradu
ate, returned to the University as
chairman of the Department of
Psychology in 1953. He was
director of the Laboratory of
Human Development at Harvard
from 1949 to 1953.
He is the co-author of major
books on "Frustration and Ag
gression" and "Patterns of Child
Reaving," among others.


DEAN RESIGNS-Robert Sears,
dean of Humanities and Sciences
has resigned his position in order
to return to teaching and research.
