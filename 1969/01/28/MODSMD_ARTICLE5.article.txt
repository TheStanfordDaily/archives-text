# Fraternity Selection
## Reforms Proposed For Rush 
### BARBARA HYLAND 
Four fraternity members are
circulating a petition seeking sev
eral changes in the present selec
tive bidding system used by frater
nities. They propose to restruc
ture rush so that the rushee bids
the fraternity rather than the frat
ernity bidding him.
The petition explains that this
will shift "the burden of making
an impression" from the rushee to
the fraternity. In order to bid a
fraternity the student must be en
dorsed by five active members and
have their signatures. The nmber
of houses he can bid will be
limited.
If a house receives more than
its quota of bids, a draw system
will determine which of the bid
ders will become members. In
order to solve the problem of
block rushing, the petition sug
gests limiting the number of
rushees submitting a collective
bid.
God and Fraternities
Grey Bryan of Theta Delta Chi
who originated the proposal to
gether with Tim Gillespie (Phi
Kappa Sigma), Jim Parker (Alpha
Tau Omicron), and Jim Vernon
(Alpha Sigma Phi), said its aim is
to revive "fraternities, at least at
Stanford, into a more relevant,
fraternal body." "There exists an
ironic similarity between God and
fraternities; both are said to be
dying," he noted. He sees his pro
posals for reform as "a start
toward a reincarnation of fraterni
ties."
Bryan does not feel that a stu
dent-bid svstem will threaten each
fraternity's distinctive 'style'. Rath
er, he claims, "the fraternities will
perpetuate their 'style' through a

modicum of selectivity, the five
signatures, and by a maximum of
activity, the vigorous attempts to
attract or dissuade prospective
members by honestly displaying
and discussing what their particu
lar house has to offer."
Gaining these signatures will
"necessitate a more than passing
Where're-you from—What's your
major evaluation of rushees and
actives, in demanding that the two
individuals directly involved con
front each other," Bryan main
tains.
"The bewildering pressure of
immediately making thirty good
impressions will be supplanted by
the lesser, perhaps even beneficial,
pressure of first making five
friends," he added.
Inequities Alleviated
The petition hopes to provide
reforms that will alleviate "many
of the inequities in the bidding
system; for instance the possibil
ity of discrimination, the imper
sonal ding-system, the harshness
of rejection, and the bias surface
impressions sometimes incur."
Jim Parker, one of the peti
tion's sponsors, stressed the key
sentence in the petition. "We are
not anti-fraternity; we feel that
fraternities at Stanford offer a
viable living alternative on this
campus and we do not believe
that our proposal will emasculate
or destroy that needed alterna
tive."
Doug Chandler, President of
the Inter-Fraternity Council
(IFC), reacted with surprise when
he first heard of the petition
through a Daily reporter. He
noted that the sponsors of the
proposals "haven't been through
any of the channels." He did not

think they had attended any re
cent meetings of the Rush Com
mittee or the IFC meeting last
week.
Proposal Not 'Revolutionary'
Chandler felt that the proposal
for a student-bid system "isn't
actually a revolutionary change. It
can fit easily into the final regula
tions, which were formulated by
the IFC Ad Hoc Rush Committee
and approved after discussions last
quarter by the IFC."
The Rush Committee has held
discussions with fraternities,
eating club representatives, repre
sentatives of the Dean of Stu
dents, and freshman, including
girls.
He emphasized that "fraterni
ties at Stanford have traditionally
asserted a high degree of auton
omy and each house is free, as has
always been the case, to deter
mine its own selection procedure
within the guideline provided by
the Rush Regulations." The pro
posed reform in Rush practices "is
an option open to any house
which wishes to accept or adopt
it."
Investigation of Rush
Chandler said that the IFC is
concerned with Rush practices.
They have written to the Nation
als who have local chapters at
Stanford asking for "a description
of membership selection and prac
tices." Dan Williams, Assistant
Dean of Students, is presently
interviewing fraternity presidents
about their selection procedures.
Moreover, an Ad Hoc Frater
nity Committee has been estab
lished to study SES, in particular
its report on residences and the
implications towards fraternities.

of houses he can bid will be

God and Fraternities
Grey Bryan of Theta Delta Chi
who originated the proposal to
gether with Tim Gillespie (Phi
Kappa Sigma), Jim Parker (Alpha
Tau Omicron), and Jim Vernon
(Alpha Sigma Phi), said its aim is
to revive "fraternities, at least at
Stanford, into a more relevant,
fraternal body." "There exists an
ironic similarity between God and
fraternities; both are said to be
dying," he noted. He sees his pro
posals for reform as "a start
toward a reincarnation of fraterni
ties."
Bryan does not feel that a stu
dent-bid svstem will threaten each
fraternity's distinctive 'style'. Rath
er, he claims, "the fraternities will
perpetuate their 'style' through a

modicum of selectivity, the five
signatures, and by a maximum of
activity, the vigorous attempts to
attract or dissuade prospective
members by honestly displaying
and discussing what their particu
lar house has to offer."
Gaining these signatures will
"necessitate a more than passing
Where're-you from—What's your
major evaluation of rushees and
actives, in demanding that the two
individuals directly involved con
front each other," Bryan main
tains.
"The bewildering pressure of
immediately making thirty good
impressions will be supplanted by
the lesser, perhaps even beneficial,
pressure of first making five
friends," he added.
Inequities Alleviated
The petition hopes to provide
reforms that will alleviate "many
of the inequities in the bidding
system; for instance the possibil
ity of discrimination, the imper
sonal ding-system, the harshness
of rejection, and the bias surface
impressions sometimes incur."
Jim Parker, one of the peti
tion's sponsors, stressed the key
sentence in the petition. "We are
not anti-fraternity; we feel that
fraternities at Stanford offer a
viable living alternative on this
campus and we do not believe
that our proposal will emasculate
or destroy that needed alterna
tive."
Doug Chandler, President of
the Inter-Fraternity Council
(IFC), reacted with surprise when
he first heard of the petition
through a Daily reporter. He
noted that the sponsors of the
proposals "haven't been through
any of the channels." He did not

think they had attended any re
cent meetings of the Rush Com
mittee or the IFC meeting last
week.
Proposal Not 'Revolutionary'
Chandler felt that the proposal
for a student-bid system "isn't
actually a revolutionary change. It
can fit easily into the final regula
tions, which were formulated by
the IFC Ad Hoc Rush Committee
and approved after discussions last
quarter by the IFC."
The Rush Committee has held
discussions with fraternities,
eating club representatives, repre
sentatives of the Dean of Stu
dents, and freshman, including
girls.
He emphasized that "fraterni
ties at Stanford have traditionally
asserted a high degree of auton
omy and each house is free, as has
always been the case, to deter
mine its own selection procedure
within the guideline provided by
the Rush Regulations." The pro
posed reform in Rush practices "is
an option open to any house
which wishes to accept or adopt
it."
Investigation of Rush
Chandler said that the IFC is
concerned with Rush practices.
They have written to the Nation
als who have local chapters at
Stanford asking for "a description
of membership selection and prac
tices." Dan Williams, Assistant
Dean of Students, is presently
interviewing fraternity presidents
about their selection procedures.
Moreover, an Ad Hoc Frater
nity Committee has been estab
lished to study SES, in particular
its report on residences and the
implications towards fraternities.
Four fraternity members are
circulating a petition seeking sev
eral changes in the present selec
tive bidding system used by frater
nities. They propose to restruc
ture rush so that the rushee bids
the fraternity rather than the frat
ernity bidding him.
The petition explains that this
will shift "the burden of making
an impression" from the rushee to
the fraternity. In order to bid a
fraternity the student must be en
