# Diarrhea Closes Baby Ward
## 
### 
Stanford University Hospital
maternity ward will re-open on
Monday, February 2, ending a
two-week period during which no
new patients were admitted.
The nurseries and maternity
wards were closed to new arrivals
after the sporadic outbreak of a
'mild' form of diarrhea in a few
new-born babies.
"Non-Specific Variety"
Dr. Thomas A. Gonda, acting
director of the hospital, identified
the diarrhea as one of "non-speci
fic variety". Non-specific diarrhea
accounts for approximately 50
per cent of the occurrences of
diarrhea in infants.
A form of diarrhea is desig
nated as non-specific when the
organism or chemical causing it
has not been isolated.

Dr. Gonda exphasized the need
for caution in dealing with the
problem. He explained that there
has been a lot of pressure to open
the wards on Saturday, January
31, exactly two weeks after the
outbreak was discovered.
"it is important that we don't
open prematurely," Dr. Gonda
said. "This is a mild form of diar
rliea, but diarrhea can be danger
ous."
Standard Precautions
"We're following the standard
precautions under cases of this
type," Dr. Gonda added.
Stanford University Hospital
usually delivers about 170 babies
a month.
The maternity serivces in both
the West and East wings of the

nursery have been closed since
January 19th to incoming pa
tients. Services for mothers and
babies born before the 19th have
been continued.
El Camino Hospital in Moun
tain View and Sequoia Hospital in
Redwood City have been caring
for the obstretic patients who
would normally be handled at
Stanford. About a dozen patients
from Stanford have gone to
Sequoia since the nurseries were
closed, according to Max Gerfen,
Sequoia's administrator.
Charles Cowen, assistant ad
ministrator at El Camino, stated
that the Stanford patients have
not overloaded his hospital. El
Camino normally operates at only
70 percent of capacity.
