# Biafran Conflict Called Tribe War
## 
### 
"We Africans are being used by
the Western World" complains
Peter Ekeh, a Nigerian graduate
student from Berkeley.
Speaking yesterday in Dinkel
spiel Auditorium, Ekeh accused
the Portuguese, French, and South
Africans of trying to "bleed both
sides" in the Nigerian-Biafran con
flict, by intervening when peace
was most likely to sustain the con
flict.
Ekeh gave a history of this war
as he saw it. From 1954 to 1966
Nigeria had been split into three
regions with the Hausa, Yoruba,
and Ibo tribes each dominating
one area. During this period there
was widespread corruption.
The Ibos and Hausas ruled in
political alliance until 1964 when,
according to Ekeh, rigged elec
tions threw the balance of power
to the Hausas.
Two years later the Ibos staged
a military coup at the expense of
their former allies. Many Hausas
and pro-Hausa minority leaders
were killed.
Ibos Massacred
Following this coup were mas
sacres of Ibos and other minorities
in the North, resulting in the flow
of millions of refugees into what
is now Biafra. Biafra seceded from
the Nigerian federation in 1967.
According to Ekeh, Biafra was
trying to dominate the entire
country, citing as evidence her
drive deep into Western Nigeria.
Contrary to belief, he said, the
civil war was not started by riots
but was a planned affair.
Ekeh said that the Biafran
charge of genocide by the Niger
ians was ridiculous, pointing out
that 4 million Biafrans are now
living in federally controlled areas.
Also, he said, this charge had been
discounted by observer teams
from Sweden, Poland, Britain,
Canada, and the United Nations,
and the Organization of African
Unity.
He added that the Biafran
leader, Ojuku, had admitted that
he was exploiting the situation in

order to gain sympathy.
Foreigners Interfere
Several foreign countries also
came under attack. Britain and
Russia were accused of "bleeding
us dry" by demanding cash for all
munitions. Ekeh said no country
was really altruistically motivated
but that all were trying to frag
ment Nigeria.
Otherwise, he said, there would
be a concern for the millions
dying in Angola instead of the
present news black-out of this in
America.
Ekeh also criticized CARITAS,
the international Catholic relief
service for its political involve
ment. He charged that the Vatican
supported Biafra.
In closing the Nigerian warned
ominously that American involve
ment might lead to another Viet
nam. He thought that the West
underestimated Nigeria's deter
mination to remain united.
Several African students in the
audience disagreed strongly with
Ekeh. Tomorrow the Biafran
viewpoint will be presented by Dr.
Boniface Obichre at 4:15 in Dink
elspiel, followed by a discussion in
Branner Lounge at 7:30.
