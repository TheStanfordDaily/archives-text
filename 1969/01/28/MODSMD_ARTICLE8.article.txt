# SDS Rally
## 
### 
SDS will present a list of nine
demands "concerning the Univer
sity's participation in the violence
perpetrated against the people of
the world" to President Kenneth
Pitzer at 12:30 today at his office.
Tomorrow SDS will hold a sec
ond rally in the Old Union court
yard to consider his response to
the demands and to discuss future
action.
The nine demands center
around faculty. Trustee, and SRI

These are the same demands pre

stormy Jan. 14 Trustee meeting at
the Faculty Club that was disrup
ted by SI)S and supporters.
