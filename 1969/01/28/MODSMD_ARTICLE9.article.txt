# Concerning Marijuana's Pungent Odor
## 
### CARY DICTOR 
It came as a great shock to me,
as it undoubtedly did to many of
us, that the Building Superin
tendent of the Meyer Library de
scribed marijuana as having a
"pungent" odor. To quote his
words, "I decided to open the
desk carrel and remove the con
tents when I discovered a pungent
odor coming from the carrel."
Now, I assume, as seems
natural, that the briefcase in the
carrel contained dry and unburn
ing grass, if indeed it contained
any grass at all. To leave burning
or even smoldering grass in a brief
case would be unthinkable, I am
sure, first because it would surely
attract attention, and second be
cause it is a senseless waste of
grass. Thus are we faced with a
Building Superintendent who not
only smelled normal grass through
a briefcase and carrel, but who
labelled the smell "pungent."
Webster Says
Webster's New World Diction
ary defines pungent as "sharp and
piercing; poignant; painful; stimu-

lating," all of which fail to satisfy
in describing the peculiar
fragrance of marijuana. Old
Webster himself, though
describing marijuana as "a nar
cotic obtained from dried
leaves and flowers, smoked in
cigarettes by addicts," fails to use
"pungent" in any connection with
it.
To return to the problem,
though: what sort of nose has this
superintendent got that sniffs out
grass hundreds of yards away? To
find out I purposely gathered to
gether several truly pungent items
and took them in a briefcase to
the library. Among the things a
delicatessen salami sandwich, a
quarter-pound selection of Lim
burger cheese, and a half dozen
sliced onions were the most
prominent, and probably the most
pungent.
After carefully installing the
briefcase in a carrel I sat back a
safe distance to watch. Within half
an hour students stopped studying
in the room and left. I, too, was
forced out a good hundred feet.

Unsuspecting people would walk
about the carrel but quickly leave.
Two coeds even reported the
stench to the custodians at the
desk. Still no action. Finally I left
for the day and returned the fol
lowing afternoon. The briefcase
was still there intact and had
smelled up the whole third floor.
No superintendent in sight. I took
the case and left.
The next day, being very
puzzled by this all, I decided upon
one last test. I bought half a lid
from one of my professors and
walked across campus with it, ask
ing people along the way if there
was anything pungent about me.
Nobody thought there was. Some
people weren't quite sure what
pungent meant, so to be safe I
asked also if there was anything
about me that was sharp, piercing,
poignant, painful, or stimulating.
One girl told me I had a poignant
expression, and one elderly lady
took offense at "stimulating" and
advised me not to be so brash.
Otherwise the response was nega
tive.

Then I tried the clincher.
Casually I walked into the library
with the grass wrapped in cello
phane and enclosed in an old
tobacco pouch. Before I had got
ten to the second floor I was ac
costed by two men. One identi
fied himself as being from the
Santa Clara County Air Pollution
Control Commission and the
other I recognized as the Building
Superintendent. They advised me
that I was carrying with me a
painfully stimulating substance
which, if placed in a carrel locker,
would be subject to removal.
Suddenly I looked down and
saw that the Building Superinten
dent was holding a police dog by
the leash. The dog was growling
and snapping at me, straining on
the leash to get to me. I left.
I would advise that we not
keep our stuff near Uncle Leland
any more, at least while He uses
the police as an odor retribution
squad.
Thank God our hypodermic
needles aren't pungent.

desk carrel and remove the con
tents when I discovered a pungent
odor coming from the carrel."
Now, I assume, as seems
natural, that the briefcase in the
carrel contained dry and unburn
ing grass, if indeed it contained
any grass at all. To leave burning
or even smoldering grass in a brief
case would be unthinkable, I am
sure, first because it would surely
attract attention, and second be
cause it is a senseless waste of
grass. Thus are we faced with a
Building Superintendent who not
only smelled normal grass through
a briefcase and carrel, but who
labelled the smell "pungent."
Webster Says
Webster's New World Diction
ary defines pungent as "sharp and
piercing; poignant; painful; stimu-

lating," all of which fail to satisfy
in describing the peculiar
fragrance of marijuana. Old
Webster himself, though
describing marijuana as "a nar
cotic obtained from dried
leaves and flowers, smoked in
cigarettes by addicts," fails to use
"pungent" in any connection with
it.
To return to the problem,
though: what sort of nose has this
superintendent got that sniffs out
grass hundreds of yards away? To
find out I purposely gathered to
gether several truly pungent items
and took them in a briefcase to
the library. Among the things a
delicatessen salami sandwich, a
quarter-pound selection of Lim
burger cheese, and a half dozen
sliced onions were the most
prominent, and probably the most
pungent.
After carefully installing the
briefcase in a carrel I sat back a
safe distance to watch. Within half
an hour students stopped studying
in the room and left. I, too, was
forced out a good hundred feet.

Unsuspecting people would walk
about the carrel but quickly leave.
Two coeds even reported the
stench to the custodians at the
desk. Still no action. Finally I left
for the day and returned the fol
lowing afternoon. The briefcase
was still there intact and had
smelled up the whole third floor.
No superintendent in sight. I took
the case and left.
The next day, being very
puzzled by this all, I decided upon
one last test. I bought half a lid
from one of my professors and
walked across campus with it, ask
ing people along the way if there
was anything pungent about me.
Nobody thought there was. Some
people weren't quite sure what
pungent meant, so to be safe I
asked also if there was anything
about me that was sharp, piercing,
poignant, painful, or stimulating.
One girl told me I had a poignant
expression, and one elderly lady
took offense at "stimulating" and
advised me not to be so brash.
Otherwise the response was nega
tive.

Then I tried the clincher.
Casually I walked into the library
with the grass wrapped in cello
phane and enclosed in an old
tobacco pouch. Before I had got
ten to the second floor I was ac
costed by two men. One identi
fied himself as being from the
Santa Clara County Air Pollution
Control Commission and the
other I recognized as the Building
Superintendent. They advised me
that I was carrying with me a
painfully stimulating substance
which, if placed in a carrel locker,
would be subject to removal.
Suddenly I looked down and
saw that the Building Superinten
dent was holding a police dog by
the leash. The dog was growling
and snapping at me, straining on
the leash to get to me. I left.
I would advise that we not
keep our stuff near Uncle Leland
any more, at least while He uses
the police as an odor retribution
squad.
Thank God our hypodermic
needles aren't pungent.
It came as a great shock to me,
as it undoubtedly did to many of
us, that the Building Superin
tendent of the Meyer Library de
scribed marijuana as having a
"pungent" odor. To quote his
words, "I decided to open the
desk carrel and remove the con
tents when I discovered a pungent
odor coming from the carrel."
