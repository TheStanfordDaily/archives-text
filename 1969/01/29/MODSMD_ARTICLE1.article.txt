# Pitzer 'Invited
## SDS To Hold Rally 
### MARSHALL KILDUFF 
After running up a Viet Cong
flag on the Post Office flagpole,
forty members of Students for a
Democratic Society (SDS)
marched to President Kenneth Pit
zer's office yesterday afternoon to
invite him "to explain why he has
failed to meet our demands" at a
12:30 rally today in the Old
Union courtyard.
Pitzer was not in his office at
the time, and the group left
promptly after presenting its invi
tation. Besides Pitzer, SDS asked
that Trustee William Hewlett of
Hewlett-Packard Corp., Prof. Wil
liam Rambo, director of the Ap
plied Electronics Laboratory,

(AEL) and Stanford Research In
stitute (SRI) Vice-President
Rudolph Brunsvold appear at the
rally to answer questions.
Before leaving Pitzer's office,
SDS member Leonard Siegel an
nounced, "If we aren't satisfied,
we will decide on what action to
take then."
SDS' nine demands center
around Trustee, faculty and SRI
involvement in defense contracts.
SDS asks that General Dynamics
president Roger Lewis, Northrop
president Tom Jones, and Hew
lett-Packard president William
Hewlett resign either from their
trustee or business positions.
Other demands ask that SRI

stop all research in Southeast
Asia, and close its office in Thai
land. Finally SDS requests that
faculty members sever all connec
tions with the Department of De
fense and that AEL stop all mili
tary-electronic research.
Last night Pitzer issued a state
ment on the SDS demands. He
said, "We must respect the free
doms which are central to the
University, and it is therefore un
acceptable to me, as the SDS has
proposed, that we interfere with
the individual freedom of choice
of trustees or faculty." (Complete
statement follows story)
John Munger, a senior in politi
cal science and head of the Com
mittee for Communication on
Campus, said, "On behalf of the
over 1000 students who last week
signed a petition condemning vio
lence and intimidation on campus,
and in the interest of Stanford as
an academic institution we strong
ly hope that Wednesday's rally
will not be ruined by childish and
violent tactics and language on the
parts of the administration or SDS
or others."
At the beginning of the march,
SDS members ran the red and
blue Viet Cong up the flagpole at
the Post Office. No American flag
was flown because of bad weather
yesterday morning.
Several people tried to remove
the flag, but it had been knotted
in a way which made it impossible
to remove except by climbing to
the top of the pole. Part of the
homemade flag blew away, and
the rest was removed several hours
later by maintenance employees.

this University to Stanford Re
search Institute. These questions
were circulated to you Jan. 14.
As I have made clear in many
meetings with students—including
members of the SDS—I under
stand and indeed share their con
cern about the war in Vietnam,
and I am well aware of the range
and complexity of the issues
which confront our universities
and our society because of it.
These issues are profoundly signif
icant and I am committed to
facing up to them openly and con
scientiously.
In opposing the tactics of the
SDS, the Student Legislature and
the Open Campus Committee also
have expressed their desire for
wide discussion of these and re
lated issues.
In facing those issues, we must
respect the freedoms which are
central to the University, and it is
therefore unacceptable to me to

consider, as the SDS has pro
posed, that we interfere with the
individual freedom of choice of
trustees or faculty. Just as I re
spect the right of individual stu
dents to make personal decisions
within the law according to their
personal values, I respect and de
fend that right for other members
of the University community such
as faculty members and members
of the Board of Trustees.
Consequently, insofar as any
demands insist that individual
freedoms be sacrificed, the answer
is unequivocal: these freedoms
apply to all members of the com
munity and Stanford will not re
strict them for one group while
upholding them for another.
Moreover, as to those demands
which speak to the University as
an institution, the record clearly
shows that those subjects are cur
rently under consideration by
University committees on which
students now serve. There is a
standing committee on research

appointed by the faculty senate,
and the committee investigating
the University's relationship with
Stanford Research Institute will
have its report ready by the
Spring Quarter. We cannot ask
those committees to continue
working conscientiously and at
the same time instruct them as to
what their conclusions must be.
I have pledged that as President
of Stanford I will ensure an open
community, and I have also
pledged that there will be new and
increasingly significant opportun
ities for discussion among all
members of the University com
munity. As a matter of fact, I
placed on the agenda of the Trus
tees, at their last meeting, a re
commendation for the formation
of a University Advisory Commit
tee, to include 5 students, 5
faculty members and 5 Trustees,
together with myself. That
committee will work on impor
tant subjects including the sugges
tions of students and faculty con
cerning possible candidates for
election to the Board of Trustees
and various modes of communica
tion to the Trustees of student
and faculty concerns. It is sadly
ironic that the Trustee meeting
was disrupted by some students
and, therefore, the Trustees could
not consider my recommendation
at that time.
Nevertheless, I hope to be able
to establish the committee in the
near future. This forum, in con
trast to confrontation, is designed
to allow reasoned discussion and
debate. I am confident it will help
to promote the understanding and
cooperation which are necessary
to make further constructive
changes.
The President of the Stanford
Chapter, AAUP, informs me that
this faculty organization next
week is planning a University-wide
forum for discussion of student
and faculty concerns about the
activities and policies of the Stan
ford Research Institute and
related questions, which have
been of concern to the Open
Campus Committee and other
groups.
To promote the fullest
discussion of these issues, I am
asking the chairman of the
President's Ad Hoc Committee on
SRI to report on the occasion of
this meeting its progress to date.
Substantial information gathered
by this Committee is available to
the University community in the
Meyer Library, and I invite
interested persons to peruse this
material in advance of the
meeting.
The issues posed by SRl's
relations to the University ramify
into questions touching upon the
academic freedom of students and
faculty alike, and I am glad to
learn that the AAUP forum will
be designed to reach into these
extremely important questions.

this University to Stanford Re
search Institute. These questions
were circulated to you Jan. 14.
As I have made clear in many
meetings with students—including
members of the SDS—I under
stand and indeed share their con
cern about the war in Vietnam,
and I am well aware of the range
and complexity of the issues
which confront our universities
and our society because of it.
These issues are profoundly signif
icant and I am committed to
facing up to them openly and con
scientiously.
In opposing the tactics of the
SDS, the Student Legislature and
the Open Campus Committee also
have expressed their desire for
wide discussion of these and re
lated issues.
In facing those issues, we must
respect the freedoms which are
central to the University, and it is
therefore unacceptable to me to

consider, as the SDS has pro
posed, that we interfere with the
individual freedom of choice of
trustees or faculty. Just as I re
spect the right of individual stu
dents to make personal decisions
within the law according to their
personal values, I respect and de
fend that right for other members
of the University community such
as faculty members and members
of the Board of Trustees.
Consequently, insofar as any
demands insist that individual
freedoms be sacrificed, the answer
is unequivocal: these freedoms
apply to all members of the com
munity and Stanford will not re
strict them for one group while
upholding them for another.
Moreover, as to those demands
which speak to the University as
an institution, the record clearly
shows that those subjects are cur
rently under consideration by
University committees on which
students now serve. There is a
standing committee on research

appointed by the faculty senate,
and the committee investigating
the University's relationship with
Stanford Research Institute will
have its report ready by the
Spring Quarter. We cannot ask
those committees to continue
working conscientiously and at
the same time instruct them as to
what their conclusions must be.
I have pledged that as President
of Stanford I will ensure an open
community, and I have also
pledged that there will be new and
increasingly significant opportun
ities for discussion among all
members of the University com
munity. As a matter of fact, I
placed on the agenda of the Trus
tees, at their last meeting, a re
commendation for the formation
of a University Advisory Commit
tee, to include 5 students, 5
faculty members and 5 Trustees,
together with myself. That
committee will work on impor
tant subjects including the sugges
tions of students and faculty con
cerning possible candidates for
election to the Board of Trustees
and various modes of communica
tion to the Trustees of student
and faculty concerns. It is sadly
ironic that the Trustee meeting
was disrupted by some students
and, therefore, the Trustees could
not consider my recommendation
at that time.
Nevertheless, I hope to be able
to establish the committee in the
near future. This forum, in con
trast to confrontation, is designed
to allow reasoned discussion and
debate. I am confident it will help
to promote the understanding and
cooperation which are necessary
to make further constructive
changes.
The President of the Stanford
Chapter, AAUP, informs me that
this faculty organization next
week is planning a University-wide
forum for discussion of student
and faculty concerns about the
activities and policies of the Stan
ford Research Institute and
related questions, which have
been of concern to the Open
Campus Committee and other
groups.
To promote the fullest
discussion of these issues, I am
asking the chairman of the
President's Ad Hoc Committee on
SRI to report on the occasion of
this meeting its progress to date.
Substantial information gathered
by this Committee is available to
the University community in the
Meyer Library, and I invite
interested persons to peruse this
material in advance of the
meeting.
The issues posed by SRl's
relations to the University ramify
into questions touching upon the
academic freedom of students and
faculty alike, and I am glad to
learn that the AAUP forum will
be designed to reach into these
extremely important questions.
Kenneth S. Pitzer
President
After running up a Viet Cong
flag on the Post Office flagpole,
forty members of Students for a
Democratic Society (SDS)
marched to President Kenneth Pit
zer's office yesterday afternoon to
invite him "to explain why he has
failed to meet our demands" at a
12:30 rally today in the Old
Union courtyard.
Pitzer was not in his office at
the time, and the group left
promptly after presenting its invi
tation. Besides Pitzer, SDS asked
that Trustee William Hewlett of
Hewlett-Packard Corp., Prof. Wil
liam Rambo, director of the Ap
plied Electronics Laboratory,

(AEL) and Stanford Research In
stitute (SRI) Vice-President
Rudolph Brunsvold appear at the
rally to answer questions.
Before leaving Pitzer's office,
SDS member Leonard Siegel an
nounced, "If we aren't satisfied,
we will decide on what action to
take then."
SDS' nine demands center
around Trustee, faculty and SRI
involvement in defense contracts.
SDS asks that General Dynamics
president Roger Lewis, Northrop
president Tom Jones, and Hew
lett-Packard president William
Hewlett resign either from their
trustee or business positions.
Other demands ask that SRI

stop all research in Southeast
Asia, and close its office in Thai
land. Finally SDS requests that
faculty members sever all connec
tions with the Department of De
fense and that AEL stop all mili
tary-electronic research.
Last night Pitzer issued a state
ment on the SDS demands. He
said, "We must respect the free
doms which are central to the
University, and it is therefore un
acceptable to me, as the SDS has
proposed, that we interfere with
the individual freedom of choice
of trustees or faculty." (Complete
statement follows story)
John Munger, a senior in politi
cal science and head of the Com
mittee for Communication on
Campus, said, "On behalf of the
over 1000 students who last week
signed a petition condemning vio
lence and intimidation on campus,
and in the interest of Stanford as
an academic institution we strong
ly hope that Wednesday's rally
will not be ruined by childish and
violent tactics and language on the
parts of the administration or SDS
or others."
At the beginning of the march,
SDS members ran the red and
blue Viet Cong up the flagpole at
the Post Office. No American flag
was flown because of bad weather
yesterday morning.
Several people tried to remove
the flag, but it had been knotted
in a way which made it impossible
to remove except by climbing to

I have pledged that as President

placed on the agenda of the Trus
tees, at their last meeting, a re
commendation for the formation
of a University Advisory Commit
tee, to include 5 students, 5
faculty members and 5 Trustees,
together with myself. That
committee will work on impor
tant subjects including the sugges
tions of students and faculty con
cerning possible candidates for
election to the Board of Trustees
and various modes of communica

and faculty concerns. It is sadly
ironic that the Trustee meeting
was disrupted by some students
and, therefore, the Trustees could
not consider my recommendation
at that time.
Nevertheless, I hope to be able
to establish the committee in the
near future. This forum, in con
trast to confrontation, is designed
to allow reasoned discussion and
debate. I am confident it will help
to promote the understanding and
cooperation which are necessary
to make further constructive
changes.
The President of the Stanford
Chapter, AAUP, informs me that
this faculty organization next
week is planning a University-wide
forum for discussion of student
and faculty concerns about the
activities and policies of the Stan

related questions, which have
been of concern to the Open
Campus Committee and other
groups.
To promote the fullest
discussion of these issues, I am
asking the chairman of the
President's Ad Hoc Committee on
SRI to report on the occasion of
this meeting its progress to date.
Substantial information gathered
by this Committee is available to
the University community in the
Meyer Library, and I invite
interested persons to peruse this
material in advance of the
meeting.
The issues posed by SRl's
relations to the University ramify
into questions touching upon the
academic freedom of students and
faculty alike, and I am glad to
learn that the AAUP forum will
be designed to reach into these
extremely important questions.
Kenneth S. Pitzer
President
After running up a Viet Cong
flag on the Post Office flagpole,
forty members of Students for a
Democratic Society (SDS)
marched to President Kenneth Pit
zer's office yesterday afternoon to
invite him "to explain why he has
failed to meet our demands" at a
12:30 rally today in the Old
Union courtyard.
Pitzer was not in his office at
the time, and the group left
promptly after presenting its invi
tation. Besides Pitzer, SDS asked
that Trustee William Hewlett of
Hewlett-Packard Corp., Prof. Wil
liam Rambo, director of the Ap
plied Electronics Laboratory,

(AEL) and Stanford Research In
stitute (SRI) Vice-President
Rudolph Brunsvold appear at the
rally to answer questions.
Before leaving Pitzer's office,
SDS member Leonard Siegel an
nounced, "If we aren't satisfied,
we will decide on what action to
take then."
SDS' nine demands center
around Trustee, faculty and SRI
involvement in defense contracts.
SDS asks that General Dynamics
president Roger Lewis, Northrop
president Tom Jones, and Hew
lett-Packard president William
Hewlett resign either from their
trustee or business positions.
Other demands ask that SRI

stop all research in Southeast
Asia, and close its office in Thai
land. Finally SDS requests that
faculty members sever all connec
tions with the Department of De
fense and that AEL stop all mili
tary-electronic research.
Last night Pitzer issued a state
ment on the SDS demands. He
said, "We must respect the free
doms which are central to the
University, and it is therefore un
acceptable to me, as the SDS has
proposed, that we interfere with
the individual freedom of choice
of trustees or faculty." (Complete
statement follows story)
John Munger, a senior in politi
cal science and head of the Com
mittee for Communication on
Campus, said, "On behalf of the
over 1000 students who last week
signed a petition condemning vio
lence and intimidation on campus,
and in the interest of Stanford as
an academic institution we strong
ly hope that Wednesday's rally
will not be ruined by childish and
violent tactics and language on the
parts of the administration or SDS
or others."
At the beginning of the march,
SDS members ran the red and
blue Viet Cong up the flagpole at
the Post Office. No American flag
was flown because of bad weather
yesterday morning.
Several people tried to remove
the flag, but it had been knotted
in a way which made it impossible
to remove except by climbing to
the top of the pole. Part of the
homemade flag blew away, and
the rest was removed several hours
later by maintenance employees.

this University to Stanford Re
search Institute. These questions
were circulated to you Jan. 14.
As I have made clear in many
meetings with students—including
members of the SDS—I under
stand and indeed share their con
cern about the war in Vietnam,
and I am well aware of the range
and complexity of the issues
which confront our universities
and our society because of it.
These issues are profoundly signif
icant and I am committed to
facing up to them openly and con
scientiously.
In opposing the tactics of the
SDS, the Student Legislature and
the Open Campus Committee also
have expressed their desire for
wide discussion of these and re
lated issues.
In facing those issues, we must
respect the freedoms which are
central to the University, and it is
therefore unacceptable to me to

consider, as the SDS has pro
posed, that we interfere with the
individual freedom of choice of
trustees or faculty. Just as I re
spect the right of individual stu
dents to make personal decisions
within the law according to their
personal values, I respect and de
fend that right for other members
of the University community such
as faculty members and members
of the Board of Trustees.
Consequently, insofar as any
demands insist that individual
freedoms be sacrificed, the answer
is unequivocal: these freedoms
apply to all members of the com
munity and Stanford will not re
strict them for one group while
upholding them for another.
Moreover, as to those demands
which speak to the University as
an institution, the record clearly
shows that those subjects are cur
rently under consideration by
University committees on which
students now serve. There is a
standing committee on research

appointed by the faculty senate,
and the committee investigating
the University's relationship with
Stanford Research Institute will
have its report ready by the
Spring Quarter. We cannot ask

12:30 rally today in the Old
Union courtyard.
Pitzer was not in his office at
the time, and the group left
promptly after presenting its invi
tation. Besides Pitzer, SDS asked
that Trustee William Hewlett of
Hewlett-Packard Corp., Prof. Wil
liam Rambo, director of the Ap
plied Electronics Laboratory,

(AEL) and Stanford Research In
stitute (SRI) Vice-President
Rudolph Brunsvold appear at the
rally to answer questions.
Before leaving Pitzer's office,
SDS member Leonard Siegel an
nounced, "If we aren't satisfied,
we will decide on what action to
take then."
SDS' nine demands center
around Trustee, faculty and SRI
involvement in defense contracts.
SDS asks that General Dynamics
president Roger Lewis, Northrop
president Tom Jones, and Hew
lett-Packard president William
Hewlett resign either from their
trustee or business positions.
Other demands ask that SRI

stop all research in Southeast
Asia, and close its office in Thai
land. Finally SDS requests that
faculty members sever all connec
tions with the Department of De
fense and that AEL stop all mili
tary-electronic research.
Last night Pitzer issued a state
ment on the SDS demands. He
said, "We must respect the free
doms which are central to the
University, and it is therefore un
acceptable to me, as the SDS has
proposed, that we interfere with
the individual freedom of choice
of trustees or faculty." (Complete
statement follows story)
John Munger, a senior in politi
cal science and head of the Com
mittee for Communication on
Campus, said, "On behalf of the
over 1000 students who last week
signed a petition condemning vio
lence and intimidation on campus,
and in the interest of Stanford as
an academic institution we strong
ly hope that Wednesday's rally
will not be ruined by childish and
violent tactics and language on the
parts of the administration or SDS
or others."
At the beginning of the march,
SDS members ran the red and
blue Viet Cong up the flagpole at
the Post Office. No American flag
was flown because of bad weather
yesterday morning.
Several people tried to remove
the flag, but it had been knotted
in a way which made it impossible
to remove except by climbing to
the top of the pole. Part of the
homemade flag blew away, and
the rest was removed several hours
later by maintenance employees.

this University to Stanford Re
search Institute. These questions
were circulated to you Jan. 14.
As I have made clear in many
meetings with students—including
members of the SDS—I under
stand and indeed share their con
cern about the war in Vietnam,
and I am well aware of the range
and complexity of the issues
which confront our universities
and our society because of it.
These issues are profoundly signif
icant and I am committed to
facing up to them openly and con
scientiously.
In opposing the tactics of the
SDS, the Student Legislature and
the Open Campus Committee also
have expressed their desire for
wide discussion of these and re
lated issues.
In facing those issues, we must
respect the freedoms which are
central to the University, and it is
therefore unacceptable to me to

consider, as the SDS has pro
posed, that we interfere with the
individual freedom of choice of
trustees or faculty. Just as I re
spect the right of individual stu
dents to make personal decisions
within the law according to their
personal values, I respect and de
fend that right for other members
of the University community such
as faculty members and members
of the Board of Trustees.
Consequently, insofar as any
demands insist that individual
freedoms be sacrificed, the answer
is unequivocal: these freedoms
apply to all members of the com
munity and Stanford will not re
strict them for one group while
upholding them for another.
Moreover, as to those demands
which speak to the University as
an institution, the record clearly
shows that those subjects are cur
rently under consideration by
University committees on which
students now serve. There is a
standing committee on research

appointed by the faculty senate,
and the committee investigating
the University's relationship with
Stanford Research Institute will
have its report ready by the
Spring Quarter. We cannot ask
those committees to continue
working conscientiously and at
the same time instruct them as to
what their conclusions must be.
I have pledged that as President
of Stanford I will ensure an open
community, and I have also
pledged that there will be new and
increasingly significant opportun
ities for discussion among all
members of the University com
munity. As a matter of fact, I
placed on the agenda of the Trus
tees, at their last meeting, a re
commendation for the formation
of a University Advisory Commit
tee, to include 5 students, 5
faculty members and 5 Trustees,
together with myself. That
committee will work on impor
tant subjects including the sugges
tions of students and faculty con
cerning possible candidates for
election to the Board of Trustees
and various modes of communica
tion to the Trustees of student
and faculty concerns. It is sadly
ironic that the Trustee meeting
was disrupted by some students
and, therefore, the Trustees could
not consider my recommendation
at that time.
Nevertheless, I hope to be able
to establish the committee in the
near future. This forum, in con
trast to confrontation, is designed
to allow reasoned discussion and
debate. I am confident it will help
to promote the understanding and
cooperation which are necessary
to make further constructive
changes.
The President of the Stanford
Chapter, AAUP, informs me that
this faculty organization next
week is planning a University-wide
forum for discussion of student
and faculty concerns about the
activities and policies of the Stan
ford Research Institute and
related questions, which have
been of concern to the Open
Campus Committee and other
groups.
To promote the fullest
discussion of these issues, I am
asking the chairman of the
President's Ad Hoc Committee on
SRI to report on the occasion of
this meeting its progress to date.
Substantial information gathered
by this Committee is available to
the University community in the
Meyer Library, and I invite
interested persons to peruse this
material in advance of the
meeting.
The issues posed by SRl's
relations to the University ramify
into questions touching upon the
academic freedom of students and
faculty alike, and I am glad to
learn that the AAUP forum will
be designed to reach into these
extremely important questions.
Kenneth S. Pitzer
President
