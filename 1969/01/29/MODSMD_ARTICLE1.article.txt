# Pitzer 'Invited
## SDS To Hold Rally 
### MARSHALL KILDUFF 
After running up a Viet Cong
flag on the Post Office flagpole,
forty members of Students for a
Democratic Society (SDS)
marched to President Kenneth Pit
zer's office yesterday afternoon to
invite him "to explain why he has
failed to meet our demands" at a
12:30 rally today in the Old
Union courtyard.
Pitzer was not in his office at
the time, and the group left
promptly after presenting its invi
tation. Besides Pitzer, SDS asked
that Trustee William Hewlett of
Hewlett-Packard Corp., Prof. Wil
liam Rambo, director of the Ap
plied Electronics Laboratory,

(AEL) and Stanford Research In
stitute (SRI) Vice-President
Rudolph Brunsvold appear at the
rally to answer questions.
Before leaving Pitzer's office,
SDS member Leonard Siegel an
nounced, "If we aren't satisfied,
we will decide on what action to
take then."
SDS' nine demands center
around Trustee, faculty and SRI
involvement in defense contracts.
SDS asks that General Dynamics
president Roger Lewis, Northrop
president Tom Jones, and Hew
lett-Packard president William
Hewlett resign either from their
trustee or business positions.
Other demands ask that SRI

stop all research in Southeast
Asia, and close its office in Thai
land. Finally SDS requests that
faculty members sever all connec
tions with the Department of De
fense and that AEL stop all mili
tary-electronic research.
Last night Pitzer issued a state
ment on the SDS demands. He
said, "We must respect the free
doms which are central to the
University, and it is therefore un
acceptable to me, as the SDS has
proposed, that we interfere with
the individual freedom of choice
of trustees or faculty." (Complete
statement follows story)
John Munger, a senior in politi
cal science and head of the Com
mittee for Communication on
Campus, said, "On behalf of the
over 1000 students who last week
signed a petition condemning vio
lence and intimidation on campus,
and in the interest of Stanford as
an academic institution we strong
ly hope that Wednesday's rally
will not be ruined by childish and
violent tactics and language on the
parts of the administration or SDS
or others."
At the beginning of the march,
SDS members ran the red and
blue Viet Cong up the flagpole at
the Post Office. No American flag
was flown because of bad weather
yesterday morning.
Several people tried to remove
the flag, but it had been knotted
in a way which made it impossible
to remove except by climbing to
the top of the pole. Part of the
homemade flag blew away, and
the rest was removed several hours
later by maintenance employees.
