"My father came here as head
of the chemistry department. I
was 11 years old at the time. I
remember Dr. Jordan, with his
usual slow slouch when he was
walking. He always said he walked
like he was working in the field
with one leg on the plow.
"In the first year at Stanford
there were approximately 500
boys and girls, and the number of
girls was always kept the same.
I remember the first foot
ball game well, it was played in
San Francisco near Golden Gate
Park. The games were always big
social events. The most stylish
girls went out with their boys in a
tally ho, and they always met
afterwards in the Palace Hotel. It
vas the headquarters for their
social life.

On Dr. and Mrs. Stanford
"The people who worked with
him were very fond of him. And
Mrs. Stanford, wasn't handsome
or fine looking, but she was
friendly and civil to all the people
she met."
Hippies
"I don't remember anything
like the hippy or protestors then.
There was no need to make any
fuss about being radical. You were
radical merely by being in school.
