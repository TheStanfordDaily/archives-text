### BARBARA RITZ 
PRESIDENT
DAVID STARR JORDAN
On the ideal college: "In an
ideal condition of things, the stu
dent's work ought not to be es
timated at all. Marks and terms
are clumsy devices, more suitable
for measuring cordwood than cul
ture. It is true, no doubt, that the
hope of a degree coaxes some men
to stay in college longer than they
otherwise would. This seems a
good thing, but is it? It is putting
a cheap price on culture to induce
the student to take it, not because
he wants it, but because he wants
something else. If a student's
work is perfunctory, the sooner
he leaves it for something real, the
better."

1906 Earthquake
"It happened about 5 o'clock
in the morning. I was home.
Mother and Dad had gone to the
opera. The house shook and the
plaster came down. We had some
friends spending the night with us
because we were alone. I remem
ber looking out of the window
and seeing the chaplain standing
in the next row of people,
wrapped up in a blanket.
"We got our first look after
breakfast, and when we saw the
things that had fallen, we got
small snaps of them.
"In the front there was a large
palm and we put our hats out and
sat under the date palm The fear
came afterwards, when you
realized that things could come
again."

OSCAR NELSON
MASTER PLANNER
STANFORD PLANNING OFFICE
"It's foolish to plan the archi
tecture of anything, without tak
ing the number of people into
consideration.
If we're to assume that the in
crease of students per year (a little
over 100) will remain what it has
been in the last 10 years, it would
take 25 years to get the enroll
ment up to 25,000.
Future Traffic Problems
"We've been discussing ways of
handling the traffic distribution as
well as future parking problems
on campus. There will be a ring
road which runs along the peri
meter of the campus, and would
take away some of the congestion
inside. Bikes will probably be used
more. The problem with bikes,
though, is bikes. You have to con
stantly watch out for them.
Certainly it could lessen the num
ber of cars on campus now, but
the trouble is that a student
comes to Stanford with both a
bike and car."
Lake Lagunita
"Lake Lagunita could be
turned into a permanent year
round feature. If the time comes
when we don't need the lake for
drinking water any more, then we
can do something to the bottom,
not concrete it, but put in clay or
something of that nature."

RAJ REDDY
Assistant Professor of
Computer Science
"With computers the mechanics
of teaching a course can be over
looked. The questions will be
'what should be taught' rather
than 'how.'
Future Classroom
"At Stanford there may be no
such thing as the quarter system.
Everybody will follow his own
individual program, some students
finishing a 4 year college program
in two years. You call it 'un
programmed education,' every
body can learn at his own stride.
There would be no need to learn
things at a fixed hour. You could
keep going at a very fast rate, such
as completing all the math re
quirements in one year.
World Lectures
"You could also start hearing
lectures from colleges all over the
country, especially from the top
men in their field. The computer
would make distances meaning
less."
"The computer can lead to
more self-motivated people.
Students, will see the day's lecture
when they feel like it.
Computers vs. Man
There are no sensitivity inputs
or outputs in a computer. It
would take a whole city block to
build a computer with a brain
capacity equal to that of a man.
"There is no reason to fear com
puters. The computer is just some
clever person who is telling the
computer what to do."

DENNIS BURKE, T.A. GEOLOGY
"Scientists have been saying that we're long overdue for another earthquake. The energy released from it
could be as great as the 1906 earthquake, but definitely nothing like the magnitude of half of California
sinking into the ocean.
What To Do
"One of the first warning's you'll get is that dogs might start to bark. Birds look nervous. Animals that
figet do so because of the high frequency vibrations, causing small crackling noises, which could start
anytime and which vary in different places.
And at areas along the fault, you could hear an audible noise, like a boom. Or else there would be no
sound at all. The earthquake could be either violent, a movement up and down, or else a gentle rocking
back and forth. Then you would get a sharp jolt that continues and is intensified. People literally would get
seasick.
Results
"The Stanford campus would not be damaged too much, because the ground on which the buildings rest
is composed generally of rough chunks, rather than on soft mud pockets like Foster City.
Most of the new buildings will be all right. If there is an earthquake, the first building that would be
totally destroyed is the Geology Corner. After the 1906 earthquake, the building and the walls were merely
patched up, and the shelves inside are now stuffed full with heavy specimens.
It's true that scientists have predicted an earthquake soon, but unless you say that the earthquake is
coming on a specific date, no one takes you seriously."
