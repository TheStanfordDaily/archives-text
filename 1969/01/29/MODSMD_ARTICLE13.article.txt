# Crash Programs
## Population Control Scored 
### 
Crash programs of population
control were sharply criticized by
a Stanford expert.
Speaking in Oxford, Ohio Prof.
Dudley Kirk of the Food Re
search Institute said that "far
from facing starvation, the world
has the best food outlook in a
generation."
He said a new "green revolu
tion," based on new seed grains
and wider fertilizer use, "promises
to give us at least a breathing
space" in seeking lower world
population growth rates.
The present "runaway growth"
of 2 or 3 percent annually should
be reduced to reasonable levels of
about 1 percent, he suggested.
'Little Relief'
But even crash programs can
promise "little relief" before
1980. Even a "very rapid" reduc
tion of fertility rates from their
present level would only reduce
projected world population from
4.6 to 4.1 billion by then.
Kirk said his own studies at
Stanford suggest that improved
living standards can trigger dra
matic downturns in birth rates in
less developed areas of the world.
No people adopt birth control
because their government tells
them to—they do so because their
conditions of life and their aspir
ations have changed.
Memorial Lecture
A nationally prominent dem
ographer, Kirk prepared his re
marks for delivery at the Pascal K.
Whelpton memorial lecture at the

Scripps Foundation for Research
in Population Problems at Miami
University here.
Even before this year's bumper
harvests, he declared, data com
piled by the UN Food and Agri
cultural Organization showed that
"food production has kept up
with population and generally
done a little better.
The shortages of 1966 and
1967 have had one salutary effect,
he noted: "governments are now
alerted to the need to put effort
into agricultural progress, form
erly the stepchild in most national
economies."
Famine Rare
"Hunger and malnutrition will
still be with us," he emphasized.
But in contrast with the views of
the alarmists, the facts are that—
aside from war —famine has be
come rarer and rarer.
"Hunger is not new. What is
new is our awareness of it, our ex
pressed concern, and our ex
pressed intention to do something
about it."
"Everyone admits that a large
proportion of the human race is ill
fed. One FAO estimate is that 20
percent of the world's population
is undernourished and that 60 per
cent do not receive an adequate
diet. The seed-fertilizer revolution
offers realistic hope that these
proportions will be much reduced
in the next decade," he said.
"On the economic side, (the
population problem) is not so

much a question of massive fam
ine, which is not imminent, as it is
of general social and economic
development to meet legitimate
aspirations of two-thirds of the
human race that do not yet enjoy
the basic amenities."
Birth Reduction
In East Africa, for example,
countries which have achieved a
per capita income of "little more
than $100" per year have precip
itated rapid reductions of birth
rates, he reported.
"The more advanced are all ex
periencing this phase of the vital
transition—Japan, Taiwan, Korea,
Hong Kong, Malaysia, Singapore
and Ceylon. In several of these,
government and private family
planning programs have helped,
but in each the reduction of the
birth rate (came before) govern
ment family planning programs
and the introduction of new con
traceptives.
Provision for legal abortion
under proper medical conditions
"is one of the most effective
measures a country can take to re
duce its birth rate, and in my
judgment it is a humane one as
well," he said.
Effective Control
"The most effective birth con
trol is the free will of individual
couples in a society that offers op
portunity for advancement of
themselves and their children."
The U.S., which Ls now exper
iencing the lowest birth rate in its
history, should look to migration,
not the birth rate, as the cause of
urban congestion and the flight to
the suburbs.
"In more than half the area of
the U.S., the population is declin
ing, Kirk observed. "There are
quite a few townships in the U.S.
that have fewer people now than
they had in 1790.
Huge Difference
"In 1900, the metropolitan
area of Los Angeles had 189,000
people. At the national growth
and birth rate, Los Angeles would
now be a nice little smogless place
of 500,000. But it isn't; it now
has a population of 7 million. The
huge difference is the result of
migration."
The U.S. birth rate will "rise
somewhat" in the next few years,
but present evide ice suggests that
those born in the post World War
II "baby boom" will marry later,
have longer in,ervals between
children, and per'iaps fewer child
ren than the parents, he predicted.
"Crash programs involving co
ercion are more likely to bring
down governments than birth
rates . .he said.

Stanford suggest that improved
living standards can trigger dra
matic downturns in birth rates in
less developed areas of the world.
No people adopt birth control
because their government tells
them to—they do so because their
conditions of life and their aspir
ations have changed.
Memorial Lecture
A nationally prominent dem
ographer, Kirk prepared his re
marks for delivery at the Pascal K.
Whelpton memorial lecture at the

Scripps Foundation for Research
in Population Problems at Miami
University here.
Even before this year's bumper
harvests, he declared, data com
piled by the UN Food and Agri
cultural Organization showed that
"food production has kept up
with population and generally
done a little better.
The shortages of 1966 and
1967 have had one salutary effect,
he noted: "governments are now
alerted to the need to put effort
into agricultural progress, form
erly the stepchild in most national
economies."
Famine Rare
"Hunger and malnutrition will
still be with us," he emphasized.
But in contrast with the views of
the alarmists, the facts are that—
aside from war —famine has be
come rarer and rarer.
"Hunger is not new. What is
new is our awareness of it, our ex
pressed concern, and our ex
pressed intention to do something
about it."
"Everyone admits that a large
proportion of the human race is ill
fed. One FAO estimate is that 20
percent of the world's population
is undernourished and that 60 per
cent do not receive an adequate
diet. The seed-fertilizer revolution
offers realistic hope that these
proportions will be much reduced
in the next decade," he said.
"On the economic side, (the
population problem) is not so

much a question of massive fam
ine, which is not imminent, as it is
of general social and economic
development to meet legitimate
aspirations of two-thirds of the
human race that do not yet enjoy
the basic amenities."
Birth Reduction
In East Africa, for example,
countries which have achieved a
per capita income of "little more
than $100" per year have precip
itated rapid reductions of birth
rates, he reported.
"The more advanced are all ex
periencing this phase of the vital
transition—Japan, Taiwan, Korea,
Hong Kong, Malaysia, Singapore
and Ceylon. In several of these,
government and private family
planning programs have helped,
but in each the reduction of the
birth rate (came before) govern
ment family planning programs
and the introduction of new con
traceptives.
Provision for legal abortion
under proper medical conditions
"is one of the most effective
measures a country can take to re
duce its birth rate, and in my
judgment it is a humane one as
well," he said.
Effective Control
"The most effective birth con
trol is the free will of individual
couples in a society that offers op
portunity for advancement of
themselves and their children."
The U.S., which Ls now exper
iencing the lowest birth rate in its
history, should look to migration,
not the birth rate, as the cause of
urban congestion and the flight to
the suburbs.
"In more than half the area of
the U.S., the population is declin
ing, Kirk observed. "There are
quite a few townships in the U.S.
that have fewer people now than
they had in 1790.
Huge Difference
"In 1900, the metropolitan
area of Los Angeles had 189,000
people. At the national growth
and birth rate, Los Angeles would
now be a nice little smogless place
of 500,000. But it isn't; it now
has a population of 7 million. The
huge difference is the result of
migration."
The U.S. birth rate will "rise
somewhat" in the next few years,
but present evide ice suggests that
those born in the post World War
II "baby boom" will marry later,
have longer in,ervals between
children, and per'iaps fewer child
ren than the parents, he predicted.
"Crash programs involving co
ercion are more likely to bring
down governments than birth
rates . .he said.
Crash programs of population
control were sharply criticized by
a Stanford expert.
Speaking in Oxford, Ohio Prof.
Dudley Kirk of the Food Re
search Institute said that "far
from facing starvation, the world
has the best food outlook in a
generation."
He said a new "green revolu
tion," based on new seed grains
and wider fertilizer use, "promises
to give us at least a breathing
space" in seeking lower world
population growth rates.
The present "runaway growth"
of 2 or 3 percent annually should
be reduced to reasonable levels of
about 1 percent, he suggested.
'Little Relief'
But even crash programs can
promise "little relief" before
1980. Even a "very rapid" reduc
tion of fertility rates from their
present level would only reduce
projected world population from
4.6 to 4.1 billion by then.

erly the stepchild in most national
economies."
Famine Rare
"Hunger and malnutrition will
still be with us," he emphasized.
But in contrast with the views of
the alarmists, the facts are that—
aside from war —famine has be
come rarer and rarer.
"Hunger is not new. What is
new is our awareness of it, our ex
pressed concern, and our ex
pressed intention to do something
about it."
"Everyone admits that a large
proportion of the human race is ill
fed. One FAO estimate is that 20
percent of the world's population
is undernourished and that 60 per
cent do not receive an adequate
diet. The seed-fertilizer revolution
offers realistic hope that these
proportions will be much reduced
in the next decade," he said.
"On the economic side, (the
population problem) is not so

much a question of massive fam
ine, which is not imminent, as it is
of general social and economic
development to meet legitimate
aspirations of two-thirds of the
human race that do not yet enjoy
the basic amenities."
Birth Reduction
In East Africa, for example,
countries which have achieved a
per capita income of "little more
than $100" per year have precip
itated rapid reductions of birth
rates, he reported.
"The more advanced are all ex
periencing this phase of the vital
transition—Japan, Taiwan, Korea,
Hong Kong, Malaysia, Singapore
and Ceylon. In several of these,
government and private family
planning programs have helped,
but in each the reduction of the
birth rate (came before) govern
ment family planning programs
and the introduction of new con
traceptives.
Provision for legal abortion
under proper medical conditions
"is one of the most effective
measures a country can take to re
duce its birth rate, and in my
judgment it is a humane one as
well," he said.
Effective Control
"The most effective birth con
trol is the free will of individual
couples in a society that offers op
portunity for advancement of
themselves and their children."
The U.S., which Ls now exper
iencing the lowest birth rate in its
history, should look to migration,
not the birth rate, as the cause of
urban congestion and the flight to
the suburbs.
"In more than half the area of
the U.S., the population is declin
ing, Kirk observed. "There are
quite a few townships in the U.S.
that have fewer people now than
they had in 1790.
Huge Difference
"In 1900, the metropolitan
area of Los Angeles had 189,000
people. At the national growth
and birth rate, Los Angeles would
now be a nice little smogless place
of 500,000. But it isn't; it now
has a population of 7 million. The
huge difference is the result of
migration."
The U.S. birth rate will "rise
somewhat" in the next few years,
but present evide ice suggests that
those born in the post World War
II "baby boom" will marry later,
have longer in,ervals between
children, and per'iaps fewer child
ren than the parents, he predicted.
"Crash programs involving co
ercion are more likely to bring
down governments than birth
rates . .he said.
Crash programs of population
control were sharply criticized by
a Stanford expert.
Speaking in Oxford, Ohio Prof.
Dudley Kirk of the Food Re
search Institute said that "far
from facing starvation, the world
has the best food outlook in a
generation."
He said a new "green revolu
tion," based on new seed grains
and wider fertilizer use, "promises
to give us at least a breathing
space" in seeking lower world
population growth rates.
The present "runaway growth"
of 2 or 3 percent annually should
be reduced to reasonable levels of
about 1 percent, he suggested.
'Little Relief'
But even crash programs can
promise "little relief" before
1980. Even a "very rapid" reduc
tion of fertility rates from their
present level would only reduce
projected world population from
4.6 to 4.1 billion by then.
Kirk said his own studies at
Stanford suggest that improved
living standards can trigger dra
matic downturns in birth rates in
less developed areas of the world.
No people adopt birth control
because their government tells
them to—they do so because their
conditions of life and their aspir
ations have changed.
Memorial Lecture
A nationally prominent dem
ographer, Kirk prepared his re
marks for delivery at the Pascal K.
Whelpton memorial lecture at the

Scripps Foundation for Research
in Population Problems at Miami
University here.
Even before this year's bumper
harvests, he declared, data com
piled by the UN Food and Agri
cultural Organization showed that
"food production has kept up
with population and generally
done a little better.
The shortages of 1966 and
1967 have had one salutary effect,
he noted: "governments are now
alerted to the need to put effort
into agricultural progress, form
erly the stepchild in most national
economies."
