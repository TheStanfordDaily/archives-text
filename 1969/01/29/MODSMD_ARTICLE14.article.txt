# Instructional TV Effective
## 
### 
Instructional television has
firmly established itself as an ef
ficient teaching method.
In fact, educators only need to
ask two questions about it, ac
cording to a report by Stanford's
Institute for Communication Re
search made for the U.S. Office of
Education.
The questions are: (1) Does the
teaching situation call for it? and
(2) how can it be used effectively?
The survey, compiled under
the supervision of Communication
Institute Director Wilbur
Schramm and Prof. Godwin Chu,
was made public at a recent meet
ing of the National Association of
Broadcasters.
Variety of Objectives
The evidence, they reported,
comes from "many countries,
from studies of all age levels from
pre-school to adults, and from a
great variety of subject matter and
learning objectives."
The research, compiled over a
two-year period, noted that the

effectiveness of instructional tele
vision, or ITV, "has been demon
strated in well over 100 countries,
performed in many parts of the
world, in developing as well as in
dustrialized countries . . .
Some highlights from the re
port:
• "By and large, ITV can more
easily be used effectively for pri
mary and secondary school stu
dents than for college stu
dents ....
• "Television can be used effi
ciently to teach any subject mat
ter where one-way communica
tion will contribute to learn
ing. . .
• "Television is most effective
as a tool for learning when used in
a suitable context of learning ac
tivities at the receiving end . . .
• "It is more likely to be an ef
ficient part of an educational
system when it applied to a pro
blem of sufficient magnitude to
call forth broad support . . ."
Size Unimportant
Neither the size of the screen
nor the magnification of the
image improves the learning pro
cess, the report said, nor does
color TV or films.
Motor skills, such as knot
tying or nursing training, were
best learned when presented by
camera from the observer's angle,
rather than from the teacher's.
Humor, animation or other at
tention-getting devices don't seem
to make a significant contribution
to learning. What matters is an
orderly, logical lesson carefully
presented.
Teacher Follow-up
Repeated showings of a pro
gram will increase learning up to a
point, but teacher-directed follow
up is more effective than a second
showing.
"The students are likely to ac
quire the same amount of learning
from ITV whether the material is
presented as a lecture, an inter
view, or a panel discussion," the
report found.

ITV has a built-in ilaw, the re
port noted: "The lack of oppor
tunity for students to raise ques
tions and participate in free dis
cussion would seem to reduce the
effectiveness of learning from
ITV, particularly if the students
are fairly advanced or the material
is relatively complicated."
Further, "if a student can be
given immediate knowledge of
whether he has responded correc
tly, he will learn more."


MEDICINE AND COMPUTERS—Medicine's future depends increasingly on how
much it makes use of technological advances, such as computers. Bill Brody,
third year medical student and engineering doctoral candidate, is shown on a
working visit to ACMR, Stanford's Advanced Computer for Medical Research.
