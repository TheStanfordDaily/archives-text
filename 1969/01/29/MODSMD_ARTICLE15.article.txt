# Engineering Useful In Medical Future

Stockton-born William R.
Brody, 25, preparing for that day,
is studying for a doctoral degree
in electrical engineering as well as
a medical degree.
"Until we have people who are
trained in both fields, we are go
ing to have a hard time bringing
powerful engineering techniques
to bear on clinical medicine," he
says. But his guess is that more
and more engineering students
will enter medical school. "There
may be fewer people now who
want to go out and build bombs,"
he says.
Technology's most valuable
tool, the computer, is beginning
to be used he explains, in at least
three areas of medicine: basic
medical research, patient monitor
ing and more efficient delivery of
hospital care.
Computer Applied
An example of the computer
applied to research is the work go
ing on in a Stanford University
School of Medicine neurology lab.
There, the computer is doing
laborious analyses in a study of

how body movements are con
trolled. The study may someday
contribute to better therapy for
correcting abnormal limb move
ments caused by neurological
diseases.
"Patient monitoring, such as
that done in intensive care units,
can be automated to the extent
that computers will be able to
provide around-the-clock surveil
lance and alert the medical staff as
soon as an abnormality occurs,"
says Bill. "And computers will be
able to help the hospitals of the
future run wards, locate medical
information and tabulate test re
sults."
Bill started his college educa
tion at MIT, where he took the
S.B. in electrical engineering in
1965 and the S.M. in 1966. A
summer job between his junior
and senior years at Stagg High
School in Stockton played an im
portant part in his choice of
schools; he worked alongside a
graduate of the famed institute on
a National Science Foundation
grant.

Three summers later, with two
years of MIT under his belt,
another summer job, this time on
a California Heart Association Fel
lowship, brought him into the
medical camp."I worked under a
pediatric surgeon at Children's
Hospital in San Francisco," says
Bill, "and the exposure to physi
cians was the key factor in my de
cision to go to medical school."
His father, an ophthalmologist,
had encouraged him since boy
hood to "work at whatever I wan
ted." It turned out that Bill wan
ted, and excelled at, biology and
math and physics, so he has opted
for the double doctorate.
The winner of the 1964 Scott
Foundation Leadership Award as
the most outstanding student in
his class at MIT, Bill also received
the Hewlett-Packard Biomedical
Engineering Fellowship at Stan
ford in 1967. He currently holds a
Life Insurance Medical Research
Foundation Fellowship.

Stockton-born William R.
Brody, 25, preparing for that day,
is studying for a doctoral degree
in electrical engineering as well as
a medical degree.
"Until we have people who are
trained in both fields, we are go
ing to have a hard time bringing
powerful engineering techniques
to bear on clinical medicine," he
says. But his guess is that more
and more engineering students
will enter medical school. "There
may be fewer people now who
want to go out and build bombs,"
he says.
Technology's most valuable
tool, the computer, is beginning
to be used he explains, in at least
three areas of medicine: basic
medical research, patient monitor
ing and more efficient delivery of
hospital care.
Computer Applied
An example of the computer
applied to research is the work go
ing on in a Stanford University
School of Medicine neurology lab.
There, the computer is doing
laborious analyses in a study of

how body movements are con
trolled. The study may someday
contribute to better therapy for
correcting abnormal limb move
ments caused by neurological
diseases.
"Patient monitoring, such as
that done in intensive care units,
can be automated to the extent
that computers will be able to
provide around-the-clock surveil
lance and alert the medical staff as
soon as an abnormality occurs,"
says Bill. "And computers will be
able to help the hospitals of the
future run wards, locate medical
information and tabulate test re
sults."
Bill started his college educa
tion at MIT, where he took the
S.B. in electrical engineering in
1965 and the S.M. in 1966. A
summer job between his junior
and senior years at Stagg High
School in Stockton played an im
portant part in his choice of
schools; he worked alongside a
graduate of the famed institute on
a National Science Foundation
grant.

Three summers later, with two
years of MIT under his belt,
another summer job, this time on
a California Heart Association Fel
lowship, brought him into the
