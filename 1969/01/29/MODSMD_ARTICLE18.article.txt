# Indians Outclass SF Rugby Club
## 
### DAVE NOLAND 
Stanford's undefeated rugby
team racked up the San Francisco
Rugby Club 14-9 Saturday for its
third straight win of the year.
John Huss of the Indians pro
vided the margin of victory with
an 80-yard Try, longest of the
year for the Tribe.
SFRC, bolstered by a sizeable
English and Australian contingent
(their coach encouraged his
charges with such exhortations as
"Jolly well played, City!"),
played smart, sound rugby, but
just didn't have the horses to
match Stanford.
And the few mistakes they did
make were instantly converted
into Stanford points by the uner
ring toe of Leon Hartvickson. Leo
hit dead-center on three out of
three penalty kicks, and also con
verted Huss's spectacular Try.
Missed Opportunities
The City boys let several early
scoring opportunities slip by.
Peter Hogg twice missed makeable
penalty kicks, and a drop kick at
tempt was wide by inches.
The Farm boys drew first
blood when Hartvickson kicked a
40-yard penalty goal after an over
eager SF forward jumped offside
in a lineout.
A Try by SF's John Bias tied
the score at 3-3. Stanford fullback
Mike Forster, backed up against
his goal line, knocked on trying to
field a high, slippery SF kick. Bias
picked the ball out of the ensuing
scrum and sliced over for the
score.
HartvifiÂ».;on put the Tribe back
on top 6-3 with another penalty
kick late in the half.
Offside
But on the ensuing kiokoff, the
aggressive City pack quickly
moved the ball deep into Stanford
territory. A frantic kicking melee
followed, and an overanxious
Stanford player was offside.
Hogg missed the easy penalty
kick, but Stanford was again off
side trying to block it. Hogg's
reprieve proved to be only tem
porary, however, as his second
kick hit the upright and caromed
back onto the field, where an
amazed and very lucky Stanford
team was able to run out the last
few seconds of the half and hang
onto its 6-3 lead.
Leo Again
Hartvickson opened the second
half with his third straight penalty
kick, upping the Tribe's lead to
9-3.
A "few minutes later, Huss took
a pass near his own 25-yard line,
burst through two tacklers,
straight-armed a third, and
sprinted 80 yards through the
mud to the goal line.
Hartvickson easily converted,
making it 14-3.
The City boys fought back
bravely, turning two Stanford
mental errors into penalty kicks.
But it was a case of too little, too
late, and the Tribe finished com
fortably on top 14-9.
Hooker Bill Bucklin was in
jured in the first half. Sub Jim

Squieri raced dramatically out of
the stands, feverishly changed into
his jockular togs, and substituted
quite creditibly for Bucklin, who
injured a rib and may see action
this weekend.
The second team slogged its
way to a 3-9 win over the Santa
Clara varsity.
