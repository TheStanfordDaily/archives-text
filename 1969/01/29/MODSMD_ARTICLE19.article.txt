# Tribe Flanker Elated
## 49ers Draft Washington 
### GARY CAVALLI 
Yesterday was no ordinary day
for Gene Washington.
The 6-1, 185 pound senior,
quite possibly the finest pass re
ceiver ever to put on a Stanford
football uniform, was drafted by
the San Francisco 49ers in the
combined NFL-AFL professional
draft.
The 49ers took Washington
with their first round choice, after
selecting Penn State's All-Amer
ican tight end Ted Kwalich with a
pick obtained from New Orleans.
You might say Gene was happy
over being chosen by the SF club.
"It's just terrific," an elated
Washington told us yesterday
when we collared him at the 49ers
training camp in Redwood City.
"I can't describe my feelings in
one word. It's more than I could
ever hope for."
Earlier this year Washington re
vealed that he would prefer play
ing in the Bay Area, although he
would play for any pro team that
drafted him. "It would be ideal to
play for the 49ers or Raiders,"
Gene said last November.
Dream Comes True
Yesterday he felt the same
way: "It's almost too good to be
true. I've always dreamed of play
ing with the 49ers, and now, for

tunately, everything has worked
out."
Washington is looking forward
to working with John Brodie,
whom he has known for the past
four years, and 49er flanker Clif
ton McNeil.
"I've always wanted to play
with John Brodie," Gene said,
"especially since I've gotten to
know him quite well. Clifton
McNeil is a great receiver, and I
know I can learn a lot from him.
He's been around for a few years,
and I'm sure he can teach me
quite a bit."
Gene realizes he may have
some difficulty learning to cope
with complicated pro defenses,
but feels that having played on
the pro-type Stanford offense
may prove a great asset to him.
"I know one problem will be
learning the different defenses the
pros use," Washington admitted
yesterday. "They disguise their
defense so well that you never
know when they're in a zone or
man-to-man. But I feel very lucky
to have played at Stanford this
year, since we emphasized the
passing offense."
Nolan Pleased
49er Coach Dick Nolan was
very happy to get the fleet
Stanford flanker. "We felt Wash
ington was one of the two or

three best wide receivers available.
If Ron Sellers had still been
around, we probably would have
flipped a coin between him and
Washington. But when Sellers was
grabbed by Boston, Gene was un
doubtably the choice."
The San Francisco mentor
went on to say he felt that the
49ers would "definitely" have po
tentially the best receiving corps
in the league next year.
"Inexperience may be a fac
tor," Nolan remarked, "but with
McNeil, Washington, Kwalick, and
Dick Witcher, we're in pretty
good shape. It's nice to have a
man to come in as a replacement
who's just as good as the starters,
and that's the kind of position
we'll be in next fall."
49er Quarterback John Brodie,
who has often said Washington
would make a great pro receiver,
was understandably very pleased
by Gene's selection.
"Gene has fantastic speed,
great moves, and a fine pair of
hands," the San Francisco signal
caller said yesterday."I was hop
ing we would get either Ted
Kwalick or Gene. To have gotten
them both is really great. If I can
get the ball to them, Washington
and McNeil should be the best
pair of deep receivers in the

league. And Ted Kwalick is sup
posed to be one of the best tight
ends to come along in a long
time."
Falcons Grab Snider
Washington was not the only
Stanford player to be picked in
the early rounds of the pro dsaft.
Co-captain Malcolm Snider, 6-4,
235 pound offensive tackle, was
selected on the third round by the
Atlanta Falcons.
The Falcons, .attempting to
strengthen a pitifully weak offen
sive line, drafted Notre Dame's
George Kunz with their first pick.
Kunz, also an offensive tackle,
and Snider should give a big boost
to the sagging Atlanta forward
wall.
