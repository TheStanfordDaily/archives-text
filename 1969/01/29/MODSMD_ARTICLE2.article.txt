# Senior Charged With Sounding False Alarm
## 
### 
James Johnson, senior in chem
ical engineering and a member of
the Students for a Democratic
Society (SDS), has been charged
for allegedly "tampering with or
sounding a false alarm" by the
Santa Clara County district at
torney's office.
In a complaint filed by the
Santa Clara County Fire Mar
shall's office, Johnson is charged
with having "maliciously trans
mitted a false alarm of fire by util
izing a public alarm system at the
Stanford Faculty Club."
An investigation which was
conducted jointly by the Stanford
Fire Department and the Santa
Clara County Fire Marshall alleges
that Johnson pulled the fire alarm
on Tuesday, January 14, during
the fracas between the Board of
Trustees and members of the
Stanford SDS.
According to Stanford Assis
tant Fire Chief, Frank Jurian,
Johnson was seen breaking the

alarm by at least two people pres
ent at the scene. Jurian refused to
name the witnesses, however, be
cause it was a "touchy issue" and
because he was "not at liberty to
do so."
Jurian said that pulling a false
alarm was classified as a mis
demeanor punishable by a $500
fine or six months in jail or both,
but that the judge is responsible
for setting the exact punishment.
He further stated that Johnson's
was "not a unique case, that there
are several false alarms from uni
versity buildings turned in each
year."
"In the years since I have been
with the Stanford Fire Depart
ment, I have never seen anyone go
to jail for this offense," Jurian
said. "This case is not being
handled differently than any of
the other cases of false alarm."
Johnson has been arraigned for
February 3 at ten o'clock in De
partment 3 of the Santa Clara
County courthouse.
