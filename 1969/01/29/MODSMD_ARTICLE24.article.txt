# New Planner Chosen To Upgrade Buildings
## 
### MORRIS WEE 
Planning the use of buildings so
that they meet both safety and
academic standards is the primary
function of the University's new
est employee.
Bruce L. Wiggins, filling the
newly created post as Manager of
Facilities Safety Planning, will
"plan and implement a long range
program to upgrade the protec
tion provided Stanford's buildings
and facilities," Daniel DeYoung,
Director of Public Safety, said re
cently.
Wiggins graduated from Stan
ford in 1948, and has served as
County Fire Marshal since 1952.
After barely two weeks at his
new job, Wiggins is still trying to
acquaint himself with his facili
ties. Over half of the Campus's
buildings were built in the last ten
years.
Develops Program
Wiggins will work with the
fire and police departments to
develop "a program to consider in
the design of new buildings and
modification of older structures
systems which will reduce losses
from fire, vandalism, thefts and
other causes," said DeYoung.
But, Wiggins emphasized, his
job concerns "not just new con
struction, not just safety." With
old buildings as well as new, he
will try to find the use to which
the building is best suited, consid
ering both function and safety.
Wiggins wants to remodel some
older buildings "without impair
ing esthetics." "There's more than
one way to make a building both
useable and safe," he said.
Unsuitable Building
He cited the example of the
NROTC building as one which
was not suited to its use. The
building used to be the faculty
club, he said. It's "not designed
for ROTC at all." The NROTC
building has burned down twice in
the last two years.
To prevent accidents like these
fires from occurring, Wiggins has
become "a full-time professional
pessimist."

One major cause for his pessim
ism is old electric wiring systems.
In electric systems, he said, "what
is good today is obsolete tomor
row." The wiring systems in some
of the old fraternities have been
dangerous for years, he said.
