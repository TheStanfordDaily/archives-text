# LASSU Meeting To Consider Education Council Proposal
## 
### JENNY MATTHEWS 
Conflicts arising over the
newly-proposed student Edu
cation Council to consider SES
proposals will be deliberated at to
night's special meeting of the Stu
dent Legislature (LASSU).
According to LASSU speaker
Yale Braunstein a major contro
versy exists as to whether the
Legislature should accept the pro
posal for the Education Council as
outlined by the Academic Senate
last week.
The Council was originally con
ceived of as a 53-representative
student group that would meet in
joint sessions with the faculty
Academic Senate to discuss SES
recommendations.
According to Coalition mem
ber Pat Shea, "it was the student
intention to insure that an equal
number of students be constantly
involved in the SES discussions of
the 53-member Academic
Senate."
Joint voting would be em
ployed in decision-making.
Separate Voting
The Senate agreed to student
participation in SES evaluation,
but called for separate voting of
the two bodies.
According to Senate Chairman
Leonard Schiff, the two groups
could not engage in joint, voting
because such a procedure would
violate a part of the original
Senate charter and the voting of a
106-member group would be "too
cumbersome".
Braunstein expressed concern
as to whether a student commit
tee voting separately from the
faculty senate adequately fulfills
the need for a student-faculty
decision-making group.
"The Senate seems to be ad

mitting, by setting up separate
voting," Braunstein continued,
"that it believes student interests
and faculty interests to be differ
ent."
Braunstein added that "sepa
rate voting would tend to stifle
cooperation."
Not Participation
LASSU member Jeff Kane
voiced further dissatisfaction of
the Senate's proposal for the Edu
cation Council because of the in
stigation of separate voting.
"The Faculty Senate's idea of
participation," stated Kane, is not
what the students had in mind."
Kane believes that students
should have equal say with the
faculty in the discussion of SES
proposals and in joint-voting ses
sions because "students have a
legitimate interest in deciding mat
ters whicn will be very significant
in their lives. The Study of Edu
cation at Stanford is one of these
matters."
Kane continued that students
are perhaps even more qualified to
evaluate SES proposals because
they "have a special knowledge of
the University based on their
everyday experiences which gives
students the potential to greatly
contribute to the changing of poli
cies that surpasses the faculty's
experiences.
"I challenge any faculty mem
ber to say that he is more quali
fied than students to make judge
ments concerning residence poli
cies, for instance, when he has
never, in fact, lived in a University
residence as a student."
No Great Violation
According to Shea, however,
the instigation of separate voting

does not considerably violate the
original conception of the Edu
cation Council.
"The concept of community of
scholars taking part in a com
munity forum," stated Shea, "is
what we had originally aspired to.
The Faculty Senate's proposal al
ludes to the concept of the com
munity forum."
"If the Education Council
voted and the Faculty Senate
didn't listen to them, then the stu

dent members could rightfully go
to their constituents and then
organize a confrontation."
If the Education Council is ap
proved at tonight's meeting the
question of selecting the student
members will be discussed.
LASSU members clashed in
last week's meeting over whether
to choose the members by means
of a campus-wide election or by a
LASSU selection committee.
The legislature will meet to
night at 7:30 in room 370.
