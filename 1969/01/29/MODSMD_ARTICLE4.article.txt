# SES Meetings Set
## 
### BROOKE SHEARER 
The Senate of the Academic
Council endorsed plans Friday for
a university-wide Conference on
Educational Objectives to be held
Feb. 10 and 11.
Further the Senate unani
mously recommended that all
faculty consider suspending or re
scheduling their classes on Tues
day, Feb. 11, so that students
would be able to attend the day
long discussions.
The Conference, according to
its steering committee head, John
Kramer, will be focused on the
subjects covered in the SES Re
ports on Undergraduate Edu
cation and University Residences.
"These reports," says Kramer,
"may be viewed as the most re
cent definitive document of the
continuing effort to make edu
cation at Stanford relevant to
both the needs of individual stu
dents and the world within which
the University operates."
The Conference is scheduled to
come just prior to the Academic

Senate's consideration of SES pro
posals on February 3. At that
meeting summaries of the discus
sions among faculty, students, ad
ministrators, and Trustees during
the Conference will be submitted
to the Senate. "In this way," says
Kramer, "the Study of Education
at Stanford will derive both great
er legitimacy and more accuracy."
Kramer and his steering com
mittee have sent letters to all
faculty members and more than
80 students asking for their help
in participating on the panels and
in the discussion groups planned
for the conference.
The groups which have been
scheduled thus far are: The Fresh
man Year, Distribution Policies
and Requirements, Special Pro
grams, Calender and Schedule,
Academics and Bookkeeping, Uni
versity Housing, Fraternities and
Campus Community.
Students interested in applying
to serve on these inner
community discussion groups as
either panel members or modera
tors can pick up an application
blank in the ASSU office.
The Conference Steering Com
mittee plans to begin the two-day
program with a general afternoon
meeting on Monday, February 10.
Renowned educators Prof. David
Riesman and Irving Howe have
agreed to speak.
Fifteen faculty members have
already offered to invite five to
seven students into their homes
the night before to discuss SES
proposals and the educational pro
cess.
