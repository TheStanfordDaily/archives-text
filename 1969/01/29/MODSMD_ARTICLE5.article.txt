# Biafran Speaks
## "No Nigerian Coexistence" 
### BRIAN McCAFFREY 
The "crises politics" of
Nigerian history leading up to the
Biafran/Nigerian conflict and the
nature of that war were the sub
jects of the speech by Dr.
Obichere yesterday afternoon.
Dr. Obichere, who holds de
grees from the University of Min
nesota, Berkeley and Oxford pre
sented the Biafran point of view
on the topic.
Obichere first emphasized the
separate history of the various
groups in Nigeria. He referred to
the joining of the different areas
under one governor general by the
British as, "the nightmare of
amalgamation." He said that the
British did this so that the strong
economy of the South would off
set the debts of the North.
Dr. Obichere charged the Brit
ish with relying on the "psychol
ogy of the noble savage" in their
dealings with the Africans.
Rooted in 1953
Dr. Obichere asserted that the
roots of the present conflict were
evident in the events of 1953.
During this year there were great

"social upheavals" in which many
Ibos were killed. Subsequently
Eastern and Western Nigeria de
clared their independence from
Britain. Northern Nigeria, how
ever did not do this until some
time later.
The speaker stated that jeal
ousy in the North stemmed from
this action and has been at the
root of the conflict ever since.
This jealousy, Dr. Obichere
said, also resulted from the differ
ence in the degree of development
in the various ethnic groups. He
characterized the Ibos and
Yorubas of the south east and
west as being far more advanced
than the Hausas of the North.
No Aggression
According to Dr. Obichere the
secession was precipitated by the
massacre of 1966. At this time a
number of Ibos and some Yorubas
and minority tribesmen were
killed in a reaction against the
1964 coup.
The speaker said that Biafra
was not fighting a war of aggres

sion and would willingly accept a
peace settlement. However he also
stated that "the talk of bringing
Biafra back into Nigeria is pure
rubbish." He declared that this
was not the manifest intention of
the tribes of the North, thus im
plying the change of genocide.
He also stated that he person
ally felt that the two groups could
never co-exist under one govern
ment.
Urges Support
Dr. Obichere concluded his
speech by urging the members of
the audience to become involved,
to send relief to Biafra, and to
support Biafran self-determina
tion.
Dr. Obichere's speech was one
in a series, given by people from
both sides of the conflict and
sponsored by the Stanford Com
mittee for Nigerian/Biafran Relief.
The next event will be a talk and
slides by a former Church World
Service director.
The committee is sponsoring
an advertisement in today's Daily
to publicize its relief fund drive.
