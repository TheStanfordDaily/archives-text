# 'Spirited' Walker Responds To SES Criticism
## 
### DENNIS PERLUSS 
Robert A. Walker leaned back
in his swivel chair, thanked his
secretary for the cup of coffee she
had handed him, flashed his broad
grin, and replied, "That's a hell of
a big task."
He had just been asked to com
ment on the general philosophy of
the Study of Education at Stan
ford (SES) and in particular on
the recent report by its Commit
tee on Study Abroad.
"I agree with the premise of
the SES with its ideal of the inter
ested and highly motivated stu
dent working with an equally in
terested and motivated advisor."
Walker then paused, stood up,
moved to another chair, placed his
feel on the desk, rocked back and
continued:
"I've been working with these
matters a great many years. With
experience one tends to see prob
lems that will inevitably be en
countered. With the best intent I
have raised some of these prob
lems and in the process I sound
conservative."
Spirited Defense
Walker, Director of General
Studies and of Overseas Cam
puses, took the opportunity of
this Daily interview to attack
many aspects of the Report on
Studv Abroad, the fifth of the ten

SES committee reports. Con
fronted with this highly critical
student-faculty review of present
policy, Walker responded with a
spirited defense.
He found particularly objec
tionable the recommendations to
separate administrative and
policy-making functions; to de
centralize control of the campuses
by creating five committees, one
for each campus; to add to re
quirements for acceptance to the
program; and to increase greatly
the amount of course specializa
tion and independent study.
Walker specifically expressed
disappointment that the work
that he and his General Studies
Subcommittee on Overseas Cam
puses has done to create "not an
ideal program, but the best pro
gram that there is," had met with
only one general acknowledge
ment in the introduction to the
report.
The balance of the report and
recommendations, he complained,
were full of "Snide implications
that we don't know what the hell
we are doing."
He termed "personally offen
sive and in error" those sections
of the report which appeared to
criticize his allegedly great per
sonal power as well as "hanky

panky" in the selection of faculty
members.
'One-sidedness'
Walker ascribed part of the
"one-sideness" of the report to
"preconceptions on the part of
some members of the commit
tee."
During the interview Walker re
peatedly emphasized that not he,
but the General Studies Subcom
mittee on Overseas Campuses, was
responsible for policy and curricu
lum decisions. "I'm the channel
through which policy recommend
ations come for implementation."
He chided the SES recommen
dation to separate academic
policy-making from adminis
tration as being "unrealistic" des
pite the SES contention that this
would "reflect common Univer
sity practice."
Such a proposal, he said, is
completely out of touch with how
policies are made and imple
mented. He added in his deep
throated laugh, "My field is public
administration."
Individual Committees
The SES calls the creation of
an individual committee for each
campus the "key feature of our
proposals." Walker termed the
idea "burdensome and difficult to
work with."
He agreed that the Overseas

Program should be separated from
the General Studies Office, but
feels that to legislate the structure
proposed by SES would be the
"death knell of the overseas cam
pus program."
SES concluded, in contrast,
that maximum diversity and ex
ploitation of resources would be
most probable only if policies for
each campus are formulated by
separate committees. In fact, the
report called the creation of these
committees "essential to the
future of the overseas program."
SES further stated that most
faculty members and students to
whom they had talked supported
their position.
Walker maintained his position
against the proposal primarily on
the "need for co-ordination to
make the program financially feas
ible."
Cavaliere Dismissal
He called the SES committee
"unduly cavaliere" in its dismissal
of cost factors which he claimed
would deter many students from
going overseas. As an example he
cited the impossibility of charter
ing planes for student transport if
certain SES scheduling proposals
are effected.
The report's consideration of
the cost problem was limited to
the statement that "the University

should not place a premium on
achieving the program's goals
without cost to the budget or to
participating students," including
more extensive course preparation
before departure.
Walker chuckled contentedly
at what he termed the inconsis

tency between SES calls for
greater flexibility in all other areas
of the University while demanding
more requirements for overseas.
"The Overseas Campuses are now
operating within the self-motiva
tion framework of the SES philos
ophy." Still laughing, he added,
"Don't forget to print that!"
Walker vehemently disagreed
with the recommendation which
called for much more specializa
tion, advanced study, and inde
pendent work directed from the
home campus.
He called the alleged lack of
specialization a "straw m.*M ' and
cited examples of experimental
courses now offered or planned
which had been ignored by the
Committee on Study Abroad.
Pacing back and forth behind
his desk, Walker declared that to
turn the Overseas Campuses into
centers for specialized study
would be a "tremendous loss to
education at Stanford." He ex
pressed his concern that the pro
gram should advance the educa
tion of as many Stanford students
as possible. He did not, however,
object to offering some advanced
work at the campuses.
Walker declared that too many
non-scholastic claims on student
time make the "mail-order-direc
ted-work" proposal unfeasible.
