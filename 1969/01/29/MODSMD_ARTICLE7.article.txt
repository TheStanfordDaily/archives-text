" . . .Well, anyway, man, then
what happened?"
"It was fantastic! I mean, we
had all been expecting really the
worst in '69. In the White House
we had Nixon, and at Stanford we
had Pitzer. But Pitzer fooled us.
You know how things had gotten,
everybody getting more polarized.
I, myself, was hung up about it,
and I knew I had to come down
on the side of the street people if
it came to that."
"And it was coming to that."
"Indeed it was. You know how
we all were saying, 'Unless the
University gets out of business as
usual and takes radical action, it's
going to be civil war?' Well, that's
what happened.
"It started with a strike by
SDS over some usual thing, like
Southeast Asia, but there was
something in people's mood
how can you predict those
things?—and it grew. Lots of
students stayed out. Not propa
ganda things, but real examina
tions of the relevant questions. Of
course, we all expected the ad
ministration to call the police."
"Didn't it?"

"No! I guess Pitzer had learned
something from SF State, about
how it just keeps going. Somehow
he knew that both sides just stif
fened in reaction to each other.
So he struck out on his own.
Now, I don't know. In the begin
ning he may have been pulling a
Kennedy—you know, a "new
moral crusade" which is really a
tactic of crisis management.
That's what the Left thought at
first.
"But he was so good at it that
they knew they were finessed.
When he promised all that money
for a new radical studies depart
ment, and came out among the
kids for eight hours of up-front
talk, and presented a motion to
the faculty to disengage in war re
search. I mean, it bugged us that
he was giving us those things, but
we would have looked pretty silly
to keep up.
"But we did slip in a few
things, like the student-faculty en
counter groups. I myself was in
one with Pitzer, Lyman, Bruce
Franklin, and Steve Weissman,
among others, led by Hsuain
Chung—a 40 hour marathon. Talk
about heavy scenes! For the first

day we damn near killed each
other!"
"You've got to be putting me
on!"
"No, man, it worked. I mean
we dug on each other. Look, I
know it sounds insane. But it was
after that that Weissman drew up
the platform of the Radical
Democratic Party and Pitzer led
the march on the Pentagon! And
all over the campus it was happen
ing. Rambo gave a speech to some
national group of engineers that
pulled 90% of them out of war
research. And the SDS kids! It
was like when they had just
started in radicalism—hope and
tolerance and joy. And it was in
fectious.
"Like when the national SDS
sent a delegation to China and
somehow got to Mao. I mean,
they knew he was a good cat, but
even they had no idea he'd go as
far as he did. But it did help when
Nixon dropped acid and decided
to restrict American overseas in
vestment."
"Uh huh, and how did that
happen?"
"When Sandy Dornbusch gave
it to David Packard who gave it to

Nixon. Believe me, man, getting
Dornbush to drop it was the hard
est part. After that, all that man's
natural energy carried it the rest
of the way. And when Reagan ap
peared nude, wow! I thought I
was going to die!"
"Out. of sight! I wish I'd been
there!"
"Yeah, it was a trip. With
Kathleen Cleaver on one arm and
Reies Tijerina on the other. And
Allen Ginsberg chanted. And
Virgil Whittaker was there dressed
as Falstaff. That was to celebrate
the institution of anarchy in
California, when Jesse Unruh had
met Ken Kesey and gone biking
with the Angels."
"And it all started from that
thing at Stanford?"
It had to start somewhere. I
mean we hit bottom and bounced.
But it seems there had been all
those people, right there in concen
tration and then all over when the
idea spread, who were ready to
love, and agree, and find their com
mon humanity. It waslike "Yellow
Submarine." It was just that easy.
People had just gotten tired of all

that shit, so instead of saying
'No.' they said 'Yes.'"
"So then what happened?"
"Well, you must know the
story from there. The thing
spread, and we automated, and
made peace, and fed everybody,
and limited population, and
turned on . . .and then I woke
up."
"Yeah. But what a trip. And all
because of ptomaine poisoning in
the damn prison cafeteria."

"Yeah, but it could be worse.
I've only got six months more to
serve, and by then the war may be
over."
