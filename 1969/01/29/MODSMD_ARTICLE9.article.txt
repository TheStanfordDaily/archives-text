## Marxism Needed? 
### 
Editor, THE DAILY:
Yesterday someone of the staff
in the Athletic Department put
your copy of Wednesday, January
22 in my hands suggesting that I
read the Letter which Professor
Donald Kennedy wrote about the
conduct of the transgressors of
the Trustees Meeting of recent
date.

Regretable as this may be
many have expressed the hopes
that the Judicial body of recent
origin will handle this matter with
prompt action and no comments
from this writer.
However, I did read the Banner
Article about the Poly Sci Student
aims and would like to enter my
brief comments on this subject.
Some students seem to want a
course on "Marxism"—Perhaps if
a superficial examination of this
subject and personality would be
made the demands would be
dropped. The basis for my re
marks are that the substance of
the subject "Marxism" including a
biography of 'the man' and his in
fluences would be so soon ex
hausted that it could be said that
the course would be greatly disap
pointing and a regrettable waste
of time as compared to some
broader fields of interest.
To confirm my comments I
would suggest that investigation
be made of "Marxism" in the En
cyclopedia Brittanica which in my
opinion would quite satisfy this
writer.
Today "Marxism" is a mile
stone and maybe often his name is
mentioned but to think of an en
tire course given over to that
name would be a challenge to
most any well schooled professor
in keep it holding the interests of
his students—at least in my
opinion. I don't think Stanford
students are there to waste their
time.

• SDS Tactics
Editor, THE DAILY:
The "shortcomings in tactics"
of S.D.S. members become ever
more difficult to ignore. Should
one grant that the stated goals of
S.D.S. are laudable, the tactics
employed by some of its members
to achieve these goals nonetheless
strongly tempt one to question
their commitment to these goals.
After all, the stated goal of the
U.S. government in accounting for
its military presence in Viet Nam
is to provide for the self
determination of the peoples of
southeast Asia. As stated, this goal
is laudable.
The tactics employed to attain
this goal have persuaded many
people that the actual goals are
other than stated. Because the
leaders of the United States ap
pear to be committed to the tac
tics of violence in achieving an
avowedly peaceful goal, many dis
illusioned citizens speak of hypoc
risy, cynicism, and moral corrup
tion. Tactics can distort goals; tac
tics cannot be ignored.
How many of us will decide
that the tactics employed by
S.D.S. members are evidence that
the stated goals of S.D.S. are not
the actual goals? How many of us
will decide that the leaders of
S.D.S. are becoming morally and
ethically corrupt?

P.S. Is anyone on the Daily
staff going to address himself to
Dr. Kennedy's accusation?
