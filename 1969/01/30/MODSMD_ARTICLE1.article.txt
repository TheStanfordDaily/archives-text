# Conservatives Disrupt SDS Old Union Rally
## 
### MARSHALL KILDUFF 
A rally sponsored by Students
for a Democratic Society (SDS)
turned into a shouting match be
tween SDS members and a vocal
group led by members of the
moderate Young Republicans
(YR) and conservative Young
Americans for Freedom (YAF)
yesterday afternoon.
The right-wing militants con
tinued to hound the SDS students
for the rest of the afternoon,
blocking doorways at the Applied
Electronics Laboratory (AEL) as
SDS members tried to get in and
interrupting SDS strategy meet
ings outside of Stanford Research
Institute (SRI) offices in Palo
Alto.
In a dramatic show of conser
vative strength, 30 YR's and
YAF's arrived at the Old Union
courtyard shortly before 12:30

with signs reading "SDS is revolt
ing," "SDS Oink," and "Reject
SDS demands." Harvey Hukari,
president of YAF and editor of
Arena, led a cheer of "Pigs Off
Campus."
Nothing Being Done
William Boyd, president of the
YR's, stated that his group was
upset that "nothing is being done
by the administration. Pitzer
hasn't done a thing, and that is
why we are here."
The group shouted and jeered
as several SDS members presented
"guerilla theater" satirizing Presi
dent Pitzer to the crowd of over
500 students.
Prof. William Rambo, director
of AEL, then spoke about the
SDS demand that faculty mem
bers end all contracts with the
Defense Department. He defended
acceptance of research contracts
on two grounds: "The first is aca
demic propriety.
"The university asked for as
surances that this work was ac
ceptable to the community." He
said that the work had to be of
instructive value so that graduate
students could participate also.
The Moral Issue
Rambo went on to declare
"'Secondly, there is the question
of morality and values and prin
cipals. You students ought not to
delude yourselves that you are the
first to have thought about it."
The AEL director stated, "I
intend CD continue this association
with government to the extent
that it remains valuable, consis
tent with my personal values, and
to the extent my university res
ponsibilities permit."
Hukari spoke next and criti
cized SDS for "claiming to speak
for the majority of the students
when in fact they have been re

pudiated twice in campus elec
tions in the past two years."
SDS member Fred Cohen
countered, "Of course SDS
doesn't speak for the majority of
the Stanford students. Why
should the majority of Stanford
students decide for the Viet
namese people? The Vietnamese
people have a right to make their
own decisions."
Mill-In at AEL
Leonard Siegel of SDS then an
nounced that his group was going
to proceed to AEL and "mill-in to
bring business as usual to a halt."
The march to the laboratory
ended in a race as the right-wing
students tried to get there first
and block the doors.
At first, an AEL official,
Charles Shoens, had ordered the
first floor doors left open since he
believes it impossible to close
them before students arrived.
However, employees managed to
close all but a rear entrance which
was soon blocked by the right
wingers. Only some fifty SDSers
managed to get inside.
Schoens said later "We did not
want SDS to mill-in and disrupt
our activities." He said that
Rambo had told him to close the
building.
No Reprisals
No action was taken against
either group of demonstrators.
Dean of Students Joel Smith said
that in the opinion of the Faculty
Advisory Committee on Campus
Disturbances there was no viola
tion of university rules. "There
were some situations that were
pretty close but in my opinion
there were no violations," he de
clared.
Associate Dean of Students
Willard Wyman agreed, and added
"The committee considered both
groups close to violation." A vio
lation is generally said to occur
when university activities are dis
rupted.
Finding offices inside the AEL
building locked, SDS leaders de
cided to go to SRI offices in the
Stanford Industrial Park. About
forty people showed up, but again
the doors were locked by employ
ees.
There was a brief scuffle as an
employee tried to leave, and an
SDS member attempted to enter
the building. The students held a
meeting and decided to discuss
the SDS side of the issues in dor
mitories for the rest of the week.
