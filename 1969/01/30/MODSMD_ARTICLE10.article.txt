## Vocations For Social Change 
### BRUCE CAMPBELL 
So you have become aware of
the channeling process that passes
for career choice and want to ex
plore other alternatives. Where do
you begin?
George Brosi, founder of Vo
cations for Social Change and Wil
bur guest-in-residence last week,
suggests several avenues of action
which students interested in social
reconstruction can pursue while
still in college.
VSC
The first is, not surprisingly,
supporting the work of Vocations
for Social Change, a clearinghouse
for job openings which have a
direct relation to basic institu
tional change. VSC publishes a
monthly newsletter listing jobs in
the three areas the group feels will
be vital in the process of funda
mental social change: research, al
ternative institutions (schools,
media, cooperatives, intentional
communities), and direct action
(lobbying, boycots, peace and
draft work).
In addition to the newsletter,
VSC has compiled a relatively ex

tensive literature list, including
papers on job ideas for the inex
perienced person, examples of job
ideas and job precedents, job ideas
in research, job precedents in edu
cation, and a bibliography of rele
vant readings. The group also has
a speakers' bureau.
Brosi suggests supporting VSC
1) by contributions: the news
letter states that Vocations for
Social Change is "a tax-exempt,
non-profit organization subsisting
entirely on your donations."
Their address is 2010 B Street,
Hayward, Calif. 94541; 2) by
sharing and spreading the news
letter and the other literature on
campus (to dorms, library, place
ment service); and 3) by in
forming them of job openings and
other information which could
profitably spread by their organi
zation to others interested in this
area.
A second avenue of action is to
organize a network of social
change counselors. Work has al
ready begun at Stanford tracking
down persons who had had ex

perience in full-time work for
social change and who are willing
to talk with interested students
about it. The group includes
people who have worked in com
munity organizing, alternative
educational institutions, medical
and other types of cooperatives,
and media.
Preparing Leaflets
A third and related project is
the preparing of leaflets describing
how students can prepare them
selves for social change vocations
within the context of the uni
versity. The leaflets would detail
relevant course offerings, courses
which could be created (through
such mechanisms as the Under
graduate Specials), desirable
extra-curricular and summer ac
tivities, contacts with persons ex
perienced in that field, and a bibli
ography.
Fourth, stimulating 'social
change' discussion in disciplines
by formation of "radical
caucuses" in each department.
These groups discuss role options
for people in the discipline and
the utilization of academic
knowledge for democratic social
change. In addition, the caucuses
can serve as a locus for thorough
critiques of the department and
thus for curricular change.
Vocational Alternatives
groups can sponsor various kinds
of public events designed to make
students aware of vocational alter
natives. An example of this is a
series of panel discussions on vari
ous fields of work featuring
people from established organi
zations as well as from insurgent
groups.
In sum, George Brosi is en
couraging work along two comple
mentary lines: freeing your mind
to think of vocational alternatives
and organizing so that there will
be communication among those
wanting to work for social change.
A meeting is being held at 4:15
today in the Branner lounge for
those wishing to work on the pro
jects mentioned in this article and
on other activities furthering the
exploration of career alternatives.
