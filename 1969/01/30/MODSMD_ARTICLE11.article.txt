• Travesty Of Liberty Charged
Editor, THE DAILY:
I, a concerned student who is
not a member of SDS, hope that
the general student body is aware
of what happened at Wednesday's
SDS Rally. Screaming for an open
campus and waving swastikas, a
group of men following Harvey
"Hitler" Hukari attempted to
shout down and bodily overrun
the SDS speakers. At one point a
disgusting remark referring to one
of the speakers' racial background
and Nazi ovens was made by the
Neo-Nazis, who evidently thought
it was a good joke. It's hard for
me to believe that any students
here could be either so basely in
sensitive or so wantonly cruel.
These must be the same people
who will be trying to raise the
Stars and Stripes over South-East
Asia soon.
Later, at the prodding of
Hukari to "keep in order" and
"follow me", these supposed
counter-revolutionaries marched
to AEL where they solidly
blocked the entrance to all those
students who had been told by an
AEL worker that the doors were
open and they were welcome to
see anything they wanted. They
were actually invited in! A double
column of placard-carrying, self
styled Establishment guards
blocked the door, and by so doing
violated a University regulation
which has often been enforced in
the recent past against protest
action.
I think it will greatly distrub
Prof. Jack Friedenthal, chairman
of the Stanford Judicial Council,
to know that Dean Joel Smith
witnessed this violation. When
requested by the crowd to enforce
the regulations, he refused. Hukari
shouted at him about name-taking
and Smith replied, "I don't intend
to take any names or press charges
against YAF or any individuals
here." With that, he left and
Hukari's squad continued to block
the door.
In my opinion this was a
shameless administration of injus
tice, since anti-Establishment
groups have so often received the
hardened side of the personally
biased judgments which prevail on
this campus. I hope the rest of the
students are as incensed as I am
and will take action to prevent a
recurrence of this travesty of lib
erty.

• Bouquets For Denis Hayes
Editor, THE DAILY:
It was a real privilege and pleas
ure to hear Denis Hayes, President
of Associated Students, "Tell It
Like It Is!" to the Mothers' Club
of Stanford University. He was
most articulate, obviously well
informed, and keenly perceptive
of student activities not only at
Stanford but also across the na
tion and world-wide.
Mr. Hayes' deep concern for
settling student unrest seems un
paralleled in so commendably ex
ploring every conceivable channel
of communication with those "in
power."
Perhaps if we could really hear,
not just listen, we could better un
derstand the students' particular
needs for the specific kind of
higher education with which they
can cope with life today and,
hopefully, to improve the world.
These young students are our
World War II babies, born with
the atom bomb in their hands,
and if they are truly to be our
leaders of tomorrow, the age of
maturity is simply screaming,
"Give us our fair share of the re
sponsibility of total destruction or
peace."
There was no indication, dur
ing Mr. Hayes' detailed and pre
cise presentation, that any student
desires to "run" any institution of
higher education.
Respect begets respect so how
can any institution demand re
spect of students until and unless
they are first shown such respect?
Perhaps they, and they alone, best
know their individual and collec
tive needs for higher education.
Personally, I profess an undying
faith in the good judgement of
Stanford students. Freedom to
choose, they must have, or vio
lence, we can expect. As mature,
responsible human beings, why
should they be denied active in
volvement in all University
affairs?

• Travesty Of Liberty Charged
Editor, THE DAILY:
I, a concerned student who is
not a member of SDS, hope that
the general student body is aware
of what happened at Wednesday's
SDS Rally. Screaming for an open
campus and waving swastikas, a
group of men following Harvey
"Hitler" Hukari attempted to
shout down and bodily overrun
the SDS speakers. At one point a
disgusting remark referring to one
of the speakers' racial background
and Nazi ovens was made by the
Neo-Nazis, who evidently thought
it was a good joke. It's hard for
me to believe that any students
here could be either so basely in
sensitive or so wantonly cruel.
These must be the same people
who will be trying to raise the
Stars and Stripes over South-East
Asia soon.
Later, at the prodding of
Hukari to "keep in order" and
"follow me", these supposed
counter-revolutionaries marched
to AEL where they solidly
blocked the entrance to all those
students who had been told by an
AEL worker that the doors were
open and they were welcome to
see anything they wanted. They
were actually invited in! A double
column of placard-carrying, self
styled Establishment guards
blocked the door, and by so doing
violated a University regulation
which has often been enforced in
the recent past against protest
action.
I think it will greatly distrub
Prof. Jack Friedenthal, chairman
of the Stanford Judicial Council,
to know that Dean Joel Smith
witnessed this violation. When
requested by the crowd to enforce
the regulations, he refused. Hukari
shouted at him about name-taking
and Smith replied, "I don't intend
to take any names or press charges
against YAF or any individuals
here." With that, he left and
Hukari's squad continued to block
the door.
In my opinion this was a
shameless administration of injus
tice, since anti-Establishment
groups have so often received the
hardened side of the personally
biased judgments which prevail on
this campus. I hope the rest of the
students are as incensed as I am
and will take action to prevent a
recurrence of this travesty of lib
erty.

• Bouquets For Denis Hayes
Editor, THE DAILY:
It was a real privilege and pleas
ure to hear Denis Hayes, President
of Associated Students, "Tell It
Like It Is!" to the Mothers' Club
of Stanford University. He was
most articulate, obviously well
informed, and keenly perceptive
of student activities not only at
Stanford but also across the na
tion and world-wide.
Mr. Hayes' deep concern for
settling student unrest seems un
paralleled in so commendably ex
ploring every conceivable channel
of communication with those "in
power."
Perhaps if we could really hear,
not just listen, we could better un
derstand the students' particular
needs for the specific kind of
higher education with which they
can cope with life today and,
hopefully, to improve the world.
These young students are our
World War II babies, born with
the atom bomb in their hands,
and if they are truly to be our
leaders of tomorrow, the age of
maturity is simply screaming,
"Give us our fair share of the re
sponsibility of total destruction or
peace."
There was no indication, dur
ing Mr. Hayes' detailed and pre
cise presentation, that any student
desires to "run" any institution of
higher education.
Respect begets respect so how
can any institution demand re
spect of students until and unless
they are first shown such respect?
Perhaps they, and they alone, best
know their individual and collec
tive needs for higher education.
Personally, I profess an undying
faith in the good judgement of
Stanford students. Freedom to
choose, they must have, or vio
