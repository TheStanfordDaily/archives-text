# "Minsky's" Evokes Vaudeville Spirit
## 
### TODD McCARTHY 
A film like The Night They
Raided Minsky's is a joy to a critic
and a lucky film-goer; one goes to
it not expecting much but then, as
the film progresses, one feels a
sense of discovery and you thank
yourself for walking into this
movie instead of another.
Minsky's is a wonderful film.
After the release of most
American films of any merit, a
critical controversy begins and
people cram theatres to see the

picture, thus creating the impor
tant word of mouth advertising
(2001 is a prime example). Not
too many people have seen Mi
nsky's, however, and I doubt if
many will. Thus, it may be dis
missed and forgotten as a minor
attempt to re-create the heyday of
burlesque.
As it stands, however, Minsky's
manages to capture perfectly the
atmosphere of New York in 1925
and has a much better sense of
vaudeville and dance hall theatre
than do any other recent "back
stage" musicals, notably the ex
pensive Funny Girl and Star!
"Accidental" Discovery
Though Minsky's is held to
gether by a plotline which chron
icles the "accidental" discovery of
the striptease by a naive Amish
girl at Minsky's Burlesque house
(reportedly a true story and actu
ally rather funny in itself), the
principal wonder of the film is its
superb evocation of the period, as
director William Friedkin and the
rest of the crew re-capture an era
that had presumably been lost for
ever.
As the comedians, dancers and
singers go through their routines,
the watchful camera catches the
unshaven men who comprise the
audience roaring it up, and we can
somehow sense why some of them
are at Minsky's; to escape other
wise frustrating lives, to pass a
couple of hours, to pass the rest
of their lives, having nothing else
to live for. This, in combination
with the marvelous work done in
'20's delicatessens, hotels and
pawnshops and on location on old
New York streets, perfectly re
creates days past.
Superb Character Actors
In addition, the personal story
is well maintained by a superb col
lection of character actors, perfor
mers and types. Jason Robards
and Britain's Norman Wisdon, as a
vaudeville comedy team, work
very well together and become in
volved in a rivalry for the "new"
girl, well represented by Britt
Eklund.
Throughout the entire film,
faces which are recognizable but

generally not identifiable to movie
goers keep turning up, such as
those of Forrest Tucker, Harry
Andrews, Joseph Wiseman, Den
holm Elliot and the late Bert
Lahr.
Perhaps the one major element
which makes the film click is the
close attention paid to detail. The
grainy color is superb, for it both
heightens the emotions in the
picture and remains true to the
era involved. Furthermore, the
various cross-currents of American
thought and morality are clearly
evident, with the puritanical gov
ernment employees in direct op
position to the raucous, light
hearted show business personali
ties.
In all respects, Minsky's is
"right." It is bawdy without being
tasteless, nostalgic without being
sentimental and totally enjoyable
without seeming trivial. A very
rare film indeed.
