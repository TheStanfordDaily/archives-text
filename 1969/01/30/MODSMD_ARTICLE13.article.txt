## 
### 
Two Stanford freshmen living
in Branner Hall were arrested
Monday, January 27, after a Santa
Clara County deputy sheriff pur
sued their motorcycle into the
married student housing area.
Sebastian John Taylor, 16, dri
ver of the motorcycle, was
booked at the North County Jail
for failure to stop at a stop sign,
excessive speed, resisting arrest,
and reckless driving. William C.
Janss, 18, was charged with con
tributing to the delinquency of a
minor.
The two failed to stop at the
corner of Escondido and Campus
Drive, said Officer Salvidar of the
Sheriffs Department, then pulled
away when Salvidar started to
pursue. Taylor accelerated, hitting
55 in a 25 mph zone, then turned
into Comstock Circle.
According to the officer, Tay
lor ran a delivery truck off the
road and endangered the lives of a
bicyclist and a woman and her
two children with his reckless
driving.
Salvidar was about to give up
the chase because of the danger
involved to families in Escondido
Village when Taylor's cycle spun
out on wet grass, tossing its riders
to the ground.
Taylor, who was treated for an
elbow scrape, is the son of a Stan
ford Medical School professor;
Janss is the son of a Southern Cal
ifornia businessman.
