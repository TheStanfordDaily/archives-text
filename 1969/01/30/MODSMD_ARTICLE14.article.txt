# Detente Policy
## "Success Impossible" 
### LANG ATWOOD 
Calling the present East-West
conflict an "unresolved power
conflict" which precludes the suc
cess of a policy of detente, Dr.
Richard Lowenthal predicted that
any change in Soviet-American re
lations will come fron internal
changes within the Soviet Union
itself.
Lowenthal, Professor of Inter
national Relations at the Free
University of Berlin, spoke to an
overflow crowd Tuesday after
noon in the Tresidder small
lounge on "Soviet Foreign Policy
in the Light of Czechoslovakia."
The lecture and discussion was
moderated by Jon F. Triska, pro
fessor of political science at the
Institute of Political Studies.
Lowenthal outlined the
detente between the superpowers
which came out of the Cuban mis
sile crisis and the growing split be

tween Russia and Red China. The
Nuclear Test Ban Treaty is an ex
ample of the closer cooperation
exhibited in the early 60's, ac
cording to Lowenthal.
At the same time, however, he
stated, elements of conflict such as
the arms race and the crises in the
Middle East made it clear that
"while the offensive tactic failed,
the goals remained the same."
Soviet Rearmament
Lowenthal outlined three main
lines of Soviet policy. The first
was rearmament both conven
tional and nuclear. This is evident
in the Russian deployment of a
limited anti-ballistic missile sys
tem and an increase in their Medi
terranean naval fleet. A concentra
tion on the Middle East and other
areas closer to Russia instead of
far-flung world operations, con
tinued Lowenthal, was the second
major aspect of Soviet foreign
policy.
The last goal was to bring
about the dissolution of NATO. A
plan to set up mutual guarantees
to replace both NATO and the
Warsaw Pact was proposed but
not acted upon the by West, he
explained, because it would mean
a military withdrawal by the U.S.
while Russian troops would be
able to remain in the satellite
countries through bilateral trea
ties.
Lowenthal explained that the
reform-minded government in
Czechoslovakia threatened the
stability of the Warsaw Pact.
Russia felt that it could not let
the Czechs set an example for
other nations such as Rumania

which was considering establishing
diplomatic relations with West
Germany. "The danger was not
Czech defection, but infection,"
he said.
Fear Of NATO
The Soviets hesitated to take
direct military action because it
would destroy the detente and
strengthen NATO.
When the invasion finally took
place, the Russians did not have a
Quisling government ready be
cause they thought that conserva
tives within the Czech communist
party would step in and take over.
When this support did not come,
the Russians were forced "to
negotiate with the very men they
imprisoned."
Lowenthal concluded by say
ing that this return to post-Stalin
policy would not last forever. He
questioned, however, the possibil
ity of any meaningful change oc
curring except through the efforts
of the Russian people.

the Czechs set an example for
other nations such as Rumania

which was considering establishing
diplomatic relations with West
Germany. "The danger was not
Czech defection, but infection,"
he said.
Fear Of NATO
The Soviets hesitated to take
direct military action because it
would destroy the detente and
strengthen NATO.
When the invasion finally took
place, the Russians did not have a
Quisling government ready be
cause they thought that conserva
tives within the Czech communist
party would step in and take over.
When this support did not come,
the Russians were forced "to
negotiate with the very men they
imprisoned."
Lowenthal concluded by say
ing that this return to post-Stalin
policy would not last forever. He
questioned, however, the possibil
ity of any meaningful change oc
curring except through the efforts
of the Russian people.
Calling the present East-West
conflict an "unresolved power
conflict" which precludes the suc
cess of a policy of detente, Dr.
Richard Lowenthal predicted that
any change in Soviet-American re
lations will come fron internal
changes within the Soviet Union
itself.
Lowenthal, Professor of Inter
national Relations at the Free
University of Berlin, spoke to an
overflow crowd Tuesday after
noon in the Tresidder small
lounge on "Soviet Foreign Policy
in the Light of Czechoslovakia."
The lecture and discussion was
moderated by Jon F. Triska, pro
fessor of political science at the
Institute of Political Studies.
Lowenthal outlined the
detente between the superpowers
which came out of the Cuban mis
sile crisis and the growing split be

tween Russia and Red China. The
Nuclear Test Ban Treaty is an ex
ample of the closer cooperation
exhibited in the early 60's, ac
cording to Lowenthal.
At the same time, however, he
stated, elements of conflict such as
the arms race and the crises in the
Middle East made it clear that
"while the offensive tactic failed,
the goals remained the same."
Soviet Rearmament
Lowenthal outlined three main
lines of Soviet policy. The first
was rearmament both conven
tional and nuclear. This is evident
in the Russian deployment of a
limited anti-ballistic missile sys
tem and an increase in their Medi
terranean naval fleet. A concentra
tion on the Middle East and other
areas closer to Russia instead of
far-flung world operations, con
tinued Lowenthal, was the second
major aspect of Soviet foreign
policy.
The last goal was to bring
about the dissolution of NATO. A
plan to set up mutual guarantees
to replace both NATO and the
Warsaw Pact was proposed but
not acted upon the by West, he
explained, because it would mean
a military withdrawal by the U.S.
while Russian troops would be
able to remain in the satellite
countries through bilateral trea
ties.
Lowenthal explained that the
reform-minded government in
Czechoslovakia threatened the
stability of the Warsaw Pact.
Russia felt that it could not let
the Czechs set an example for
other nations such as Rumania

which was considering establishing
diplomatic relations with West
Germany. "The danger was not
Czech defection, but infection,"
he said.
