# Women Choose Inferior Role
## 
### 
American women have chosen
to follow the Freudian beliefs of
Margaret Sanger which ironically
have led them to an inferior role
rather than emancipation, a Stan
ford historian contends.
Rather than free themselves
from a chiefly sexual role, they
have relied on Sanger's "woman
power" theories instead of consid
ering themselves as human beings
first and women second, says

Prof. David Kennedy in a recent
report to the American Studies
Association.
Mrs. Sanger, the feminist who
preached sexual equality through
contraception and advocated
women's uniqueness as a sort of
currency in dealing with the dom
inant male world, has merely put
women back into the same Victor
ian "immutably different" roles
they once had.
