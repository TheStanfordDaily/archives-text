# New Cinema: 'Shazam!â€™
## 
### WALTER MARTIN 
Part II of New Cinema is com
ing to Cubberley (Fri. 7:30,
10:30; Sat. 7:30, 10:30; Sun.
2:30, 7:30) and if you missed the
first program, don't make the
same mistake again. This half stars
Godard, Beckett, and Hugh Hef
ner, plus two animated films by
the Polish mastermind, Borow
czyk, who did Renaissance, one of
the best films shown last week.
One of his new ones is a "serious
cartoon" about concentration
camps that conveys what it must
feel like to live in one better than
any film ever has, including
Resnais's Night and Fog. But we
may have been brainwashed by
Looney Tunes too long to com
prehend it.
Non-readers of Playboy (if
there are any) will be equally baf
fled by The Most. Hefner is cast in
the role of Gatsby, only greater.
As an Horatio Alger Story it's a
gem. As truth-cinema it's got a
long way to go: apart from a
couple of shots of soused execs
and the merest hint of a spat be
tween Hef and his special bunny,
the film is strictly surface and
glossy, heavily edited to preserve
the image, not to smash it.
Actua-Tilt by Jean Herman
cuts back and forth between the
world of the penny arcade and
nickelodeon to the great big five
& dime store work beyond: pull
the trigger on the toy gun and
BOOM! a real fighter pilot gets
shot down. It may be the most
violent 12 minutes ever put on
film. After a while the disasters of
war get so enmeshed with the bat
tlegrounds of pinball machines it's
hard to tell which is which. As
pure Pop Art it's even better than

The Most. It finally approaches
what the French have been admir
ing as the pinnacle of American
culture for years: the comic strip.
SHAZAM!
What Mallarme and Baudelaire
did for Poe, Godard has done for
our cartoons and comic books. In
All The Boys Are Called Patrick
an elderly gentlemen (the type of
Frenchman who wears the Legion
of Honor on his lapel) sits in a
cafe reading Mickey Mouse.
Another reads a newspaper whose
headline shouts: "The French Cin
ema is Dying Under its False Leg
ends." Meanwhile in the fore
ground, the cotton candy plot is
being flossed. (In his later films
Godard has moved the asides to
the audience up front and pushed
his plots back in the back if not
out of sight altogether).
Unlike many others in the
series, this is more than merely
"promising". It looks like a pre
view of coming attractions: Gary
Cooper, James Dean, Cary Grant
and Tony Perkins get honorable
mentions in passing. It stars Jean-
Claude Brialy. There is rapid-fire
cutting, flashy, but not yet out
rageously so. Plus the inevitable
girl-reading-a-book, the sunglasses,
the stripes on stripes, the ever
present gun (When Guns Are Out
lawed Only Godard's Actors Will

Have Guns). And if you didn't
know whose film it was and all
the many other clues were mis
sing, there would still be such
dead-giveaways as: "Girls always
drink Coca-Cola. It's so corny."
Nobody but Godard would give a
guy a line like that to say.
