# Koff Denies BSU Charge, Black Demands Questioned
## 
### MARGIE WOLF 
Black Student Union charges
that Robert Koff exhibited racist
behavior during an interview with
Clarissa Stevenson have drawn re
sponses from Koff and Mark
Schweninger, graduate education
student.
Koff's statement affirmed faith
in the Human Relations Council,
scheduled to examine the allega
tions against him tomorrow and
Saturday.
Accusations Denied
"I have complete confidence in
the outcome of the procedings.
The charges are false. I deny them
most vehemently," the Secondary
Teacher Education Program
(STEP) director said.
Schweninger challenged the

BSU with 11 questions submitted
to the group's co-chairman Nate
Kirtman Tuesday morning.
The set of queries are a compil
ation of the ideas of the many
people he interviewed. Although
he asked the BSU for an open
public discussion, Schweninger
admitted, "I expect no response."
Six queries probed BSU mem
bership and action policies—are
students admitted regardless of
color, are all blacks automatically
members, does the BSU seek out
side advice, does the BSU refer
grievances to the Human Rela
tions Council, what is the consen
sus on use of violence, has any
member spoken degradingly of
another race.
Five questions pertained di
rectly to the accusation of Koff—
is the demand for his resignation
non-negotiable, would a black ad
ministrator be better in his place,
will the BSU force a confronta
tion if the demand is not granted,
is arson threatened, should one
faction determine firing of a pro
fessor.
Kirtman had no comment re
garding either Koff's or Schwen
inger's communications. BSU
member Jim Johnson remarked
that Schweninger had no right to
question the internal affairs of the
organization.
Charges Termed 'Groundless'
The BSU demanded Koff's res
ignation in response to his inter
view with STEP applicant Miss
Stevenson, a black student at
Loretto Heights College in Den
ver.
After conferring with certain
BSU representatives and univer
sity officials, Koff sent an apology
to Miss Stevenson.

Unsatisfied, the BSU accused
Koff of racism and demanded his
resignation.
The matter was referred to the
Human Relations Council at the
request of President Kenneth
Pitzer.
Koff defended himself in yes
terday's statement:
"My adult life has been de
voted to an effort to improve edu
cational opportunities, particu
larly those of minorities and the
underprivileged.
"Indeed, I feel my own rights
have been violated and I will ask
the Human Relations Commission
to investigate the circumstances
behind such a groundless charge
being made against me."
