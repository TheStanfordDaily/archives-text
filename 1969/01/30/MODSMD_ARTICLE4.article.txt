# Economist Named ASSU Professor
## 
### 
This spring quarter Stanford
students will have their own Mrs.
Robinson. She is Joan Robinson,
a professor of economics at Cam
bridge University, England.
LASSU is sponsoring her financi
ally.
Her selection by ASSU is be
lieved to set a precedent among
major American universities.
ASSU has appropriated $5,000 in
student funds to bring her to
Stanford.
Mrs. Robinson is best known
for her book Economic Philos
ophy. She has also written an
early book on Imperfect Competi
tion, a theoretical work which
presaged many modern works on

monopolistic tendencies within
the economy. She was a close col
league of John Keynes in the
1920's and 1930'5.
Recently she has written several
articles about her visits to China
and Cuba.
Her first request was to allo
cate up to $500 of her funds from
LASSU for books in order that
students could become familiar
with her works.
While she is on campus, she
will not be affiliated with any aca
demic department at her request.
Regular faculty members have of
fered to sponsor undergraduate
special courses where she could
teach for credit.
