# Peace Negotiators To Meet
## 
### 
PARIS (AP)-The United
States is going into the second
full-scale session of Vietnam peace
talks Thursday refusing to accept
as final the other side's rejection
of its proposals on steps to scale
down the war.
A high diplomatic source said
the U.S. delegation views the
quick statements of rejection by
North Vietnam and the National
Liberation Front as part of a pro
cess which will develop into long
sparring for advantage.
The NLF—Hanoi delegations
said at the first session they would
explain and elaborate at this ses
sion why they rejected U.S. Am
bassador Henry Cabot Lodge's
proposals.
The proposal specifically re
jected was one which dealt with
the demilitarized zone buffer be
tween North and South Vietnam.
The United States and its South
Vietnamese ally want the zone re
established and guarantees that it
will be respected.
•Israel Denies Charge
Israel's army officially denied
Wednesday night Iraq's charge
that it was massing troops for an
attack on Iraqi military units sta
tioned in Jordan. A dispatch from
Tel Aviv said newsmen have
noticed no unusual troop move
ments.
The Israeli government seemed
to be heeding advice from abroad
to avoid retaliation for the public
hanging and display of 14 alleged
Israeli agents, including nine Jews,
in Baghdad and Basra.
The army's denial was belated.
It was issued by military authori
ties in Tel Aviv nearly 24 hours
after Iraqi Information Minister

Abdullah Salloum Samerrai as
serted at a Baghdad news confer
ence that Israelis were assembling
to attack the 20,000 Iraqi troops
based across the frontier in Jordan
since the Arab-Israeli war of 1967.
Similar Arab charges in the
past have drawn swift denials.
Though the executions have
been widely condemned, Prime
Minister Levi Eshkol of Israel has
angrily accused the world of
"turning a blind eye to the fate of
Jews in the Arab countries."
•Police At Berkeley
BERKELEY (AP) —The Univer
sity of California carried out a
threat Wednesday to bring in out
side police to maintain order dur
ing a student strike at Berkeley.
Forty highway patrolmen and
Sheriff's deputies cleared 200
strikers from the main campus
entrance.
There were no arrests or injur
ies.
Chancellor Roger W. Heyns
had branded similar blockage of
the main entrance Tuesday as
"callous disregard of the rights
and freedoms for students, faculty
and staff members."
He warned that off-campus
police would be summoned to
quell violence and enforce campus
regulations.
Except for the midday clearing
of the main entrance about 70
officers stood by watchfully at
the southeast corner of the cam
pus as the strike sponsored by the
Third World Liberation Front
moved into its second week.
•Heart Transplants
SAN DIEGO, Calif. (AP)-
America's leading heart transplant
surgeon says one byproduct of the

operation may be a cure for can
cer.
Dr. Denton A. Cooley of
Houston, Tex., told reporters at
the Society of Thoracic Surgeons
convention Tuesday he disagrees
with critics of heart transplants.
Cooley said heart transplants
have the potential to provide in
formation about cellul?.r biology
and genetics and their relationship
to treat an incurable disease.
Cooley, who has transplanted
17 human hearts, more than any
one else, said a proposed morator
ium on heart transplant opera
tions is repulsive.
"It shows a lack of information
in regard to the history of pro
gress," he added.
•Sirhan Trial
LOS ANGELES (AP) —Sirhan
Bishara Sirhan's defenders got a
go-ahead Wednesday to try to
throw out a grand jury murder in
dictment against him on grounds
the jury wasn't representative of
the community.
The court allowed the effort
despite a prosecution objection
that, as the defense concedes
Sirhan fired the shot that killed
Sen. Robert F. Kennedy last June,
any grand jury regardless of make
up would return a true bill of
murder.
•Unruh On Dissent
SACRAMENTO (AP)-
Assembly Democratic Leader
Jesse M. Unruh challenged his fel
low legislators Wednesday to look
beyond hard-line tactics in dealing
with student unrest and face the
underlying causes of dissent on
state college and university cam
puses.
Unruh said the campus crisis

today was "far, far worse" than
the crisis during the Free Speech
Movement at the University of
California's Berkeley campus in
1964 and 1965—and the legisla
ture has not adequately res
ponded.
"I think it is terribly crucial
that we do something at this ses
sion of the legislature," Unruh
said, speaking in support of a
$100,000 resolution to continue
the legislature's Joint Committee
for Higher Education for one
more year.
•Pueblo Hearing
CORONADO, Calif. (AP)-The
admiral who supervised the
Pueblo said Wednesday he had no
ships to help when North Koreans
attacked the intelligence vessel
and planes and ships in other com
mands were unavailable or too far
away.
The Pueblo's two ,50-caliber
machine guns, he added, "did not
appear to me to provide a signifi
cant defense capability."
Rear Adm. Frank L. Johnson,
commander of naval forces in
Japan when the Pueblo was seized
a year ago and its crew im
prisoned, testified at a court of in
quiry—first open session after
three days of secret testimony.
In earlier sessions the Pueblo's
skipper, Cmdr. Lloyd M. Bucher,
had said he asked for help after
North Korean gunboats opened
fire but got none; that he had
asked for bigger guns but got
none; and that facilities for de
stroying secret papers and gear
were inadequate.
