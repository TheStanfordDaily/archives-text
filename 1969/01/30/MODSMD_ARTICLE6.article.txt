# Right Wing Ready For A Comeback?

### MICHAEL KUHL 
"SDS does not speak for the
majority of the students on this
campus," Harvey H. Hukari, Jr.,
the long—haired chairman of
Young Americans for Freedom
(YAF), shouted yesterday.
The guru of conservatives on
campus has made this his battle
cry in three years at Stanford. But
yesterday, for the first time, he
heard the enthusiastic response of
that "majority."
There was an unusually large
crowd on hand for yesterday's
demonstration. They were not

Commentary

drawn by the scheduled program,
but rather to enjoy the absurdity
of a student confrontation.
Since the Old Union sit-in of
last spring, moderates, conserva
tives, and radicals have all tried to
gain the support of the student
body.
Attention Grabber
SDS seems to have succeeded
in capturing the student body's at
tention where the exciting possi
bilities of educational reform
contained in SES never could.
In this sense, even apathy is
dead. Right now students are
pissed off, but at each other.
A new polarization exists on
campus. Each side points the

other way when asked to single
out the dangerous element on this
campus.
There is a certain sickness that
breeds the wild rumors that some
where between fraternity row and
the ROTC department there is a
militant, rightist vigilante group
arming itself for the coming bat
tle.
Nonviolence the Watchword
"Nonviolence" so far has been
the watchword of groups moving
in reaction to SDS. But in execut
ing the hastily drawn plans yester
day, emotions might well have
taken charge.
For a few brief, shaky mom
ents the possibility of violence
was less than a first fight away.
Luckily, a flying fist, like many of
the verbal barbs thrown during
the afternoon, missed its mark.
For Stanford's latest "mass
movement" of students it tre
mendously boosted their hopes
for popular support.
For the majority of students
who dislike placing their bodies
on either side of the line, it was
heartening to see the other side
put on their show.
"It is a general campus reac
tion," insists Bill Boyd, chairman
of the Young Republicans. "The
people that turned out come from
all over campus; they are conser
vatives, moderates, and liberals."
