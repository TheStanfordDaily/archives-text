# Legislature OK's Proposal For Joint SES Discussion
## 
### RANDAL SAMSTAG 
In a special meeting last night
the Student Legislature (LASSU)
unanimously accepted faculty
proposals for joint consideration
of the recommendations of the
Study of Education at Stanford
(SES) calling the move a "further
step toward community govern
ment at Stanford."
In addition, LASSU agreed
that the members of the student
group (The Education Council)
will be chosen in a campus-wide
election utilizing the Hare system
of proportional representation on
Feb. 18-19.
The text of the LASSU resolu
tion reads as follows:
"We accept the Academic Sen
ate resolution of January 23,
1969 as a basis for proceedings on
the consideration of the SES pro
posals. We shall create a represen
tative student group (the ASSU
Education Council). We call on

the Senate to work toward the
establishment of a joint body for
the consideration, debate, and
voting, on educational reform at
Stanford. We consider this joint
body as a further step toward
community government at Stan
ford."
Separate Voting
While the SES proposals will be
considered jointly, the Academic
Senate and the student group will
vote separately. Disagreement
would hopefully be mediated by a
committee composed of four
members from each body and
chaired by a ninth person chosen
by the committee itself.
The question of a lack of con
sensus in this committee was de
bated among the members and
questions were directed to faculty
members present; Prof. Leonard
Schiff, chairman of the Academic
Senate, and Profs. Philip Dawson,
history, and Leslie Zatz, radi

ology, faculty representatives on
the Senate.
Schiff was distressed at the sug
gestion of the inevitability of dis
agreement and said he felt that
such disagreement would be un
likely.
When asked if he thought that
the Senate might reverse its rec
ommendation on a specific point
of conflict with the student group
and/or the third committee he
noted "I think it is possible."
Agreement Not Fiat
Schiff reasserted his feeling
that the "real issues will be settled
not by fiat but by agreement." If
they are regarded as improper by
any relevant consistuency they
probably won't succeed."
Zatz pointed out that any
action of the Senate may be ap
pealed to the entire Academic
Council by 50 professors.
He said he felt the Senate had
moved toward joint deliberation
with a student group on "the Cri
teria of fairness," so both could
be equally well informed.
Schiff said appeals from the
Senate to the Council were "quite
unlikely" except on "exceedingly
volatile issues." He said he ex
pected no tablings on SES recom
mendations that the Senate would
recommend for or against accept
ance of all cases.
Some members of LASSU
wanted to make it clear that they
were not completely satisfied with
the Academic Senate's proposal.
The Senate rejected the Coali
tion's proposal for joint voting
early this month. Still, the major
ity of LASSU was in agreement
that the separate voting bodies
should be approved and the resol
ution proposed by Paul Witt was
subsequently adopted unani
mously.
Expressing his personal judge
ment, Schiff said there was "very
little doubt about the prevailing
opinion" within the Senate and
the Academic Council that joint
voting with students was "not
consistent with the spirit of the
Academic council's charter."

LASSU—Professor Leonard I. Schiff, chairman of the Academic Senate, addresses
last night's LASSU meeting.
In a special meeting last night
the Student Legislature (LASSU)
unanimously accepted faculty
proposals for joint consideration
of the recommendations of the
Study of Education at Stanford
(SES) calling the move a "further
step toward community govern
ment at Stanford."
In addition, LASSU agreed
that the members of the student
group (The Education Council)
will be chosen in a campus-wide
election utilizing the Hare system
of proportional representation on
Feb. 18-19.
The text of the LASSU resolu
tion reads as follows:
"We accept the Academic Sen
ate resolution of January 23,
1969 as a basis for proceedings on
the consideration of the SES pro
posals. We shall create a represen
tative student group (the ASSU
Education Council). We call on

the Senate to work toward the
establishment of a joint body for
the consideration, debate, and
voting, on educational reform at
Stanford. We consider this joint
body as a further step toward
community government at Stan
ford."
Separate Voting
While the SES proposals will be
considered jointly, the Academic
Senate and the student group will
vote separately. Disagreement
would hopefully be mediated by a
committee composed of four
members from each body and
chaired by a ninth person chosen
by the committee itself.
The question of a lack of con
sensus in this committee was de
bated among the members and
questions were directed to faculty
members present; Prof. Leonard
Schiff, chairman of the Academic
Senate, and Profs. Philip Dawson,
history, and Leslie Zatz, radi

ology, faculty representatives on
the Senate.
Schiff was distressed at the sug
gestion of the inevitability of dis
agreement and said he felt that
such disagreement would be un
likely.
When asked if he thought that
the Senate might reverse its rec
ommendation on a specific point
of conflict with the student group
and/or the third committee he
noted "I think it is possible."
Agreement Not Fiat
Schiff reasserted his feeling
that the "real issues will be settled
not by fiat but by agreement." If
they are regarded as improper by
any relevant consistuency they
probably won't succeed."
Zatz pointed out that any
action of the Senate may be ap
pealed to the entire Academic
Council by 50 professors.
He said he felt the Senate had
moved toward joint deliberation
with a student group on "the Cri
teria of fairness," so both could
be equally well informed.
Schiff said appeals from the
Senate to the Council were "quite
unlikely" except on "exceedingly
volatile issues." He said he ex
pected no tablings on SES recom
mendations that the Senate would
recommend for or against accept
ance of all cases.
Some members of LASSU
wanted to make it clear that they
were not completely satisfied with
the Academic Senate's proposal.
The Senate rejected the Coali
tion's proposal for joint voting
early this month. Still, the major
ity of LASSU was in agreement
that the separate voting bodies
should be approved and the resol
ution proposed by Paul Witt was
subsequently adopted unani
mously.
Expressing his personal judge
ment, Schiff said there was "very
little doubt about the prevailing
opinion" within the Senate and
the Academic Council that joint
voting with students was "not
consistent with the spirit of the
Academic council's charter."
