"Wee shall be as a Citty upon a Hill, The Eies of all people
are uppon us . . ." So echoing John Winthrop, the first gov
ernor of Massachusetts, Time magazine begins its ambitious
20-page report on fixing America.
The quotation was well chosen. Since the days of the
Plymouth Colony, Americans have been intensely conscious
of their relationship with the rest of the world. It is the
failure of that relationship that is most likely to destroy us.
The concept of a "Citty upon a Mill" cuts several ways.
Winthrop and his handful of religious refugees hoped that, by
doing God's will, they would create a compelling example for
other peoples. Today we are still trying to recreat the world
in our image, but the compulsion of example has become the
compulsion of force.
Our motives have changed as well. There is still much of
Winthrop's Puritan zeal in our national character, but today
we have as much economic and moral interest in influencing
our neighbors. We would like Latin Americans, for example,
to be as energetic and materially oriented as we are. But, in
their case, we define energy as eagerness to pump oil and
sugar into our economy.
In fact our Citty is very much in the consciousness of the
"underdeveloped" world. Newspapers in countries like

Uganda and Uruguay divide their space about evenly between
coverage of their affairs and stories about us. This does not
surprise most American tourists. But as they snap color slides
of quaint natives and third-world grandeur, our emissaries do
not reflect on the fact that the reverse is not true. Where is
Uganda, anyway. Near Nepal?
So we beam a gleaming image of our fantasyland into
what is, for us, darkness. What is that the Vietnamese are
trying to tell us? Is it possible that they have their own
culture and their own image of a desirable future? Could it be
that they simply do not want to be Americanized?
No, America tells itself. They must be out to destroy our
identity. After all, if we aren't God's chosen people, it might
be the Chinese.
Ignoring ignorance, Time dwells on power. "The world's
richest, strongest nation has never deserved its superlatives
more," they cheer. "Yet rarely has it felt so wracked and
confused, so unable to yoke its power to its problems." And
the corporate journalists quote Arthur Krock's "visceral feat
that 'the tenure of the United States as the first power in the
world may be one of the briefest in history!"
But, for all its ability to purchase information and bright,
young writers, Time fails to ask the central question: How

much power should America have? Should we, tor example,
have the power to establish political systems for people
whose cultural heritage is not our own?
Could it be fitting that the United States should cease to
be "the first power in the world?" Are we not strong and
confident enough to renounce the use of military and
economic power to impose our will on others?
As part of this inquiry, it is important to recognize that
the kind of power we possess is the power of madness, Our
intellectual tradition has separated the concepts of mind and
body. The result is seen in the frustration and sickness of
"successful" Americans. Our economic tradition has divorced
man from his environment. The result is our ability to rape
nature for short-term material advantage.
If we would listen to them, the Buddists of Vietnam might
tell us about a different kind of power: the power of
harmony. But it is difficult to get that kind of message across
while your pagoda is being blown up.
Time talks of "healing" America in terms of rechanneling
power rather than reconsidering its use, in terms of
developing "vigorous young leadership" rather than
examining the popular mentality and assumptions that lie
behing our discontent. (The model leader, incidentally, is
James Kllis, 47, a dynamic corporate lawyer from Seattle
who is helping build things like storm sewers and a stadium
for his city.)
The formerly staid voice of Henry Luce has become so
daring as to devote an entire page to a proposal for changing
the U.S. Constitution. Rexford Guy Tugwell and his fellows
at the Center for the Study of Democratic Institutions in
Santa Barbara want to "let law catch up with life."
We would rather they had given that space to the Beatles.
These foreign social critics were thinking of a different kind
of revolution, but their message is relevant to the problem of
healing nations:
"You say you'll change the constitution
Well you know
We all want to change your head
You tell me its the institution
Well you know
You better free your mind instead . . ."

their case, we define energy as eagerness to pump oil and
sugar into our economy.
In fact our Citty is very much in the consciousness of the
"underdeveloped" world. Newspapers in countries like

Uganda and Uruguay divide their space about evenly between
coverage of their affairs and stories about us. This does not
surprise most American tourists. But as they snap color slides
of quaint natives and third-world grandeur, our emissaries do
not reflect on the fact that the reverse is not true. Where is
Uganda, anyway. Near Nepal?
So we beam a gleaming image of our fantasyland into
what is, for us, darkness. What is that the Vietnamese are
trying to tell us? Is it possible that they have their own
culture and their own image of a desirable future? Could it be
that they simply do not want to be Americanized?
No, America tells itself. They must be out to destroy our
identity. After all, if we aren't God's chosen people, it might
be the Chinese.
Ignoring ignorance, Time dwells on power. "The world's
richest, strongest nation has never deserved its superlatives
more," they cheer. "Yet rarely has it felt so wracked and
confused, so unable to yoke its power to its problems." And
the corporate journalists quote Arthur Krock's "visceral feat
that 'the tenure of the United States as the first power in the
world may be one of the briefest in history!"
But, for all its ability to purchase information and bright,
young writers, Time fails to ask the central question: How

much power should America have? Should we, tor example,
have the power to establish political systems for people
whose cultural heritage is not our own?
Could it be fitting that the United States should cease to
be "the first power in the world?" Are we not strong and
confident enough to renounce the use of military and
economic power to impose our will on others?
As part of this inquiry, it is important to recognize that
the kind of power we possess is the power of madness, Our
intellectual tradition has separated the concepts of mind and
body. The result is seen in the frustration and sickness of
"successful" Americans. Our economic tradition has divorced
man from his environment. The result is our ability to rape
nature for short-term material advantage.
If we would listen to them, the Buddists of Vietnam might
tell us about a different kind of power: the power of
harmony. But it is difficult to get that kind of message across
while your pagoda is being blown up.
Time talks of "healing" America in terms of rechanneling
power rather than reconsidering its use, in terms of
developing "vigorous young leadership" rather than
examining the popular mentality and assumptions that lie
behing our discontent. (The model leader, incidentally, is
James Kllis, 47, a dynamic corporate lawyer from Seattle
who is helping build things like storm sewers and a stadium
for his city.)
The formerly staid voice of Henry Luce has become so
daring as to devote an entire page to a proposal for changing
the U.S. Constitution. Rexford Guy Tugwell and his fellows
at the Center for the Study of Democratic Institutions in
Santa Barbara want to "let law catch up with life."
We would rather they had given that space to the Beatles.
These foreign social critics were thinking of a different kind
of revolution, but their message is relevant to the problem of
healing nations:
"You say you'll change the constitution
Well you know
We all want to change your head
You tell me its the institution
Well you know
You better free your mind instead . . ."
"Wee shall be as a Citty upon a Hill, The Eies of all people
are uppon us . . ." So echoing John Winthrop, the first gov
ernor of Massachusetts, Time magazine begins its ambitious
20-page report on fixing America.
The quotation was well chosen. Since the days of the
Plymouth Colony, Americans have been intensely conscious
of their relationship with the rest of the world. It is the
failure of that relationship that is most likely to destroy us.
The concept of a "Citty upon a Mill" cuts several ways.
Winthrop and his handful of religious refugees hoped that, by
doing God's will, they would create a compelling example for
other peoples. Today we are still trying to recreat the world
in our image, but the compulsion of example has become the
compulsion of force.
Our motives have changed as well. There is still much of
Winthrop's Puritan zeal in our national character, but today
we have as much economic and moral interest in influencing
our neighbors. We would like Latin Americans, for example,
to be as energetic and materially oriented as we are. But, in
their case, we define energy as eagerness to pump oil and
sugar into our economy.
