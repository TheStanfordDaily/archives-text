A Groovy Place to Meet and Eat
"Belly up" to the serve-yourself
salad bar, relax with your favorite
spirits and listen to the free juke box
music you select, or bite into a juicy V2
pound "BELTBUSTER" burger with
golden french fries. Beef'n Barrel is a
good place to let loose, enjoy some
great food, and just have a "heck of a
good time." Check it out! We guarantee
your first visit won't be your last.
