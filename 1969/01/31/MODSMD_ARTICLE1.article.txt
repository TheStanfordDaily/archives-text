# Judicial Guideline May Have Flaws
## News Analysis 
### SUSAN SWARD 
The judicial body reviewing the
recent student-Trustee confron
tation has published procedural
rules which may embody major
constitutional inaccuracies.
The problematic section of the
Stanford Judicial Council (SJC)
rules concerns the matter of de
fendant and witness rights. The
legialative and judicial charter of
1968, the constitution which
established the SJC, provides
stringent sanctions against defen
dants who refuse to cooperate
with SJC deliberations.
The SJC procedural guidelines,
however, supply the same sanc
tions to punish any student, not
just defendants, who fail to co
operate with the SJC. Witnesses
and other non-defendants in the
SJC system are thus placed in the
same category as defendants in
terms of judicial rights.
The SJC rules therefore con
flict with the overall legislative
and judicial charter. Furthermore,
taken in a literal sense, the SJC
has promulgated a rule of student

conduct by stating in its rules, "A
student does not have the right to
refuse to cooperate with either
the SJC or with any judicial aide
chosen by the Council . . .-
Sanctions for refusal of coopera
tion may include placing a hold
on registration or graduation."
According to the charter, the
SJC has no right to establish a rule
of student conduct. Only the Stu
dent Conduct Legislative Council
(SCLC) may establish student
conduct guidelines.
Professor Gene Franklin, a
member of the SJC, stated last
night that the SJC "sought to
clarify, and, in this case, I suppose
modify the charter because it was
too ambiguous. We did not think
the specific charter wording on
cooperation was exactly what the
Committee of Fifteen had in
mind." The Committee of 15
wrote the charter last spring.
SJC Chairman Jack Friedenthal
was out of town and unavailable
for comment yesterday.
Denis Hayes, ASSIJ president,
commented last night that, "The
rules adopted by the Judicial
Council closely parallel the rules
prevailing within all systems with

which I'm familiar. The rule in
question could certainly work to
the benefit of an innocent defen
dant. .
Hayes further noted, "However
there seems to me to be a serious
question as to whether the SJC
has the authority to modify this
section of its own Charter. The
promulgating of this kind of regu
lation is more legitimately the
purview of the Student Conduct
Legislative Council.
"In any case I intend to pursue
the matter before the SJC, the
SCLC, and the C-15, and hope
that no one will be charged with a
violation before the validity of the
rule itself is established."

rules concerns the matter of de
fendant and witness rights. The
legialative and judicial charter of
1968, the constitution which
established the SJC, provides
stringent sanctions against defen
dants who refuse to cooperate
with SJC deliberations.
The SJC procedural guidelines,
however, supply the same sanc
tions to punish any student, not
just defendants, who fail to co
operate with the SJC. Witnesses
and other non-defendants in the
SJC system are thus placed in the
same category as defendants in
terms of judicial rights.
The SJC rules therefore con
flict with the overall legislative
and judicial charter. Furthermore,
taken in a literal sense, the SJC
has promulgated a rule of student

conduct by stating in its rules, "A
student does not have the right to
refuse to cooperate with either
the SJC or with any judicial aide
chosen by the Council . . .-
Sanctions for refusal of coopera
tion may include placing a hold
on registration or graduation."
According to the charter, the
SJC has no right to establish a rule
of student conduct. Only the Stu
dent Conduct Legislative Council
(SCLC) may establish student
conduct guidelines.
Professor Gene Franklin, a
member of the SJC, stated last
night that the SJC "sought to
clarify, and, in this case, I suppose
modify the charter because it was
too ambiguous. We did not think
the specific charter wording on
cooperation was exactly what the
Committee of Fifteen had in
mind." The Committee of 15
wrote the charter last spring.
SJC Chairman Jack Friedenthal
was out of town and unavailable
for comment yesterday.
Denis Hayes, ASSIJ president,
commented last night that, "The
rules adopted by the Judicial
Council closely parallel the rules
prevailing within all systems with

which I'm familiar. The rule in
question could certainly work to
the benefit of an innocent defen
dant. .
Hayes further noted, "However
there seems to me to be a serious
question as to whether the SJC
has the authority to modify this
section of its own Charter. The
promulgating of this kind of regu
lation is more legitimately the
purview of the Student Conduct
Legislative Council.
"In any case I intend to pursue
the matter before the SJC, the
SCLC, and the C-15, and hope
that no one will be charged with a
violation before the validity of the
rule itself is established."
