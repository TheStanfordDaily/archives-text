## A Lunch At 12:30 p.m.
### JOEL STRATTE 
The Put-On Ball began. Hordes
gathered in communion, looking
like defeated debutantes after
tripping at their long-awaited
coming-out-to-impress-you gala,
baby you've had fun long enough,
now the serious shit begins. Wide
awake Castorites heeding the ad
vice of an older and more success
ful revolutionary, the American
Dream does not come to those
who fall asleep, cigarette smoke
halos drifted above their heads,
viva la revolution.
A guerilla theater of gorillas,
hang overs from hippiedom
dressed like the legions of Sgt.
Pepper, paraded through the
union announcing the coming
event. How's the revolution?
Hubba hubba. And fraternity
men, with their mother-pressed
brooks brothers shirts, their hang
a-long chick from the sorority
next door, managed to tippy-toe

over to the Old Union for one
bull-bitch tomwallager of a pro
test, while wrinkle-shirted SDS
had been waiting there since
dawn, a victory dance and fertility
rites.
The appointed time. Wait and
see. Trustees and friends of the
foes could be seen with hunting
rifles on the roof edge above, San
Franciscan reporters hoping to ob
tain a few mediocre misquotes for
their mediocre mispapers, anti
anti factions dotted the air with
their anti-anti-faction placards.
Nixon-trites and Buckliests taking
a stand, making the world safe for
necromancy, we can stand for this
no longer. So here it is, two
groups trying to outnigger each
other with their more polished
rabble-rousing power-to-the
people mumbo jumbo. Take your
pick and dive into one crowd or
another.
I had missed lunch to attend
this dance of the youthful
dotards, a notable sacrifice, a rev
olution is not a lunciieon, and eag
erly anticipated a barroom brawl
if not a bloody good cockfight.
Take to the hills, brothers, coffee.
Two, four, six, nine, let's go out

and zonk their minds. But, alas,
nothing more than sorrowful
bulcitating.
Tales of a reactionary and revo
lutionary babbling. Siegel, I
double dare you to hang up a
Vietcong flag today. Dares go first
buddy. Cross this line and we'll
see. First one takes last one's
place. No fists. SDS is revoluting.
The trumpet sounded again. A
representative announced the rea
sons for the occurrence. Why did
Pitzer fail to walk on water? We
all knew and were convinced that
his excuses were not valid, a poor
portrayal of Hitler. But the clar
ion from afar, we love Pitzer. And
the response from above, work,
study, get ahead and kill, we'd
rather be red than dead, we want
the world and we want it now.
Sounds of oink emitted from both
sides of the sty, neither revealing
more expertise than the other, no
body's gonna write a book about
what transpired. A sense of com
munistent was displayed by both
groups.
I toyed with the thought of be
ing me for a few minutes but
fared better before the many cam
eras. The last thing heard was a

barbled soliloquy on the morality
of a bullhorn, judge not lest not.
The noonday tryst was a farce at
bestâ€”entombed by the falling lid
of a toilet bowl. Old Union
wouldn't be a bad place to eat
lunch if the ground weren't wet.
