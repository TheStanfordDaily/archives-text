## Koff Defended 
### DAVID A. MINNA 
The action of the Black Stu
dent Union against Dr. Robert
Koff is based on an unfounded
and unsubstantial conclusion. To
say that socio-economic inquiry is
definitive of racial prejudice is an
ungrounded hypothesis when one
has incomplete knowledge of the
nature of the inquirer or the pur
pose of the inquiry. Such is the
case of the BSU as presented in
The Stanford Daily, January 24,
1969. This is not to say that an
investigation of the facts around
the interview of Clarissa Stevenson
is unwarranted, but that an exag
gerated and premature accusation
has been made.
That Dr. Koff is provocative is
evident from the facts presented.
Having taken a course from him I
know that his nature in general is
one that provokes people to
action in many forms. His style of
teaching is aimed directly at the
individual. To confront a problem
and not to "cop out" is his ex
pressed goal. As observed in class
this style irritated some individ
uals, but initiated student res
ponse in a forceful way, and rep
resents a highly stimulating form
of education.
BSU Statement
What is suggested in the BSU
statement is that these provoca
tive inquiries were made for the
purpose of humiliating a black
woman. Speaking only as a stu
dent having had a course from Dr.
Koff, I can not act as a character
witness for Dr. Koff; from the
opening lecture of his course,
however, it appeared to me that
he was acutely aware, interested,
and concerned with the problems
racism in America has caused. In
the early sessions a presentation
was made of a tape-recorded inter
view with an adult Negro male
from East Palo Alto. The tape
dealt with the heart breaks and
frustrations this man had experi
enced, and ended with an emotion
charged plea that something be

done. What followed in class was
the statement by Dr. Koff that
this man's problems were ours as
well as his. Though leveled at
America's racial situation specif
ically, this point was developed in
the course to show that the prob
lems were not limited to black
people, but to all who have prob
lems due to the lack of under
standing, justice, and the patience
on the part of others. In view of
this the categorical accusation of
"racist" attitudes is difficult to
accept.
Interviewing
Clearly Dr. Koff's techniques
of interviewing lack discretion and
proper respect by most standards,
and these are rightly called into
question. An interview is often an
intensely pressurized situation,
however, there are frequent at
tempts to find areas of extreme
sensitivity in applicants in fields
that may lead to real difficulties
later. Probing must be refined and
sensitive, and because of this the
interviewer has the responsibility
to contain and control its con
tents within the limits of the in
terviews purpose. The real ques
tion is: Were these bounds over
stepped? Dr. Koff is certainly
accountable for them, and per
haps he should not be the inter
viewer for STEP, as suggested in
Audrey Wong's letter of Jan. 27.
Since the STEP goals include ex
plicity the recruiting of minority
students, perhaps there should be
a minority group member on the
interviewing staff.
To demand Koff's uncondi
tional resignation does not logic
ally follow from the facts pre
sented, and would constitute a
tremendous loss to the study of
education and to the Stanford
Community at large. To give cred
ence to the accusations made is to
allow the high pressure techniques
employed by the BSU to have
their intended effect, to bring a
premature judgement against Dr.
Koff.

Interviewing
Clearly Dr. Koff's techniques
of interviewing lack discretion and
proper respect by most standards,
and these are rightly called into
question. An interview is often an
intensely pressurized situation,
however, there are frequent at
tempts to find areas of extreme
sensitivity in applicants in fields
that may lead to real difficulties
later. Probing must be refined and
sensitive, and because of this the
interviewer has the responsibility
to contain and control its con
tents within the limits of the in
terviews purpose. The real ques
tion is: Were these bounds over
stepped? Dr. Koff is certainly
accountable for them, and per
haps he should not be the inter
viewer for STEP, as suggested in
Audrey Wong's letter of Jan. 27.
Since the STEP goals include ex
plicity the recruiting of minority
students, perhaps there should be
a minority group member on the
interviewing staff.
To demand Koff's uncondi
tional resignation does not logic
ally follow from the facts pre
sented, and would constitute a
tremendous loss to the study of
education and to the Stanford
Community at large. To give cred
ence to the accusations made is to
allow the high pressure techniques
employed by the BSU to have
their intended effect, to bring a
premature judgement against Dr.
Koff.
The action of the Black Stu
dent Union against Dr. Robert
Koff is based on an unfounded
and unsubstantial conclusion. To
say that socio-economic inquiry is
definitive of racial prejudice is an
ungrounded hypothesis when one
has incomplete knowledge of the
nature of the inquirer or the pur
pose of the inquiry. Such is the
case of the BSU as presented in
The Stanford Daily, January 24,
1969. This is not to say that an
investigation of the facts around
the interview of Clarissa Stevenson
is unwarranted, but that an exag
gerated and premature accusation
has been made.
That Dr. Koff is provocative is
evident from the facts presented.
Having taken a course from him I
know that his nature in general is
one that provokes people to
action in many forms. His style of
teaching is aimed directly at the
individual. To confront a problem
and not to "cop out" is his ex
pressed goal. As observed in class
this style irritated some individ
uals, but initiated student res
ponse in a forceful way, and rep
resents a highly stimulating form
of education.
BSU Statement
What is suggested in the BSU
statement is that these provoca
tive inquiries were made for the
purpose of humiliating a black
woman. Speaking only as a stu
dent having had a course from Dr.
Koff, I can not act as a character
witness for Dr. Koff; from the
opening lecture of his course,
however, it appeared to me that
he was acutely aware, interested,
and concerned with the problems
racism in America has caused. In
the early sessions a presentation
was made of a tape-recorded inter
view with an adult Negro male
from East Palo Alto. The tape
dealt with the heart breaks and
frustrations this man had experi
enced, and ended with an emotion
charged plea that something be

done. What followed in class was
the statement by Dr. Koff that
this man's problems were ours as
well as his. Though leveled at
America's racial situation specif
ically, this point was developed in
the course to show that the prob
lems were not limited to black
people, but to all who have prob
lems due to the lack of under
standing, justice, and the patience
on the part of others. In view of
this the categorical accusation of
"racist" attitudes is difficult to
accept.
