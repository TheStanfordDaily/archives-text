• Republicans Attack Letter
Editor, THE DAILY:
In response to Marshall Hop
per's letter of yesterday, we
would like to clarify a few mis
conceptions and items of misin
formation.

It is not our purpose to extend
the debate over Wednesday's
activities or to participate in re
writing the occurrence to the
satisfaction of any one special
action group.
As Mr. Hopper suggests, Stan
ford students are indeed "in
censed." It is precisely for this
reason that the Young Republi
cans (YR's) and the Young Ameri
cans for Freedom (YAF) organ
ized Wednesday's show of force.
It is disconcerting for us to see
such action tagged as use of force.
First, the counter-demon
stration, as organized by the YR's
and YAF was intended to be
peaceful and nonviolent. And de
spite the heat generated in the
confrontation it remained that
way during the entire afternoon.
In order to insure that vio
lence, such as marred the last
Trustee's meeting, .would not
again be ignored by the campus
community, there were three
photographers on hand to record
any potential trouble.
The fact that the YR's and
YAF had a lawyer on hand to
brief the initial 15 participants be
forehand of their rights and to
specifically counsel against any
willful disruption of the rally
should underscore the good inten
tions of the "counter
revolutionaries."
Second, as The Daily's news
story correctly pointed out, Prof.
William Rambo, director of the
A pplied Electronics Laboratory
(A EL), ordered employees to
keep students out of the building.
Since the building was essen
tially closed, evidence as to how
"self-styled Establishment guards
blocked the door" is lacking.
In fact, on two occasions, the
group in front of the main door
opened ranks to allow SDS mem
bers to walk to the door. Only
two students availed themselves of
the opportunity.
Third, while the group yelled
and chanted against SDS, in no in
stance was an attempt made to
"shout down and bodily overrun
the SDS speakers."
In the interest of providing
more functional sound equip
ment, in fact, one YAF member
even volunteered to fix the SDS's
faulty loudspeaker.
Fourth, Harvey Hukari never
spoke during the afternoon with
Dean of Student Joel Smith.
Once again, the Daily correctly
noted that responsibility for en
forcement of the recently-adopted
regulations against campus dis
ruptions lies with the Faculty Ad
visory Committee on Campus dis

turbances, and not with Dean
Smith as Mr. Hopper suggested.
Finally, conversations among
participants after the rally fail to
offer any clue as to the nature of
an alleged "disgusting remark re
ferring to one of the speakers'
racial background and Nazi
ovens."
In reality, it was Leonard
Siegel of SDS who brought up the
subject of Nazi brutality. The re
sponse of the crowd, which Mr.
Siegel never answered, was why he
indeed continued to utilize the
tactics of a movement he is so
vehemently opposed to.
It is perhaps indicative of the
lack of dialogue that went on
Wednesday that Mr. Siegel did not
notice that the student carrying a
picket with Hitler's picture on it
was Jewish,
Stanford University has long
enough heard the student voices
in the Old Union courtyard and
on White Memorial Plaza. It is
high time that a few more voices
were heard on joint student
faculty committees and in the up
coming deliberations over SES
proposals.

• My Mother Told Me
Editor, THE DAILY:
My mother always warned
me—if you don't want to look
silly, don't say anything to the
Stanford Daily.
The statements attributed to
me in the Jan. 29 issue are, at
best, a grotesque distortion of
parts of a dinner conversation,
hardly a quotable interview. Your
use of quotation marks is mislead
ing and completely unwarranted.
This is a small matter in an un
important article but the impli
cations are disturbing. Is this sort
of reporting typical? When the
clarity of communication through
the Daily is important, do you do
any better than this?

• Glad To Have Yelled
Editor, THE DAILY:
At the SDS rally I was one of
the guys who was yelling at the
SDS along with the YAF. A girl,
who was apparently from SDS,
told me that she hoped I get killed
in Vietnam. She may or may not
be interested to know that, if and
when I go to Vietnam, I'll be de
fending the freedom not only of
the SoutfTVietnamese but, in an
indirect way, of all the people in
the Free World. And that includes
her.
One note of clarification. A
person I talked with (better make
that yelled with) seemed to think
that there is a close analogy to the
Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia
and our presence in Vietnam. To
that person I'd like to ask two
questions: 1) how many Viet
namese soldiers are fighting side
by side with us? and 2) how many
Czechs or Slavaks helped the
Russians occupy their own coun
try?
One more thing. AsT was eat
ing at Lagunita that night, an SDS
member announced that there was
going to be a meeting in Granada
Lounge to discuss SDS tactics. It
wasn't till then that I was sud
denly glad I had yelled at the
rally. The SDS, after being vic
timized by their own tactics, da
cided that maybe those tactics
needed a little discussion. They
probably won't moderate much if
at all, but at least I helped make
them stop and think.

• SDS Commotion
Editor, THE DAILY:
In view of the great commo
tion and controversy arising from
the recent activities of the SDS, I
think it important that the partic
ular type of "civil disobedience"
which its members practice be put
into proper perspective. I direct
this letter especially to SDS mem
bers and to any others who would
imitate their tactics.
First, I submit that, although
few people categorically renounce
civil disobedience as a means of
achieving justice, most find it
cheapened by its use as a source
of political power. The "civil dis
obedience" practiced by the SDS
has none of the nobility of acting
out of conscience; rather, it is the
perversion of an ideal for the sake
of expediency.
Second, civil disobedience car
ries the assumption that he who
practices it willingly brings upon
himself all consequences provided
for in the law. Someone not wil
ling to accept these consequences
often defeats his original intention
by inviting speculation that he has
acted out of selfish or other per
sonal interests. Evidently, this
kind of speculation has gone a
long way towards destroying
whatever sympathy SDS has had
at Stanford.
Third, I must point out that
those who would violate laws to
win rights they are now denied
should stop to consider how those
rights can be preserved in a soci
ety where their opponents are free
to follow the same course.
Finally, I would like to address
myself specifically to those who
feel that the decadence of society
compels them to participate in
violent acts of civil disobedience:
If you really want to restructure
society, then, unfortunately, you
must be prepared to be patient.
This realization of the need for
patience in no way diminishes the
importance and the urgency of
the problems we face; it merely
specifies the most effective way of
solving them. Truly permanent
gains always take time and patient
effort. If, on the other hand, you
are interested in personal gratifica
tion, then you may act with im
patience, but you may find that
your "gains" disappear as quickly
as your power.

• Signs And Cheers
Editor, THE DAILY:
I'm afraid I wasn't able to read
last Wednesday's Daily (you un
derstand I am so busy I rarely get
a chance to read anything but
what I might write) and just
didn't have the feel of what was
going to happen around Quad that
day. What a surprise it was then,
when my ears perked, so sensitive
they are, as the nostalgically fam
iliar sounds of a rally floated
through the air. Oh, and then the
signs and the cheers and even the
starting lineups were there too.
But I don't remember the uni
forms. Oh well, I can just as easily
forget the lack of uniforms.
WE TOLD YOU SO, Daily.
After all, who was it, that said Big
Game was out of place here at
Stanford? Little hasty perhaps,
aren't you? Why don't you speak
for the majority of the students,

uh? Face the facts for a change.
Its where its happening.

Mulberry Street
Prof Rejoices At Statement
Editor, THE DAILY:
Your readers will undoubtedly
join me in rejoicing at President
Pitzer's reaffirmation, in response
to the SDS demands, of Stan
ford's long-standing policy of
freedom of research. It is because
of this policy that important
members of the University admin
istration, although they personally
would not engage in classified re
search, have pledged themselves to
protect the rights of others, who
so choose, to engage in mission
oriented- research of military sig
nificance.
This announcement comes at a
propitious time for me. I have re
cently been in touch with the
Guevara Foundation located, ap
parently for tax purposes, in
Guinea. This foundation is inter
ested in sponsoring objective,
basic research on alternative stra
tegies for the disruption of com
plex, modern industrial systems.
Classification will not be a prob
lem as it is the policy of the
foundation to encourage the most
widespread dissemination of re
search results.
The project, happily, is intel
lectually challenging and of theo
retical significance. Are modern
industrial systems best disrupted
by sabatoge of end-product fac
tories? Are transportation systems
the weakest link in the system? Or
would "taking out" components
factories be the "least-cost solu
tion" to the problem? Systems
analysis, simulation, gaming, oper
ation research, linear program
ming, statistical decision theory
and benefit-cost analysis will all
have to be employed in the study
since it will be necessary to com
pare the relative utility of a large
number of alternative solutions to
the problem. As principal investi
gator, my position will naturally
be one of ethical neutrality. I have
no idea whether the findings will
be of practical value, or if so to
whom, but in any event those
questions are hardly of concern to
me as a scholar.
It is University policy to em
ploy graduate students in connec
tion with faculty research. Given
the political complexion of the
present group of political science

graduate students, I anticipate no
problem in securing an adequate
number of research assistants.
With luck I may even woo back
one of my last year's teaching as
sistants who is now in Cuba for an
informational visit.
Administration approval of re
search proposals is required at
Stanford, but under our policy of
freedom of research I am sure this
will not be difficult to obtain.

• YAF's Tactics Questioned
Editor, THE DAIL\ :
Wednesday a number of Young
Americans for Freedom members
turned out at the SDS Open For
um at the Old Union in order to
vent their anger over the SDS's
"gestapo-like tactics" and show
their support for 'freedom'. This
is an issue which should be dealt
with, since the controversy over
SDS tactics seems to be the chief
concern of Stanford public opin
ion (one hardly ever hears objec
tions to the nine demands con
cerning the Trustees, SRI, and
Faculty Research any more).
What forms did this conscientious
concern take?The YAFers took
their stand against "fascism" by
cheering wildly at the mention of
Vietnamese casualties and by
blocking the rest of the 250 or so
students from entering the Ap
plied Electronics Lab.
I am not writing this to de
nounce "coercive tactics" nor am
I requesting that the administra
tion prosecute the YAF for dis
rupting the noon rally and block
ing the door at AEL. I do want to
point out, however, why the ac
tions of the YAF were to be ex
pected; and why it was to be ex
pected that not a single person
from either the Faculty Commit
tee on Disruption or from the
University administration, many
of whom were diligently and
swiftly taking names at the Trus
tee's meeting, bothered to take
the names of those students who
were blocking the doors at AEL.
Instead Wyman and Smith spent
their time inside AEL, hinting at
punishment for SDS members if
they didn't leave the building.
More specifically, I wish to
point out the great contradiction
between the rhetoric of Pitzer,
Wyman, Rambo, Hukari, etc., in
deploring all forms of violence;
and their actions with respect to
violence. The articulated neutral
ity-in defense of freedom of these

faculty, administrators, and stu
dents (and many more like them)
has been shown on this occasion
as on many others to be nothing
more than liberal bullshit. The
kind of freedom they desire may
be nothing more than freedom
from effective opposition to a vio
lent status quo.
This status quo includes the
War in Vietnam, which men like
Roger Lewis (chrmn., General
Dynamics) and William Rambo
(military electronics research and
Defense Dept. Boards) support
materially; this means SRl's chem
ical and biological warfare re
search and their counter-insur
gency center in Thailand; this
means Turstee's corporations in
Southeast Asis and Latin America,
where the need for a "good invest
ment climate and economic stabil
ity" necessitates the establishment
and maintenance of oppressive
military dictatorships (Thailand,
for example) which ignore the
basic social needs and human
rights of millions of Third World
people. US responsibility for pov
erty, squalor, disease, and illiter
acy is an act of violence equally as
great as the B-52s bombing Viet
Nam.
These people don't oppose vio
lence or violent tactics on princi
ple. They opposed SDS's "violent
(?) disruption" of the Trustees'
meeting because they oppose the
nine demands and all they stand
for (these demands are just the
first step toward disengaging Stan
ford from the violence going on in
Southeast Asia and the Third
World). Their use of a supposedly
neutral demonstration policy and
their constant reference to cam
pus referenda against coercion
simply isolate Stanford people
from the rest of humanity and of
diver the issue from the concern
over the great coercion and hu
man suffering in the "outside"
world, a violence that Stanford
now actively supports. My request
to Hewlett, Lewis, Pitzer, et al., is
not to prosecute the YAF, but in
stead to tell everyone where they
really stand concerning Stanford
research—And that's my request
to you. Where do you stand on
the nine demands? Where do you
stand on the violence in Southeast
Asia?
MARC WEISS
• Moderates: Beware Of YAF
Editor, THE DAILY:
The Young Americans for
Freedom? By their support of the

war, and SRI research aiding that
war, they do not grant the Viet
namese people the freedom to
live. In addition, Wednesday's per
formance should have made it
clear to all that the members of
the group are not the defenders of
civil liberties that they would like
us to believe.
The attempt of an ultra-right
wing group to equate SDS with
Hilter's Nazis is a ludicrous ges
ture designed to draw attention
away from their own positions
and ideology. This is the group
that tried to rally the "moder
ates" under its banner? Moder
ates, beware!
ELLIS KIRSCHENBAUM
• Hippie As Conformist
Editor, THE DAILY:
Do you know what a hippie is?
The hippie slavishly cringes before
theopinions of other people who
have dropped out from our soci
ety. He wants their approval and
acceptance. His craven desire to
belong, his desperate search for
identity with other humans leads
him to incredible filth, immoral
ity, long hair, beads, psychedelic
clothing, and other obscene ac
coutrements and paraphernalia.
So, in his professed non-conform
ity, he is actually a classic con
formist. Its only a matter of
which group of people comprise
his authority.
A man in the military isn't so
dimwitted. He knows who his
authority is—from the platoon
sergeant right on up to his ultimate
commander-in-chief, the President
of the United States. He knows

his dress, haircut, work habits,
uniform, and whole being must
conform to the dictates of that
authority which governs his life.
But few others, outside the mili
tary, know who their authority is.
Do you?

• Biafra Aid Worthwhile
Editor, THE DAIL\ :
Were all the funds collected for
Biafran/Nigerian relief during this
week going to unilaterally detract
from money which was conceiv
ably on its way to the World
Health Organization or even to
the Stanford Population and En
vironment Forum, the question of
funds going to long-range plan
ning, research and education vs.
funds to as specific and immediate
a need as this would be much
more at issue here.
It might be hoped, however,
that giving to a fund which would
help to alleviate a small part of
much immediate suffering —some-
thing as basic as starvation—would
not prevent a person from giving
greater support to plan against
desperate situations in the future;
this might in fact stimulate a larg
er involvement in human con
cerns. Urging not to support
drives for relief is not to raise
funds for planning, for research.
Planning and research are with
out a doubt the more "worthy" in
a strictly utilitarian sense; long
range goals are generally more im
portant than limited objectives.
We too would like to help the
whole world, and realize that
whatever small part of the suffer
ing is alleviated through this drive
will be only a drop in the bucket.
But here is something that can be
done now—and an all-or-nothing
approach is simplistic. At least it
is a drop of the Stanford reservoir
that will not have simply evapor
ated.
Nothing at all will be done if
an awareness of the basic nature
of the problem is not aroused—if

the gap between the starving peo
ple now or in the future and an
American's experience is not
somehow empathetically bridge
able. In addition to an immediate
objective of raising money for re
lief, it is definitely one of the
goals of conducting a fast to pro
vide an opportunity to come to an
awareness of the actual problem,
beyond dropping a quarter or dol
lar in a collection can for "those
less fortunate than we."
We too would like to help the
whole world, but you need clouds
to see if you want rain.

I am not writing this to de
nounce "coercive tactics" nor am
I requesting that the administra
tion prosecute the YAF for dis
rupting the noon rally and block
ing the door at AEL. I do want to
point out, however, why the ac
tions of the YAF were to be ex
pected; and why it was to be ex
pected that not a single person
from either the Faculty Commit
tee on Disruption or from the
University administration, many
of whom were diligently and
swiftly taking names at the Trus
tee's meeting, bothered to take
the names of those students who
were blocking the doors at AEL.
Instead Wyman and Smith spent
their time inside AEL, hinting at
punishment for SDS members if
they didn't leave the building.
More specifically, I wish to
point out the great contradiction
between the rhetoric of Pitzer,
Wyman, Rambo, Hukari, etc., in
deploring all forms of violence;
and their actions with respect to
violence. The articulated neutral
ity-in defense of freedom of these

faculty, administrators, and stu
dents (and many more like them)
has been shown on this occasion
as on many others to be nothing
more than liberal bullshit. The
kind of freedom they desire may
be nothing more than freedom
from effective opposition to a vio
lent status quo.
This status quo includes the
War in Vietnam, which men like
Roger Lewis (chrmn., General
Dynamics) and William Rambo
(military electronics research and
Defense Dept. Boards) support
materially; this means SRl's chem
ical and biological warfare re
search and their counter-insur
gency center in Thailand; this
means Turstee's corporations in
Southeast Asis and Latin America,
where the need for a "good invest
ment climate and economic stabil
ity" necessitates the establishment
and maintenance of oppressive
military dictatorships (Thailand,
for example) which ignore the
basic social needs and human
rights of millions of Third World
people. US responsibility for pov
erty, squalor, disease, and illiter
acy is an act of violence equally as
great as the B-52s bombing Viet
Nam.
These people don't oppose vio
lence or violent tactics on princi
ple. They opposed SDS's "violent
(?) disruption" of the Trustees'
meeting because they oppose the
nine demands and all they stand
for (these demands are just the
first step toward disengaging Stan
ford from the violence going on in
Southeast Asia and the Third
World). Their use of a supposedly
neutral demonstration policy and
their constant reference to cam
pus referenda against coercion
simply isolate Stanford people
from the rest of humanity and of
diver the issue from the concern
over the great coercion and hu
man suffering in the "outside"
world, a violence that Stanford
now actively supports. My request
to Hewlett, Lewis, Pitzer, et al., is
not to prosecute the YAF, but in
stead to tell everyone where they
really stand concerning Stanford
research—And that's my request
to you. Where do you stand on
the nine demands? Where do you
stand on the violence in Southeast
Asia?

• Moderates: Beware Of YAF
Editor, THE DAILY:
The Young Americans for
Freedom? By their support of the

war, and SRI research aiding that
war, they do not grant the Viet
namese people the freedom to
live. In addition, Wednesday's per
formance should have made it
clear to all that the members of
the group are not the defenders of
civil liberties that they would like
us to believe.
The attempt of an ultra-right
wing group to equate SDS with
Hilter's Nazis is a ludicrous ges
ture designed to draw attention
away from their own positions
and ideology. This is the group
that tried to rally the "moder
ates" under its banner? Moder
ates, beware!

• Hippie As Conformist
Editor, THE DAILY:
Do you know what a hippie is?
The hippie slavishly cringes before
theopinions of other people who
have dropped out from our soci
ety. He wants their approval and
acceptance. His craven desire to
belong, his desperate search for
identity with other humans leads
him to incredible filth, immoral
ity, long hair, beads, psychedelic
clothing, and other obscene ac
coutrements and paraphernalia.
So, in his professed non-conform
ity, he is actually a classic con
formist. Its only a matter of
which group of people comprise
his authority.
A man in the military isn't so
dimwitted. He knows who his
authority is—from the platoon
sergeant right on up to his ultimate
commander-in-chief, the President
of the United States. He knows

his dress, haircut, work habits,
uniform, and whole being must
conform to the dictates of that
authority which governs his life.
But few others, outside the mili
tary, know who their authority is.
Do you?

• Biafra Aid Worthwhile
Editor, THE DAIL\ :
Were all the funds collected for
Biafran/Nigerian relief during this
week going to unilaterally detract
from money which was conceiv
ably on its way to the World
Health Organization or even to
the Stanford Population and En
vironment Forum, the question of
funds going to long-range plan
ning, research and education vs.
funds to as specific and immediate
a need as this would be much
more at issue here.
It might be hoped, however,
that giving to a fund which would
help to alleviate a small part of
much immediate suffering —some-
thing as basic as starvation—would
not prevent a person from giving
greater support to plan against
desperate situations in the future;
this might in fact stimulate a larg
er involvement in human con
cerns. Urging not to support
drives for relief is not to raise
funds for planning, for research.
Planning and research are with
out a doubt the more "worthy" in
a strictly utilitarian sense; long
range goals are generally more im
portant than limited objectives.
We too would like to help the
whole world, and realize that
whatever small part of the suffer
ing is alleviated through this drive
will be only a drop in the bucket.
But here is something that can be
done now—and an all-or-nothing
approach is simplistic. At least it
is a drop of the Stanford reservoir
that will not have simply evapor
ated.
Nothing at all will be done if
an awareness of the basic nature
of the problem is not aroused—if

the gap between the starving peo
ple now or in the future and an
American's experience is not
somehow empathetically bridge
able. In addition to an immediate
objective of raising money for re
lief, it is definitely one of the
goals of conducting a fast to pro
vide an opportunity to come to an
awareness of the actual problem,
beyond dropping a quarter or dol
lar in a collection can for "those
less fortunate than we."
We too would like to help the
whole world, but you need clouds
to see if you want rain.
STANFORD COMM. FOR
BIA FRAN/NIGERIAN RELIEF
• Republicans Attack Letter
Editor, THE DAILY:
In response to Marshall Hop
per's letter of yesterday, we
would like to clarify a few mis
conceptions and items of misin
formation.

It is not our purpose to extend
the debate over Wednesday's
activities or to participate in re
writing the occurrence to the
satisfaction of any one special
action group.
As Mr. Hopper suggests, Stan
ford students are indeed "in
censed." It is precisely for this
reason that the Young Republi
cans (YR's) and the Young Ameri
cans for Freedom (YAF) organ
ized Wednesday's show of force.
It is disconcerting for us to see
such action tagged as use of force.
First, the counter-demon
stration, as organized by the YR's
and YAF was intended to be
peaceful and nonviolent. And de
spite the heat generated in the
confrontation it remained that
way during the entire afternoon.
In order to insure that vio
lence, such as marred the last
Trustee's meeting, .would not
again be ignored by the campus
community, there were three
photographers on hand to record
any potential trouble.
The fact that the YR's and
YAF had a lawyer on hand to
brief the initial 15 participants be
forehand of their rights and to
specifically counsel against any
willful disruption of the rally
should underscore the good inten
tions of the "counter
revolutionaries."
Second, as The Daily's news
story correctly pointed out, Prof.
William Rambo, director of the
A pplied Electronics Laboratory
(A EL), ordered employees to
keep students out of the building.
Since the building was essen
tially closed, evidence as to how
"self-styled Establishment guards
blocked the door" is lacking.
In fact, on two occasions, the
group in front of the main door
opened ranks to allow SDS mem
bers to walk to the door. Only
two students availed themselves of
the opportunity.
Third, while the group yelled
and chanted against SDS, in no in
stance was an attempt made to
"shout down and bodily overrun
the SDS speakers."
In the interest of providing
more functional sound equip
ment, in fact, one YAF member
even volunteered to fix the SDS's
faulty loudspeaker.
Fourth, Harvey Hukari never
spoke during the afternoon with
Dean of Student Joel Smith.
Once again, the Daily correctly
noted that responsibility for en
forcement of the recently-adopted
regulations against campus dis
ruptions lies with the Faculty Ad
visory Committee on Campus dis

turbances, and not with Dean
Smith as Mr. Hopper suggested.
Finally, conversations among
participants after the rally fail to
offer any clue as to the nature of
an alleged "disgusting remark re
ferring to one of the speakers'
racial background and Nazi
ovens."
In reality, it was Leonard
Siegel of SDS who brought up the
subject of Nazi brutality. The re
sponse of the crowd, which Mr.
Siegel never answered, was why he
indeed continued to utilize the
tactics of a movement he is so
vehemently opposed to.
It is perhaps indicative of the
lack of dialogue that went on
Wednesday that Mr. Siegel did not
notice that the student carrying a
picket with Hitler's picture on it
was Jewish,
Stanford University has long
enough heard the student voices
in the Old Union courtyard and
on White Memorial Plaza. It is
high time that a few more voices
were heard on joint student
faculty committees and in the up
coming deliberations over SES
proposals.

• My Mother Told Me
Editor, THE DAILY:
My mother always warned
me—if you don't want to look
silly, don't say anything to the
Stanford Daily.
The statements attributed to
me in the Jan. 29 issue are, at
best, a grotesque distortion of
parts of a dinner conversation,
hardly a quotable interview. Your
use of quotation marks is mislead
ing and completely unwarranted.
This is a small matter in an un
important article but the impli
cations are disturbing. Is this sort
of reporting typical? When the
clarity of communication through
the Daily is important, do you do
any better than this?

• Glad To Have Yelled
Editor, THE DAILY:
At the SDS rally I was one of
the guys who was yelling at the
SDS along with the YAF. A girl,
who was apparently from SDS,
told me that she hoped I get killed
in Vietnam. She may or may not
be interested to know that, if and
when I go to Vietnam, I'll be de
fending the freedom not only of
the SoutfTVietnamese but, in an
indirect way, of all the people in
the Free World. And that includes
her.
One note of clarification. A
person I talked with (better make
that yelled with) seemed to think
that there is a close analogy to the
Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia
and our presence in Vietnam. To
that person I'd like to ask two
questions: 1) how many Viet
namese soldiers are fighting side
by side with us? and 2) how many
Czechs or Slavaks helped the
Russians occupy their own coun
try?
One more thing. AsT was eat
ing at Lagunita that night, an SDS
member announced that there was
going to be a meeting in Granada
Lounge to discuss SDS tactics. It
wasn't till then that I was sud
denly glad I had yelled at the
rally. The SDS, after being vic
timized by their own tactics, da
cided that maybe those tactics
needed a little discussion. They
probably won't moderate much if
at all, but at least I helped make
them stop and think.

• SDS Commotion
Editor, THE DAILY:
In view of the great commo
tion and controversy arising from
the recent activities of the SDS, I
think it important that the partic
ular type of "civil disobedience"
which its members practice be put
into proper perspective. I direct
this letter especially to SDS mem
bers and to any others who would
imitate their tactics.
First, I submit that, although
few people categorically renounce
civil disobedience as a means of
achieving justice, most find it
cheapened by its use as a source
of political power. The "civil dis
obedience" practiced by the SDS
has none of the nobility of acting
out of conscience; rather, it is the
perversion of an ideal for the sake
of expediency.
Second, civil disobedience car
ries the assumption that he who
practices it willingly brings upon
himself all consequences provided
for in the law. Someone not wil
ling to accept these consequences
often defeats his original intention
by inviting speculation that he has
acted out of selfish or other per
sonal interests. Evidently, this
kind of speculation has gone a
long way towards destroying
whatever sympathy SDS has had
at Stanford.
Third, I must point out that
those who would violate laws to
win rights they are now denied
should stop to consider how those
rights can be preserved in a soci
ety where their opponents are free
to follow the same course.
Finally, I would like to address
myself specifically to those who
feel that the decadence of society
compels them to participate in
violent acts of civil disobedience:
If you really want to restructure
society, then, unfortunately, you
must be prepared to be patient.
This realization of the need for
patience in no way diminishes the
importance and the urgency of
the problems we face; it merely
specifies the most effective way of
solving them. Truly permanent
gains always take time and patient
effort. If, on the other hand, you
are interested in personal gratifica
tion, then you may act with im
patience, but you may find that
your "gains" disappear as quickly
as your power.

• Signs And Cheers
Editor, THE DAILY:
I'm afraid I wasn't able to read
last Wednesday's Daily (you un
derstand I am so busy I rarely get
a chance to read anything but
what I might write) and just
didn't have the feel of what was
going to happen around Quad that
day. What a surprise it was then,
when my ears perked, so sensitive
they are, as the nostalgically fam
iliar sounds of a rally floated
through the air. Oh, and then the
signs and the cheers and even the
starting lineups were there too.
But I don't remember the uni
forms. Oh well, I can just as easily
forget the lack of uniforms.
WE TOLD YOU SO, Daily.
After all, who was it, that said Big
Game was out of place here at
Stanford? Little hasty perhaps,
aren't you? Why don't you speak
for the majority of the students,

uh? Face the facts for a change.
Its where its happening.

Mulberry Street
Prof Rejoices At Statement
Editor, THE DAILY:
Your readers will undoubtedly
join me in rejoicing at President
Pitzer's reaffirmation, in response
to the SDS demands, of Stan
ford's long-standing policy of
freedom of research. It is because
of this policy that important
members of the University admin
istration, although they personally
would not engage in classified re
search, have pledged themselves to
protect the rights of others, who
so choose, to engage in mission
oriented- research of military sig
nificance.
This announcement comes at a
propitious time for me. I have re
cently been in touch with the
Guevara Foundation located, ap
parently for tax purposes, in
Guinea. This foundation is inter
ested in sponsoring objective,
basic research on alternative stra
tegies for the disruption of com
plex, modern industrial systems.
Classification will not be a prob
lem as it is the policy of the
foundation to encourage the most
widespread dissemination of re
search results.
The project, happily, is intel
lectually challenging and of theo
retical significance. Are modern
industrial systems best disrupted
by sabatoge of end-product fac
tories? Are transportation systems
the weakest link in the system? Or
would "taking out" components
factories be the "least-cost solu
tion" to the problem? Systems
analysis, simulation, gaming, oper
ation research, linear program
ming, statistical decision theory
and benefit-cost analysis will all
have to be employed in the study
since it will be necessary to com
pare the relative utility of a large
number of alternative solutions to
the problem. As principal investi
gator, my position will naturally
be one of ethical neutrality. I have
no idea whether the findings will
be of practical value, or if so to
whom, but in any event those
questions are hardly of concern to
me as a scholar.
It is University policy to em
ploy graduate students in connec
tion with faculty research. Given
the political complexion of the
present group of political science

graduate students, I anticipate no
problem in securing an adequate
number of research assistants.
With luck I may even woo back
one of my last year's teaching as
sistants who is now in Cuba for an
informational visit.
Administration approval of re
search proposals is required at
Stanford, but under our policy of
freedom of research I am sure this
will not be difficult to obtain.

• YAF's Tactics Questioned
Editor, THE DAIL\ :
Wednesday a number of Young
Americans for Freedom members
turned out at the SDS Open For
um at the Old Union in order to
vent their anger over the SDS's
"gestapo-like tactics" and show
their support for 'freedom'. This
is an issue which should be dealt
with, since the controversy over
SDS tactics seems to be the chief
concern of Stanford public opin
ion (one hardly ever hears objec
tions to the nine demands con
cerning the Trustees, SRI, and
Faculty Research any more).
What forms did this conscientious
concern take?The YAFers took
their stand against "fascism" by
cheering wildly at the mention of
Vietnamese casualties and by
blocking the rest of the 250 or so
students from entering the Ap
plied Electronics Lab.
I am not writing this to de
nounce "coercive tactics" nor am
I requesting that the administra
tion prosecute the YAF for dis
rupting the noon rally and block
ing the door at AEL. I do want to
point out, however, why the ac
tions of the YAF were to be ex
pected; and why it was to be ex
pected that not a single person
from either the Faculty Commit
tee on Disruption or from the
University administration, many
of whom were diligently and
swiftly taking names at the Trus
tee's meeting, bothered to take
the names of those students who
were blocking the doors at AEL.
Instead Wyman and Smith spent
their time inside AEL, hinting at
punishment for SDS members if
they didn't leave the building.
More specifically, I wish to
point out the great contradiction
between the rhetoric of Pitzer,
Wyman, Rambo, Hukari, etc., in
deploring all forms of violence;
and their actions with respect to
violence. The articulated neutral
ity-in defense of freedom of these

faculty, administrators, and stu
dents (and many more like them)
has been shown on this occasion
as on many others to be nothing
more than liberal bullshit. The
kind of freedom they desire may
be nothing more than freedom
from effective opposition to a vio
lent status quo.
This status quo includes the
War in Vietnam, which men like
Roger Lewis (chrmn., General
Dynamics) and William Rambo
(military electronics research and
Defense Dept. Boards) support
materially; this means SRl's chem
ical and biological warfare re
search and their counter-insur
gency center in Thailand; this
means Turstee's corporations in
Southeast Asis and Latin America,
where the need for a "good invest
ment climate and economic stabil
ity" necessitates the establishment
and maintenance of oppressive
military dictatorships (Thailand,
for example) which ignore the
basic social needs and human
rights of millions of Third World
people. US responsibility for pov
erty, squalor, disease, and illiter
acy is an act of violence equally as
great as the B-52s bombing Viet
Nam.
These people don't oppose vio
lence or violent tactics on princi
ple. They opposed SDS's "violent
(?) disruption" of the Trustees'
meeting because they oppose the
nine demands and all they stand
for (these demands are just the
first step toward disengaging Stan
ford from the violence going on in
Southeast Asia and the Third
World). Their use of a supposedly
neutral demonstration policy and
their constant reference to cam
pus referenda against coercion
simply isolate Stanford people
from the rest of humanity and of
diver the issue from the concern
over the great coercion and hu
man suffering in the "outside"
world, a violence that Stanford
now actively supports. My request
to Hewlett, Lewis, Pitzer, et al., is
not to prosecute the YAF, but in
stead to tell everyone where they
really stand concerning Stanford
research—And that's my request
to you. Where do you stand on
the nine demands? Where do you
stand on the violence in Southeast
Asia?

that person I'd like to ask two
questions: 1) how many Viet
namese soldiers are fighting side
by side with us? and 2) how many
Czechs or Slavaks helped the
Russians occupy their own coun
try?
One more thing. AsT was eat
ing at Lagunita that night, an SDS
member announced that there was
going to be a meeting in Granada
Lounge to discuss SDS tactics. It
wasn't till then that I was sud
denly glad I had yelled at the
rally. The SDS, after being vic
timized by their own tactics, da
cided that maybe those tactics
needed a little discussion. They
probably won't moderate much if
at all, but at least I helped make
them stop and think.

• SDS Commotion
Editor, THE DAILY:
In view of the great commo
tion and controversy arising from
the recent activities of the SDS, I
think it important that the partic
ular type of "civil disobedience"
which its members practice be put
into proper perspective. I direct
this letter especially to SDS mem
bers and to any others who would
imitate their tactics.
First, I submit that, although
few people categorically renounce
civil disobedience as a means of
achieving justice, most find it
cheapened by its use as a source
of political power. The "civil dis
obedience" practiced by the SDS
has none of the nobility of acting
out of conscience; rather, it is the
perversion of an ideal for the sake
of expediency.
Second, civil disobedience car
ries the assumption that he who
practices it willingly brings upon
himself all consequences provided
for in the law. Someone not wil
ling to accept these consequences
often defeats his original intention
by inviting speculation that he has
acted out of selfish or other per
sonal interests. Evidently, this
kind of speculation has gone a
long way towards destroying
whatever sympathy SDS has had
at Stanford.
Third, I must point out that
those who would violate laws to
win rights they are now denied
should stop to consider how those
rights can be preserved in a soci
ety where their opponents are free
to follow the same course.
Finally, I would like to address
myself specifically to those who
feel that the decadence of society
compels them to participate in
violent acts of civil disobedience:
If you really want to restructure
society, then, unfortunately, you
must be prepared to be patient.
This realization of the need for
patience in no way diminishes the
importance and the urgency of
the problems we face; it merely
specifies the most effective way of
solving them. Truly permanent
gains always take time and patient
effort. If, on the other hand, you
are interested in personal gratifica
tion, then you may act with im
patience, but you may find that
your "gains" disappear as quickly
as your power.

• Signs And Cheers
Editor, THE DAILY:
I'm afraid I wasn't able to read
last Wednesday's Daily (you un
derstand I am so busy I rarely get
a chance to read anything but
what I might write) and just
didn't have the feel of what was
going to happen around Quad that
day. What a surprise it was then,
when my ears perked, so sensitive
they are, as the nostalgically fam
iliar sounds of a rally floated
through the air. Oh, and then the
signs and the cheers and even the
starting lineups were there too.
But I don't remember the uni
forms. Oh well, I can just as easily
forget the lack of uniforms.
WE TOLD YOU SO, Daily.
After all, who was it, that said Big
Game was out of place here at
Stanford? Little hasty perhaps,
aren't you? Why don't you speak
for the majority of the students,

uh? Face the facts for a change.
Its where its happening.

Prof Rejoices At Statement
Editor, THE DAILY:
Your readers will undoubtedly
join me in rejoicing at President
Pitzer's reaffirmation, in response
to the SDS demands, of Stan
ford's long-standing policy of
freedom of research. It is because
of this policy that important
members of the University admin
istration, although they personally
would not engage in classified re
search, have pledged themselves to
protect the rights of others, who
so choose, to engage in mission
oriented- research of military sig
nificance.
This announcement comes at a
propitious time for me. I have re
cently been in touch with the
Guevara Foundation located, ap
parently for tax purposes, in
Guinea. This foundation is inter
ested in sponsoring objective,
basic research on alternative stra
tegies for the disruption of com
plex, modern industrial systems.
Classification will not be a prob
lem as it is the policy of the
foundation to encourage the most
widespread dissemination of re
search results.
The project, happily, is intel
lectually challenging and of theo
retical significance. Are modern
industrial systems best disrupted
by sabatoge of end-product fac
tories? Are transportation systems
the weakest link in the system? Or
would "taking out" components
factories be the "least-cost solu
tion" to the problem? Systems
analysis, simulation, gaming, oper
ation research, linear program
ming, statistical decision theory
and benefit-cost analysis will all
have to be employed in the study
since it will be necessary to com
pare the relative utility of a large
number of alternative solutions to
the problem. As principal investi
gator, my position will naturally
be one of ethical neutrality. I have
no idea whether the findings will
be of practical value, or if so to
whom, but in any event those
questions are hardly of concern to
me as a scholar.
It is University policy to em
ploy graduate students in connec
tion with faculty research. Given
the political complexion of the
present group of political science

graduate students, I anticipate no
problem in securing an adequate
number of research assistants.
With luck I may even woo back
one of my last year's teaching as
sistants who is now in Cuba for an
informational visit.
Administration approval of re
search proposals is required at
Stanford, but under our policy of
freedom of research I am sure this
will not be difficult to obtain.

• YAF's Tactics Questioned
Editor, THE DAIL\ :
Wednesday a number of Young
Americans for Freedom members
turned out at the SDS Open For
um at the Old Union in order to
vent their anger over the SDS's
"gestapo-like tactics" and show
their support for 'freedom'. This
is an issue which should be dealt
with, since the controversy over
SDS tactics seems to be the chief
concern of Stanford public opin
ion (one hardly ever hears objec
tions to the nine demands con
cerning the Trustees, SRI, and
Faculty Research any more).
What forms did this conscientious
concern take?The YAFers took
their stand against "fascism" by
cheering wildly at the mention of
Vietnamese casualties and by
blocking the rest of the 250 or so
students from entering the Ap
plied Electronics Lab.
I am not writing this to de
nounce "coercive tactics" nor am
I requesting that the administra
tion prosecute the YAF for dis
rupting the noon rally and block
ing the door at AEL. I do want to
point out, however, why the ac
tions of the YAF were to be ex
pected; and why it was to be ex
pected that not a single person
from either the Faculty Commit
tee on Disruption or from the
University administration, many
of whom were diligently and
swiftly taking names at the Trus
tee's meeting, bothered to take
the names of those students who
were blocking the doors at AEL.
Instead Wyman and Smith spent
their time inside AEL, hinting at
punishment for SDS members if
they didn't leave the building.
More specifically, I wish to
point out the great contradiction
between the rhetoric of Pitzer,
Wyman, Rambo, Hukari, etc., in
deploring all forms of violence;
and their actions with respect to
violence. The articulated neutral
ity-in defense of freedom of these

faculty, administrators, and stu
dents (and many more like them)
has been shown on this occasion
as on many others to be nothing
more than liberal bullshit. The
kind of freedom they desire may
be nothing more than freedom
from effective opposition to a vio
lent status quo.
This status quo includes the
War in Vietnam, which men like
Roger Lewis (chrmn., General
Dynamics) and William Rambo
(military electronics research and
Defense Dept. Boards) support
materially; this means SRl's chem
ical and biological warfare re
search and their counter-insur
gency center in Thailand; this
means Turstee's corporations in
Southeast Asis and Latin America,
where the need for a "good invest
ment climate and economic stabil
ity" necessitates the establishment
and maintenance of oppressive
military dictatorships (Thailand,
for example) which ignore the
basic social needs and human
rights of millions of Third World
people. US responsibility for pov
erty, squalor, disease, and illiter
acy is an act of violence equally as
great as the B-52s bombing Viet
Nam.
These people don't oppose vio
lence or violent tactics on princi
ple. They opposed SDS's "violent
(?) disruption" of the Trustees'
meeting because they oppose the
nine demands and all they stand
for (these demands are just the
first step toward disengaging Stan
ford from the violence going on in
Southeast Asia and the Third
World). Their use of a supposedly
neutral demonstration policy and
their constant reference to cam
pus referenda against coercion
simply isolate Stanford people
from the rest of humanity and of
diver the issue from the concern
over the great coercion and hu
man suffering in the "outside"
world, a violence that Stanford
now actively supports. My request
to Hewlett, Lewis, Pitzer, et al., is
not to prosecute the YAF, but in
stead to tell everyone where they
really stand concerning Stanford
research—And that's my request
to you. Where do you stand on
the nine demands? Where do you
stand on the violence in Southeast
Asia?

• Moderates: Beware Of YAF
Editor, THE DAILY:
The Young Americans for
Freedom? By their support of the

war, and SRI research aiding that
war, they do not grant the Viet
namese people the freedom to
live. In addition, Wednesday's per
formance should have made it
clear to all that the members of
the group are not the defenders of
civil liberties that they would like
us to believe.
The attempt of an ultra-right
wing group to equate SDS with
Hilter's Nazis is a ludicrous ges
ture designed to draw attention
away from their own positions
and ideology. This is the group
that tried to rally the "moder
ates" under its banner? Moder
ates, beware!

• Hippie As Conformist
Editor, THE DAILY:
Do you know what a hippie is?
The hippie slavishly cringes before
theopinions of other people who
have dropped out from our soci
ety. He wants their approval and
acceptance. His craven desire to
belong, his desperate search for
identity with other humans leads
him to incredible filth, immoral
ity, long hair, beads, psychedelic
clothing, and other obscene ac
coutrements and paraphernalia.
So, in his professed non-conform
ity, he is actually a classic con
formist. Its only a matter of
which group of people comprise
his authority.
A man in the military isn't so
dimwitted. He knows who his
authority is—from the platoon
sergeant right on up to his ultimate
commander-in-chief, the President
of the United States. He knows

his dress, haircut, work habits,
uniform, and whole being must
conform to the dictates of that
authority which governs his life.
But few others, outside the mili
tary, know who their authority is.
Do you?

• Biafra Aid Worthwhile
Editor, THE DAIL\ :
Were all the funds collected for
Biafran/Nigerian relief during this
week going to unilaterally detract
from money which was conceiv
ably on its way to the World
Health Organization or even to
the Stanford Population and En
vironment Forum, the question of
funds going to long-range plan
ning, research and education vs.
funds to as specific and immediate
a need as this would be much
more at issue here.
It might be hoped, however,
that giving to a fund which would
help to alleviate a small part of
much immediate suffering —some-
thing as basic as starvation—would
not prevent a person from giving
greater support to plan against
desperate situations in the future;
this might in fact stimulate a larg
er involvement in human con
cerns. Urging not to support
drives for relief is not to raise
funds for planning, for research.
Planning and research are with
out a doubt the more "worthy" in
a strictly utilitarian sense; long
range goals are generally more im
portant than limited objectives.
We too would like to help the
whole world, and realize that
whatever small part of the suffer
ing is alleviated through this drive
will be only a drop in the bucket.
But here is something that can be
done now—and an all-or-nothing
approach is simplistic. At least it
is a drop of the Stanford reservoir
that will not have simply evapor
ated.
Nothing at all will be done if
an awareness of the basic nature
of the problem is not aroused—if

the gap between the starving peo
ple now or in the future and an
American's experience is not
somehow empathetically bridge
able. In addition to an immediate
objective of raising money for re
lief, it is definitely one of the
goals of conducting a fast to pro
vide an opportunity to come to an
awareness of the actual problem,
beyond dropping a quarter or dol
lar in a collection can for "those
less fortunate than we."
We too would like to help the
whole world, but you need clouds
to see if you want rain.
STANFORD COMM. FOR
BIA FRAN/NIGERIAN RELIEF
• Republicans Attack Letter
Editor, THE DAILY:
In response to Marshall Hop
per's letter of yesterday, we
would like to clarify a few mis
conceptions and items of misin
formation.

It is not our purpose to extend
the debate over Wednesday's
activities or to participate in re
writing the occurrence to the
satisfaction of any one special
action group.
As Mr. Hopper suggests, Stan
ford students are indeed "in
censed." It is precisely for this
reason that the Young Republi
cans (YR's) and the Young Ameri
cans for Freedom (YAF) organ
ized Wednesday's show of force.
It is disconcerting for us to see
such action tagged as use of force.
First, the counter-demon
stration, as organized by the YR's
and YAF was intended to be
peaceful and nonviolent. And de
spite the heat generated in the
confrontation it remained that
way during the entire afternoon.
In order to insure that vio
lence, such as marred the last
Trustee's meeting, .would not
again be ignored by the campus
community, there were three
photographers on hand to record
any potential trouble.
The fact that the YR's and
YAF had a lawyer on hand to
brief the initial 15 participants be
forehand of their rights and to
specifically counsel against any
willful disruption of the rally
should underscore the good inten
tions of the "counter
revolutionaries."
Second, as The Daily's news
story correctly pointed out, Prof.
William Rambo, director of the
A pplied Electronics Laboratory
(A EL), ordered employees to
keep students out of the building.
Since the building was essen
tially closed, evidence as to how
"self-styled Establishment guards
blocked the door" is lacking.
In fact, on two occasions, the
group in front of the main door
opened ranks to allow SDS mem
bers to walk to the door. Only
two students availed themselves of
the opportunity.
Third, while the group yelled
and chanted against SDS, in no in
stance was an attempt made to
"shout down and bodily overrun
the SDS speakers."
In the interest of providing
more functional sound equip
ment, in fact, one YAF member
even volunteered to fix the SDS's
faulty loudspeaker.
Fourth, Harvey Hukari never
spoke during the afternoon with
Dean of Student Joel Smith.
Once again, the Daily correctly
noted that responsibility for en
forcement of the recently-adopted
regulations against campus dis
ruptions lies with the Faculty Ad
visory Committee on Campus dis

turbances, and not with Dean
Smith as Mr. Hopper suggested.
Finally, conversations among
participants after the rally fail to
offer any clue as to the nature of
an alleged "disgusting remark re
ferring to one of the speakers'
racial background and Nazi
ovens."
In reality, it was Leonard
Siegel of SDS who brought up the
subject of Nazi brutality. The re
sponse of the crowd, which Mr.
Siegel never answered, was why he
indeed continued to utilize the
tactics of a movement he is so
vehemently opposed to.
It is perhaps indicative of the
lack of dialogue that went on
Wednesday that Mr. Siegel did not
notice that the student carrying a
picket with Hitler's picture on it
was Jewish,
Stanford University has long
enough heard the student voices
in the Old Union courtyard and
on White Memorial Plaza. It is
high time that a few more voices
were heard on joint student
faculty committees and in the up
coming deliberations over SES
proposals.

• My Mother Told Me
Editor, THE DAILY:
My mother always warned
me—if you don't want to look
silly, don't say anything to the
Stanford Daily.
The statements attributed to
me in the Jan. 29 issue are, at
best, a grotesque distortion of
parts of a dinner conversation,
hardly a quotable interview. Your
use of quotation marks is mislead
ing and completely unwarranted.
This is a small matter in an un
important article but the impli

of reporting typical? When the
clarity of communication through
the Daily is important, do you do
any better than this?

• Glad To Have Yelled
Editor, THE DAILY:
At the SDS rally I was one of
the guys who was yelling at the
SDS along with the YAF. A girl,
who was apparently from SDS,
told me that she hoped I get killed
in Vietnam. She may or may not
be interested to know that, if and
when I go to Vietnam, I'll be de
fending the freedom not only of
the SoutfTVietnamese but, in an
indirect way, of all the people in
the Free World. And that includes
her.
One note of clarification. A
person I talked with (better make
that yelled with) seemed to think
that there is a close analogy to the
Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia
and our presence in Vietnam. To
that person I'd like to ask two
questions: 1) how many Viet
namese soldiers are fighting side
by side with us? and 2) how many
Czechs or Slavaks helped the
Russians occupy their own coun
try?
One more thing. AsT was eat
ing at Lagunita that night, an SDS
member announced that there was
going to be a meeting in Granada
Lounge to discuss SDS tactics. It
wasn't till then that I was sud
denly glad I had yelled at the
rally. The SDS, after being vic

cided that maybe those tactics
needed a little discussion. They
probably won't moderate much if
at all, but at least I helped make

This realization of the need for

• YAF's Tactics Questioned
Editor, THE DAIL\ :
Wednesday a number of Young
Americans for Freedom members
turned out at the SDS Open For
um at the Old Union in order to
vent their anger over the SDS's
"gestapo-like tactics" and show
their support for 'freedom'. This
is an issue which should be dealt
with, since the controversy over
SDS tactics seems to be the chief
concern of Stanford public opin
ion (one hardly ever hears objec

cerning the Trustees, SRI, and
Faculty Research any more).
What forms did this conscientious
concern take?The YAFers took
their stand against "fascism" by
cheering wildly at the mention of
Vietnamese casualties and by
blocking the rest of the 250 or so
students from entering the Ap
plied Electronics Lab.
I am not writing this to de
nounce "coercive tactics" nor am
I requesting that the administra
tion prosecute the YAF for dis
rupting the noon rally and block
ing the door at AEL. I do want to
point out, however, why the ac
tions of the YAF were to be ex
pected; and why it was to be ex
pected that not a single person
from either the Faculty Commit
tee on Disruption or from the
University administration, many
of whom were diligently and
swiftly taking names at the Trus
tee's meeting, bothered to take
the names of those students who
were blocking the doors at AEL.
Instead Wyman and Smith spent
their time inside AEL, hinting at
punishment for SDS members if
they didn't leave the building.
More specifically, I wish to
point out the great contradiction
between the rhetoric of Pitzer,
Wyman, Rambo, Hukari, etc., in
deploring all forms of violence;
and their actions with respect to
violence. The articulated neutral
ity-in defense of freedom of these

faculty, administrators, and stu
dents (and many more like them)
has been shown on this occasion
as on many others to be nothing
more than liberal bullshit. The
kind of freedom they desire may
be nothing more than freedom
from effective opposition to a vio
lent status quo.
This status quo includes the
War in Vietnam, which men like
Roger Lewis (chrmn., General
Dynamics) and William Rambo
(military electronics research and
Defense Dept. Boards) support
materially; this means SRl's chem
ical and biological warfare re
search and their counter-insur
gency center in Thailand; this
means Turstee's corporations in
Southeast Asis and Latin America,
where the need for a "good invest

and maintenance of oppressive
military dictatorships (Thailand,
for example) which ignore the
basic social needs and human
rights of millions of Third World
people. US responsibility for pov
erty, squalor, disease, and illiter
acy is an act of violence equally as
great as the B-52s bombing Viet
Nam.
These people don't oppose vio
lence or violent tactics on princi
ple. They opposed SDS's "violent
(?) disruption" of the Trustees'
meeting because they oppose the
nine demands and all they stand
for (these demands are just the
first step toward disengaging Stan
ford from the violence going on in
Southeast Asia and the Third
World). Their use of a supposedly
neutral demonstration policy and
their constant reference to cam
pus referenda against coercion
simply isolate Stanford people
from the rest of humanity and of
diver the issue from the concern
over the great coercion and hu
man suffering in the "outside"
world, a violence that Stanford
now actively supports. My request
to Hewlett, Lewis, Pitzer, et al., is
not to prosecute the YAF, but in
stead to tell everyone where they
really stand concerning Stanford
research—And that's my request
to you. Where do you stand on
the nine demands? Where do you
stand on the violence in Southeast

• Biafra Aid Worthwhile
Editor, THE DAIL\ :
Were all the funds collected for
Biafran/Nigerian relief during this
week going to unilaterally detract
from money which was conceiv
ably on its way to the World
Health Organization or even to
the Stanford Population and En
vironment Forum, the question of
funds going to long-range plan
ning, research and education vs.
funds to as specific and immediate
a need as this would be much
more at issue here.
It might be hoped, however,
that giving to a fund which would
help to alleviate a small part of
much immediate suffering —some-
thing as basic as starvation—would
not prevent a person from giving
greater support to plan against
desperate situations in the future;
this might in fact stimulate a larg
er involvement in human con
cerns. Urging not to support
drives for relief is not to raise
funds for planning, for research.
Planning and research are with
out a doubt the more "worthy" in
a strictly utilitarian sense; long
range goals are generally more im
portant than limited objectives.
We too would like to help the
whole world, and realize that
whatever small part of the suffer
ing is alleviated through this drive
will be only a drop in the bucket.
But here is something that can be
done now—and an all-or-nothing
approach is simplistic. At least it
is a drop of the Stanford reservoir
that will not have simply evapor
ated.
Nothing at all will be done if
an awareness of the basic nature
of the problem is not aroused—if

the gap between the starving peo
ple now or in the future and an
American's experience is not
somehow empathetically bridge
able. In addition to an immediate
objective of raising money for re
lief, it is definitely one of the
goals of conducting a fast to pro
vide an opportunity to come to an
awareness of the actual problem,
beyond dropping a quarter or dol
lar in a collection can for "those
less fortunate than we."
We too would like to help the
whole world, but you need clouds
to see if you want rain.

BIA FRAN/NIGERIAN RELIEF
• Republicans Attack Letter
Editor, THE DAILY:
In response to Marshall Hop
per's letter of yesterday, we
would like to clarify a few mis
conceptions and items of misin
formation.

It is not our purpose to extend
the debate over Wednesday's
activities or to participate in re
writing the occurrence to the
satisfaction of any one special
action group.
As Mr. Hopper suggests, Stan
ford students are indeed "in
censed." It is precisely for this
reason that the Young Republi
cans (YR's) and the Young Ameri
cans for Freedom (YAF) organ
ized Wednesday's show of force.
It is disconcerting for us to see
such action tagged as use of force.
First, the counter-demon
stration, as organized by the YR's
and YAF was intended to be
peaceful and nonviolent. And de
spite the heat generated in the
confrontation it remained that
way during the entire afternoon.
In order to insure that vio
lence, such as marred the last
Trustee's meeting, .would not
again be ignored by the campus
community, there were three
photographers on hand to record
any potential trouble.
The fact that the YR's and
YAF had a lawyer on hand to
brief the initial 15 participants be
forehand of their rights and to
specifically counsel against any
willful disruption of the rally
should underscore the good inten
tions of the "counter
revolutionaries."
Second, as The Daily's news
story correctly pointed out, Prof.
William Rambo, director of the
A pplied Electronics Laboratory
(A EL), ordered employees to
keep students out of the building.
Since the building was essen
tially closed, evidence as to how
"self-styled Establishment guards
blocked the door" is lacking.
In fact, on two occasions, the
group in front of the main door
opened ranks to allow SDS mem
bers to walk to the door. Only
two students availed themselves of
the opportunity.
Third, while the group yelled
and chanted against SDS, in no in
stance was an attempt made to
"shout down and bodily overrun
the SDS speakers."
In the interest of providing
more functional sound equip
ment, in fact, one YAF member
even volunteered to fix the SDS's
faulty loudspeaker.
Fourth, Harvey Hukari never
spoke during the afternoon with
Dean of Student Joel Smith.
Once again, the Daily correctly
noted that responsibility for en
forcement of the recently-adopted
regulations against campus dis
ruptions lies with the Faculty Ad
visory Committee on Campus dis

turbances, and not with Dean
Smith as Mr. Hopper suggested.
Finally, conversations among
participants after the rally fail to
offer any clue as to the nature of
an alleged "disgusting remark re
ferring to one of the speakers'
racial background and Nazi
ovens."
In reality, it was Leonard
Siegel of SDS who brought up the
subject of Nazi brutality. The re
sponse of the crowd, which Mr.
Siegel never answered, was why he
indeed continued to utilize the
tactics of a movement he is so
vehemently opposed to.
It is perhaps indicative of the
lack of dialogue that went on
Wednesday that Mr. Siegel did not
notice that the student carrying a
picket with Hitler's picture on it
was Jewish,
Stanford University has long
enough heard the student voices
in the Old Union courtyard and
on White Memorial Plaza. It is
high time that a few more voices
were heard on joint student
faculty committees and in the up
coming deliberations over SES
proposals.

• My Mother Told Me
Editor, THE DAILY:
My mother always warned
me—if you don't want to look
silly, don't say anything to the
Stanford Daily.
The statements attributed to
me in the Jan. 29 issue are, at
best, a grotesque distortion of
parts of a dinner conversation,
hardly a quotable interview. Your
use of quotation marks is mislead
ing and completely unwarranted.
This is a small matter in an un
important article but the impli
cations are disturbing. Is this sort
of reporting typical? When the
clarity of communication through
the Daily is important, do you do
any better than this?

• Glad To Have Yelled
Editor, THE DAILY:
At the SDS rally I was one of
the guys who was yelling at the
SDS along with the YAF. A girl,
who was apparently from SDS,
told me that she hoped I get killed
in Vietnam. She may or may not
be interested to know that, if and
when I go to Vietnam, I'll be de
fending the freedom not only of
the SoutfTVietnamese but, in an
indirect way, of all the people in
the Free World. And that includes
her.
One note of clarification. A
person I talked with (better make
that yelled with) seemed to think
that there is a close analogy to the
Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia
and our presence in Vietnam. To
that person I'd like to ask two
questions: 1) how many Viet
namese soldiers are fighting side
by side with us? and 2) how many
Czechs or Slavaks helped the
Russians occupy their own coun
try?
One more thing. AsT was eat
ing at Lagunita that night, an SDS
member announced that there was
going to be a meeting in Granada
Lounge to discuss SDS tactics. It
wasn't till then that I was sud
denly glad I had yelled at the
rally. The SDS, after being vic
timized by their own tactics, da
cided that maybe those tactics
needed a little discussion. They
probably won't moderate much if
at all, but at least I helped make
them stop and think.

• SDS Commotion
Editor, THE DAILY:
In view of the great commo
tion and controversy arising from
the recent activities of the SDS, I
think it important that the partic
ular type of "civil disobedience"
which its members practice be put
into proper perspective. I direct
this letter especially to SDS mem
bers and to any others who would
imitate their tactics.
First, I submit that, although
few people categorically renounce
civil disobedience as a means of
achieving justice, most find it
cheapened by its use as a source
of political power. The "civil dis
obedience" practiced by the SDS
has none of the nobility of acting
out of conscience; rather, it is the
perversion of an ideal for the sake
of expediency.
Second, civil disobedience car
ries the assumption that he who
practices it willingly brings upon
himself all consequences provided
for in the law. Someone not wil
ling to accept these consequences
often defeats his original intention
by inviting speculation that he has
acted out of selfish or other per
sonal interests. Evidently, this
kind of speculation has gone a
long way towards destroying
whatever sympathy SDS has had
at Stanford.
Third, I must point out that
those who would violate laws to
win rights they are now denied
should stop to consider how those
rights can be preserved in a soci
ety where their opponents are free
to follow the same course.
Finally, I would like to address
myself specifically to those who
feel that the decadence of society
compels them to participate in
violent acts of civil disobedience:
If you really want to restructure
society, then, unfortunately, you
must be prepared to be patient.
This realization of the need for
patience in no way diminishes the
importance and the urgency of
the problems we face; it merely
specifies the most effective way of
solving them. Truly permanent
gains always take time and patient
effort. If, on the other hand, you
are interested in personal gratifica
tion, then you may act with im
patience, but you may find that
your "gains" disappear as quickly
as your power.

• Signs And Cheers
Editor, THE DAILY:
I'm afraid I wasn't able to read
last Wednesday's Daily (you un
derstand I am so busy I rarely get
a chance to read anything but
what I might write) and just
didn't have the feel of what was
going to happen around Quad that
day. What a surprise it was then,
when my ears perked, so sensitive
they are, as the nostalgically fam
iliar sounds of a rally floated
through the air. Oh, and then the
signs and the cheers and even the
starting lineups were there too.
But I don't remember the uni
forms. Oh well, I can just as easily
forget the lack of uniforms.
WE TOLD YOU SO, Daily.
After all, who was it, that said Big
Game was out of place here at
Stanford? Little hasty perhaps,
aren't you? Why don't you speak
for the majority of the students,

uh? Face the facts for a change.

Mulberry Street
Prof Rejoices At Statement
Editor, THE DAILY:
Your readers will undoubtedly
join me in rejoicing at President
Pitzer's reaffirmation, in response
to the SDS demands, of Stan
ford's long-standing policy of
freedom of research. It is because
of this policy that important
members of the University admin
istration, although they personally
would not engage in classified re
search, have pledged themselves to
protect the rights of others, who
so choose, to engage in mission
oriented- research of military sig
nificance.
This announcement comes at a
propitious time for me. I have re
cently been in touch with the
Guevara Foundation located, ap
parently for tax purposes, in
Guinea. This foundation is inter
ested in sponsoring objective,
basic research on alternative stra
tegies for the disruption of com
plex, modern industrial systems.
Classification will not be a prob
lem as it is the policy of the
foundation to encourage the most
widespread dissemination of re
search results.
The project, happily, is intel
lectually challenging and of theo
retical significance. Are modern
industrial systems best disrupted
by sabatoge of end-product fac
tories? Are transportation systems
the weakest link in the system? Or
would "taking out" components
factories be the "least-cost solu
tion" to the problem? Systems
analysis, simulation, gaming, oper
ation research, linear program
ming, statistical decision theory
and benefit-cost analysis will all
have to be employed in the study
since it will be necessary to com
pare the relative utility of a large
number of alternative solutions to
the problem. As principal investi
gator, my position will naturally
be one of ethical neutrality. I have
no idea whether the findings will
be of practical value, or if so to
whom, but in any event those
questions are hardly of concern to
me as a scholar.
It is University policy to em
ploy graduate students in connec
tion with faculty research. Given
the political complexion of the
present group of political science

graduate students, I anticipate no
problem in securing an adequate
number of research assistants.
With luck I may even woo back
one of my last year's teaching as
sistants who is now in Cuba for an
informational visit.
Administration approval of re
search proposals is required at
Stanford, but under our policy of
freedom of research I am sure this
will not be difficult to obtain.

• YAF's Tactics Questioned
Editor, THE DAIL\ :
Wednesday a number of Young
Americans for Freedom members
turned out at the SDS Open For
um at the Old Union in order to
vent their anger over the SDS's
"gestapo-like tactics" and show
their support for 'freedom'. This
is an issue which should be dealt
with, since the controversy over
SDS tactics seems to be the chief
concern of Stanford public opin
ion (one hardly ever hears objec
tions to the nine demands con
cerning the Trustees, SRI, and
Faculty Research any more).
What forms did this conscientious
concern take?The YAFers took
their stand against "fascism" by
cheering wildly at the mention of
Vietnamese casualties and by
blocking the rest of the 250 or so
students from entering the Ap
plied Electronics Lab.
I am not writing this to de
nounce "coercive tactics" nor am
I requesting that the administra
tion prosecute the YAF for dis
rupting the noon rally and block
ing the door at AEL. I do want to
point out, however, why the ac
tions of the YAF were to be ex
pected; and why it was to be ex
pected that not a single person
from either the Faculty Commit
tee on Disruption or from the
University administration, many
of whom were diligently and
swiftly taking names at the Trus
tee's meeting, bothered to take
the names of those students who
were blocking the doors at AEL.
Instead Wyman and Smith spent
their time inside AEL, hinting at
punishment for SDS members if
they didn't leave the building.
More specifically, I wish to
point out the great contradiction
between the rhetoric of Pitzer,
Wyman, Rambo, Hukari, etc., in
deploring all forms of violence;
and their actions with respect to
violence. The articulated neutral
ity-in defense of freedom of these

faculty, administrators, and stu
dents (and many more like them)
has been shown on this occasion
as on many others to be nothing
more than liberal bullshit. The
kind of freedom they desire may
be nothing more than freedom
from effective opposition to a vio
lent status quo.
This status quo includes the
War in Vietnam, which men like
Roger Lewis (chrmn., General
Dynamics) and William Rambo
(military electronics research and
Defense Dept. Boards) support
materially; this means SRl's chem
ical and biological warfare re
search and their counter-insur
gency center in Thailand; this
means Turstee's corporations in
Southeast Asis and Latin America,
where the need for a "good invest
ment climate and economic stabil
ity" necessitates the establishment
and maintenance of oppressive
military dictatorships (Thailand,
for example) which ignore the
basic social needs and human
rights of millions of Third World
people. US responsibility for pov
erty, squalor, disease, and illiter
acy is an act of violence equally as
great as the B-52s bombing Viet
Nam.
These people don't oppose vio
lence or violent tactics on princi
ple. They opposed SDS's "violent
(?) disruption" of the Trustees'
meeting because they oppose the
nine demands and all they stand
for (these demands are just the
first step toward disengaging Stan
ford from the violence going on in
Southeast Asia and the Third
World). Their use of a supposedly
neutral demonstration policy and
their constant reference to cam
pus referenda against coercion
simply isolate Stanford people
from the rest of humanity and of
diver the issue from the concern
over the great coercion and hu
man suffering in the "outside"
world, a violence that Stanford
now actively supports. My request
to Hewlett, Lewis, Pitzer, et al., is
not to prosecute the YAF, but in
stead to tell everyone where they
really stand concerning Stanford
research—And that's my request
to you. Where do you stand on
the nine demands? Where do you
stand on the violence in Southeast
Asia?
MARC WEISS
• Moderates: Beware Of YAF
Editor, THE DAILY:
The Young Americans for
Freedom? By their support of the

war, and SRI research aiding that
war, they do not grant the Viet
namese people the freedom to
live. In addition, Wednesday's per
formance should have made it
clear to all that the members of
the group are not the defenders of
civil liberties that they would like
us to believe.
The attempt of an ultra-right
wing group to equate SDS with
Hilter's Nazis is a ludicrous ges
ture designed to draw attention
away from their own positions
and ideology. This is the group
that tried to rally the "moder
ates" under its banner? Moder
ates, beware!
ELLIS KIRSCHENBAUM
• Hippie As Conformist
Editor, THE DAILY:
Do you know what a hippie is?
The hippie slavishly cringes before
theopinions of other people who
have dropped out from our soci
ety. He wants their approval and
acceptance. His craven desire to
belong, his desperate search for
identity with other humans leads
him to incredible filth, immoral
ity, long hair, beads, psychedelic
clothing, and other obscene ac
coutrements and paraphernalia.
So, in his professed non-conform
ity, he is actually a classic con
formist. Its only a matter of
which group of people comprise
his authority.
A man in the military isn't so
dimwitted. He knows who his
authority is—from the platoon
sergeant right on up to his ultimate
commander-in-chief, the President
of the United States. He knows

his dress, haircut, work habits,
uniform, and whole being must
conform to the dictates of that
authority which governs his life.
But few others, outside the mili
tary, know who their authority is.
Do you?

by sabatoge of end-product fac
tories? Are transportation systems
the weakest link in the system? Or
would "taking out" components
factories be the "least-cost solu
tion" to the problem? Systems
analysis, simulation, gaming, oper
ation research, linear program
ming, statistical decision theory
and benefit-cost analysis will all
have to be employed in the study
since it will be necessary to com
pare the relative utility of a large
number of alternative solutions to
the problem. As principal investi
gator, my position will naturally
be one of ethical neutrality. I have
no idea whether the findings will
be of practical value, or if so to
whom, but in any event those
questions are hardly of concern to
me as a scholar.
It is University policy to em
ploy graduate students in connec
tion with faculty research. Given
the political complexion of the
present group of political science

graduate students, I anticipate no
problem in securing an adequate
number of research assistants.
With luck I may even woo back
one of my last year's teaching as
sistants who is now in Cuba for an
informational visit.
Administration approval of re
search proposals is required at
Stanford, but under our policy of
freedom of research I am sure this
will not be difficult to obtain.

• YAF's Tactics Questioned
Editor, THE DAIL\ :
Wednesday a number of Young
Americans for Freedom members
turned out at the SDS Open For
um at the Old Union in order to
vent their anger over the SDS's
"gestapo-like tactics" and show
their support for 'freedom'. This
is an issue which should be dealt
with, since the controversy over
SDS tactics seems to be the chief
concern of Stanford public opin
ion (one hardly ever hears objec
tions to the nine demands con
cerning the Trustees, SRI, and
Faculty Research any more).
What forms did this conscientious
concern take?The YAFers took
their stand against "fascism" by
cheering wildly at the mention of
Vietnamese casualties and by
blocking the rest of the 250 or so
students from entering the Ap
plied Electronics Lab.
I am not writing this to de
nounce "coercive tactics" nor am
I requesting that the administra
tion prosecute the YAF for dis
rupting the noon rally and block
ing the door at AEL. I do want to
point out, however, why the ac
tions of the YAF were to be ex
pected; and why it was to be ex
pected that not a single person
from either the Faculty Commit
tee on Disruption or from the
University administration, many
of whom were diligently and
swiftly taking names at the Trus
tee's meeting, bothered to take
the names of those students who
were blocking the doors at AEL.
Instead Wyman and Smith spent
their time inside AEL, hinting at
punishment for SDS members if
they didn't leave the building.
More specifically, I wish to
point out the great contradiction
between the rhetoric of Pitzer,
Wyman, Rambo, Hukari, etc., in
deploring all forms of violence;
and their actions with respect to
violence. The articulated neutral
ity-in defense of freedom of these

faculty, administrators, and stu
dents (and many more like them)
has been shown on this occasion
as on many others to be nothing
more than liberal bullshit. The
kind of freedom they desire may
be nothing more than freedom
from effective opposition to a vio
lent status quo.
This status quo includes the
War in Vietnam, which men like
Roger Lewis (chrmn., General
Dynamics) and William Rambo
(military electronics research and
Defense Dept. Boards) support
materially; this means SRl's chem
ical and biological warfare re
search and their counter-insur
gency center in Thailand; this
means Turstee's corporations in
Southeast Asis and Latin America,
where the need for a "good invest
ment climate and economic stabil
ity" necessitates the establishment
and maintenance of oppressive
military dictatorships (Thailand,
for example) which ignore the
basic social needs and human
rights of millions of Third World
people. US responsibility for pov
erty, squalor, disease, and illiter
acy is an act of violence equally as
great as the B-52s bombing Viet
Nam.
These people don't oppose vio
lence or violent tactics on princi
ple. They opposed SDS's "violent
(?) disruption" of the Trustees'
meeting because they oppose the
nine demands and all they stand
for (these demands are just the
first step toward disengaging Stan
ford from the violence going on in
Southeast Asia and the Third
World). Their use of a supposedly
neutral demonstration policy and
their constant reference to cam
pus referenda against coercion
simply isolate Stanford people
from the rest of humanity and of
diver the issue from the concern
over the great coercion and hu
man suffering in the "outside"
world, a violence that Stanford
now actively supports. My request
to Hewlett, Lewis, Pitzer, et al., is
not to prosecute the YAF, but in
stead to tell everyone where they
really stand concerning Stanford
research—And that's my request
to you. Where do you stand on
the nine demands? Where do you
stand on the violence in Southeast
Asia?

• Moderates: Beware Of YAF
Editor, THE DAILY:
The Young Americans for
Freedom? By their support of the

war, and SRI research aiding that
war, they do not grant the Viet
namese people the freedom to
live. In addition, Wednesday's per
formance should have made it
clear to all that the members of
the group are not the defenders of
civil liberties that they would like
us to believe.
The attempt of an ultra-right
wing group to equate SDS with
Hilter's Nazis is a ludicrous ges
ture designed to draw attention
away from their own positions
and ideology. This is the group
that tried to rally the "moder
ates" under its banner? Moder
ates, beware!

• Hippie As Conformist
Editor, THE DAILY:
Do you know what a hippie is?
The hippie slavishly cringes before
theopinions of other people who
have dropped out from our soci
ety. He wants their approval and
acceptance. His craven desire to
belong, his desperate search for
identity with other humans leads
him to incredible filth, immoral
ity, long hair, beads, psychedelic
clothing, and other obscene ac
coutrements and paraphernalia.
So, in his professed non-conform
ity, he is actually a classic con
formist. Its only a matter of
which group of people comprise
his authority.
A man in the military isn't so
dimwitted. He knows who his
authority is—from the platoon
sergeant right on up to his ultimate
commander-in-chief, the President
of the United States. He knows

his dress, haircut, work habits,
uniform, and whole being must
conform to the dictates of that
authority which governs his life.
But few others, outside the mili
tary, know who their authority is.
Do you?

• Biafra Aid Worthwhile
Editor, THE DAIL\ :
Were all the funds collected for
Biafran/Nigerian relief during this
week going to unilaterally detract
from money which was conceiv
ably on its way to the World
Health Organization or even to
the Stanford Population and En
vironment Forum, the question of
funds going to long-range plan
ning, research and education vs.
funds to as specific and immediate
a need as this would be much
more at issue here.
It might be hoped, however,
that giving to a fund which would
help to alleviate a small part of
much immediate suffering —some-
thing as basic as starvation—would
not prevent a person from giving
greater support to plan against
desperate situations in the future;
this might in fact stimulate a larg
er involvement in human con
cerns. Urging not to support
drives for relief is not to raise
funds for planning, for research.
Planning and research are with
out a doubt the more "worthy" in
a strictly utilitarian sense; long
range goals are generally more im
portant than limited objectives.
We too would like to help the
whole world, and realize that
whatever small part of the suffer
ing is alleviated through this drive
will be only a drop in the bucket.
But here is something that can be
done now—and an all-or-nothing
approach is simplistic. At least it
is a drop of the Stanford reservoir
that will not have simply evapor
ated.
Nothing at all will be done if
an awareness of the basic nature
of the problem is not aroused—if

the gap between the starving peo
ple now or in the future and an
American's experience is not
somehow empathetically bridge
able. In addition to an immediate
objective of raising money for re
lief, it is definitely one of the
goals of conducting a fast to pro
vide an opportunity to come to an
awareness of the actual problem,
beyond dropping a quarter or dol
lar in a collection can for "those
less fortunate than we."
We too would like to help the
whole world, but you need clouds
to see if you want rain.
STANFORD COMM. FOR
BIA FRAN/NIGERIAN RELIEF
• Republicans Attack Letter
Editor, THE DAILY:
In response to Marshall Hop
per's letter of yesterday, we
would like to clarify a few mis
conceptions and items of misin
formation.

It is not our purpose to extend
the debate over Wednesday's
activities or to participate in re
writing the occurrence to the
satisfaction of any one special
action group.
As Mr. Hopper suggests, Stan
ford students are indeed "in
censed." It is precisely for this
reason that the Young Republi
cans (YR's) and the Young Ameri
cans for Freedom (YAF) organ
ized Wednesday's show of force.
It is disconcerting for us to see
such action tagged as use of force.
First, the counter-demon
stration, as organized by the YR's
and YAF was intended to be
peaceful and nonviolent. And de
spite the heat generated in the
confrontation it remained that
way during the entire afternoon.
In order to insure that vio
lence, such as marred the last
Trustee's meeting, .would not
again be ignored by the campus
community, there were three
photographers on hand to record
any potential trouble.
The fact that the YR's and
YAF had a lawyer on hand to
brief the initial 15 participants be
forehand of their rights and to
specifically counsel against any
willful disruption of the rally
should underscore the good inten
tions of the "counter
revolutionaries."
Second, as The Daily's news
story correctly pointed out, Prof.
William Rambo, director of the
A pplied Electronics Laboratory
(A EL), ordered employees to
keep students out of the building.
Since the building was essen
tially closed, evidence as to how
"self-styled Establishment guards
blocked the door" is lacking.
In fact, on two occasions, the
group in front of the main door
opened ranks to allow SDS mem
bers to walk to the door. Only
two students availed themselves of
the opportunity.
Third, while the group yelled
and chanted against SDS, in no in
stance was an attempt made to
"shout down and bodily overrun
the SDS speakers."
In the interest of providing
more functional sound equip
ment, in fact, one YAF member
even volunteered to fix the SDS's
faulty loudspeaker.
Fourth, Harvey Hukari never
spoke during the afternoon with
Dean of Student Joel Smith.
Once again, the Daily correctly
noted that responsibility for en
forcement of the recently-adopted
regulations against campus dis
ruptions lies with the Faculty Ad
visory Committee on Campus dis

turbances, and not with Dean
Smith as Mr. Hopper suggested.
Finally, conversations among
participants after the rally fail to
offer any clue as to the nature of
an alleged "disgusting remark re
ferring to one of the speakers'
racial background and Nazi
ovens."
In reality, it was Leonard
Siegel of SDS who brought up the
subject of Nazi brutality. The re
sponse of the crowd, which Mr.
Siegel never answered, was why he
indeed continued to utilize the
tactics of a movement he is so
vehemently opposed to.
It is perhaps indicative of the
lack of dialogue that went on
Wednesday that Mr. Siegel did not
notice that the student carrying a
picket with Hitler's picture on it
was Jewish,
Stanford University has long
enough heard the student voices
in the Old Union courtyard and
on White Memorial Plaza. It is
high time that a few more voices
were heard on joint student
faculty committees and in the up
coming deliberations over SES
proposals.

• My Mother Told Me
Editor, THE DAILY:
My mother always warned
me—if you don't want to look
silly, don't say anything to the
Stanford Daily.
The statements attributed to
me in the Jan. 29 issue are, at
best, a grotesque distortion of
parts of a dinner conversation,
hardly a quotable interview. Your
use of quotation marks is mislead
ing and completely unwarranted.
This is a small matter in an un
important article but the impli
cations are disturbing. Is this sort
of reporting typical? When the
clarity of communication through
the Daily is important, do you do
any better than this?
DENNIS BURKE

• Glad To Have Yelled
Editor, THE DAILY:
At the SDS rally I was one of
the guys who was yelling at the
SDS along with the YAF. A girl,
who was apparently from SDS,
told me that she hoped I get killed
in Vietnam. She may or may not
be interested to know that, if and
when I go to Vietnam, I'll be de
fending the freedom not only of
the SoutfTVietnamese but, in an
indirect way, of all the people in
the Free World. And that includes
her.
One note of clarification. A
person I talked with (better make
that yelled with) seemed to think
that there is a close analogy to the
Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia
and our presence in Vietnam. To
that person I'd like to ask two
questions: 1) how many Viet
namese soldiers are fighting side
by side with us? and 2) how many
Czechs or Slavaks helped the
Russians occupy their own coun
try?
One more thing. AsT was eat
ing at Lagunita that night, an SDS
member announced that there was
going to be a meeting in Granada
Lounge to discuss SDS tactics. It
wasn't till then that I was sud
denly glad I had yelled at the
rally. The SDS, after being vic
timized by their own tactics, da
cided that maybe those tactics
needed a little discussion. They
probably won't moderate much if
at all, but at least I helped make
them stop and think.

• SDS Commotion
Editor, THE DAILY:
In view of the great commo
tion and controversy arising from
the recent activities of the SDS, I
think it important that the partic
ular type of "civil disobedience"
which its members practice be put
into proper perspective. I direct
this letter especially to SDS mem
bers and to any others who would
imitate their tactics.
First, I submit that, although
few people categorically renounce
civil disobedience as a means of
achieving justice, most find it
cheapened by its use as a source
of political power. The "civil dis
obedience" practiced by the SDS
has none of the nobility of acting
out of conscience; rather, it is the
perversion of an ideal for the sake
of expediency.
Second, civil disobedience car
ries the assumption that he who
practices it willingly brings upon
himself all consequences provided
for in the law. Someone not wil
ling to accept these consequences
often defeats his original intention
by inviting speculation that he has
acted out of selfish or other per
sonal interests. Evidently, this
kind of speculation has gone a
long way towards destroying
whatever sympathy SDS has had
at Stanford.
Third, I must point out that
those who would violate laws to
win rights they are now denied
should stop to consider how those
rights can be preserved in a soci
ety where their opponents are free
to follow the same course.
Finally, I would like to address
myself specifically to those who
feel that the decadence of society
compels them to participate in
violent acts of civil disobedience:
If you really want to restructure
society, then, unfortunately, you
must be prepared to be patient.
This realization of the need for
patience in no way diminishes the
importance and the urgency of
the problems we face; it merely
specifies the most effective way of
solving them. Truly permanent
gains always take time and patient
effort. If, on the other hand, you
are interested in personal gratifica
tion, then you may act with im
patience, but you may find that
your "gains" disappear as quickly
as your power.

• Signs And Cheers
Editor, THE DAILY:
I'm afraid I wasn't able to read
last Wednesday's Daily (you un
derstand I am so busy I rarely get
a chance to read anything but
what I might write) and just
didn't have the feel of what was
going to happen around Quad that
day. What a surprise it was then,
when my ears perked, so sensitive
they are, as the nostalgically fam
iliar sounds of a rally floated
through the air. Oh, and then the
signs and the cheers and even the
starting lineups were there too.
But I don't remember the uni
forms. Oh well, I can just as easily
forget the lack of uniforms.
WE TOLD YOU SO, Daily.
After all, who was it, that said Big
Game was out of place here at
Stanford? Little hasty perhaps,
aren't you? Why don't you speak
for the majority of the students,

uh? Face the facts for a change.
Its where its happening.

Mulberry Street
Prof Rejoices At Statement
Editor, THE DAILY:
Your readers will undoubtedly
join me in rejoicing at President
Pitzer's reaffirmation, in response
to the SDS demands, of Stan
ford's long-standing policy of
freedom of research. It is because
of this policy that important
members of the University admin
istration, although they personally
would not engage in classified re
search, have pledged themselves to
protect the rights of others, who
so choose, to engage in mission
oriented- research of military sig
nificance.
This announcement comes at a
propitious time for me. I have re
cently been in touch with the
Guevara Foundation located, ap
parently for tax purposes, in
Guinea. This foundation is inter
ested in sponsoring objective,
basic research on alternative stra
tegies for the disruption of com
plex, modern industrial systems.
Classification will not be a prob
lem as it is the policy of the
foundation to encourage the most
widespread dissemination of re
search results.
The project, happily, is intel
lectually challenging and of theo
retical significance. Are modern
industrial systems best disrupted
by sabatoge of end-product fac
tories? Are transportation systems
the weakest link in the system? Or
would "taking out" components
factories be the "least-cost solu
tion" to the problem? Systems
analysis, simulation, gaming, oper
ation research, linear program
ming, statistical decision theory
and benefit-cost analysis will all
have to be employed in the study
since it will be necessary to com
pare the relative utility of a large
number of alternative solutions to
the problem. As principal investi
gator, my position will naturally
be one of ethical neutrality. I have
no idea whether the findings will
be of practical value, or if so to
whom, but in any event those
questions are hardly of concern to

It is University policy to em
ploy graduate students in connec
tion with faculty research. Given
the political complexion of the
present group of political science

graduate students, I anticipate no
problem in securing an adequate
number of research assistants.
With luck I may even woo back
one of my last year's teaching as
sistants who is now in Cuba for an
informational visit.
Administration approval of re
search proposals is required at
Stanford, but under our policy of
freedom of research I am sure this
will not be difficult to obtain.

• YAF's Tactics Questioned
Editor, THE DAIL\ :
Wednesday a number of Young
Americans for Freedom members
turned out at the SDS Open For

vent their anger over the SDS's
"gestapo-like tactics" and show
their support for 'freedom'. This
is an issue which should be dealt
with, since the controversy over
SDS tactics seems to be the chief
concern of Stanford public opin

What forms did this conscientious
concern take?The YAFers took
their stand against "fascism" by
cheering wildly at the mention of
Vietnamese casualties and by
blocking the rest of the 250 or so
students from entering the Ap
plied Electronics Lab.
I am not writing this to de
nounce "coercive tactics" nor am
I requesting that the administra
tion prosecute the YAF for dis
rupting the noon rally and block
ing the door at AEL. I do want to
point out, however, why the ac
tions of the YAF were to be ex
pected; and why it was to be ex
pected that not a single person
from either the Faculty Commit
tee on Disruption or from the
University administration, many
of whom were diligently and
swiftly taking names at the Trus
tee's meeting, bothered to take
the names of those students who
were blocking the doors at AEL.
Instead Wyman and Smith spent
their time inside AEL, hinting at
punishment for SDS members if
they didn't leave the building.
More specifically, I wish to
point out the great contradiction
between the rhetoric of Pitzer,
Wyman, Rambo, Hukari, etc., in
deploring all forms of violence;
and their actions with respect to
violence. The articulated neutral
ity-in defense of freedom of these

faculty, administrators, and stu

has been shown on this occasion
as on many others to be nothing
more than liberal bullshit. The
kind of freedom they desire may
be nothing more than freedom
from effective opposition to a vio
lent status quo.
This status quo includes the
War in Vietnam, which men like
Roger Lewis (chrmn., General
Dynamics) and William Rambo
(military electronics research and
Defense Dept. Boards) support
materially; this means SRl's chem
ical and biological warfare re
search and their counter-insur
gency center in Thailand; this
means Turstee's corporations in
Southeast Asis and Latin America,
where the need for a "good invest

and maintenance of oppressive
military dictatorships (Thailand,
for example) which ignore the
basic social needs and human
rights of millions of Third World
people. US responsibility for pov
erty, squalor, disease, and illiter
acy is an act of violence equally as
great as the B-52s bombing Viet
Nam.
These people don't oppose vio
lence or violent tactics on princi
ple. They opposed SDS's "violent
(?) disruption" of the Trustees'
meeting because they oppose the
nine demands and all they stand
for (these demands are just the
first step toward disengaging Stan
ford from the violence going on in
Southeast Asia and the Third
World). Their use of a supposedly
neutral demonstration policy and
their constant reference to cam
pus referenda against coercion
simply isolate Stanford people
from the rest of humanity and of
diver the issue from the concern
over the great coercion and hu
man suffering in the "outside"
world, a violence that Stanford
now actively supports. My request
to Hewlett, Lewis, Pitzer, et al., is
not to prosecute the YAF, but in
stead to tell everyone where they
really stand concerning Stanford
research—And that's my request
to you. Where do you stand on
the nine demands? Where do you
stand on the violence in Southeast
Asia?

sponse of the crowd, which Mr.
Siegel never answered, was why he
indeed continued to utilize the
tactics of a movement he is so
vehemently opposed to.
It is perhaps indicative of the
lack of dialogue that went on
Wednesday that Mr. Siegel did not
notice that the student carrying a
picket with Hitler's picture on it
was Jewish,
Stanford University has long
enough heard the student voices
in the Old Union courtyard and
on White Memorial Plaza. It is
high time that a few more voices
were heard on joint student
faculty committees and in the up
coming deliberations over SES
proposals.

• My Mother Told Me
Editor, THE DAILY:
My mother always warned
me—if you don't want to look
silly, don't say anything to the
Stanford Daily.
The statements attributed to
me in the Jan. 29 issue are, at
best, a grotesque distortion of
parts of a dinner conversation,
hardly a quotable interview. Your
use of quotation marks is mislead
ing and completely unwarranted.
This is a small matter in an un
important article but the impli
cations are disturbing. Is this sort
of reporting typical? When the
clarity of communication through
the Daily is important, do you do
any better than this?

• Glad To Have Yelled
Editor, THE DAILY:
At the SDS rally I was one of
the guys who was yelling at the
SDS along with the YAF. A girl,
who was apparently from SDS,
told me that she hoped I get killed
in Vietnam. She may or may not
be interested to know that, if and
when I go to Vietnam, I'll be de
fending the freedom not only of
the SoutfTVietnamese but, in an
indirect way, of all the people in
the Free World. And that includes
her.
One note of clarification. A
person I talked with (better make
that yelled with) seemed to think
that there is a close analogy to the
Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia
and our presence in Vietnam. To
that person I'd like to ask two
questions: 1) how many Viet
namese soldiers are fighting side
by side with us? and 2) how many
Czechs or Slavaks helped the
Russians occupy their own coun
try?
One more thing. AsT was eat
ing at Lagunita that night, an SDS
member announced that there was
going to be a meeting in Granada
Lounge to discuss SDS tactics. It
wasn't till then that I was sud
denly glad I had yelled at the
rally. The SDS, after being vic
timized by their own tactics, da
cided that maybe those tactics
needed a little discussion. They
probably won't moderate much if
at all, but at least I helped make
them stop and think.

• SDS Commotion
Editor, THE DAILY:
In view of the great commo
tion and controversy arising from
the recent activities of the SDS, I
think it important that the partic
ular type of "civil disobedience"
which its members practice be put
into proper perspective. I direct
this letter especially to SDS mem
bers and to any others who would
imitate their tactics.
First, I submit that, although
few people categorically renounce
civil disobedience as a means of
achieving justice, most find it
cheapened by its use as a source
of political power. The "civil dis
obedience" practiced by the SDS
has none of the nobility of acting
out of conscience; rather, it is the
perversion of an ideal for the sake
of expediency.
Second, civil disobedience car
ries the assumption that he who
practices it willingly brings upon
himself all consequences provided
for in the law. Someone not wil
ling to accept these consequences
often defeats his original intention
by inviting speculation that he has
acted out of selfish or other per
sonal interests. Evidently, this
kind of speculation has gone a
long way towards destroying
whatever sympathy SDS has had
at Stanford.
Third, I must point out that
those who would violate laws to
win rights they are now denied
should stop to consider how those
rights can be preserved in a soci
ety where their opponents are free
to follow the same course.
Finally, I would like to address
myself specifically to those who
feel that the decadence of society
compels them to participate in
violent acts of civil disobedience:
If you really want to restructure
society, then, unfortunately, you
must be prepared to be patient.
This realization of the need for
patience in no way diminishes the
importance and the urgency of
the problems we face; it merely
specifies the most effective way of
solving them. Truly permanent
gains always take time and patient
effort. If, on the other hand, you
are interested in personal gratifica
tion, then you may act with im
patience, but you may find that
your "gains" disappear as quickly
as your power.

• Signs And Cheers
Editor, THE DAILY:
I'm afraid I wasn't able to read
last Wednesday's Daily (you un
derstand I am so busy I rarely get
a chance to read anything but
what I might write) and just
didn't have the feel of what was
going to happen around Quad that
day. What a surprise it was then,
when my ears perked, so sensitive
they are, as the nostalgically fam
iliar sounds of a rally floated
through the air. Oh, and then the
signs and the cheers and even the
starting lineups were there too.
But I don't remember the uni
forms. Oh well, I can just as easily
forget the lack of uniforms.
WE TOLD YOU SO, Daily.
After all, who was it, that said Big
Game was out of place here at
Stanford? Little hasty perhaps,
aren't you? Why don't you speak
for the majority of the students,

uh? Face the facts for a change.
Its where its happening.

Mulberry Street
Prof Rejoices At Statement
Editor, THE DAILY:
Your readers will undoubtedly
join me in rejoicing at President
Pitzer's reaffirmation, in response
to the SDS demands, of Stan
ford's long-standing policy of
freedom of research. It is because
of this policy that important
members of the University admin
istration, although they personally
would not engage in classified re
search, have pledged themselves to
protect the rights of others, who
so choose, to engage in mission
oriented- research of military sig
nificance.
This announcement comes at a
propitious time for me. I have re
cently been in touch with the
Guevara Foundation located, ap
parently for tax purposes, in
Guinea. This foundation is inter
ested in sponsoring objective,
basic research on alternative stra
tegies for the disruption of com
plex, modern industrial systems.
Classification will not be a prob
lem as it is the policy of the
foundation to encourage the most
widespread dissemination of re
search results.
The project, happily, is intel
lectually challenging and of theo
retical significance. Are modern
industrial systems best disrupted
by sabatoge of end-product fac
tories? Are transportation systems
the weakest link in the system? Or
would "taking out" components
factories be the "least-cost solu
tion" to the problem? Systems
analysis, simulation, gaming, oper
ation research, linear program
ming, statistical decision theory
and benefit-cost analysis will all
have to be employed in the study
since it will be necessary to com
pare the relative utility of a large
number of alternative solutions to
the problem. As principal investi
gator, my position will naturally
be one of ethical neutrality. I have
no idea whether the findings will
be of practical value, or if so to
whom, but in any event those
questions are hardly of concern to
me as a scholar.
It is University policy to em
ploy graduate students in connec
tion with faculty research. Given
the political complexion of the
present group of political science

graduate students, I anticipate no
problem in securing an adequate
number of research assistants.
With luck I may even woo back
one of my last year's teaching as
sistants who is now in Cuba for an
informational visit.
Administration approval of re
search proposals is required at
Stanford, but under our policy of
freedom of research I am sure this
will not be difficult to obtain.

• YAF's Tactics Questioned
Editor, THE DAIL\ :
Wednesday a number of Young
Americans for Freedom members
turned out at the SDS Open For
um at the Old Union in order to
vent their anger over the SDS's
"gestapo-like tactics" and show
their support for 'freedom'. This
is an issue which should be dealt
with, since the controversy over
SDS tactics seems to be the chief
concern of Stanford public opin
ion (one hardly ever hears objec
tions to the nine demands con
cerning the Trustees, SRI, and
Faculty Research any more).
What forms did this conscientious
concern take?The YAFers took
their stand against "fascism" by
cheering wildly at the mention of
Vietnamese casualties and by
blocking the rest of the 250 or so
students from entering the Ap
plied Electronics Lab.
I am not writing this to de
nounce "coercive tactics" nor am
I requesting that the administra
tion prosecute the YAF for dis
rupting the noon rally and block
ing the door at AEL. I do want to
point out, however, why the ac
tions of the YAF were to be ex
pected; and why it was to be ex
pected that not a single person
from either the Faculty Commit
tee on Disruption or from the
University administration, many
of whom were diligently and
swiftly taking names at the Trus
tee's meeting, bothered to take
the names of those students who
were blocking the doors at AEL.
Instead Wyman and Smith spent
their time inside AEL, hinting at
punishment for SDS members if
they didn't leave the building.
More specifically, I wish to
point out the great contradiction
between the rhetoric of Pitzer,
Wyman, Rambo, Hukari, etc., in
deploring all forms of violence;
and their actions with respect to
violence. The articulated neutral
ity-in defense of freedom of these

faculty, administrators, and stu
dents (and many more like them)
has been shown on this occasion
as on many others to be nothing
more than liberal bullshit. The
kind of freedom they desire may
be nothing more than freedom
from effective opposition to a vio
lent status quo.
This status quo includes the
War in Vietnam, which men like
Roger Lewis (chrmn., General
Dynamics) and William Rambo
(military electronics research and
Defense Dept. Boards) support
materially; this means SRl's chem
ical and biological warfare re
search and their counter-insur
gency center in Thailand; this
means Turstee's corporations in
Southeast Asis and Latin America,
where the need for a "good invest
ment climate and economic stabil
ity" necessitates the establishment
and maintenance of oppressive
military dictatorships (Thailand,
for example) which ignore the
basic social needs and human
rights of millions of Third World
people. US responsibility for pov
erty, squalor, disease, and illiter
acy is an act of violence equally as
great as the B-52s bombing Viet
Nam.
These people don't oppose vio
lence or violent tactics on princi
ple. They opposed SDS's "violent
(?) disruption" of the Trustees'
meeting because they oppose the
nine demands and all they stand
for (these demands are just the
first step toward disengaging Stan
ford from the violence going on in
Southeast Asia and the Third
World). Their use of a supposedly
neutral demonstration policy and
their constant reference to cam
pus referenda against coercion
simply isolate Stanford people
from the rest of humanity and of
diver the issue from the concern
over the great coercion and hu
man suffering in the "outside"
world, a violence that Stanford
now actively supports. My request
to Hewlett, Lewis, Pitzer, et al., is
not to prosecute the YAF, but in
stead to tell everyone where they
really stand concerning Stanford
research—And that's my request
to you. Where do you stand on
the nine demands? Where do you
stand on the violence in Southeast
Asia?
MARC WEISS
• Moderates: Beware Of YAF
Editor, THE DAILY:
The Young Americans for
Freedom? By their support of the

war, and SRI research aiding that
war, they do not grant the Viet
namese people the freedom to
live. In addition, Wednesday's per
formance should have made it
clear to all that the members of
the group are not the defenders of
civil liberties that they would like
us to believe.
The attempt of an ultra-right
wing group to equate SDS with
Hilter's Nazis is a ludicrous ges
ture designed to draw attention
away from their own positions
and ideology. This is the group
that tried to rally the "moder
ates" under its banner? Moder
ates, beware!
ELLIS KIRSCHENBAUM
• Hippie As Conformist
Editor, THE DAILY:
Do you know what a hippie is?
The hippie slavishly cringes before
theopinions of other people who
have dropped out from our soci
ety. He wants their approval and
acceptance. His craven desire to
belong, his desperate search for
identity with other humans leads
him to incredible filth, immoral
ity, long hair, beads, psychedelic
clothing, and other obscene ac
coutrements and paraphernalia.
So, in his professed non-conform
ity, he is actually a classic con
formist. Its only a matter of
which group of people comprise
his authority.
A man in the military isn't so
dimwitted. He knows who his
authority is—from the platoon
sergeant right on up to his ultimate
commander-in-chief, the President
of the United States. He knows

his dress, haircut, work habits,
uniform, and whole being must
conform to the dictates of that
authority which governs his life.
But few others, outside the mili
tary, know who their authority is.
Do you?

• Biafra Aid Worthwhile
Editor, THE DAIL\ :
Were all the funds collected for
Biafran/Nigerian relief during this
week going to unilaterally detract
from money which was conceiv
ably on its way to the World
Health Organization or even to
the Stanford Population and En
vironment Forum, the question of
funds going to long-range plan
ning, research and education vs.
funds to as specific and immediate
a need as this would be much
more at issue here.
It might be hoped, however,
that giving to a fund which would
help to alleviate a small part of
much immediate suffering —some-
thing as basic as starvation—would
not prevent a person from giving
greater support to plan against
desperate situations in the future;
this might in fact stimulate a larg
er involvement in human con
cerns. Urging not to support
drives for relief is not to raise
funds for planning, for research.
Planning and research are with
out a doubt the more "worthy" in
a strictly utilitarian sense; long
range goals are generally more im
portant than limited objectives.
We too would like to help the
whole world, and realize that
whatever small part of the suffer
ing is alleviated through this drive
will be only a drop in the bucket.
But here is something that can be
done now—and an all-or-nothing
approach is simplistic. At least it
is a drop of the Stanford reservoir
that will not have simply evapor
ated.
Nothing at all will be done if
an awareness of the basic nature
of the problem is not aroused—if

the gap between the starving peo
ple now or in the future and an
American's experience is not
somehow empathetically bridge
able. In addition to an immediate
objective of raising money for re
lief, it is definitely one of the
goals of conducting a fast to pro
vide an opportunity to come to an
awareness of the actual problem,
beyond dropping a quarter or dol
lar in a collection can for "those
less fortunate than we."
We too would like to help the
whole world, but you need clouds
to see if you want rain.
STANFORD COMM. FOR
BIA FRAN/NIGERIAN RELIEF
• Republicans Attack Letter
Editor, THE DAILY:
In response to Marshall Hop
per's letter of yesterday, we
would like to clarify a few mis
conceptions and items of misin
formation.

It is not our purpose to extend
the debate over Wednesday's
activities or to participate in re
writing the occurrence to the
satisfaction of any one special
action group.
As Mr. Hopper suggests, Stan
ford students are indeed "in
censed." It is precisely for this
reason that the Young Republi
cans (YR's) and the Young Ameri
cans for Freedom (YAF) organ
ized Wednesday's show of force.
It is disconcerting for us to see
such action tagged as use of force.
First, the counter-demon
stration, as organized by the YR's
and YAF was intended to be
peaceful and nonviolent. And de
spite the heat generated in the
confrontation it remained that
way during the entire afternoon.
In order to insure that vio
lence, such as marred the last
Trustee's meeting, .would not
again be ignored by the campus
community, there were three
photographers on hand to record
any potential trouble.
The fact that the YR's and
YAF had a lawyer on hand to
brief the initial 15 participants be
forehand of their rights and to
specifically counsel against any
willful disruption of the rally
should underscore the good inten
tions of the "counter
revolutionaries."
Second, as The Daily's news
story correctly pointed out, Prof.
William Rambo, director of the
A pplied Electronics Laboratory
(A EL), ordered employees to
keep students out of the building.
Since the building was essen
tially closed, evidence as to how
"self-styled Establishment guards
blocked the door" is lacking.
In fact, on two occasions, the
group in front of the main door
opened ranks to allow SDS mem
bers to walk to the door. Only
two students availed themselves of
the opportunity.
Third, while the group yelled
and chanted against SDS, in no in
stance was an attempt made to
"shout down and bodily overrun
the SDS speakers."
In the interest of providing
more functional sound equip
ment, in fact, one YAF member
even volunteered to fix the SDS's
faulty loudspeaker.
Fourth, Harvey Hukari never
spoke during the afternoon with
Dean of Student Joel Smith.
Once again, the Daily correctly
noted that responsibility for en
forcement of the recently-adopted
regulations against campus dis
ruptions lies with the Faculty Ad
visory Committee on Campus dis

turbances, and not with Dean
Smith as Mr. Hopper suggested.
Finally, conversations among
participants after the rally fail to
offer any clue as to the nature of
an alleged "disgusting remark re
ferring to one of the speakers'
racial background and Nazi
ovens."
In reality, it was Leonard
Siegel of SDS who brought up the
subject of Nazi brutality. The re
sponse of the crowd, which Mr.
Siegel never answered, was why he
indeed continued to utilize the
tactics of a movement he is so
vehemently opposed to.
It is perhaps indicative of the
lack of dialogue that went on
Wednesday that Mr. Siegel did not
notice that the student carrying a
picket with Hitler's picture on it
was Jewish,
Stanford University has long
enough heard the student voices
in the Old Union courtyard and
on White Memorial Plaza. It is
high time that a few more voices
were heard on joint student
faculty committees and in the up
coming deliberations over SES
proposals.

• YAF's Tactics Questioned
Editor, THE DAIL\ :
Wednesday a number of Young
Americans for Freedom members
turned out at the SDS Open For
um at the Old Union in order to
vent their anger over the SDS's
"gestapo-like tactics" and show
their support for 'freedom'. This
is an issue which should be dealt
with, since the controversy over
SDS tactics seems to be the chief
concern of Stanford public opin
ion (one hardly ever hears objec
tions to the nine demands con
cerning the Trustees, SRI, and
Faculty Research any more).
What forms did this conscientious
concern take?The YAFers took
their stand against "fascism" by
cheering wildly at the mention of
Vietnamese casualties and by
blocking the rest of the 250 or so
students from entering the Ap
plied Electronics Lab.
I am not writing this to de
nounce "coercive tactics" nor am
I requesting that the administra
tion prosecute the YAF for dis
rupting the noon rally and block
ing the door at AEL. I do want to
point out, however, why the ac
tions of the YAF were to be ex
pected; and why it was to be ex
pected that not a single person
from either the Faculty Commit
tee on Disruption or from the
University administration, many
of whom were diligently and
swiftly taking names at the Trus
tee's meeting, bothered to take
the names of those students who
were blocking the doors at AEL.
Instead Wyman and Smith spent
their time inside AEL, hinting at
punishment for SDS members if
they didn't leave the building.
More specifically, I wish to
point out the great contradiction
between the rhetoric of Pitzer,
Wyman, Rambo, Hukari, etc., in
deploring all forms of violence;
and their actions with respect to
violence. The articulated neutral
ity-in defense of freedom of these

faculty, administrators, and stu
dents (and many more like them)
has been shown on this occasion
as on many others to be nothing
more than liberal bullshit. The
kind of freedom they desire may
be nothing more than freedom
from effective opposition to a vio
lent status quo.
This status quo includes the
War in Vietnam, which men like
Roger Lewis (chrmn., General
Dynamics) and William Rambo
(military electronics research and
Defense Dept. Boards) support
materially; this means SRl's chem
ical and biological warfare re
search and their counter-insur
gency center in Thailand; this
means Turstee's corporations in
Southeast Asis and Latin America,
where the need for a "good invest

and maintenance of oppressive
military dictatorships (Thailand,
for example) which ignore the
basic social needs and human
rights of millions of Third World
people. US responsibility for pov
erty, squalor, disease, and illiter
acy is an act of violence equally as
great as the B-52s bombing Viet
Nam.
These people don't oppose vio
lence or violent tactics on princi
ple. They opposed SDS's "violent
(?) disruption" of the Trustees'
meeting because they oppose the
nine demands and all they stand
for (these demands are just the
first step toward disengaging Stan
ford from the violence going on in
Southeast Asia and the Third
World). Their use of a supposedly
neutral demonstration policy and
their constant reference to cam
pus referenda against coercion
simply isolate Stanford people
from the rest of humanity and of
diver the issue from the concern
over the great coercion and hu
man suffering in the "outside"
world, a violence that Stanford
now actively supports. My request
to Hewlett, Lewis, Pitzer, et al., is
not to prosecute the YAF, but in

really stand concerning Stanford
research—And that's my request
to you. Where do you stand on

• Moderates: Beware Of YAF
Editor, THE DAILY:
The Young Americans for
Freedom? By their support of the

war, and SRI research aiding that
war, they do not grant the Viet
namese people the freedom to
live. In addition, Wednesday's per
formance should have made it
clear to all that the members of
the group are not the defenders of
civil liberties that they would like
us to believe.
The attempt of an ultra-right
wing group to equate SDS with
Hilter's Nazis is a ludicrous ges
ture designed to draw attention
away from their own positions
and ideology. This is the group
that tried to rally the "moder
ates" under its banner? Moder
ates, beware!

• Hippie As Conformist
Editor, THE DAILY:
Do you know what a hippie is?
The hippie slavishly cringes before
theopinions of other people who
have dropped out from our soci
ety. He wants their approval and
acceptance. His craven desire to
belong, his desperate search for
identity with other humans leads
him to incredible filth, immoral
ity, long hair, beads, psychedelic
clothing, and other obscene ac
coutrements and paraphernalia.
So, in his professed non-conform
ity, he is actually a classic con
formist. Its only a matter of
which group of people comprise
his authority.
A man in the military isn't so
dimwitted. He knows who his
authority is—from the platoon
sergeant right on up to his ultimate
commander-in-chief, the President
of the United States. He knows

his dress, haircut, work habits,
uniform, and whole being must
conform to the dictates of that
authority which governs his life.
But few others, outside the mili
tary, know who their authority is.
Do you?

• Biafra Aid Worthwhile
Editor, THE DAIL\ :
Were all the funds collected for
Biafran/Nigerian relief during this
week going to unilaterally detract
from money which was conceiv
ably on its way to the World
Health Organization or even to
the Stanford Population and En
vironment Forum, the question of
funds going to long-range plan
ning, research and education vs.
funds to as specific and immediate
a need as this would be much
more at issue here.
It might be hoped, however,
that giving to a fund which would
help to alleviate a small part of
much immediate suffering —some-
thing as basic as starvation—would
not prevent a person from giving
greater support to plan against
desperate situations in the future;
this might in fact stimulate a larg
er involvement in human con
cerns. Urging not to support
drives for relief is not to raise
funds for planning, for research.
Planning and research are with
out a doubt the more "worthy" in
a strictly utilitarian sense; long
range goals are generally more im
portant than limited objectives.
We too would like to help the
whole world, and realize that
whatever small part of the suffer
ing is alleviated through this drive
will be only a drop in the bucket.
But here is something that can be
done now—and an all-or-nothing
approach is simplistic. At least it
is a drop of the Stanford reservoir
that will not have simply evapor
ated.
Nothing at all will be done if
an awareness of the basic nature
of the problem is not aroused—if

the gap between the starving peo
ple now or in the future and an
American's experience is not
somehow empathetically bridge
able. In addition to an immediate
objective of raising money for re
lief, it is definitely one of the
goals of conducting a fast to pro
vide an opportunity to come to an
awareness of the actual problem,
beyond dropping a quarter or dol
lar in a collection can for "those
less fortunate than we."
We too would like to help the
whole world, but you need clouds
to see if you want rain.
STANFORD COMM. FOR
BIA FRAN/NIGERIAN RELIEF
• Republicans Attack Letter
Editor, THE DAILY:
In response to Marshall Hop
per's letter of yesterday, we
would like to clarify a few mis
conceptions and items of misin
formation.

It is not our purpose to extend
the debate over Wednesday's
activities or to participate in re
writing the occurrence to the
satisfaction of any one special
action group.
As Mr. Hopper suggests, Stan
ford students are indeed "in
censed." It is precisely for this
reason that the Young Republi
cans (YR's) and the Young Ameri
cans for Freedom (YAF) organ
ized Wednesday's show of force.
It is disconcerting for us to see
such action tagged as use of force.
First, the counter-demon
stration, as organized by the YR's
and YAF was intended to be
peaceful and nonviolent. And de
spite the heat generated in the
confrontation it remained that
way during the entire afternoon.
In order to insure that vio
lence, such as marred the last
Trustee's meeting, .would not
again be ignored by the campus
community, there were three
photographers on hand to record
any potential trouble.
The fact that the YR's and
YAF had a lawyer on hand to
brief the initial 15 participants be
forehand of their rights and to
specifically counsel against any
willful disruption of the rally
should underscore the good inten
tions of the "counter
revolutionaries."
Second, as The Daily's news
story correctly pointed out, Prof.
William Rambo, director of the
A pplied Electronics Laboratory
(A EL), ordered employees to
keep students out of the building.
Since the building was essen
tially closed, evidence as to how
"self-styled Establishment guards
blocked the door" is lacking.
In fact, on two occasions, the
group in front of the main door
opened ranks to allow SDS mem
bers to walk to the door. Only
two students availed themselves of
the opportunity.
Third, while the group yelled
and chanted against SDS, in no in
stance was an attempt made to
"shout down and bodily overrun
the SDS speakers."
In the interest of providing
more functional sound equip
ment, in fact, one YAF member
even volunteered to fix the SDS's
faulty loudspeaker.
Fourth, Harvey Hukari never
spoke during the afternoon with
Dean of Student Joel Smith.
Once again, the Daily correctly
noted that responsibility for en
forcement of the recently-adopted
regulations against campus dis
ruptions lies with the Faculty Ad
visory Committee on Campus dis

turbances, and not with Dean
Smith as Mr. Hopper suggested.
Finally, conversations among
participants after the rally fail to
offer any clue as to the nature of
an alleged "disgusting remark re
ferring to one of the speakers'
racial background and Nazi
ovens."
In reality, it was Leonard
Siegel of SDS who brought up the
subject of Nazi brutality. The re
sponse of the crowd, which Mr.
Siegel never answered, was why he
indeed continued to utilize the
tactics of a movement he is so
vehemently opposed to.
It is perhaps indicative of the
lack of dialogue that went on
Wednesday that Mr. Siegel did not
notice that the student carrying a
picket with Hitler's picture on it
was Jewish,
Stanford University has long
enough heard the student voices
in the Old Union courtyard and
on White Memorial Plaza. It is
high time that a few more voices
were heard on joint student
faculty committees and in the up
coming deliberations over SES
proposals.

• My Mother Told Me
Editor, THE DAILY:
My mother always warned
me—if you don't want to look
silly, don't say anything to the
Stanford Daily.
The statements attributed to
me in the Jan. 29 issue are, at
best, a grotesque distortion of
parts of a dinner conversation,
hardly a quotable interview. Your
use of quotation marks is mislead
ing and completely unwarranted.
This is a small matter in an un
important article but the impli

of reporting typical? When the
clarity of communication through
the Daily is important, do you do
any better than this?

• Glad To Have Yelled
Editor, THE DAILY:
At the SDS rally I was one of
the guys who was yelling at the
SDS along with the YAF. A girl,
who was apparently from SDS,
told me that she hoped I get killed
in Vietnam. She may or may not
be interested to know that, if and
when I go to Vietnam, I'll be de
fending the freedom not only of
the SoutfTVietnamese but, in an
indirect way, of all the people in
the Free World. And that includes
her.
One note of clarification. A
person I talked with (better make
that yelled with) seemed to think
that there is a close analogy to the
Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia
and our presence in Vietnam. To
that person I'd like to ask two
questions: 1) how many Viet
namese soldiers are fighting side
by side with us? and 2) how many
Czechs or Slavaks helped the
Russians occupy their own coun
try?
One more thing. AsT was eat
ing at Lagunita that night, an SDS
member announced that there was
going to be a meeting in Granada
Lounge to discuss SDS tactics. It
wasn't till then that I was sud
denly glad I had yelled at the
rally. The SDS, after being vic
timized by their own tactics, da
cided that maybe those tactics
needed a little discussion. They
probably won't moderate much if
at all, but at least I helped make
them stop and think.

• SDS Commotion
Editor, THE DAILY:
In view of the great commo
tion and controversy arising from
the recent activities of the SDS, I
think it important that the partic
ular type of "civil disobedience"
which its members practice be put
into proper perspective. I direct
this letter especially to SDS mem
bers and to any others who would
imitate their tactics.
First, I submit that, although
few people categorically renounce
civil disobedience as a means of
achieving justice, most find it
cheapened by its use as a source
of political power. The "civil dis
obedience" practiced by the SDS
has none of the nobility of acting
out of conscience; rather, it is the
perversion of an ideal for the sake
of expediency.
Second, civil disobedience car
ries the assumption that he who
practices it willingly brings upon
himself all consequences provided
for in the law. Someone not wil
ling to accept these consequences
often defeats his original intention
by inviting speculation that he has
acted out of selfish or other per
sonal interests. Evidently, this
kind of speculation has gone a
long way towards destroying
whatever sympathy SDS has had
at Stanford.
Third, I must point out that
those who would violate laws to
win rights they are now denied
should stop to consider how those
rights can be preserved in a soci
ety where their opponents are free
to follow the same course.
Finally, I would like to address
myself specifically to those who
feel that the decadence of society
compels them to participate in
violent acts of civil disobedience:
If you really want to restructure
society, then, unfortunately, you
must be prepared to be patient.
This realization of the need for
patience in no way diminishes the
importance and the urgency of
the problems we face; it merely
specifies the most effective way of
solving them. Truly permanent
gains always take time and patient
effort. If, on the other hand, you
are interested in personal gratifica
tion, then you may act with im
patience, but you may find that
your "gains" disappear as quickly
as your power.

• Signs And Cheers
Editor, THE DAILY:
I'm afraid I wasn't able to read

didn't have the feel of what was
going to happen around Quad that

when my ears perked, so sensitive
they are, as the nostalgically fam

through the air. Oh, and then the
signs and the cheers and even the
starting lineups were there too.
But I don't remember the uni
forms. Oh well, I can just as easily
forget the lack of uniforms.
WE TOLD YOU SO, Daily.
After all, who was it, that said Big
Game was out of place here at

Mulberry Street
Prof Rejoices At Statement
Editor, THE DAILY:
Your readers will undoubtedly
join me in rejoicing at President
Pitzer's reaffirmation, in response
to the SDS demands, of Stan
ford's long-standing policy of
freedom of research. It is because
of this policy that important
members of the University admin
istration, although they personally
would not engage in classified re
search, have pledged themselves to
protect the rights of others, who
so choose, to engage in mission
oriented- research of military sig
nificance.
This announcement comes at a
propitious time for me. I have re
cently been in touch with the
Guevara Foundation located, ap
parently for tax purposes, in
Guinea. This foundation is inter
ested in sponsoring objective,
basic research on alternative stra
tegies for the disruption of com
plex, modern industrial systems.
Classification will not be a prob
lem as it is the policy of the
foundation to encourage the most
widespread dissemination of re
search results.
The project, happily, is intel
lectually challenging and of theo
retical significance. Are modern
industrial systems best disrupted
by sabatoge of end-product fac
tories? Are transportation systems
the weakest link in the system? Or
would "taking out" components
factories be the "least-cost solu
tion" to the problem? Systems
analysis, simulation, gaming, oper
ation research, linear program
ming, statistical decision theory
and benefit-cost analysis will all
have to be employed in the study
since it will be necessary to com
pare the relative utility of a large
number of alternative solutions to
the problem. As principal investi
gator, my position will naturally
be one of ethical neutrality. I have
no idea whether the findings will
be of practical value, or if so to
whom, but in any event those
questions are hardly of concern to
me as a scholar.
It is University policy to em
ploy graduate students in connec
tion with faculty research. Given
the political complexion of the
present group of political science

graduate students, I anticipate no
problem in securing an adequate
number of research assistants.
With luck I may even woo back
one of my last year's teaching as
sistants who is now in Cuba for an
informational visit.
Administration approval of re
search proposals is required at
Stanford, but under our policy of
freedom of research I am sure this
will not be difficult to obtain.

• YAF's Tactics Questioned
Editor, THE DAIL\ :
Wednesday a number of Young
Americans for Freedom members
turned out at the SDS Open For
um at the Old Union in order to
vent their anger over the SDS's
"gestapo-like tactics" and show
their support for 'freedom'. This
is an issue which should be dealt
with, since the controversy over
SDS tactics seems to be the chief
concern of Stanford public opin
ion (one hardly ever hears objec
tions to the nine demands con
cerning the Trustees, SRI, and
Faculty Research any more).
What forms did this conscientious
concern take?The YAFers took
their stand against "fascism" by
cheering wildly at the mention of
Vietnamese casualties and by
blocking the rest of the 250 or so
students from entering the Ap
plied Electronics Lab.
I am not writing this to de
nounce "coercive tactics" nor am
I requesting that the administra
tion prosecute the YAF for dis
rupting the noon rally and block
ing the door at AEL. I do want to
point out, however, why the ac
tions of the YAF were to be ex
pected; and why it was to be ex
pected that not a single person
from either the Faculty Commit
tee on Disruption or from the
University administration, many
of whom were diligently and
swiftly taking names at the Trus
tee's meeting, bothered to take
the names of those students who
were blocking the doors at AEL.
Instead Wyman and Smith spent
their time inside AEL, hinting at
punishment for SDS members if
they didn't leave the building.
More specifically, I wish to
point out the great contradiction
between the rhetoric of Pitzer,
Wyman, Rambo, Hukari, etc., in
deploring all forms of violence;
and their actions with respect to
violence. The articulated neutral
ity-in defense of freedom of these

faculty, administrators, and stu
dents (and many more like them)
has been shown on this occasion
as on many others to be nothing
more than liberal bullshit. The
kind of freedom they desire may
be nothing more than freedom
from effective opposition to a vio
lent status quo.
This status quo includes the
War in Vietnam, which men like
Roger Lewis (chrmn., General
Dynamics) and William Rambo
(military electronics research and
Defense Dept. Boards) support
materially; this means SRl's chem
ical and biological warfare re
search and their counter-insur
gency center in Thailand; this
means Turstee's corporations in
Southeast Asis and Latin America,
where the need for a "good invest
ment climate and economic stabil
ity" necessitates the establishment
and maintenance of oppressive
military dictatorships (Thailand,
for example) which ignore the
basic social needs and human
rights of millions of Third World
people. US responsibility for pov
erty, squalor, disease, and illiter
acy is an act of violence equally as
great as the B-52s bombing Viet
Nam.
These people don't oppose vio
lence or violent tactics on princi
ple. They opposed SDS's "violent
(?) disruption" of the Trustees'
meeting because they oppose the
nine demands and all they stand
for (these demands are just the
first step toward disengaging Stan
ford from the violence going on in
Southeast Asia and the Third
World). Their use of a supposedly
neutral demonstration policy and
their constant reference to cam
pus referenda against coercion
simply isolate Stanford people
from the rest of humanity and of
diver the issue from the concern
over the great coercion and hu
man suffering in the "outside"
world, a violence that Stanford
now actively supports. My request
to Hewlett, Lewis, Pitzer, et al., is
not to prosecute the YAF, but in
stead to tell everyone where they
really stand concerning Stanford
research—And that's my request
to you. Where do you stand on
the nine demands? Where do you
stand on the violence in Southeast
Asia?

Editor, THE DAILY:
I'm afraid I wasn't able to read
last Wednesday's Daily (you un
derstand I am so busy I rarely get
a chance to read anything but
what I might write) and just
didn't have the feel of what was
going to happen around Quad that
day. What a surprise it was then,
when my ears perked, so sensitive
they are, as the nostalgically fam
iliar sounds of a rally floated
through the air. Oh, and then the
signs and the cheers and even the
starting lineups were there too.
But I don't remember the uni
forms. Oh well, I can just as easily
forget the lack of uniforms.
WE TOLD YOU SO, Daily.
After all, who was it, that said Big
Game was out of place here at
Stanford? Little hasty perhaps,
aren't you? Why don't you speak
for the majority of the students,

uh? Face the facts for a change.
Its where its happening.

Prof Rejoices At Statement
Editor, THE DAILY:
Your readers will undoubtedly
join me in rejoicing at President
Pitzer's reaffirmation, in response
to the SDS demands, of Stan
ford's long-standing policy of
freedom of research. It is because
of this policy that important
members of the University admin
istration, although they personally
would not engage in classified re
search, have pledged themselves to
protect the rights of others, who
so choose, to engage in mission
oriented- research of military sig
nificance.
This announcement comes at a
propitious time for me. I have re
cently been in touch with the
Guevara Foundation located, ap
parently for tax purposes, in
Guinea. This foundation is inter
ested in sponsoring objective,
basic research on alternative stra
tegies for the disruption of com
plex, modern industrial systems.
Classification will not be a prob
lem as it is the policy of the
foundation to encourage the most
widespread dissemination of re
search results.
The project, happily, is intel
lectually challenging and of theo
retical significance. Are modern
industrial systems best disrupted
by sabatoge of end-product fac
tories? Are transportation systems
the weakest link in the system? Or
would "taking out" components
factories be the "least-cost solu
tion" to the problem? Systems
analysis, simulation, gaming, oper
ation research, linear program
ming, statistical decision theory
and benefit-cost analysis will all
have to be employed in the study
since it will be necessary to com
pare the relative utility of a large
number of alternative solutions to
the problem. As principal investi
gator, my position will naturally
be one of ethical neutrality. I have
no idea whether the findings will
be of practical value, or if so to
whom, but in any event those
questions are hardly of concern to
me as a scholar.
It is University policy to em
ploy graduate students in connec
tion with faculty research. Given
the political complexion of the
present group of political science

graduate students, I anticipate no
problem in securing an adequate
number of research assistants.
With luck I may even woo back
one of my last year's teaching as
sistants who is now in Cuba for an
informational visit.
Administration approval of re
search proposals is required at
Stanford, but under our policy of
freedom of research I am sure this
will not be difficult to obtain.

• YAF's Tactics Questioned
Editor, THE DAIL\ :
Wednesday a number of Young
Americans for Freedom members
turned out at the SDS Open For
um at the Old Union in order to
vent their anger over the SDS's
"gestapo-like tactics" and show
their support for 'freedom'. This
is an issue which should be dealt
with, since the controversy over
SDS tactics seems to be the chief
concern of Stanford public opin
ion (one hardly ever hears objec
tions to the nine demands con
cerning the Trustees, SRI, and
Faculty Research any more).
What forms did this conscientious
concern take?The YAFers took
their stand against "fascism" by
cheering wildly at the mention of
Vietnamese casualties and by
blocking the rest of the 250 or so
students from entering the Ap
plied Electronics Lab.
I am not writing this to de
nounce "coercive tactics" nor am
I requesting that the administra
tion prosecute the YAF for dis
rupting the noon rally and block
ing the door at AEL. I do want to
point out, however, why the ac
tions of the YAF were to be ex
pected; and why it was to be ex
pected that not a single person
from either the Faculty Commit
tee on Disruption or from the
University administration, many
of whom were diligently and
swiftly taking names at the Trus
tee's meeting, bothered to take
the names of those students who
were blocking the doors at AEL.
Instead Wyman and Smith spent
their time inside AEL, hinting at
punishment for SDS members if
they didn't leave the building.
More specifically, I wish to
point out the great contradiction
between the rhetoric of Pitzer,
Wyman, Rambo, Hukari, etc., in
deploring all forms of violence;
and their actions with respect to
violence. The articulated neutral
ity-in defense of freedom of these

faculty, administrators, and stu
dents (and many more like them)
has been shown on this occasion
as on many others to be nothing
more than liberal bullshit. The
kind of freedom they desire may
be nothing more than freedom
from effective opposition to a vio
lent status quo.
This status quo includes the
War in Vietnam, which men like
Roger Lewis (chrmn., General
Dynamics) and William Rambo
(military electronics research and
Defense Dept. Boards) support
materially; this means SRl's chem
ical and biological warfare re
search and their counter-insur
gency center in Thailand; this
means Turstee's corporations in
Southeast Asis and Latin America,
where the need for a "good invest
ment climate and economic stabil
ity" necessitates the establishment
and maintenance of oppressive
military dictatorships (Thailand,
for example) which ignore the
basic social needs and human
rights of millions of Third World
people. US responsibility for pov
erty, squalor, disease, and illiter
acy is an act of violence equally as
great as the B-52s bombing Viet
Nam.
These people don't oppose vio
lence or violent tactics on princi
ple. They opposed SDS's "violent
(?) disruption" of the Trustees'
meeting because they oppose the
nine demands and all they stand
for (these demands are just the
first step toward disengaging Stan
ford from the violence going on in
Southeast Asia and the Third
World). Their use of a supposedly
neutral demonstration policy and
their constant reference to cam
pus referenda against coercion
simply isolate Stanford people
from the rest of humanity and of
diver the issue from the concern
over the great coercion and hu
man suffering in the "outside"
world, a violence that Stanford
now actively supports. My request
to Hewlett, Lewis, Pitzer, et al., is
not to prosecute the YAF, but in
stead to tell everyone where they
really stand concerning Stanford
research—And that's my request
to you. Where do you stand on
the nine demands? Where do you
stand on the violence in Southeast
Asia?

• Moderates: Beware Of YAF
Editor, THE DAILY:
The Young Americans for
Freedom? By their support of the

war, and SRI research aiding that
war, they do not grant the Viet
namese people the freedom to
live. In addition, Wednesday's per
formance should have made it
clear to all that the members of
the group are not the defenders of
civil liberties that they would like
us to believe.
The attempt of an ultra-right
wing group to equate SDS with
Hilter's Nazis is a ludicrous ges
ture designed to draw attention
away from their own positions
and ideology. This is the group
that tried to rally the "moder
ates" under its banner? Moder
ates, beware!

• Hippie As Conformist
Editor, THE DAILY:
Do you know what a hippie is?
The hippie slavishly cringes before
theopinions of other people who
have dropped out from our soci
ety. He wants their approval and
acceptance. His craven desire to
belong, his desperate search for
identity with other humans leads
him to incredible filth, immoral
ity, long hair, beads, psychedelic
clothing, and other obscene ac
coutrements and paraphernalia.
So, in his professed non-conform
ity, he is actually a classic con
formist. Its only a matter of
which group of people comprise
his authority.
A man in the military isn't so
dimwitted. He knows who his
authority is—from the platoon
sergeant right on up to his ultimate
commander-in-chief, the President
of the United States. He knows

his dress, haircut, work habits,
uniform, and whole being must
conform to the dictates of that
authority which governs his life.
But few others, outside the mili
tary, know who their authority is.
Do you?

• Biafra Aid Worthwhile
Editor, THE DAIL\ :
Were all the funds collected for
Biafran/Nigerian relief during this
week going to unilaterally detract
from money which was conceiv
ably on its way to the World
Health Organization or even to
the Stanford Population and En
vironment Forum, the question of
funds going to long-range plan
ning, research and education vs.
funds to as specific and immediate
a need as this would be much
more at issue here.
It might be hoped, however,
that giving to a fund which would
help to alleviate a small part of
much immediate suffering —some-
thing as basic as starvation—would
not prevent a person from giving
greater support to plan against
desperate situations in the future;
this might in fact stimulate a larg
er involvement in human con
cerns. Urging not to support
drives for relief is not to raise
funds for planning, for research.
Planning and research are with
out a doubt the more "worthy" in
a strictly utilitarian sense; long
range goals are generally more im
portant than limited objectives.
We too would like to help the
whole world, and realize that
whatever small part of the suffer
ing is alleviated through this drive
will be only a drop in the bucket.
But here is something that can be
done now—and an all-or-nothing
approach is simplistic. At least it
is a drop of the Stanford reservoir
that will not have simply evapor
ated.
Nothing at all will be done if
an awareness of the basic nature
of the problem is not aroused—if

the gap between the starving peo
ple now or in the future and an
American's experience is not
somehow empathetically bridge
able. In addition to an immediate
objective of raising money for re
lief, it is definitely one of the
goals of conducting a fast to pro
vide an opportunity to come to an
awareness of the actual problem,
beyond dropping a quarter or dol
lar in a collection can for "those
less fortunate than we."
We too would like to help the
whole world, but you need clouds
to see if you want rain.
STANFORD COMM. FOR
BIA FRAN/NIGERIAN RELIEF
• Republicans Attack Letter
Editor, THE DAILY:
In response to Marshall Hop
per's letter of yesterday, we
would like to clarify a few mis
conceptions and items of misin
formation.

It is not our purpose to extend
the debate over Wednesday's
activities or to participate in re
writing the occurrence to the
satisfaction of any one special
action group.
As Mr. Hopper suggests, Stan
ford students are indeed "in
censed." It is precisely for this
reason that the Young Republi
cans (YR's) and the Young Ameri
cans for Freedom (YAF) organ
ized Wednesday's show of force.
It is disconcerting for us to see
such action tagged as use of force.
First, the counter-demon
stration, as organized by the YR's
and YAF was intended to be
peaceful and nonviolent. And de
spite the heat generated in the
confrontation it remained that
way during the entire afternoon.
In order to insure that vio
lence, such as marred the last
Trustee's meeting, .would not
again be ignored by the campus
community, there were three
photographers on hand to record
any potential trouble.
The fact that the YR's and
YAF had a lawyer on hand to
brief the initial 15 participants be
forehand of their rights and to
specifically counsel against any
willful disruption of the rally
should underscore the good inten
tions of the "counter
revolutionaries."
Second, as The Daily's news
story correctly pointed out, Prof.
William Rambo, director of the
A pplied Electronics Laboratory
(A EL), ordered employees to
keep students out of the building.
Since the building was essen
tially closed, evidence as to how
"self-styled Establishment guards
blocked the door" is lacking.
In fact, on two occasions, the
group in front of the main door
opened ranks to allow SDS mem
bers to walk to the door. Only
two students availed themselves of
the opportunity.
Third, while the group yelled
and chanted against SDS, in no in
stance was an attempt made to
"shout down and bodily overrun
the SDS speakers."
In the interest of providing
more functional sound equip
ment, in fact, one YAF member
even volunteered to fix the SDS's
faulty loudspeaker.
Fourth, Harvey Hukari never
spoke during the afternoon with
Dean of Student Joel Smith.
Once again, the Daily correctly
noted that responsibility for en
forcement of the recently-adopted
regulations against campus dis
ruptions lies with the Faculty Ad
visory Committee on Campus dis

turbances, and not with Dean
Smith as Mr. Hopper suggested.
Finally, conversations among
participants after the rally fail to
offer any clue as to the nature of
an alleged "disgusting remark re
ferring to one of the speakers'
racial background and Nazi
ovens."
In reality, it was Leonard
Siegel of SDS who brought up the
subject of Nazi brutality. The re
sponse of the crowd, which Mr.
Siegel never answered, was why he
indeed continued to utilize the
tactics of a movement he is so
vehemently opposed to.
It is perhaps indicative of the
lack of dialogue that went on
Wednesday that Mr. Siegel did not
notice that the student carrying a
picket with Hitler's picture on it
was Jewish,
Stanford University has long
enough heard the student voices
in the Old Union courtyard and
on White Memorial Plaza. It is
high time that a few more voices
were heard on joint student
faculty committees and in the up
coming deliberations over SES
proposals.

• My Mother Told Me
Editor, THE DAILY:
My mother always warned
me—if you don't want to look
silly, don't say anything to the
Stanford Daily.
The statements attributed to
me in the Jan. 29 issue are, at
best, a grotesque distortion of
parts of a dinner conversation,
hardly a quotable interview. Your
use of quotation marks is mislead
ing and completely unwarranted.
This is a small matter in an un
important article but the impli
cations are disturbing. Is this sort
of reporting typical? When the
clarity of communication through
the Daily is important, do you do
any better than this?
DENNIS BURKE

• Glad To Have Yelled
Editor, THE DAILY:
At the SDS rally I was one of
the guys who was yelling at the
SDS along with the YAF. A girl,
who was apparently from SDS,
told me that she hoped I get killed
in Vietnam. She may or may not
be interested to know that, if and
when I go to Vietnam, I'll be de
fending the freedom not only of
the SoutfTVietnamese but, in an
indirect way, of all the people in
the Free World. And that includes
her.
One note of clarification. A
person I talked with (better make
that yelled with) seemed to think
that there is a close analogy to the
Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia
and our presence in Vietnam. To
that person I'd like to ask two
questions: 1) how many Viet
namese soldiers are fighting side
by side with us? and 2) how many
Czechs or Slavaks helped the
Russians occupy their own coun
try?
One more thing. AsT was eat
ing at Lagunita that night, an SDS
member announced that there was
going to be a meeting in Granada
Lounge to discuss SDS tactics. It
wasn't till then that I was sud
denly glad I had yelled at the
rally. The SDS, after being vic
timized by their own tactics, da
cided that maybe those tactics
needed a little discussion. They
probably won't moderate much if
at all, but at least I helped make
them stop and think.

• SDS Commotion
Editor, THE DAILY:
In view of the great commo
tion and controversy arising from
the recent activities of the SDS, I
think it important that the partic
ular type of "civil disobedience"
which its members practice be put
into proper perspective. I direct
this letter especially to SDS mem
bers and to any others who would
imitate their tactics.
First, I submit that, although
few people categorically renounce
civil disobedience as a means of
achieving justice, most find it
cheapened by its use as a source
of political power. The "civil dis
obedience" practiced by the SDS
has none of the nobility of acting
out of conscience; rather, it is the
perversion of an ideal for the sake
of expediency.
Second, civil disobedience car
ries the assumption that he who
practices it willingly brings upon
himself all consequences provided
for in the law. Someone not wil
ling to accept these consequences
often defeats his original intention
by inviting speculation that he has
acted out of selfish or other per
sonal interests. Evidently, this
kind of speculation has gone a
long way towards destroying
whatever sympathy SDS has had
at Stanford.
Third, I must point out that
those who would violate laws to
win rights they are now denied
should stop to consider how those
rights can be preserved in a soci
ety where their opponents are free
to follow the same course.
Finally, I would like to address
myself specifically to those who
feel that the decadence of society
compels them to participate in
violent acts of civil disobedience:
If you really want to restructure
society, then, unfortunately, you
must be prepared to be patient.
This realization of the need for
patience in no way diminishes the
importance and the urgency of
the problems we face; it merely
specifies the most effective way of
solving them. Truly permanent
gains always take time and patient
effort. If, on the other hand, you
are interested in personal gratifica
tion, then you may act with im
patience, but you may find that
your "gains" disappear as quickly
as your power.

• YAF's Tactics Questioned
Editor, THE DAIL\ :
Wednesday a number of Young
Americans for Freedom members
turned out at the SDS Open For
um at the Old Union in order to
vent their anger over the SDS's
"gestapo-like tactics" and show
their support for 'freedom'. This
is an issue which should be dealt
with, since the controversy over
SDS tactics seems to be the chief
concern of Stanford public opin

What forms did this conscientious
concern take?The YAFers took
their stand against "fascism" by
cheering wildly at the mention of
Vietnamese casualties and by
blocking the rest of the 250 or so
students from entering the Ap
plied Electronics Lab.
I am not writing this to de
nounce "coercive tactics" nor am
I requesting that the administra
tion prosecute the YAF for dis
rupting the noon rally and block
ing the door at AEL. I do want to
point out, however, why the ac
tions of the YAF were to be ex

pected that not a single person
from either the Faculty Commit
tee on Disruption or from the
University administration, many
of whom were diligently and
swiftly taking names at the Trus
tee's meeting, bothered to take
the names of those students who
were blocking the doors at AEL.
Instead Wyman and Smith spent
their time inside AEL, hinting at
punishment for SDS members if
they didn't leave the building.
More specifically, I wish to
point out the great contradiction
between the rhetoric of Pitzer,
Wyman, Rambo, Hukari, etc., in
deploring all forms of violence;
and their actions with respect to
violence. The articulated neutral
ity-in defense of freedom of these

faculty, administrators, and stu

has been shown on this occasion
as on many others to be nothing
more than liberal bullshit. The
kind of freedom they desire may
be nothing more than freedom
from effective opposition to a vio
lent status quo.
This status quo includes the
War in Vietnam, which men like
Roger Lewis (chrmn., General

(military electronics research and
Defense Dept. Boards) support
materially; this means SRl's chem
ical and biological warfare re
search and their counter-insur

means Turstee's corporations in
Southeast Asis and Latin America,
where the need for a "good invest

and maintenance of oppressive
military dictatorships (Thailand,
for example) which ignore the
basic social needs and human
rights of millions of Third World
people. US responsibility for pov
erty, squalor, disease, and illiter
acy is an act of violence equally as
great as the B-52s bombing Viet

These people don't oppose vio
lence or violent tactics on princi
ple. They opposed SDS's "violent
(?) disruption" of the Trustees'
meeting because they oppose the
nine demands and all they stand
for (these demands are just the
first step toward disengaging Stan
ford from the violence going on in
Southeast Asia and the Third
World). Their use of a supposedly
neutral demonstration policy and
their constant reference to cam
pus referenda against coercion
simply isolate Stanford people
from the rest of humanity and of
diver the issue from the concern
over the great coercion and hu
man suffering in the "outside"
world, a violence that Stanford
now actively supports. My request
to Hewlett, Lewis, Pitzer, et al., is
not to prosecute the YAF, but in
stead to tell everyone where they
really stand concerning Stanford
research—And that's my request
to you. Where do you stand on
the nine demands? Where do you
stand on the violence in Southeast
Asia?

stration, as organized by the YR's
and YAF was intended to be
peaceful and nonviolent. And de
spite the heat generated in the
confrontation it remained that
way during the entire afternoon.
In order to insure that vio
lence, such as marred the last
Trustee's meeting, .would not
again be ignored by the campus
community, there were three
photographers on hand to record
any potential trouble.
The fact that the YR's and
YAF had a lawyer on hand to
brief the initial 15 participants be
forehand of their rights and to
specifically counsel against any
willful disruption of the rally
should underscore the good inten
tions of the "counter
revolutionaries."
Second, as The Daily's news
story correctly pointed out, Prof.
William Rambo, director of the
A pplied Electronics Laboratory
(A EL), ordered employees to
keep students out of the building.
Since the building was essen
tially closed, evidence as to how
"self-styled Establishment guards
blocked the door" is lacking.
In fact, on two occasions, the
group in front of the main door
opened ranks to allow SDS mem
bers to walk to the door. Only
two students availed themselves of
the opportunity.
Third, while the group yelled
and chanted against SDS, in no in
stance was an attempt made to
"shout down and bodily overrun
the SDS speakers."
In the interest of providing
more functional sound equip
ment, in fact, one YAF member
even volunteered to fix the SDS's
faulty loudspeaker.
Fourth, Harvey Hukari never
spoke during the afternoon with
Dean of Student Joel Smith.
Once again, the Daily correctly
noted that responsibility for en
forcement of the recently-adopted
regulations against campus dis
ruptions lies with the Faculty Ad
visory Committee on Campus dis

turbances, and not with Dean
Smith as Mr. Hopper suggested.
Finally, conversations among
participants after the rally fail to
offer any clue as to the nature of
an alleged "disgusting remark re
ferring to one of the speakers'
racial background and Nazi
ovens."
In reality, it was Leonard
Siegel of SDS who brought up the
subject of Nazi brutality. The re
sponse of the crowd, which Mr.
Siegel never answered, was why he
indeed continued to utilize the
tactics of a movement he is so
vehemently opposed to.
It is perhaps indicative of the
lack of dialogue that went on
Wednesday that Mr. Siegel did not
notice that the student carrying a
picket with Hitler's picture on it
was Jewish,
Stanford University has long
enough heard the student voices
in the Old Union courtyard and
on White Memorial Plaza. It is
high time that a few more voices
were heard on joint student
faculty committees and in the up
coming deliberations over SES
proposals.

• My Mother Told Me
Editor, THE DAILY:
My mother always warned
me—if you don't want to look
silly, don't say anything to the
Stanford Daily.
The statements attributed to
me in the Jan. 29 issue are, at
best, a grotesque distortion of
parts of a dinner conversation,
hardly a quotable interview. Your
use of quotation marks is mislead
ing and completely unwarranted.
This is a small matter in an un
important article but the impli
cations are disturbing. Is this sort
of reporting typical? When the
clarity of communication through
the Daily is important, do you do
any better than this?

• Glad To Have Yelled
Editor, THE DAILY:
At the SDS rally I was one of
the guys who was yelling at the
SDS along with the YAF. A girl,
who was apparently from SDS,
told me that she hoped I get killed
in Vietnam. She may or may not
be interested to know that, if and
when I go to Vietnam, I'll be de
fending the freedom not only of
the SoutfTVietnamese but, in an
indirect way, of all the people in
the Free World. And that includes
her.
One note of clarification. A
person I talked with (better make
that yelled with) seemed to think
that there is a close analogy to the
Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia
and our presence in Vietnam. To
that person I'd like to ask two
questions: 1) how many Viet
namese soldiers are fighting side
by side with us? and 2) how many
Czechs or Slavaks helped the
Russians occupy their own coun
try?
One more thing. AsT was eat
ing at Lagunita that night, an SDS
member announced that there was
going to be a meeting in Granada
Lounge to discuss SDS tactics. It
wasn't till then that I was sud
denly glad I had yelled at the
rally. The SDS, after being vic
timized by their own tactics, da
cided that maybe those tactics
needed a little discussion. They
probably won't moderate much if
at all, but at least I helped make
them stop and think.

• SDS Commotion
Editor, THE DAILY:
In view of the great commo
tion and controversy arising from
the recent activities of the SDS, I
think it important that the partic
ular type of "civil disobedience"
which its members practice be put
into proper perspective. I direct
this letter especially to SDS mem
bers and to any others who would
imitate their tactics.
First, I submit that, although
few people categorically renounce
civil disobedience as a means of
achieving justice, most find it
cheapened by its use as a source
of political power. The "civil dis
obedience" practiced by the SDS
has none of the nobility of acting
out of conscience; rather, it is the
perversion of an ideal for the sake
of expediency.
Second, civil disobedience car
ries the assumption that he who
practices it willingly brings upon
himself all consequences provided
for in the law. Someone not wil
ling to accept these consequences
often defeats his original intention
by inviting speculation that he has
acted out of selfish or other per
sonal interests. Evidently, this
kind of speculation has gone a
long way towards destroying
whatever sympathy SDS has had
at Stanford.
Third, I must point out that
those who would violate laws to
win rights they are now denied
should stop to consider how those
rights can be preserved in a soci
ety where their opponents are free
to follow the same course.
Finally, I would like to address
myself specifically to those who
feel that the decadence of society
compels them to participate in
violent acts of civil disobedience:
If you really want to restructure
society, then, unfortunately, you
must be prepared to be patient.
This realization of the need for
patience in no way diminishes the
importance and the urgency of
the problems we face; it merely
specifies the most effective way of
solving them. Truly permanent
gains always take time and patient
effort. If, on the other hand, you
are interested in personal gratifica
tion, then you may act with im
patience, but you may find that
your "gains" disappear as quickly
as your power.

• Signs And Cheers
Editor, THE DAILY:
I'm afraid I wasn't able to read
last Wednesday's Daily (you un
derstand I am so busy I rarely get
a chance to read anything but
what I might write) and just
didn't have the feel of what was
going to happen around Quad that
day. What a surprise it was then,
when my ears perked, so sensitive
they are, as the nostalgically fam
iliar sounds of a rally floated
through the air. Oh, and then the
signs and the cheers and even the
starting lineups were there too.
But I don't remember the uni
forms. Oh well, I can just as easily
forget the lack of uniforms.
WE TOLD YOU SO, Daily.
After all, who was it, that said Big
Game was out of place here at
Stanford? Little hasty perhaps,
aren't you? Why don't you speak
for the majority of the students,

uh? Face the facts for a change.
Its where its happening.

Mulberry Street
Prof Rejoices At Statement
Editor, THE DAILY:
Your readers will undoubtedly
join me in rejoicing at President
Pitzer's reaffirmation, in response
to the SDS demands, of Stan
ford's long-standing policy of
freedom of research. It is because
of this policy that important
members of the University admin
istration, although they personally
would not engage in classified re
search, have pledged themselves to
protect the rights of others, who
so choose, to engage in mission
oriented- research of military sig
nificance.
This announcement comes at a
propitious time for me. I have re
cently been in touch with the
Guevara Foundation located, ap
parently for tax purposes, in
Guinea. This foundation is inter
ested in sponsoring objective,
basic research on alternative stra
tegies for the disruption of com
plex, modern industrial systems.
Classification will not be a prob
lem as it is the policy of the
foundation to encourage the most
widespread dissemination of re
search results.
The project, happily, is intel
lectually challenging and of theo
retical significance. Are modern
industrial systems best disrupted
by sabatoge of end-product fac
tories? Are transportation systems
the weakest link in the system? Or
would "taking out" components
factories be the "least-cost solu
tion" to the problem? Systems
analysis, simulation, gaming, oper
ation research, linear program
ming, statistical decision theory
and benefit-cost analysis will all
have to be employed in the study
since it will be necessary to com
pare the relative utility of a large
number of alternative solutions to
the problem. As principal investi
gator, my position will naturally
be one of ethical neutrality. I have
no idea whether the findings will
be of practical value, or if so to
whom, but in any event those
questions are hardly of concern to
me as a scholar.
It is University policy to em
ploy graduate students in connec
tion with faculty research. Given
the political complexion of the
present group of political science

graduate students, I anticipate no
problem in securing an adequate
number of research assistants.
With luck I may even woo back
one of my last year's teaching as
sistants who is now in Cuba for an
informational visit.
Administration approval of re
search proposals is required at
Stanford, but under our policy of
freedom of research I am sure this
will not be difficult to obtain.

• YAF's Tactics Questioned
Editor, THE DAIL\ :
Wednesday a number of Young
Americans for Freedom members
turned out at the SDS Open For
um at the Old Union in order to
vent their anger over the SDS's
"gestapo-like tactics" and show
their support for 'freedom'. This
is an issue which should be dealt
with, since the controversy over
SDS tactics seems to be the chief
concern of Stanford public opin
ion (one hardly ever hears objec
tions to the nine demands con
cerning the Trustees, SRI, and
Faculty Research any more).
What forms did this conscientious
concern take?The YAFers took
their stand against "fascism" by
cheering wildly at the mention of
Vietnamese casualties and by
blocking the rest of the 250 or so
students from entering the Ap
plied Electronics Lab.
I am not writing this to de
nounce "coercive tactics" nor am
I requesting that the administra
tion prosecute the YAF for dis
rupting the noon rally and block
ing the door at AEL. I do want to
point out, however, why the ac
tions of the YAF were to be ex
pected; and why it was to be ex
pected that not a single person
from either the Faculty Commit
tee on Disruption or from the
University administration, many
of whom were diligently and
swiftly taking names at the Trus
tee's meeting, bothered to take
the names of those students who
were blocking the doors at AEL.
Instead Wyman and Smith spent
their time inside AEL, hinting at
punishment for SDS members if
they didn't leave the building.
More specifically, I wish to
point out the great contradiction
between the rhetoric of Pitzer,
Wyman, Rambo, Hukari, etc., in
deploring all forms of violence;
and their actions with respect to
violence. The articulated neutral
ity-in defense of freedom of these

faculty, administrators, and stu
dents (and many more like them)
has been shown on this occasion
as on many others to be nothing
more than liberal bullshit. The
kind of freedom they desire may
be nothing more than freedom
from effective opposition to a vio
lent status quo.
This status quo includes the
War in Vietnam, which men like
Roger Lewis (chrmn., General
Dynamics) and William Rambo
(military electronics research and
Defense Dept. Boards) support
materially; this means SRl's chem
ical and biological warfare re
search and their counter-insur
gency center in Thailand; this
means Turstee's corporations in
Southeast Asis and Latin America,
where the need for a "good invest
ment climate and economic stabil
ity" necessitates the establishment
and maintenance of oppressive
military dictatorships (Thailand,
for example) which ignore the
basic social needs and human
rights of millions of Third World
people. US responsibility for pov
erty, squalor, disease, and illiter
acy is an act of violence equally as
great as the B-52s bombing Viet
Nam.
These people don't oppose vio
lence or violent tactics on princi
ple. They opposed SDS's "violent
(?) disruption" of the Trustees'
meeting because they oppose the
nine demands and all they stand
for (these demands are just the
first step toward disengaging Stan
ford from the violence going on in
Southeast Asia and the Third
World). Their use of a supposedly
neutral demonstration policy and
their constant reference to cam
pus referenda against coercion
simply isolate Stanford people
from the rest of humanity and of
diver the issue from the concern
over the great coercion and hu
man suffering in the "outside"
world, a violence that Stanford
now actively supports. My request
to Hewlett, Lewis, Pitzer, et al., is
not to prosecute the YAF, but in
stead to tell everyone where they
really stand concerning Stanford
research—And that's my request
to you. Where do you stand on
the nine demands? Where do you
stand on the violence in Southeast
Asia?

• Moderates: Beware Of YAF
Editor, THE DAILY:
The Young Americans for
Freedom? By their support of the

war, and SRI research aiding that
war, they do not grant the Viet
namese people the freedom to
live. In addition, Wednesday's per
formance should have made it
clear to all that the members of
the group are not the defenders of
civil liberties that they would like
us to believe.
The attempt of an ultra-right
wing group to equate SDS with
Hilter's Nazis is a ludicrous ges
ture designed to draw attention
away from their own positions
and ideology. This is the group
that tried to rally the "moder
ates" under its banner? Moder
ates, beware!

• Hippie As Conformist
Editor, THE DAILY:
Do you know what a hippie is?
The hippie slavishly cringes before
theopinions of other people who
have dropped out from our soci
ety. He wants their approval and
acceptance. His craven desire to
belong, his desperate search for
identity with other humans leads
him to incredible filth, immoral
ity, long hair, beads, psychedelic
clothing, and other obscene ac
coutrements and paraphernalia.
So, in his professed non-conform
ity, he is actually a classic con
formist. Its only a matter of
which group of people comprise
his authority.
A man in the military isn't so
dimwitted. He knows who his
authority is—from the platoon
sergeant right on up to his ultimate
commander-in-chief, the President
of the United States. He knows

his dress, haircut, work habits,
uniform, and whole being must
conform to the dictates of that
authority which governs his life.
But few others, outside the mili
tary, know who their authority is.
Do you?

• Biafra Aid Worthwhile
Editor, THE DAIL\ :
Were all the funds collected for
Biafran/Nigerian relief during this
week going to unilaterally detract
from money which was conceiv
ably on its way to the World
Health Organization or even to
the Stanford Population and En
vironment Forum, the question of
funds going to long-range plan
ning, research and education vs.
funds to as specific and immediate
a need as this would be much
more at issue here.
It might be hoped, however,
that giving to a fund which would
help to alleviate a small part of
much immediate suffering —some-
thing as basic as starvation—would
not prevent a person from giving
greater support to plan against
desperate situations in the future;
this might in fact stimulate a larg
er involvement in human con
cerns. Urging not to support
drives for relief is not to raise
funds for planning, for research.
Planning and research are with
out a doubt the more "worthy" in
a strictly utilitarian sense; long
range goals are generally more im
portant than limited objectives.
We too would like to help the
whole world, and realize that
whatever small part of the suffer
ing is alleviated through this drive
will be only a drop in the bucket.
But here is something that can be
done now—and an all-or-nothing
approach is simplistic. At least it
is a drop of the Stanford reservoir
that will not have simply evapor
ated.
Nothing at all will be done if
an awareness of the basic nature
of the problem is not aroused—if

the gap between the starving peo
ple now or in the future and an
American's experience is not
somehow empathetically bridge
able. In addition to an immediate
objective of raising money for re
lief, it is definitely one of the
goals of conducting a fast to pro
vide an opportunity to come to an
awareness of the actual problem,
beyond dropping a quarter or dol
lar in a collection can for "those
less fortunate than we."
We too would like to help the
whole world, but you need clouds
to see if you want rain.
