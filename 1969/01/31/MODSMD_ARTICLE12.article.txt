• Republicans Attack Letter
Editor, THE DAILY:
In response to Marshall Hop
per's letter of yesterday, we
would like to clarify a few mis
conceptions and items of misin
formation.

It is not our purpose to extend
the debate over Wednesday's
activities or to participate in re
writing the occurrence to the
satisfaction of any one special
action group.
As Mr. Hopper suggests, Stan
ford students are indeed "in
censed." It is precisely for this
reason that the Young Republi
cans (YR's) and the Young Ameri
cans for Freedom (YAF) organ
ized Wednesday's show of force.
It is disconcerting for us to see
such action tagged as use of force.
First, the counter-demon
stration, as organized by the YR's
and YAF was intended to be
peaceful and nonviolent. And de
spite the heat generated in the
confrontation it remained that
way during the entire afternoon.
In order to insure that vio
lence, such as marred the last
Trustee's meeting, .would not
again be ignored by the campus
community, there were three
photographers on hand to record
any potential trouble.
The fact that the YR's and
YAF had a lawyer on hand to
brief the initial 15 participants be
forehand of their rights and to
specifically counsel against any
willful disruption of the rally
should underscore the good inten
tions of the "counter
revolutionaries."
Second, as The Daily's news
story correctly pointed out, Prof.
William Rambo, director of the
A pplied Electronics Laboratory
(A EL), ordered employees to
keep students out of the building.
Since the building was essen
tially closed, evidence as to how
"self-styled Establishment guards
blocked the door" is lacking.
In fact, on two occasions, the
group in front of the main door
opened ranks to allow SDS mem
bers to walk to the door. Only
two students availed themselves of
the opportunity.
Third, while the group yelled
and chanted against SDS, in no in
stance was an attempt made to
"shout down and bodily overrun
the SDS speakers."
In the interest of providing
more functional sound equip
ment, in fact, one YAF member
even volunteered to fix the SDS's
faulty loudspeaker.
Fourth, Harvey Hukari never
spoke during the afternoon with
Dean of Student Joel Smith.
Once again, the Daily correctly
noted that responsibility for en
forcement of the recently-adopted
regulations against campus dis
ruptions lies with the Faculty Ad
visory Committee on Campus dis

turbances, and not with Dean
Smith as Mr. Hopper suggested.
Finally, conversations among
participants after the rally fail to
offer any clue as to the nature of
an alleged "disgusting remark re
ferring to one of the speakers'
racial background and Nazi
ovens."
In reality, it was Leonard
Siegel of SDS who brought up the
subject of Nazi brutality. The re
sponse of the crowd, which Mr.
Siegel never answered, was why he
indeed continued to utilize the
tactics of a movement he is so
vehemently opposed to.
It is perhaps indicative of the
lack of dialogue that went on
Wednesday that Mr. Siegel did not
notice that the student carrying a
picket with Hitler's picture on it
was Jewish,
Stanford University has long
enough heard the student voices
in the Old Union courtyard and
on White Memorial Plaza. It is
high time that a few more voices
were heard on joint student
faculty committees and in the up
coming deliberations over SES
proposals.

• My Mother Told Me
Editor, THE DAILY:
My mother always warned
me—if you don't want to look
silly, don't say anything to the
Stanford Daily.
The statements attributed to
me in the Jan. 29 issue are, at
best, a grotesque distortion of
parts of a dinner conversation,
hardly a quotable interview. Your
use of quotation marks is mislead
ing and completely unwarranted.
This is a small matter in an un
important article but the impli
cations are disturbing. Is this sort
of reporting typical? When the
clarity of communication through
the Daily is important, do you do
any better than this?

• Glad To Have Yelled
Editor, THE DAILY:
At the SDS rally I was one of
the guys who was yelling at the
SDS along with the YAF. A girl,
who was apparently from SDS,
told me that she hoped I get killed
in Vietnam. She may or may not
be interested to know that, if and
when I go to Vietnam, I'll be de
fending the freedom not only of
