# Drama Review
## Uneven Quality At Nitery 
### TODD McCARTHY 
Both short plays which opened
at the Nitery Wednesday night,
Euripides' The Cyclops and De
Ghelderode's Escurial, are highly
theatrical and feature interesting
directorial ideas but only in the
second play does the staging serve
as means to a dramatic end; in the
first the effects seem merely
tacked on.
The Cyclops deals with the ar
rival of Odysseus at the island of
the one-eyed monster on his way
home from Troy. But any sense of
tradition stops at the story level.
The translation itself is extremely
contemporary, for many startling
ly colloquial words and phrases
are interspersed among the
speeches. Furthermore, modern
electronic music is used in the
background. The greatest surprise
of all, however, is in the casting.
The lead role of the cyclops is
acted not by a sprawling man but
by a young black actress and the
satyrs of the island are portrayed
not by vicarious men but by at
tractive young women. Thus,
when the cyclops tells his (her)
servant that, "I prefer boys to
girls," the effect is bewilderingly
intriguing. Also, the formidable
Odysseus is here presented as
something of a fop, which, in the
context of this production, could
be valid, but the performance of
Bernard Burkom does not con
vince us that this effect was fully
intended.
Many of the theatrical ideas
either present or latently detect
able in this staging could con
ceibably be considered minor
genius but the failure of the pro
duction to exploit its possibilities
leaves one disappointed. As the
cyclops, Sandi Richards simply
does not embody the pure physi
cal stature and subsequent terror
that the role demands. Burkom, in
addition to his failure to present a
clear approach to his part, seemed
to be grasping for lines. The five
girls in the chorus worked to
gether rather efficiently but at
times lost their unison delivery.

As Silenus, the servant, Robin
Lake was appealing and seemed
confident of his physical and
vocal capabilities.
In short, a critic cannot use
words any stronger than the hack
neyed "promising" or "inter
esting."
Fortunately, the second half of
the evening fulfills the promise
and satisfies the interest. Written
in 1927, Escurial is a moody piece
on decadence and concerns a king
who, for a day, switches places
with his sad jester. Thanks; largely
to the beautifully controlled per
formance of Gene Engene as the
king, the play builds well and is
carefully modulated. Engene's
performance is subtle, with small
movements, gestures and glances
revealing much about his charac
ter's attitudes and state of mind,
yet it is strong enough to suggest
the power he has had as king. As

an actor, he seemed sure of him
self at every moment. Chip
Zempel gives a strong, well
conceived performance as Folial,
the clown and is especially con
vincing and commanding once he
takes the throne.
Despite the fact that the play is
basically a two-character piece,
this production is highly theatri
cal. The three-sided stage area is
used to the utmost advantage and
the vividly colored costumes are
striking in the gloom of the king's
chamger. Director Roger Oliver is
to be highly complimented, for
the text, performances and staging
all seem in beautiful harmony
with each other and the control
felt over these facets of produc
tion is very strong.
The plays will be performed to
night and Saturday at 8 pm in the
Nitery. There is no admission
charge.
