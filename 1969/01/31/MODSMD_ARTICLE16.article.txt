relevance of the evidence presented.

in charge of the presentation of evi

G. ALTERNATE JUDICIAL PRO
CEDURE
1. A student may ask the Dean of
Students to hear his case. The Dean
may refuse to do so.
2. A student, whose case is heard
by the Dean of Students, may appeal
the decision before a three-man sub
committee of the Stanford Judicial
Council. The subcommittee is to con
sist of two faculty members (other

one student, chosen by the Chairman
of the Council. If the student defend

Council will replace the student mem
ber of the subcommittee with a faculty
member of the Council (and the Chair
man may appoint himself to that posi
tion).
It shall not be the duty of the sub
committee to rehear the case as if it
were first presented; the subcommittee
shall review the entire record of the
case as presented to the Dean of Stu
dents and shall determine whether the
evidence is sufficient to justify his de
cision. If the evidence is sufficient the
subcommittee will affirm the decision
of the Dean. If not, the subcommittee
may modify such decision as the evi
dence so demands, or may order the
case, or any part thereof, to be reheard
by the Dean or by the Council.

own case be heard, based on the

the academic quarter when the alleged
punishment was, or should reasonably
have been, discovered.

should reasonably have been discov
ered during Spring Quarter, the ensuing
Summer Quarter shall not be counted
as an academic quarter within the
meaning of 1 and 2 above.
I. PENALTIES
Penalties shall be imposed according
to the circumstances of each individal
case. In setting penalties the Council
shall take into account many factors,
including the nature of the violation,
the purpose and justification of any
regulation disobeyed, the knowledge

en the community and the defendant's
relationship to it.
