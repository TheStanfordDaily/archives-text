# Tribe Faces USC, UCLA
## Casabamen Go South 
### FRED MANN 
Two teams with "perfect" rec
ords clash in Pauley Pavilion in
Los Angeles tomorrow night at
8:00 p.m.
Stanford's luckless Indians are
0-3 in Pacific Eight play so far this
cage year, while UCLA's Bruins
are undefeated in the last 30
games.
Coach Howie Dallmar's squad
will be out to do the impossible
tomorrow when they go against
Lew Alcindor and company in the
Southland. Tonight, Stanford has
it a little easier, (but not much)
when they face the Trojans of
USC.
The Bruins, everybody's num
ber one team, come into the con
test with a brand new record
under their belt. They have now
won more games in a row with
only one loss than any other col
lege basketball team in history.
John Wooden's wonders have met
with defeat only once in their last

last 78 games, spanning a period
of four years.
Their only loss was to Houston
last year on the road, when a sub
par Alcindor was taken apart by
Elvin Hayes, and the favorites fell,
71-69.
UCLA has never lost at Pauly
Pavilion.
The Bruins are a different team
this season. Gone are both Mike
Warren and Lucius Allen, guards
of the NCAA championship team
of last year. But the loss of those
two stars has had little effect.
UCLA's never-ending recruiting
has given them newcomers John
Vallely (averaging 12.4) at guard,
and Sidney Wicks (7.5) at for
ward.
Along with Alcindor (26.6,
tops in the conference) their
vastly improved front line features
last year's frosh sensation Curtis
Rowe (14.1) and reliable Lynn
Shackelford (6.6).
The men of Westwood met

their closest call of the season last
weekend against Northwestern, a
team that Stanford defeated early
in the season. Down by 10 at the
half, UCLA was forced to rally
from behind to pull it out. It was
the play of Shackelford and big
reserve center Steve Patterson that
saved the day for the Bruins.
Bill Palmer and Don Griffin led
the Tribe to a smashing win over
USF last Friday, 81-48. It was
Palmer that won the game with
his great defensive play against big
Pete Cross of USF. Against Al
cindor, the job might be a bit
tougher.
Card hopes rest on the shoul
ders of senior guard Griffin who
will have to be unbelievably hot
to counter the balanced shooting
of UCLA. Griff is currently hit
ting at a 22.3 clip.
Tonight's game against Bob
Boyd's Trojans will undoubtedly
be a closer contest than will the
UCLA contest. USC, always tough
at home is a very inconsistent
team, much like the Indians.
Led by forward Ernie Powell
(17.2), 7-1 center Ron Taylor
(16.3), and quick guard Steve Jen
nings (11.2), the Trojans have
compiled a 8-6 record overall.
They are 1-1 in Pac Eight play.
The Cards can and must run
with Southern Cal, and must cut
off the outside shooting of Powell
and Jennings.
It will be an interesting week
end for Stanford, regardless of the
outcome of the games. It will be a
school that de-emphasizes athlet
ics facing two of the nation's top
sports recruiting universities.
Although the odds are against
them, the off-and-on Indians may
pull a few surprises on the LA
boys.


HE TRIES HARDER -Being num
ber two in the conference in scor
ing with a 22.3 average, Don
Griffin leads Cards to LA for bat
tles with Trojans and Bruins.
Griff, now fifth leading Indian
scorer of all-time is aiming at rec
ord for most points scored in one
season (540 by Art Harris last
year).

among the five Stanford athletes
selected in Tuesday's professional
football draft. Buehler, picked on
the second round by the Oakland
Raiders, was the second Stanford
player chosen (the 49ers took
Gene Washington on the first
round). The Raiders plan to use
the 6-3, 250 lb Buehler as an of
fensive lineman. Snider was
picked on the third round by the
Atlanta Falcons, who plan to
form a rookie offensive tackle tan
dem of Snider and Notre Dame's
George Kunz. The other Tribes
men drafted were 6-6, 230 lb de
fensive end Bill Nicholson (chosen
in the sixth round by the Chicago j
Bears) and placekicker-linebacker
Bill Shoemaker (selected in the
15th round by Cincinnati.

(17.2), 7-1 center Ron Taylor
(16.3), and quick guard Steve Jen
nings (11.2), the Trojans have
compiled a 8-6 record overall.
They are 1-1 in Pac Eight play.
The Cards can and must run
with Southern Cal, and must cut
off the outside shooting of Powell
and Jennings.
It will be an interesting week
end for Stanford, regardless of the
outcome of the games. It will be a
school that de-emphasizes athlet
ics facing two of the nation's top
sports recruiting universities.
Although the odds are against
them, the off-and-on Indians may
pull a few surprises on the LA
boys.


HE TRIES HARDER -Being num
ber two in the conference in scor
ing with a 22.3 average, Don
Griffin leads Cards to LA for bat

Griff, now fifth leading Indian
scorer of all-time is aiming at rec
ord for most points scored in one
season (540 by Art Harris last
year).


PRO PlCKS—George Buehler
(left) and Malcolm Snider were
among the five Stanford athletes
selected in Tuesday's professional
football draft. Buehler, picked on
the second round by the Oakland
Raiders, was the second Stanford
player chosen (the 49ers took
Gene Washington on the first
round). The Raiders plan to use
the 6-3, 250 lb Buehler as an of
fensive lineman. Snider was
picked on the third round by the
Atlanta Falcons, who plan to
form a rookie offensive tackle tan
dem of Snider and Notre Dame's
George Kunz. The other Tribes
men drafted were 6-6, 230 lb de
fensive end Bill Nicholson (chosen
in the sixth round by the Chicago j
Bears) and placekicker-linebacker
Bill Shoemaker (selected in the
15th round by Cincinnati.
Two teams with "perfect" rec
ords clash in Pauley Pavilion in
Los Angeles tomorrow night at
8:00 p.m.
Stanford's luckless Indians are
0-3 in Pacific Eight play so far this
cage year, while UCLA's Bruins
are undefeated in the last 30
games.
Coach Howie Dallmar's squad
will be out to do the impossible
tomorrow when they go against
Lew Alcindor and company in the
Southland. Tonight, Stanford has
it a little easier, (but not much)
when they face the Trojans of
USC.
The Bruins, everybody's num
ber one team, come into the con
test with a brand new record
under their belt. They have now
won more games in a row with
only one loss than any other col
lege basketball team in history.
John Wooden's wonders have met
with defeat only once in their last

last 78 games, spanning a period
of four years.
Their only loss was to Houston
last year on the road, when a sub
par Alcindor was taken apart by
Elvin Hayes, and the favorites fell,
71-69.
UCLA has never lost at Pauly
Pavilion.
The Bruins are a different team
this season. Gone are both Mike
Warren and Lucius Allen, guards
of the NCAA championship team
of last year. But the loss of those
two stars has had little effect.
UCLA's never-ending recruiting
has given them newcomers John
Vallely (averaging 12.4) at guard,
and Sidney Wicks (7.5) at for
ward.
Along with Alcindor (26.6,
tops in the conference) their
vastly improved front line features
last year's frosh sensation Curtis
Rowe (14.1) and reliable Lynn
Shackelford (6.6).
The men of Westwood met

their closest call of the season last
weekend against Northwestern, a
team that Stanford defeated early
in the season. Down by 10 at the
half, UCLA was forced to rally
from behind to pull it out. It was
the play of Shackelford and big
reserve center Steve Patterson that
saved the day for the Bruins.
Bill Palmer and Don Griffin led
the Tribe to a smashing win over
USF last Friday, 81-48. It was
Palmer that won the game with
his great defensive play against big
Pete Cross of USF. Against Al
cindor, the job might be a bit
tougher.
Card hopes rest on the shoul
ders of senior guard Griffin who
will have to be unbelievably hot
to counter the balanced shooting
of UCLA. Griff is currently hit
ting at a 22.3 clip.
Tonight's game against Bob
Boyd's Trojans will undoubtedly
be a closer contest than will the
UCLA contest. USC, always tough
at home is a very inconsistent
team, much like the Indians.

Their only loss was to Houston
last year on the road, when a sub
par Alcindor was taken apart by
Elvin Hayes, and the favorites fell,
71-69.
UCLA has never lost at Pauly
Pavilion.
The Bruins are a different team
this season. Gone are both Mike
Warren and Lucius Allen, guards
of the NCAA championship team
of last year. But the loss of those
two stars has had little effect.
UCLA's never-ending recruiting
has given them newcomers John
Vallely (averaging 12.4) at guard,
and Sidney Wicks (7.5) at for
ward.
Along with Alcindor (26.6,
tops in the conference) their
vastly improved front line features
last year's frosh sensation Curtis
Rowe (14.1) and reliable Lynn
Shackelford (6.6).
The men of Westwood met

their closest call of the season last
weekend against Northwestern, a
team that Stanford defeated early
in the season. Down by 10 at the
half, UCLA was forced to rally
from behind to pull it out. It was
the play of Shackelford and big
reserve center Steve Patterson that
saved the day for the Bruins.
Bill Palmer and Don Griffin led
the Tribe to a smashing win over
USF last Friday, 81-48. It was
Palmer that won the game with
his great defensive play against big
Pete Cross of USF. Against Al
cindor, the job might be a bit
tougher.
Card hopes rest on the shoul
ders of senior guard Griffin who
will have to be unbelievably hot
to counter the balanced shooting
of UCLA. Griff is currently hit
ting at a 22.3 clip.
Tonight's game against Bob
Boyd's Trojans will undoubtedly
be a closer contest than will the
UCLA contest. USC, always tough
at home is a very inconsistent
team, much like the Indians.
Led by forward Ernie Powell
(17.2), 7-1 center Ron Taylor
(16.3), and quick guard Steve Jen
nings (11.2), the Trojans have
compiled a 8-6 record overall.
They are 1-1 in Pac Eight play.
The Cards can and must run
with Southern Cal, and must cut
off the outside shooting of Powell
and Jennings.
It will be an interesting week
end for Stanford, regardless of the
outcome of the games. It will be a
school that de-emphasizes athlet
ics facing two of the nation's top
sports recruiting universities.
Although the odds are against
them, the off-and-on Indians may
pull a few surprises on the LA
boys.


HE TRIES HARDER -Being num
ber two in the conference in scor
ing with a 22.3 average, Don
Griffin leads Cards to LA for bat
tles with Trojans and Bruins.
Griff, now fifth leading Indian
scorer of all-time is aiming at rec
ord for most points scored in one
season (540 by Art Harris last
year).


PRO PlCKS—George Buehler
(left) and Malcolm Snider were
among the five Stanford athletes
selected in Tuesday's professional
football draft. Buehler, picked on
the second round by the Oakland
Raiders, was the second Stanford
player chosen (the 49ers took
Gene Washington on the first
round). The Raiders plan to use
the 6-3, 250 lb Buehler as an of
fensive lineman. Snider was
picked on the third round by the
Atlanta Falcons, who plan to
form a rookie offensive tackle tan
dem of Snider and Notre Dame's
George Kunz. The other Tribes
men drafted were 6-6, 230 lb de
fensive end Bill Nicholson (chosen
in the sixth round by the Chicago j
Bears) and placekicker-linebacker
Bill Shoemaker (selected in the
15th round by Cincinnati.
