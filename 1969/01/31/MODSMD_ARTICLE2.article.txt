## Packard To Study Pueblo 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP)~Secre
tary of Defense Melvin R. Laird
announced Thursday a review of
the Pueblo affair to determine
whether such ocean espionage
missions should be continued—
and, if so, how they can be safe
guarded.
Laird's chief deputy, David
Packard, has been placed in charge
of overseeing the Pueblo matter
and drawing up a report.
As outlined by the defense
chief, the review will:
—Study the kind of protection
that could be given these intelli
gence ships, to see how such inci
dents could be prevented.
—Seek "to see a position where
the rights of all individuals are
protected at all times, and to see
that they are and have been in this
case."
—"Study the whole matter of
the role of this kind of craft... if
such a role is necessary at any
time in the future."
• Youth Hit for Crime
WASHINGTON (AP)-The Na
tional Commission on Violence
has reported that the volcanic
eruptions of disorders in America
seem to be generated in large part
by youth—white and black, poor
and well-to-do.
In a progress report, the inves

tigating body headed by Dr. Mil
ton Eisenhower said "better con
trol of illegitimate violence in our
democratic society" can and must
be achieved.
The report put heaviest
emphasis on these sentences:
"The key to much of the vio
lence in our society seems to lie
with the young.
"Our youth account for an
ever-increasing percentage of
crime, greater than their increas
ing percentage of the population.
The thrust of much of the group
protest and collective violence—on
the campus, in the ghettos, in the
streets—is provided by our young
people.
• Five SFS A rrests
SAN FRANCISCO (AP)-Strik
ing students broke off peaceful
picketing at San Francisco State
College Thursday and threw rocks
and bottles at mounted police,
who chased them into a plush resi
dential district.
There were five arrests but no
reported injuries.
The strikers, who have kept the
big college in an uproad since
Nov. 6, failed to produce their
threatened biggest-yet demonstra
tion.
• Black Studies for SJS
SAN JOSE (AP)—A new black
studies department will open next

fall at San Jose State College,
President Robert D. Clark an
nounced Thursday.
Academic Vice President Ho
bart W. Burns said much of the
credit for the new department in
the School of Humanities and
Arts goes to Harry Edwards, a
former sociology instructor here
who tried to organize a Negro
boycott of the Olympic Games
last year.
Edwards, who now is studying
for a doctorate at Yale, was an
outspoken critic of alleged racism
on this campus.
President Clark said the new
department has been approved by
the Academic Council, but
whether students majoring in
black studies will get their degree
in that subject or in the humani
ties is a question to be decided by
the state college system's Board of
Trustees and Chancellor Glenn
Dumke.
• Tuition Grants End
JACKSON, Miss. (AP) —A
three-judge federal court rules
Thursday Mississippi's program of
financial aid to private school
pupils was unconstitutional be
cause it encouraged segregation.
The court said it would order
an end to tuition grants but would
exempt for this school year those
that were committed by Oct. 1.
