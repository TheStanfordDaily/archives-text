# Cal Strike Continues With Pickets, Violence
## 
### LANG ATWOOD 
BERKELEY—Chanting pic
kets, scattered violence and an ar
rest characterized the picketing on
the Berkeley campus of the Uni
versity of California yesterday as
the strike by the Third World Lib
eration Front (TWLF) seemed to
gain strength.
Picketing at both the Telegraph
Ave. and Sather Gate entrances to
the campus began early in the
morning with the arrival of about
45 pickets at each location. Non
strikers generally had free access
to the campus despite efforts to
disuade them by Third World sup
porters.
By noon, over 200 strikers had
completely blocked the Telegraph
and Bancroft entrance. They
forced non-strikers to detour
around the Student Union and
Sproul Hall.
Unorganized Police
Several scuffles and fights
broke out between strikers and
non-strikers. No one appeared to
be seriously injured. Uniformed
police broke up some disturbances
while other times no policemen
were in sight.

This was in marked contrast to
Wednesday's picketing when 60
police officers from several East
Bay Area departments dispersed
the strikers when access to the
campus became threatened. UC
officials would not comment to
day as to why police took no
action to disperse the demonstra
tors although the entrance was
completely blocked.
At 1:00 tension mounted when
40 policemen cleared the Sather
Gate area. They arrested one per
son. After the arrest, the police
immediately withdrew to the
basement of nearby Sproul Hall.
The police seemed unsure as to
what they were supposed to do;
one line of officers stretched
across Sproul Plaza letting people
pass through them until a sargeant
shouted, "Hey, what are you
doing? Hold that line." Everyone
in the crowd laughted at the
police as they unlimbered their
nightsticks to hold back the stu
dents.
Marching for Demands
After the police withdrew, the
strikers halted their picketing. The
strikers marched through the cam

pus to call attention to their de
mands.
The TWLF demands include a
black studies department, a col
lege of ethnic studies, and ex
panded admission of non-white
students. Their strike was having
little effect on the campus and did
not have widespread support be
fore Wednesday. The calling of
outside police onto the campus by
Chancellor Roger W. Heyns im
mediately swelled the ranks of the
strikers for there were about 1000
people in yesterday's march.
After parading around the cam
pus and through several buildings
including Barrows Hall and the
Student Union the strikers
marched around Sproul Plaza
shouting, "On strike, join the
line," and "Sproul is closed."
Students Arrested
They were also protesting the
arrest of Tim Neighbors, a strike
leader and member of the Afro-
American Student Union. He was
arrested in the police sweep at
Sather Gate and charged with
blocking and obstructing a public
walkway. Arrested later in the day
after a similar incident was Third
World advisor Albert Black, Jr.
Police officials would not com
ment on why Neighbors was the
only person arrested when there
were many people in violation at
the Gate area.
The demonstration broke up
when the strikers marched to
Pauley Auditorium about 2:30 to
hold a convocation to discuss is
sues and tactics.

one line of officers stretched
across Sproul Plaza letting people
pass through them until a sargeant
shouted, "Hey, what are you
doing? Hold that line." Everyone
in the crowd laughted at the
police as they unlimbered their
nightsticks to hold back the stu
dents.
Marching for Demands
After the police withdrew, the
strikers halted their picketing. The
strikers marched through the cam

pus to call attention to their de
mands.
The TWLF demands include a
black studies department, a col
lege of ethnic studies, and ex
panded admission of non-white
students. Their strike was having
little effect on the campus and did
not have widespread support be
fore Wednesday. The calling of
outside police onto the campus by
Chancellor Roger W. Heyns im
mediately swelled the ranks of the
strikers for there were about 1000
people in yesterday's march.
After parading around the cam
pus and through several buildings
including Barrows Hall and the
Student Union the strikers
marched around Sproul Plaza
shouting, "On strike, join the
line," and "Sproul is closed."
Students Arrested
They were also protesting the
arrest of Tim Neighbors, a strike
leader and member of the Afro-
American Student Union. He was
arrested in the police sweep at
Sather Gate and charged with
blocking and obstructing a public
walkway. Arrested later in the day
after a similar incident was Third
World advisor Albert Black, Jr.
Police officials would not com
ment on why Neighbors was the
only person arrested when there
were many people in violation at
the Gate area.
The demonstration broke up
when the strikers marched to
Pauley Auditorium about 2:30 to
hold a convocation to discuss is
sues and tactics.
BERKELEY—Chanting pic
kets, scattered violence and an ar
rest characterized the picketing on
the Berkeley campus of the Uni
versity of California yesterday as
the strike by the Third World Lib
eration Front (TWLF) seemed to
gain strength.
Picketing at both the Telegraph
Ave. and Sather Gate entrances to
the campus began early in the
morning with the arrival of about
45 pickets at each location. Non
strikers generally had free access
to the campus despite efforts to
disuade them by Third World sup
porters.
By noon, over 200 strikers had
completely blocked the Telegraph
and Bancroft entrance. They
forced non-strikers to detour
around the Student Union and
Sproul Hall.
Unorganized Police
Several scuffles and fights
broke out between strikers and
non-strikers. No one appeared to
be seriously injured. Uniformed
police broke up some disturbances
while other times no policemen
were in sight.

This was in marked contrast to
Wednesday's picketing when 60
police officers from several East
Bay Area departments dispersed
the strikers when access to the
campus became threatened. UC
officials would not comment to
day as to why police took no
action to disperse the demonstra
tors although the entrance was
completely blocked.
At 1:00 tension mounted when
40 policemen cleared the Sather
Gate area. They arrested one per
son. After the arrest, the police
immediately withdrew to the
basement of nearby Sproul Hall.
The police seemed unsure as to
what they were supposed to do;
one line of officers stretched
across Sproul Plaza letting people
pass through them until a sargeant
shouted, "Hey, what are you
doing? Hold that line." Everyone
