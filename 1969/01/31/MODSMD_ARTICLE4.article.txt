# Doctorate Language Requirement Dropped
## 
### 
Faculty representatives yesterday abolished a university-wide
foreign language requirement for the Ph.D. degree, leaving this to the
option of individual departments or schools.
The action was taken by the Senate of the Academic Council by
voice vote, with dissent, carrying by a substantial majority. It was
recommended by the Committee on the Graduate Division.
In a Jan. 20 letter to Graduate Dean Virgil Whitaker, Prof.
Wolfgang Panofsky, chairman of the policy subcommittee of the
Graduate Division, said:
"The subcommittee was impressed by the necessity and value of
foreign language training and knowledge on the part of graduate
students, but agreed that the needs as they relate to the different
disciplines were exceedingly variable.
"The case of physics was considered to be probably a singular one,
in that English is beginning to be an almost universal language among
scholars in the field, and therefore the subcommittee expects that, in
general, other departments may not substantially decrease language
requirements.
"Nevertheless, the subcommittee feels that this step is a correct
one in the direction of increasing flexibility in graduate study and in
decreasing the time required towards obtaining a Ph.D."
Physics Professor Shawlow declared that facility with foreign
languages "is an important part of any general education." Though
Prof. Leonard Schiff, Chairman of the Steering Committee for the
Academic Council, concurs with this viewpoint, he added that if the
student has had no previous training in languages, much of the
preparation he receives at the graduate level is superficial. If it started
at this time he learns only enough to pass the reading exam, but six
months later it is of no help.
In other action, the Senate voted to postpone consideration of
recommendations from the Study of Education at Stanford ntil Feb.
27 in order to allow student participants in deliberations to be named.
