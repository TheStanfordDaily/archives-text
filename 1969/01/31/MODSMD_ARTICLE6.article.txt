# Editor Sees Red Split As U.S. Opportunity

### DAVID DAVENPORT 
Surely Marx, Engels, and Lenin never imagined that the primary
threat of war would not come from the Communist-capitalist struggle,
but from a division within the Communist world itself.
As a result of the deepening crisis in the Communist realm, Harrison
Salisbury, a managing editor of The New York Times, indicated that

the U.S. may soon find itself in the attractive position of being able to
deal with both China and Russia.
Highlighting this new potential role for the U.S., Salisbury addressed
over 250 members of the Stanford community last night at Dinkelspiel
Auditorium. A Pulitzer Prize winner for foreign correspondence, an
author of several books on Communism, and a journalist and traveller
in several Communist nations, Salisbury was particularly qualified to
discuss "The Crisis in the Communist World."
Citing the Czechoslovakian crisis of last summer as "one of the most
cogent signs of the depth of the crisis," Salisbury noted a growing fear
in the Kremlin that Russian people and satellites may be attempting to
withdraw from Soviet influence. The Czechs, introducing free speech,
free press, free assembly, and free criticism, were setting a dangerous
precedent for the unity of the Communist world, Consequently the
Russians suppressed them with force.
The greatest crisis in the Communist world is the division between
Russia and Red China. Although it is difficult for Americans to imagine
Mao and Nixon talking strategy, the Russians fear that we are moving
toward China in this power conflict. The Chinese, likewise, fear that we
will support Russia.
As a result of these fears, both nations are making advances toward
the U.S. Russia is extremely eager to talk with the U.S. China has
scheduled a meeting with U.S. government representatives in Warsaw.
This eagerness of both powers to talk to the U.S. thrusts the Ameri
ca into a powerful potential peace-makers. As Salisbury concluded,
"The rewards will be extremely great if we succeed, and the dangers
equally great if we fail."
