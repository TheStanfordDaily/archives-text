# Another Meeting Today
## Blacks Huddle In Secrecy 
### 
The Black Student Union has
scheduled another convocation
for all Blacks on campus to be
held in the Tresidder Large
Lounge at noon today to resume
discussion of the future course of
the black community at Stanford.
A similar convocation was held
yesterday in Bishop Auditorium
of the Business School. Considera
ble secrecy surrounded it. When
asked to describe yesterday's
meeting, Assistant Provost James
Simmons replied "Since it is a
meeting that the BSU called, I am
not a liberty to say anything."
A few BSU members contacted
yesterday would make no com
ment on the meeting. Others
could not be reached. A BSU
spokesman said there will be a

statement made to the press when
final decisions have been made.
Racism at Stanford
A release submitted by BSU to
The Daily on Wednesday ex
plained the purpose of the meet
ings. It said BSU "plans to keep
everyone aware of exactly what is
happening concerning the racial
situation at Stanford".
It went on to say that "in
many ways, hostility and re
pression is manifesting itself quite
openly on the campus. Parallels to
the situation at San Francisco
State and other campuses across
the nation are quite obvious".
Charges Against Koff
Today's scheduled meeting is a
major concern for the BSU. The
Human Relations Council has

been called to consider BSU
charges against Robert Koff, di
rector of the Secondary Teacher
Education Program (STEP).
BSU has accused Koff of
making "the most provocative and
goddamned of inquiries" in an
interview with Clarissa Stevenson,
a black applicant to STEP. In light
of these charges, BSU has de
manded Koff's resignation.
At the request of President
Pitzer, the case has been referred
to the Human Relations Council.
