# Overseas Report Defended
## 
### DENNIS PERLUSS 
The Study of Education at Stanford (SES)
report on overseas study, issued only last week,
has already been subject to attack.
Answering criticism that the report was unfair
to the present program and its administrators,
Thomas Erlich, chairman of the SES Study
Abroad Committee, declared that the focus of
the report is the future.
Erlich, professor of law, went on to say, "The
mandate given us by the SES Steering Committee
was not for paeans of personal praise, but for a
blueprint of what we thought the future of
overseas study at Stanford ought to be.
"We stated that the present program is the
best of any American university, and we meant
it. We said that it can and should be better, and
we meant that too.
"I would have thought that our unqualified
statement would have been accepted for what it
meant. There were no 'snide implications'
intended."
Concerted Effort
Erlich explained that the SES Steering
Committee made a concerted effort to appoint
members to his committee who were free of
preconceived notions as to how the present
program should be changed. He feels they were
very successful in this regard.
Noting that he was the only member of the
committee not to spend at least six months at
one of the campuses, Erlich agreed that the line
between having ideas and exposure and having
preconceptions is often very fine.

Nevertheless, he strongly affirmed that
"although everybody had ideas, we had no fixed
notions as to how or if the program could be
made better."
Advice Considered
Addressing himself to the specific charge that
his committee had ignored advice and corrections
from the Overseas Campus Office, Erlich
maintained that at all stages of the committee's
deliberation there existed cooperation between
the two bodies.
"As fully and as fairly as we could, we took
into account everything said by the Overseas
Campus Office, as well as everybody else. We
tried to get a good, broad base of opinion."
Mark Edwards, student member of the
committee, declared that "We paid close
attention to all remarks, including those of Dr.
(Robert) Walker. When the committee agreed
that there were errors, we made the necessary
corrections.
"There were times, though, when what he
considered errors didn't jive with our research
and testimony. It is more difficult for him to
take a detached view." Walker is Director of
Overseas Campuses.
Decentralization Essential
Erlich emphasized that decentralizing control
of the overseas program by creating a
policy-making committee for each campus is the
key proposal of the report.
Such action, he stated, is essential for the
complete development of the educational
resources available at each individual campus.
Erlich is optimistic that both students and the
Academic Senate will approve this
decentralization. The other proposals in the
report could then be considered by each separate
committee.
Commenting on the vehement opposition to
this restructuring by the Overseas Campus Office,
Erlich said, "I would prefer if Dr. Walker and we
were in agreement. Still, I have no doubt that if
the student and faculty groups involved decide
that this is an idea that should be adopted, it will
be. I'm confident that reason will prevail."
