# LASSU Votes Speech Funds
## 
### 
The Legislature of the Associ
ated Students (LASSU) voted
Wednesday night to appropriate
$4000 from general contingency
to the ASSU Speech Association.
The appropriation has a long
history of controversy which be
gan at an emergency meeting of
the Legislature at the end of last
quarter when the Speech Associa
tion first attempted to obtain the
$4000 appropriation.
The appropriation is to be used
"to set up an endowment," ac
cording to Prof. Kenneth Mosier,
Speech Association adviser, who
spoke to the group.
The Legislature also set an elec
tion on Feb. 18-19 for positions
on The Education Council, the
student group to pass on Study of
Education at Stanford (SES) pro
posals. It also approved nomina
tions for search committees on
deans of students and admissions,
and director of libraries; filled a
vacancy on the Registrar's Ad
visory Committee; and named a
committee on nominations.
The Speech Association move
was made possible by a transfer of
money from marked contingency
funds to general contingency
funds, which was passed by the
Legislature Wednesday night also.
The $4000 appropriation brings
the total ASSU contribution to
Speech Association for the year to
$7000.
Dismay
Some of the members of the
Legislature expressed dismay with
the action. Yale Braunstein said
yesterday, "Charges have been
made by some members of
LASSU that the Speech Associ
ation isn't using its funds proper
ly, but nothing has been done
yet."
LASSU member Ellen
Mahoney from Roble said, "It's
extremely frustrating when every
meeting of LASSU to consider the
Speech Association is dominated
by questionably constituted legis
lators who are also members of
the Speech Association.
"It's virtually a blank check for
Speech Association whims," Miss
Mahoney believes.
Member Paul Witt called the
appropriation an "outrage" and
said "thinking about the crises of
today leads me to believe that the
$7000 they requested for this
year could more wisely be spent
in ways other than hotel bills and
airplane tickets for themselves."
Association President
Answering charges that the
Legislature is "packed" with
Speech Association members,
president of the group Ken Phil
pot said last night "at the most,
12-15 members voted"
Wednesday night on the bill. The
bill passed 47-10.
There remained at press tune
the possibility that ASSU Presi
dent Denis Hayes would veto the
funds transfer that made the ap
propriation possible.
