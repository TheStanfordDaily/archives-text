# BSU Calls Rally On Koff Demand
## 
### FELICITY BAR RINGER 
The Black Students' Union (BSU)
announced Sunday that it will hold a
rally tomorrow at noon in White Plaza.
This rally is the latest development in
the controversy which was triggered by
Professor Robert Koff's alleged 'racist'
interview of an applicant for the
Secondary Teacher Education Program
(STEP).
Nate Kirkman, the chairman of the
BSU, stated that the rally would be "in
formative and important." "We would
urge members of the community to at
tend," Kirkman said.
Leo Bazile, another member of the
BSU, stated that at the end of the rally
some demands will be presented to
President Pitzer. Bazile would not dis
close the content of the demands. "We
will tell that to Mr. Pitzer," he said.
The BSU demanded Koff's resig
nation last Thursday, saying that there
should be "no apologies" and "no
equivocating." Koff, director of the
STEP, reportedly asked Miss Clarissa
Stevenson in an interview if "she had ever
not had enough money to buy tampax
or sanitary napkins," or "ever not had a
piece of meat on the table for a period
of months."
Apology
Koff subsequently sent a letter of
apology to Miss Stevenson, who re
ported that she "had not yet decided
what to reply."
Byron D. Sher, chairman of the
Human Relations Committee which has
been appointed to investigate the
charges against Koff, issued a statement
that the committee "held an extensive

hearing into the charges" on Friday and
Saturday, ending late Saturday night.
"The commission is about to begin its
deliberations," the statement reported.
"Direct Action"
In their statement issued last Thurs
day, the BSU demanded that Koff be
replaced by a black professor and ad
ministrator, and warned the adminis
tration to "look for direct action" if the
selection of a black man does not take
place immediately.
The rally Tuesday will be attended
by "speakers from the community,"
Kirkman said. The rally will be to in
form members of this community about
the situation, before presenting the de
mands.
In a statement last week Koff denied
the charges of racist behavior and ex
pressed confidence in the findings of the
Commission.

UNMOVEDâ€”The cigar smoking gentleman above felt slightly out of place listening to Mary
Hansen discuss American Imperialism at a recent SDS rally on White Plaza. Faintly visible on
the pavement below is the word "PIG." He may think it of the SDS and the SDS may well
think it of him.
