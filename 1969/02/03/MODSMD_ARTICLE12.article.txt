## Drama—A Bad Scene? 
### Andrew Moss 
At the moment experimental
theater is almost dead outside the
universities; places like Stanford
have to decide whether or not to
keep it alive. The MFA students
are afraid Stanford is going to let
it die and that's why the admin
istration is dragging its feet on
hiring a new department head.
A decision has to be made
about allocating resources—a deci
sion which may mean eliminating
a whole department, or at the
least changing its nature. Who
makes that kind of decision at
Stanford and who are they ac
countable to?
For the MFA students it is a
decision about their professional
careers; unless they find out what
is going on they have threatened
to leave the department en masse
at the end of this academic year.
(Some of the faculty too, appar
ently.) Since that would put an
end to the department the admin
istration's reaction will be a good
test of whether Stanford wants to
maintain a theater program or
not.
Last year when the students
threatened to resign they didn't
get any results. This time they
mean it, and they still may not get
any.
If not, something stronger is
needed: my suggestion is that the
MFA people ought to take a leaf
out of SDS' book and apply some
of their training to the problem of
guerilla theater, possibly at the
next trustee meeting. If that's
what it takes to find out what is
going on, then that's what it
takes.

'Cerent ideas—
leatre-based

department offering a professional
training or was it to become more
academically oriented?
It hasn't had a department
chairman for two and a half years
and since nothing can be done
about settling its identity problem
till it gets a chairman, nothing is
getting done.
In spite of all this it apparently
has good students and faculty and
it is well enough known for News
week to be making a film about it
at the moment.
But the lack of a department
chairman prevents the department
from getting itself together and
the students are beginning to feel
they may get screwed. They don't
know what kind of a department
it's going to be next year and they
are afraid it won't be the kind
they came here to be in—a pro
duction-based department rather
than an academic one.
Student Proposals
With this kind of insecurity as
a stimulus, this students
managed to agree proposal
that the department should take
the professional-training line,
basing itself on a new central rep
ertory theater. They also pro
posed that grades be abolished,
that students have a voice in de
partmental policy-making and
that students be consulted on fac
ulty selection.
These proposals, published Jan
uary 24, managed to get faculty
support but they can't be imple
mented because of the lack of a
chairman. Consequently the stu
dents made one demand: that a
new department chairman be
found.
The irony of this situation is
the fact that both students and
faculty know who they want as
chairman—Michael Barry, head of
the BBC drama division in Eng

land and currently visiting the
department. Ninety-five percent
of the students and faculty in the
department have signed a petition
saying they want Barry and his
name was duly forwarded to the
relevant Dean.
In Limbo
None of the students (possibly
not many of the faculty?) have
the faintest idea what is going on
with chairman selection. The de
cision vanished upwards into ad
ministrative limbo and nobody
knows why it is taking two and a
half years to make and why it is
still dragging on now that every
one wants Barry.
The Master of Fine Arts (MFA)
students are rather suspicious;
after all, it's their professional
qualification the elevated admini
strators are playing with.
The root of their suspicion is a
fairly credible rumor that the uni
versity intends to let the Drama
part of the Speech and Drama de
partment fade quietly away. By
the standards of the Humanities it
is a very expensive department to
run, and of course it doesn't have
any of the abundant military
money that keeps other expensive
projects going. Since it can't cover
costs on admissions, there really
isn't much hope for the drama
people unless the university de
cides theatre is worth subsidizing,,
Lack of money for things like
theatres is a familiar problem at
Stanford, which is much more a
part of the world around it than
some academic propagandists
would have you believe. What gets
done in the university is what peo
ple will pay for; nobody will pay
for theatre (more precisely, you
can't make any money on it) and
so theater is dying.
