it on any-

thing, but what I'm getting to is
this: We need a blend between
two forces on this campus, the
radical outrage and imagination of
SDS on one side, and the radical
thought and hope for possibilities
in our best academic thought on
the other.
With this combination we
might be able to combine the rad
ical criticism of the Left with a
deep look at the forces of progress
implicit in the technological, in
formational, and human revolu
tions now taking place or waiting
for people to get over their hang
ups and let them happen. With
such a combination we might be
able to get out of the tactical
quagmire, the stereotype labelling,
and the jargon jungle that is
hampering SDS so badly.
But who cares? People knock
SDS and think they've done their
duty to their conscience. Great, so
what have they done—defended
police tactics and the status quo.
Fine, but what about Vietnam,
racism, pollution, imperialism,
alienation, drugs, divorce, alcol
holism, lovelessness, atomic de
struction, poverty, and the other
symptoms of our mass psychosis?
Then Who?
Like don't we still feel some
body should be doing something?
Then who? And is it enough to
say that we will all do our little
bit in the fields for which we are
being trained, when SDS has done
us the service of pointing out who
decides how those efforts will be
made and rewarded? Don't we
need some radical change to deal

with the root causes of all those
problems?
Now perhaps I'm just missing
out personally. I don't come
around Stanford that much any
more. Maybe some bright, liberal
professors and some bright radi
cal-revolutionaries are secretly
meeting somewhere, having de
cided not to try to impede one's
current activities, but to look way
ahead and then right back to im
mediate social action. But no
body's told me about it. Drop me
a card here, if this is going on.
But most people are probably
just worrying about their careers,
money, dates, money, grades, sex,
money, publishing, promotion,
money, bridge, money, fraterni
ties, sports, grades, money, eternal
life, money, draft deferments,
marriage, children, insurance, cars,
rent, money, jobs, television,
rock, money, clothes, hair, paint,
papers, personalities, love, money.
And that's a lot to worry
about. Cough. But who's minding
the store—old Richard the Nix
and SDS? Wheeze. You people are
supposed to be bright and creative
and aware and all those nice
things. Don't you think this situ
ation is important? What is going
on? Why can't we get together?
Look, all the liberals and
others who put SDS down always
say how we won't listen, and how
we're power-hungry, and how we
won't cooperate. Here's your
chance. Propose something. Show
the radicals up when they reject
you out of hand.
Are you still alive?
