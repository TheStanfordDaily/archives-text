# Non-Credit Status Accorded ROTC
## 
### MORRIS WEE 
As part of nationwide dissatis
faction with military programs
which train college students to be
officers in the US armed services,
the faculties of Yale and Dart
mouth recently voted to strip the
Reserve Officers Training Corps
(ROTC) of its academic standing,
severely undercutting the pro
gram's status.
The Yale faculty voted Thurs
day to relegate its ROTC program
to extracurricular standing. No
more credit will be given to stu
dents for participating in ROTC,
and the military officers in charge
of the programs will no longer be
granted the title of "professor."
This decision was followed
closely by a similar change at
Dartmouth. The faculty voted to
support in principal a recommend
ation which contained three basic
proposals. They agreed: 1) to de
crease ROTC credit to two
courses; 2) to limit the faculty

status to the senior officer of each
ROTC detachment; 3) to elimin
ate all credit for ROTC unless the
military instruction is transferred
to summer camps within three
years.

Both decisions reflect a grow
ing trend on college campuses to
analyze the position of military
programs in the university. Ac
cording to Yale's Dr. Arthur W.
Galston, chairman of the faculty's
course of study committee,
"ROTC is like singing in the Whif
fenpoofs—a perfectly fine activity
but one that we don't think mer
its any academic standing."
At Stanford the Academic Sen
ate set up an ad hoc committee
last September to reappraise the
university's policy for accrediting
the ROTC program. The commit
tee's report was originally to be
released on January 15 but has
been postponed. Its release is ex
pected soon.
