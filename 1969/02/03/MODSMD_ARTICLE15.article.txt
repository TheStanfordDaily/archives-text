# End To Draft May Be Near
## 
### 
President Richard Nixon has
directed the Pentagon to end the
draft and replace the present Se
lective Service System with an all
volunteer army as soon as Viet
nam expenditures can be reduced.
The move was contained in a
detailed directive to the Penta
gon's Secretary of Defense, Melvin
Ft. Laird. The report to Laird re
quested that the Pentagon plan a
special commission to develop a
detailed plan of action for ending
the draft as well as Nixon's recom
mendation that an all volunteer
system be created as soon as the
costs of the Vietnamese War go
down.
White House press secretary
Ronald Ziegler said Mr. Nixon is
"moving ahead on developing his
thoughts and getting further rec
ommendations" on his proposals
that the Selective Service System
eventually be eliminated.
The White House added that
Mr. Nixon's instructions for a
draft study and his requests for re
ports on other topics were the
first in a series the President will
be issuing to his Cabinet.
Among the other studies Nixon
ordered:
The Department of Transpor
tation was instructed to set up a
committee "to investigate all as
pects of the supersonic transport
program." The agency also was
told to look into airport develop
ment and air traffic control prob
lems.
The Treasury Department was
directed "to review interest rate
ceilings on Treasury issues and on
bank deposits and to submit rec
ommendations for action."
The Department of Justice
was directed to advise Mr. Nixon
promptly on electoral college re
form and to review recommenda
tions for action against organized
crime.
The Departments of Com
merce and of Housing and Urban
Development were asked for rec
ommendations on the convening
of a White House conference to
consider voluntary programs "that
will involve business men more
actively in our social and econ
omic problems."
The Budget Bureau was ad
vised that Mr. Nixon is disturbed
at reports that the government "is
not living up to its obligations to
colleges and universities" which
have been denied national science
foundation grants because of a
federal expenditure ceiling.
