# Novak Discusses Identity
## 'Nothingness' Praised 
### 
By CICELY BATES
"Nothingness" was the topic of
Catholic theologian, Michael
York, as he addressed the morning
service in Memorial Church yester
day.
Under the glaring lights of
Newsweek's cameras, Novak told
of the problems people face in
finding their true identity and he
proposed that out of Nothingness
comes the answer to the problem.
"Nothingness is the fetile place
in human life. The void is full. It
can be a place of terror but is also
a place of joy because it recog
nizes there is terror in the world,"
began Novak.
"Unfortunately, Americans are
taught to fear Nothingness and
spend much of their life escaping
it," Novak explained. "The per
suit of happiness is a constitu
tional right—but is it good? Do
whites have the only right to it
while they make all other people
and goals subservient?" he ques
tioned.
"The American definition of
happiness is a balanced diet, suc
cess in marriage and job, and get
ting enough sleep. It is unpatriotic
to be discontent. Things are al
ways looking up. America has an
illusion that progress is good and
we always r-equire a New Frontier.
We are ill at ease if 'progress—our
most important product' is not
there."
"But maybe progress and his
tory are m isguided—going
nowhere," replied the theologian.

"Youths realize the myths of the
American life," said Novak citing
the brutal war in Vietnam as an
example. They realize that they
live in a "Militarist and rascist
nation."
Explaining how these youths
have come to experience Nothing
ness Novak explained tha pre
viously "many youths wanted a
revolution of values." Since this
has obviously not occured, they
are "now disillusioned." "They
can't seem to go forward and they
can't go back. They are experi
encing Nothingness." In fact, it is
now gotten to the point that "the
perception of the void becomes
daily break," he stated.
"There is an exhausting of the
spirit and the threshold is low for
rage suicide or murder." Novak
quoted Nietzsche who summed up
the experience by saying that
Nothingness was reached with the
"realization that the character of
existence does not contain the
concepts of aim, unity, or being.
Existence has no aim or goal."
But by perceiving Nothingness,
Novak continued, "each human
being can put structure into his
own existencs." Then the reali
zation can be reached that the ex
istence of culture and the outer
world is only pretend, wishful,
and an illusion. "There is no real
world—only a great darkness in
which human beings momentarily
flash," relected Novak.
He went on to say that
Nothingness is not automatically

experienced. The instructions that
people receive from their culture
is designed to make a "well
rounded person, clear in aims."
"The well brought-up person is
shielded from Nothingness." But
culture can be pierced by ques
tions.
Novak said that culture
avoided the concept of Nothing
ness by creating "Myths." Namely
these myths are that: 1. enlighten
ment and the scientific method
explain everything. 2. that the
autonomous individual is impor
tant. 3. that achievement to the
point that one person's success is
contingent upon another's failure
is important. 4. that it is impor
tant to serve a functional role
within the system and await, not
demand, recognition.
"Nothingness is between sanity
and insanity where holiness
resides," explained Novak.
"Nothingness is the fruit of
honesty and courage. It enables
people to see through one
another's myths. It is a beginning
place where honesty is clean and
courage is naked. It is a time when
a person can really ask himself
how he should live, what he
should do."
