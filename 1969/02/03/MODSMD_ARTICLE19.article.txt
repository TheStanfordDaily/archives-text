# Black Assistant Provost
## Simmons Sees Conflict In Roles 
### KIM THORBURN 
Jim Simmons arrived for din
ner in his trench coat and Russian
fur cap. "I never expected to get
to use my hat out here," he said,
expressing the usual Eastern sur
prise at a California chill.
Simmons is a black man, and
he's an administrator, a member
of the Provost's staff. His position
is Assistant Provost of Inter-group
Relations. It is a new office in the
administration, created to meet
one of the Black Student Union's
ten demands last spring.
The Assistant Provost of Inter
group Relations assists the Provost
especially in affairs concerned
with minority students. He helps
the University develop academic
and non-academic programs that
are meaningful for the minority
population and he articulates the
needs and concerns of those stu
dents.
Since Simmons arrived last fall,
he has been faced with a variety
of responsibilities. He has worked
with minority admissions prob
lems and financial aid. He has
been a counselor for personal
problems, and his office has
served as a resource for depart
ments and individuals seeking to
develop programs for minority
students.
Liason
"The departments draw on our
experience and it serves to facili
tate the development of such pro
grams," said Simmons. "We are
also a viable, visible liason be
tween the administration and
minorities," he added.
"One of the greatest diffi
culties in our new office has been
defining our responsibilities," he
said as he settled comfortably
with a cigarette after dinner. Sim
mons' office now represents all
minorities on campus, but he is
searching for a Mexican-American
administrator who will join his
staff.
"One of our biggest problems
is getting concerned departments
and individuals to utilize our
office before problems arise. We
hate to consider ourselves
trouble-shooters. We would rather
serve in a preventative capacity,
plan significantly and develop pro
cedures that cause less problems.
"It's hard to find a workable
solution once a problem has
developed," he added.
The second difficulty facing

Simmons in his new position is
personal. "It is hard to find a way
to show sincerity and concern as a
Elack man, to demonstrate my
sympathy for my Black brothers
and sisters, and, at the same time
to carry out a job in a responsible
way, which is more characteristic
of my nature than in an irrespon
sible way.
"On a Fence"
"Sometimes I feel like a guy on
a fence being misunderstood by
those on both sides of the fence.
At times I get caught up and feel I
should jump on one side or the
other. Maybe that's the moral
thing to do.
"But I can't help but feel that
there's merit taking the middle
ground. One can talk about the
consequences to both extremes.
"If Stanford ever found itself
in a confrontation the middle
ground would be impossible" Sim
mons continued. "I guess thirty
seven years of Black experience,
and my wife and children being
black, would influence me greatly
in choosing the Black side."
Simmons was born in New
York City. He was thrown out of
junior high school because he was
too old and he dropped out of
tenth grade of the Public High
School of Commerce to join the

Navy when he was sixteen. He
planned to make the Navy a
career.
Valedictorian
The Navy sent him to school
and for twelve weeks he com
muted from New York City to
Bayon, New Jersey. After he
finished his classes he was made
valedictorian, which was the first
academic honor he'd ever re
ceived. "I didn't know what it
meant but I knew that it was im
portant because they took my pic
ture for the Navy Times," he said.
He began to focus on himself
in an academic way and wonder if
a future of twenty years in the
Navy was really what he wanted.
Upon completing his first stint, he
decided not to re-enlist. He went
back to New York in January.
"I suffered one setback after
another," said Simmons. He
couldn't enroll in school until the
following September and he had
no particular skills so he had to
take a job pushing carts in the gar
ment district.
He joined the 52-20 Club in
which the government gave him
twenty dollars a week for a year
while he was readjusting to
civilian life. He began hanging out
on the streets and his mother and
sister kept saying that he would
end up in trouble. All his friends
were in jail. By Spring he'd de-

cided that he'd made a mistake
and left for Florida to rejoin the
Navy.
Grandmother's Encouragement
On his way to Florida, Sim
mons stopped in Newport News,
Virginia, to visit his grandmother.
It was there that he got his first
encouragement in months. She
said to him, "Son, if you think
you can do it, why don't you
try?"
His grandfather found him a
job at the army base and the fol
lowing September, at the age of
twenty-one, he enrolled in the
high school at Newport News. He
had no college preparatory credits
so he took two Engligh courses,
two math courses, United States
history, world history, biology,
chemistry and continued working
at the base. He got straight A's
but still didn't have enough
credits to graduate.
At twenty-two he felt too old
to return to high school and he
decided to give up. His grand
mother told him to go to talk to
the director of admissions at
Hampton College which was a few
miles from Newport News. They
gave him an entrance examination
and admitted him without a high
school diploma.
At Hampton he was president
of his fraternity, the speech club,

the radio club and the veterans'
club. He also made the Dean's
List. He majored in sociology and
speech and drama and minored in
English.
After graduating from Hamp
ton, he taught for five years in
rural schools in North Carolina
and Virginia. Harvard then gave
him a fellowship and at the same
time, he was made Assistant Dean
of Men at Hampton. He received
his masters in counselling and
psychology from Harvard.
In 1963 Simmons began to
work with A Better Chance (ABC)
Program, which recruits minority
students for private schools. Its
headquarters are at Dartmoth. In
1965 SargeantShriver invided him
to Washington to be Deputy
Director of Upward Bound.
After four years as director of
ABC he helped to found Con
necticut Talent Assistance Co
operative (Conntac), which was
the first program of its kind in the
nation. Every college in the state
worked with the state and federal
governments to recruit minority
students. After a year, Simmons
accepted his position at Stanford.
As he got up to leave Simmons
said, "I guess the reason I'm in
this kind of work is that I know
that the minority student needs
the kind of encouragement my
grandmother gave to me."

ceived. "I didn't know what it
meant but I knew that it was im
portant because they took my pic
ture for the Navy Times," he said.
He began to focus on himself
in an academic way and wonder if
a future of twenty years in the
Navy was really what he wanted.
Upon completing his first stint, he
decided not to re-enlist. He went
back to New York in January.
"I suffered one setback after
another," said Simmons. He
couldn't enroll in school until the
following September and he had
no particular skills so he had to
take a job pushing carts in the gar
ment district.
He joined the 52-20 Club in
which the government gave him
twenty dollars a week for a year
while he was readjusting to
civilian life. He began hanging out
on the streets and his mother and
sister kept saying that he would
end up in trouble. All his friends
were in jail. By Spring he'd de-

cided that he'd made a mistake
and left for Florida to rejoin the
Navy.
Grandmother's Encouragement
On his way to Florida, Sim
mons stopped in Newport News,
Virginia, to visit his grandmother.
It was there that he got his first
encouragement in months. She
said to him, "Son, if you think
you can do it, why don't you
try?"
His grandfather found him a
job at the army base and the fol
lowing September, at the age of
twenty-one, he enrolled in the
high school at Newport News. He
had no college preparatory credits
so he took two Engligh courses,
two math courses, United States
history, world history, biology,
chemistry and continued working
at the base. He got straight A's
but still didn't have enough
credits to graduate.
At twenty-two he felt too old
to return to high school and he
decided to give up. His grand
mother told him to go to talk to
the director of admissions at
Hampton College which was a few
miles from Newport News. They
gave him an entrance examination
and admitted him without a high
school diploma.
At Hampton he was president
of his fraternity, the speech club,

the radio club and the veterans'
club. He also made the Dean's
List. He majored in sociology and
speech and drama and minored in
English.
After graduating from Hamp
ton, he taught for five years in
rural schools in North Carolina
and Virginia. Harvard then gave
him a fellowship and at the same
time, he was made Assistant Dean
of Men at Hampton. He received
his masters in counselling and
psychology from Harvard.
In 1963 Simmons began to
work with A Better Chance (ABC)
Program, which recruits minority
students for private schools. Its
headquarters are at Dartmoth. In
1965 SargeantShriver invided him
to Washington to be Deputy
Director of Upward Bound.
After four years as director of
ABC he helped to found Con
necticut Talent Assistance Co
operative (Conntac), which was
the first program of its kind in the
nation. Every college in the state
worked with the state and federal
governments to recruit minority
students. After a year, Simmons
accepted his position at Stanford.
As he got up to leave Simmons
said, "I guess the reason I'm in
this kind of work is that I know
that the minority student needs
the kind of encouragement my
grandmother gave to me."


JAMES SIMMONS
Jim Simmons arrived for din
ner in his trench coat and Russian
fur cap. "I never expected to get
to use my hat out here," he said,
expressing the usual Eastern sur
prise at a California chill.
Simmons is a black man, and
he's an administrator, a member
of the Provost's staff. His position
is Assistant Provost of Inter-group
Relations. It is a new office in the
administration, created to meet
one of the Black Student Union's
ten demands last spring.
The Assistant Provost of Inter
group Relations assists the Provost
especially in affairs concerned
with minority students. He helps
the University develop academic
and non-academic programs that
are meaningful for the minority
population and he articulates the
needs and concerns of those stu
dents.
Since Simmons arrived last fall,
he has been faced with a variety
of responsibilities. He has worked
with minority admissions prob
lems and financial aid. He has
been a counselor for personal
problems, and his office has
served as a resource for depart
ments and individuals seeking to
develop programs for minority
students.
Liason
"The departments draw on our
experience and it serves to facili
tate the development of such pro
grams," said Simmons. "We are
also a viable, visible liason be
tween the administration and
minorities," he added.
"One of the greatest diffi
culties in our new office has been
defining our responsibilities," he
said as he settled comfortably
with a cigarette after dinner. Sim
mons' office now represents all
minorities on campus, but he is
searching for a Mexican-American
administrator who will join his
staff.
"One of our biggest problems
is getting concerned departments
and individuals to utilize our
office before problems arise. We
hate to consider ourselves
trouble-shooters. We would rather
serve in a preventative capacity,
plan significantly and develop pro
cedures that cause less problems.
"It's hard to find a workable
solution once a problem has
developed," he added.
The second difficulty facing

Simmons in his new position is
personal. "It is hard to find a way
to show sincerity and concern as a
Elack man, to demonstrate my
sympathy for my Black brothers
and sisters, and, at the same time
to carry out a job in a responsible
way, which is more characteristic
of my nature than in an irrespon
sible way.
"On a Fence"
"Sometimes I feel like a guy on
a fence being misunderstood by
those on both sides of the fence.
At times I get caught up and feel I
should jump on one side or the
other. Maybe that's the moral
thing to do.
"But I can't help but feel that
there's merit taking the middle
ground. One can talk about the
consequences to both extremes.
"If Stanford ever found itself
in a confrontation the middle
ground would be impossible" Sim
mons continued. "I guess thirty
seven years of Black experience,
and my wife and children being
black, would influence me greatly
in choosing the Black side."
Simmons was born in New
York City. He was thrown out of
junior high school because he was
too old and he dropped out of
tenth grade of the Public High
School of Commerce to join the

Navy when he was sixteen. He
planned to make the Navy a
career.
Valedictorian
The Navy sent him to school
and for twelve weeks he com
muted from New York City to
Bayon, New Jersey. After he
finished his classes he was made
valedictorian, which was the first
academic honor he'd ever re
ceived. "I didn't know what it
meant but I knew that it was im
portant because they took my pic
ture for the Navy Times," he said.

expressing the usual Eastern sur
prise at a California chill.
Simmons is a black man, and
he's an administrator, a member
of the Provost's staff. His position
is Assistant Provost of Inter-group
Relations. It is a new office in the
administration, created to meet
one of the Black Student Union's
ten demands last spring.
The Assistant Provost of Inter
group Relations assists the Provost
especially in affairs concerned
with minority students. He helps
the University develop academic
and non-academic programs that
are meaningful for the minority
population and he articulates the
needs and concerns of those stu
dents.
Since Simmons arrived last fall,
he has been faced with a variety
of responsibilities. He has worked
with minority admissions prob
lems and financial aid. He has
been a counselor for personal
problems, and his office has
served as a resource for depart
ments and individuals seeking to
develop programs for minority
students.
Liason
"The departments draw on our
experience and it serves to facili
tate the development of such pro
grams," said Simmons. "We are
also a viable, visible liason be
tween the administration and
minorities," he added.
"One of the greatest diffi
culties in our new office has been
defining our responsibilities," he
said as he settled comfortably
with a cigarette after dinner. Sim
mons' office now represents all
minorities on campus, but he is
searching for a Mexican-American
administrator who will join his
staff.
"One of our biggest problems
is getting concerned departments
and individuals to utilize our
office before problems arise. We
hate to consider ourselves
trouble-shooters. We would rather
serve in a preventative capacity,
plan significantly and develop pro
cedures that cause less problems.
"It's hard to find a workable
solution once a problem has
developed," he added.
The second difficulty facing

Simmons in his new position is
personal. "It is hard to find a way
to show sincerity and concern as a
Elack man, to demonstrate my
sympathy for my Black brothers
and sisters, and, at the same time
to carry out a job in a responsible
way, which is more characteristic
of my nature than in an irrespon
sible way.
"On a Fence"
"Sometimes I feel like a guy on
a fence being misunderstood by
those on both sides of the fence.
At times I get caught up and feel I
should jump on one side or the
other. Maybe that's the moral
thing to do.
"But I can't help but feel that
there's merit taking the middle
ground. One can talk about the
consequences to both extremes.
"If Stanford ever found itself
in a confrontation the middle
ground would be impossible" Sim
mons continued. "I guess thirty
seven years of Black experience,
and my wife and children being
black, would influence me greatly
in choosing the Black side."
Simmons was born in New
York City. He was thrown out of
junior high school because he was
too old and he dropped out of
tenth grade of the Public High
School of Commerce to join the

Navy when he was sixteen. He
planned to make the Navy a
career.
Valedictorian
The Navy sent him to school
and for twelve weeks he com
muted from New York City to
Bayon, New Jersey. After he
finished his classes he was made
valedictorian, which was the first
academic honor he'd ever re
ceived. "I didn't know what it
meant but I knew that it was im
portant because they took my pic
ture for the Navy Times," he said.
He began to focus on himself
in an academic way and wonder if
a future of twenty years in the
Navy was really what he wanted.
Upon completing his first stint, he
decided not to re-enlist. He went
back to New York in January.
"I suffered one setback after
another," said Simmons. He
couldn't enroll in school until the
following September and he had
no particular skills so he had to
take a job pushing carts in the gar
ment district.
He joined the 52-20 Club in
which the government gave him
twenty dollars a week for a year
while he was readjusting to
civilian life. He began hanging out
on the streets and his mother and
sister kept saying that he would
end up in trouble. All his friends
were in jail. By Spring he'd de-

cided that he'd made a mistake
and left for Florida to rejoin the
Navy.
Grandmother's Encouragement
On his way to Florida, Sim
mons stopped in Newport News,
Virginia, to visit his grandmother.
It was there that he got his first
encouragement in months. She
said to him, "Son, if you think
you can do it, why don't you
try?"
His grandfather found him a
job at the army base and the fol
lowing September, at the age of
twenty-one, he enrolled in the
high school at Newport News. He
had no college preparatory credits
so he took two Engligh courses,
two math courses, United States
history, world history, biology,
chemistry and continued working
at the base. He got straight A's
but still didn't have enough
credits to graduate.
At twenty-two he felt too old
to return to high school and he
decided to give up. His grand
mother told him to go to talk to
the director of admissions at
Hampton College which was a few
miles from Newport News. They
gave him an entrance examination
and admitted him without a high
school diploma.
At Hampton he was president
of his fraternity, the speech club,

the radio club and the veterans'
club. He also made the Dean's
List. He majored in sociology and
speech and drama and minored in
English.
After graduating from Hamp
ton, he taught for five years in
rural schools in North Carolina
and Virginia. Harvard then gave
him a fellowship and at the same
time, he was made Assistant Dean
of Men at Hampton. He received
his masters in counselling and
psychology from Harvard.
In 1963 Simmons began to
work with A Better Chance (ABC)
Program, which recruits minority
students for private schools. Its
headquarters are at Dartmoth. In
1965 SargeantShriver invided him
to Washington to be Deputy
Director of Upward Bound.
After four years as director of
ABC he helped to found Con
necticut Talent Assistance Co
operative (Conntac), which was
the first program of its kind in the
nation. Every college in the state
worked with the state and federal
governments to recruit minority
students. After a year, Simmons
accepted his position at Stanford.
As he got up to leave Simmons
said, "I guess the reason I'm in
this kind of work is that I know
that the minority student needs
the kind of encouragement my
grandmother gave to me."

He began to focus on himself
in an academic way and wonder if
a future of twenty years in the
Navy was really what he wanted.
Upon completing his first stint, he
decided not to re-enlist. He went
back to New York in January.
"I suffered one setback after
another," said Simmons. He
couldn't enroll in school until the
following September and he had
no particular skills so he had to
take a job pushing carts in the gar
ment district.
He joined the 52-20 Club in
which the government gave him
twenty dollars a week for a year
while he was readjusting to
civilian life. He began hanging out
on the streets and his mother and
sister kept saying that he would
end up in trouble. All his friends
were in jail. By Spring he'd de-

cided that he'd made a mistake
and left for Florida to rejoin the
Navy.
Grandmother's Encouragement
On his way to Florida, Sim
mons stopped in Newport News,
Virginia, to visit his grandmother.
It was there that he got his first
encouragement in months. She
said to him, "Son, if you think
you can do it, why don't you
try?"
His grandfather found him a
job at the army base and the fol
lowing September, at the age of
twenty-one, he enrolled in the
high school at Newport News. He
had no college preparatory credits
so he took two Engligh courses,
two math courses, United States
history, world history, biology,
chemistry and continued working
at the base. He got straight A's
but still didn't have enough
credits to graduate.
At twenty-two he felt too old
to return to high school and he
decided to give up. His grand
mother told him to go to talk to
the director of admissions at
Hampton College which was a few
miles from Newport News. They
gave him an entrance examination
and admitted him without a high
school diploma.
At Hampton he was president
of his fraternity, the speech club,

the radio club and the veterans'
club. He also made the Dean's
List. He majored in sociology and
speech and drama and minored in
English.
After graduating from Hamp
ton, he taught for five years in
rural schools in North Carolina
and Virginia. Harvard then gave
him a fellowship and at the same
time, he was made Assistant Dean
of Men at Hampton. He received
his masters in counselling and
psychology from Harvard.
In 1963 Simmons began to
work with A Better Chance (ABC)
Program, which recruits minority
students for private schools. Its
headquarters are at Dartmoth. In
1965 SargeantShriver invided him
to Washington to be Deputy
Director of Upward Bound.
After four years as director of
ABC he helped to found Con
necticut Talent Assistance Co
operative (Conntac), which was
the first program of its kind in the
nation. Every college in the state
worked with the state and federal
governments to recruit minority
students. After a year, Simmons
accepted his position at Stanford.
As he got up to leave Simmons
said, "I guess the reason I'm in
this kind of work is that I know
that the minority student needs
the kind of encouragement my
grandmother gave to me."
