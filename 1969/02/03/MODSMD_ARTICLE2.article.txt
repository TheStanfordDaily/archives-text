on campus so that the taxpayers . . . can

selves."

nounced that it would place 13
more Jews on trial soon.
Maariv, which gave no source, said
Israeli officials had gotten across a warn
ing to Iraq.

cial way," said the paper, "informed
Iraq that Israel will not stand for the
hangng of Jews in market places and
any further harm to the remainder of
the Iraqi Jewish community will in the
end bring damage to the Bahgdad
regime—damage for which Israel will be
responsible in one way or another," that
they would not tolerate any more such
acts against Jews.

State College, said Sunday he thought
some teachers backed student revolts

establishment, you are praised for it,
you are told you are a bright boy," said
Hayakawa.

most militant Negro students at San
Francisco State retained their power by
"intimidation and gangsterism" and that
their aim was "simply to close the place
down."
He said his most immediate problem
is "establishing that kind of atmosphere
on campus so that the taxpayers . . . can
get confidence in our ability to run our
selves."

Hayakawa said that striking teachers
who reiarn to class with the start of
spring on Feb. 17 will be rein

docked tor their time on strike.
Israel Warns Iraq
(AP) —Israel has warned Iraq that if
any more Iraqi Jews are harmed, the
Baghdad regime will suffer reprisals, the
usually well-informed newspaper Maariv
said Sunday.
Israel's foreign ministry denied
knowledge of any such warning. But
anger has swept Israel since the exe
cution last Monday of 14 Iraqis, in
cluding nine Jews, on spy charges.
Israeli anger increased when Iraq an
nounced that it would place 13
more Jews on trial soon.
Maariv, which gave no source, said
Israeli officials had gotten across a warn
ing to Iraq.
"Official parties have, in an unoffi
cial way," said the paper, "informed
Iraq that Israel will not stand for the
hangng of Jews in market places and
any further harm to the remainder of
the Iraqi Jewish community will in the
end bring damage to the Bahgdad
regime—damage for which Israel will be
responsible in one way or another," that
they would not tolerate any more such
acts against Jews.
