# World Decays As Population Grows

Failure to teach the basic
principles of ecology—the inter
dependence of all living things and
their environment—to politicians,
agriculturists, and physical scien
tists may soon seal mankind's
doom, Stanford population bio
logist, Prof. Paul R. Ehrlich, told a
Chicago audience last week.
Speaking before the Planned
Parenthood Association-Chicago
Area on "Conservation of Man's
Environment is the Conservation
of Man," Prof. Ehrlich stated that
"even those who are aware of the
colossal magnitude of the popula
tion-food crisis tend to ignore the
seriousness of environmental
deterioration, or fail to see its
complex connection with the
population explosion."
Direct environmental assaults
on our health by smog, low-level
pesticide poisoning, polluted
water, and the like are extremely
serious, he said, but "the threat
from them is minor compared
with that posed by our heedless
destruction of the ecological
systems on which human ex
istence is absolutely dependent."
Prof. Ehrlich pointed out that
each of us depends on these eco
systems, among other things, for
every bit of food we eat, for the
oxygen we breathe, and for keep
ing our atmosphere free of am
monia. Ecologists have discovered
that the stability of these systems
is dependent on their complexity,
and that "man is the greatest sim
plifier of ecosystems the world
has ever seen."

The Stanford biologist at
tacked the "common fallacy that
environmental problems can be di
vorced from population growth."
Each additional person requires
that more energy be expended
through combustion, adding to
the thermal and chemical pol
lution of the atmosphere. His
wastes must be disposed of. More
non-renewable resources are con
sumed for his maintenance.
Thus each person adds to the
overall density of the population,
which in turn increases the proba
bility of worldwide pestilence.
"These problems are most aggra
vated by the rich peoples of the
developed countries, who are de
stroyers, consumers, and polluters
par excellence," said Prof.
Ehrlich.
"What is worse," he continues,
"frantic attempts to find and pro
duce food for today's burgeoning
millions show every sign of com
pleting the destruction of our
planet. On land, for instance, agri
culturists in futile pursuit of a
'green revolution' plan to increase
pesticide inputs. No sensible bi
ologist thinks that all synthetic
pesticides should be completely
banned, but neither does any
sensible biologist think that cur
rent practices are anything but
criminally stupid," Ehrlich said.
"Pesticides are one of man's
major tools for simplifying eco
systems, and thus destroying
them. It is becoming clear that the
sole long-term gainer in the pesti
cide game will be the profiteers of
the petrochemical industry.
