# Biologist Scolds Pope Paul
## 
### 
Pope Paul VI is "at best a bad
economist, a worse demographer,
and a terrible biologist" in the
opinion of a Roman Catholic bi
ologist from Stanford University.
Dr. John H. Thomas, an invited
speaker Sunday (Feb. 2) at the
Episcopal Diocesan Convention
being held at San Francisco's
Grace Cathedral, censured the
Pope for his conservative views on
birth control and population
problems.
"Paul does not recognize prob
lems of population in a realistic
way and his comprehension of the
laws of ecology approaches zero,"
said Dr. Thomas.
"Ecology, which deals with the
relationships between living organ
isms and their surroundings, un
fortunately is still not a part of
the thinking of most men. To me
there are two fundamental laws of
ecology.
"The firist is that we cannot
create anything; we cannot de
stroy anything; we can only
change the form of things.
Hauling Garbage
"Hauling San Francisco's gar
bage to Lassen County, for ex
ample, is not going to get rid of it.
We are rid of it here, but it is still
somewhere in our environment.

"Sooner or later part of it will
decay and oxidize. The organic
matter will be changed to water,
carbon dioxide, other gases, resi
dues, and probably into rats and
flies. And so we are faced with
more problems.
"The second law of ecology
states that an action in one place
produces an effect in the same
place and usually in some other
place. The greater the action, the
more likely it is that the effect
will be widespread and often ir
reversible.
Dangers of DDT
"For instance, the use of DDT
in California, mainly in the val
leys, has resulted in its accumu
lations in the fat bodies of high
altitude Sierra Nevada frogs. And
we are just beginning to be aware
of the dangers of DDT.
"A corollary to these two
laws," continued the STanford bi
ologist, "is the concept of a buf
fering system. Our world is large,
but limited. It can and has buf
fered many changes in the past.
However, the buffering capacity
of the world is finite and in many
instances we are already exceeding
it. Atmospheric pollution is an ex
ample.
