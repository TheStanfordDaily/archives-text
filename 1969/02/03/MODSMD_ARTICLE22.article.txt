## Tribe Nips USC, Killed By UCLA 
### FRED MANN 
UCLA's fantastic national
championship basketball team
totally destroyed Stanford Satur
day night, in what must be re
garded as the classic mismatch of
the year.
The Bruins simply clobbered
the Indians inside, outside, on the
backboards, and on defense. The
final score was 98-61.
But the weekend was not a
total loss for the visitors. Friday
night, they invaded LA Sports
Arena and stayed on top of USC
all evening to pull off a minor up
set victory, 66-56.
In the big one, Lew Alcindor
and his talented teammates were
overpowering in all areas of the
game, and easily proved to the
12,190 fans why they are number
one.
Alcindor scored at will over a
helpl ess Bill Palmer. Lynn
Shackelford high arched jumpers
from over 25 feet away. Curtis
Rowe helped sweep the back
boards, and kept Stanford's Don
Griffin so bothered in the first
half, that most of his shots barely
hit the rim of the basket.
Kenny Heitz and newcomer
John Vallely directed the attack
and passed beautifully. Alcindor's
back up man, Steve Patterson,
who almost came to Stanford,
banged in 8 points and added to
the artistic slaughter.
Another Bruin Record
Coach Howie Dallmar's
cagers tried their best, but were

simply no match for the Bruins
who have now won 32 in a row,
and are 16-0 on the season. With
the win, UCLA tied a Pacific
Eight Conference record for most
consecutive league victories, with
36. The record is currently held
by John Wooden's Bruins of
1963-66.
The Cards stayed close for
the first four minutes, by control
ling the ball, and hitting a few
outside shots. Bill Halligan scored
on a backdoor trap layup to
spark the early Stanford drive.
But UCLA had not yet
warmed up. After a Bruin time
out, they returned to the court in
a 3-1-1 zone, with Alcindor out
on top. Whenever the Tribe would
move the ball down to the cor
ners, big Lew would double up on
the ball and foil any shot attempt.
The Bruins began to run at
that point, and the contest was all
but over. In the next five minutes,
the champs outscored their op
ponents, 16-2, and Stanford was
dead.
Stanford Stuck
The UCLA defense kept
Griffin and Dennis O'Neill way
outside. The only place the
Indians could move the ball was
around the midcourt line.
Alcindor crammed any inside shot
attempts, and Rowe leaped to the
ceiling in batting down numerous
outside tries.
Stanford was ice cold all
game, hitting only 34.7 per cent
from the floor to UCLA's 53.6.

Much of the shooting trouble was
the result of the Bruin's defense.
Griffin had to hurry his shots all
game, and although he amazingly
still chalked up 20 points, he was
only 7-23 from the field.
The mere presence of
Alcindor, Rowe, and all the
others, has got to be intimidating
to the opposition. Their repu
tation size and strength are almost
as powerful as their talent.
Big Lew led all scorers with
27 even though he sat out a good
part of the second half. Shackel
ford and Heitz hit 13 apiece for
UCLA.
The best effort for Stanford
was turned in by sophomore Mike
Michel of Anaheim, playing be
fore home town folk. Michel tal
lied 13. O'Neill had 8.
Quarterback
Alcindor, aside from his
many known talents also showed
himself to be quite a long distance
passer. Lew connected on four
length of the court passes against
a slow-getting-back Stanford de
fense.
Coach Dallmar was lavish in
his praise for the team that beat
his to a pulp. "I don't think
there's been a greater front line in
the history of college basketball,"
he said.
USC Falls
Just the night before, the
glum coach had seen his own
front line put on a fine demon
stration in beating USC.
In this game, Griffin was hot
ter than ever, nailing 26 points,
most of them in the first half. The
Trojans played without their big
center Ron Taylor, who was ill,
and they sorely missed his defen
sive strength. Palmer and Mai
McElwain had free run of the

boards, and started many Stan
ford breaks with their passes.
Southern Cal started in a
man-to-man defense that the
Cards ate up, scoring from every
place. When SC switched to a
zone however, Stanford was
stymied, and the Trojans began to
close the gap.
Little Mack Calvin came off
the bench for Bob Boyd's team
and hit four quick field goals mid
way through the first half, to
tighten the ?amo to 21-15. Up to
that point, USC had not scored
from the field in seven minutes.
The first 20 minutes for SC
were not particularly inspiring.
Aside from Calvin, the team hit
only 3-24 from the floor. High
scoring Ernie Powell did not hit
until 1:56 remained in the game!
The second period was fairly
even, leaving Stanford's fine first
half play as the difference in the
contest. Calvin had 25 for the
losers.

In this game, Griffin was hot
ter than ever, nailing 26 points,
most of them in the first half. The
Trojans played without their big
center Ron Taylor, who was ill,
and they sorely missed his defen
sive strength. Palmer and Mai
McElwain had free run of the

boards, and started many Stan
ford breaks with their passes.
Southern Cal started in a
man-to-man defense that the
Cards ate up, scoring from every
place. When SC switched to a
zone however, Stanford was
stymied, and the Trojans began to
close the gap.
Little Mack Calvin came off
the bench for Bob Boyd's team
and hit four quick field goals mid
way through the first half, to
tighten the ?amo to 21-15. Up to
that point, USC had not scored
from the field in seven minutes.
The first 20 minutes for SC
were not particularly inspiring.
Aside from Calvin, the team hit
only 3-24 from the floor. High
scoring Ernie Powell did not hit
until 1:56 remained in the game!
The second period was fairly
even, leaving Stanford's fine first
half play as the difference in the
contest. Calvin had 25 for the
losers.
UCLA's fantastic national
championship basketball team
totally destroyed Stanford Satur
day night, in what must be re
garded as the classic mismatch of
the year.
The Bruins simply clobbered
the Indians inside, outside, on the
backboards, and on defense. The
final score was 98-61.
But the weekend was not a
total loss for the visitors. Friday
night, they invaded LA Sports
Arena and stayed on top of USC
all evening to pull off a minor up
set victory, 66-56.
In the big one, Lew Alcindor
and his talented teammates were
overpowering in all areas of the
game, and easily proved to the
12,190 fans why they are number
one.
Alcindor scored at will over a
helpl ess Bill Palmer. Lynn
Shackelford high arched jumpers
from over 25 feet away. Curtis
Rowe helped sweep the back
boards, and kept Stanford's Don
Griffin so bothered in the first
half, that most of his shots barely
hit the rim of the basket.
Kenny Heitz and newcomer
John Vallely directed the attack
and passed beautifully. Alcindor's
back up man, Steve Patterson,
who almost came to Stanford,
banged in 8 points and added to
the artistic slaughter.
Another Bruin Record
Coach Howie Dallmar's
cagers tried their best, but were

simply no match for the Bruins
who have now won 32 in a row,
and are 16-0 on the season. With
the win, UCLA tied a Pacific
Eight Conference record for most
consecutive league victories, with
36. The record is currently held
by John Wooden's Bruins of
1963-66.
The Cards stayed close for
the first four minutes, by control
ling the ball, and hitting a few
outside shots. Bill Halligan scored
on a backdoor trap layup to
spark the early Stanford drive.
But UCLA had not yet
warmed up. After a Bruin time
out, they returned to the court in
a 3-1-1 zone, with Alcindor out
on top. Whenever the Tribe would
move the ball down to the cor
ners, big Lew would double up on
the ball and foil any shot attempt.
The Bruins began to run at
that point, and the contest was all
but over. In the next five minutes,
the champs outscored their op
ponents, 16-2, and Stanford was
dead.
Stanford Stuck
The UCLA defense kept
Griffin and Dennis O'Neill way
outside. The only place the
Indians could move the ball was
around the midcourt line.
Alcindor crammed any inside shot
attempts, and Rowe leaped to the
ceiling in batting down numerous
outside tries.
Stanford was ice cold all
game, hitting only 34.7 per cent
from the floor to UCLA's 53.6.

Much of the shooting trouble was
the result of the Bruin's defense.
Griffin had to hurry his shots all
game, and although he amazingly
still chalked up 20 points, he was
only 7-23 from the field.
The mere presence of
Alcindor, Rowe, and all the
others, has got to be intimidating
to the opposition. Their repu
tation size and strength are almost
as powerful as their talent.
Big Lew led all scorers with
27 even though he sat out a good
part of the second half. Shackel
ford and Heitz hit 13 apiece for
UCLA.
The best effort for Stanford
was turned in by sophomore Mike
Michel of Anaheim, playing be
fore home town folk. Michel tal
lied 13. O'Neill had 8.
Quarterback
Alcindor, aside from his
many known talents also showed
himself to be quite a long distance
passer. Lew connected on four
length of the court passes against
a slow-getting-back Stanford de
fense.
Coach Dallmar was lavish in
his praise for the team that beat
his to a pulp. "I don't think
there's been a greater front line in
the history of college basketball,"
he said.

only 7-23 from the field.
The mere presence of
Alcindor, Rowe, and all the
others, has got to be intimidating
to the opposition. Their repu
tation size and strength are almost
as powerful as their talent.
Big Lew led all scorers with
27 even though he sat out a good
part of the second half. Shackel
ford and Heitz hit 13 apiece for
UCLA.
The best effort for Stanford
was turned in by sophomore Mike
Michel of Anaheim, playing be
fore home town folk. Michel tal
lied 13. O'Neill had 8.
Quarterback
Alcindor, aside from his
many known talents also showed
himself to be quite a long distance
passer. Lew connected on four
length of the court passes against
a slow-getting-back Stanford de
fense.
Coach Dallmar was lavish in
his praise for the team that beat
his to a pulp. "I don't think
there's been a greater front line in
the history of college basketball,"
he said.
USC Falls
Just the night before, the
glum coach had seen his own
front line put on a fine demon
stration in beating USC.
In this game, Griffin was hot
ter than ever, nailing 26 points,
most of them in the first half. The
Trojans played without their big
center Ron Taylor, who was ill,
and they sorely missed his defen
sive strength. Palmer and Mai
McElwain had free run of the

boards, and started many Stan
ford breaks with their passes.
Southern Cal started in a
man-to-man defense that the
Cards ate up, scoring from every
place. When SC switched to a
zone however, Stanford was
stymied, and the Trojans began to
close the gap.
Little Mack Calvin came off
the bench for Bob Boyd's team
and hit four quick field goals mid
way through the first half, to
tighten the ?amo to 21-15. Up to
that point, USC had not scored
from the field in seven minutes.
The first 20 minutes for SC
were not particularly inspiring.
Aside from Calvin, the team hit
only 3-24 from the floor. High
scoring Ernie Powell did not hit
until 1:56 remained in the game!
The second period was fairly
even, leaving Stanford's fine first
half play as the difference in the
contest. Calvin had 25 for the
losers.
UCLA's fantastic national
championship basketball team
totally destroyed Stanford Satur
day night, in what must be re
garded as the classic mismatch of
the year.
The Bruins simply clobbered
the Indians inside, outside, on the
backboards, and on defense. The
final score was 98-61.
But the weekend was not a
total loss for the visitors. Friday
night, they invaded LA Sports
Arena and stayed on top of USC
all evening to pull off a minor up
set victory, 66-56.
In the big one, Lew Alcindor
and his talented teammates were
overpowering in all areas of the
game, and easily proved to the
12,190 fans why they are number
one.
Alcindor scored at will over a
helpl ess Bill Palmer. Lynn
Shackelford high arched jumpers
from over 25 feet away. Curtis
Rowe helped sweep the back
boards, and kept Stanford's Don
Griffin so bothered in the first
half, that most of his shots barely
hit the rim of the basket.
Kenny Heitz and newcomer
John Vallely directed the attack
and passed beautifully. Alcindor's
back up man, Steve Patterson,
who almost came to Stanford,
banged in 8 points and added to
the artistic slaughter.
Another Bruin Record
Coach Howie Dallmar's
cagers tried their best, but were

simply no match for the Bruins
who have now won 32 in a row,
and are 16-0 on the season. With
the win, UCLA tied a Pacific
Eight Conference record for most
consecutive league victories, with
36. The record is currently held
by John Wooden's Bruins of
1963-66.
The Cards stayed close for
the first four minutes, by control
ling the ball, and hitting a few
outside shots. Bill Halligan scored
on a backdoor trap layup to
spark the early Stanford drive.
But UCLA had not yet
warmed up. After a Bruin time
out, they returned to the court in
a 3-1-1 zone, with Alcindor out
on top. Whenever the Tribe would
move the ball down to the cor
ners, big Lew would double up on
the ball and foil any shot attempt.
The Bruins began to run at
that point, and the contest was all
but over. In the next five minutes,
the champs outscored their op
ponents, 16-2, and Stanford was
dead.
Stanford Stuck
The UCLA defense kept
Griffin and Dennis O'Neill way
outside. The only place the
Indians could move the ball was
around the midcourt line.
Alcindor crammed any inside shot
attempts, and Rowe leaped to the
ceiling in batting down numerous
outside tries.
Stanford was ice cold all
game, hitting only 34.7 per cent
from the floor to UCLA's 53.6.

Much of the shooting trouble was
the result of the Bruin's defense.
Griffin had to hurry his shots all
game, and although he amazingly
still chalked up 20 points, he was
only 7-23 from the field.
