# Ruggers Roll Past Capitol Club, 36-0
## 
### DAVE NOLAND 
Stanford's rugby team had a
good workout Saturday for next
weekend's match at USC.
Officially, the affair was
called a match against
Sacramento's Capitol Rugby Club,
but the pitifully outmanned Caps
served not as opponents, but as
sacrificial lambs to keep the Stan
ford backs in shape for next week.
For the record, the score was
36-0, and it easily could have been
50-0.
The Stanford domination of
the match was overwhelming. The
ball was in Stanford's territory for
perhaps 10 minutes of the 90 min
ute game. The Caps never pene
trated the Tribe's 25 yard line,
and indeed never even managed to
get the ball out past the first five
eights position. About the only
thing that they did better than the
Tribe was yelling "Mark!" and
that was purely in self-defense.
The Indians meanwhile were
scoring almost at will. Bernie Bays
had three tries, Jim Kaufmann
scored two in less than a minute,
and Jon Huss, fullback Mike
Forster, and first five-eights Ray
Wilson all whipped in one apiece.
And of course Leon
Harterickson met his weekly point
quota with a penalty kick and a
couple of conversions.
The loudest cheers, however,

were reserved for prop Joe Neal, a
fourth year med student, who is
playing his seventh season with
Stanford.
Neal rose from the ano
nymity of the scrum to the giddy
heights of glory by kicking a con
version, thereby etching his name
into the proverbial scoring
column.
Ray Wilson also got into the
act, converting Bays' third try for
the last three points of the match.
The only sour note of the
afternoon was Dick Ragsdale's
pulled hamstring. Coach Pete
Kmetovic said Rags may not be
well enough to start next week
against SC.
The second team came from
behind to beat the Palo Alto
Rugby Club, 19-11.
Tim Murphy, Bernard Gust,
Dennis Phillips and Dick Bendig
all scored tries for Stanford, Jody
Graves connected on a penalty
kick and two conversions.
Doug "Legs" Logan and
"Captain Hook" Jessup thrilled
the capacity crowd with their
graceful moves and general all
around studliness.
