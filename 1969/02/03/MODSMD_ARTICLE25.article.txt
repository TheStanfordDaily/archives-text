# Long Season Opens For Baseball Team Tuesday
## 
### DAN BERNSTEIN 
An optimistic coach and a
determined squad of athletes will
take on the Pittsburgh Rookies,
Tuesday at 2:30 p.m., as the Stan
ford Indians inaugurate the 1969
baseball season at the sunken dia
mond.
The Indians, whose 36-12-1
record was good enough for a
second place finish behind USC's
Trojans last year, again find them
selves in the thick of the race for
the Pacific 8 championship. Pitch
ing will be the main obstacle for
the team to overcome since Sandy
Vance, Don Rose and Harvey
Shank, all members of last year's
pitching unit will not return this
season. Vance and Rose both
signed professional contracts with
a year of eligibility remaining.
Coach Ray Young is still en
thusiastic about this phase of the
game, however, as righthanders

Rod Poteete and Phil Keller, both
starters on the 1968 squad, head
line an inexperienced staff with a
high degree of winning potential.
Although Keller was forced out of
the pitching box and into the in
field because of the injuries suf
fered by the team early last sea
son, Coach Young is hopeful that
he will be able to regain the pitch
ing form which was so impressive
before the switch was made.
Other pitching roles are ex
pected to be filled by Bob Moore,
who is currently recovering from a
football injury, and Bolt) Sharp
and Ben Burch, two junior right
handers who didn't throw much
last year but had outstanding
records as freshmen. Other hope
fuls include two sophomores,
Steve Dunning and Bruce Schoen,
also righthanders with good fresh
man records. Inexperienced as it
may seem, Young looks for the
pitching to be a strong asset to the
1969 Indians.
Defensively, the Stanford in
field will be studded with seniors,
and a carbon copy of 1968. Bob
Edie will be behind the plate,
two-time Ail-American Mark Mar
quess will be at first base, Mike
Ammirato will be at second, with
Russ Tweet at shortstop. Chuck
Williams and Bob Boone will both
see duty at third base, with Wil
liams filling in when Boone is
called upon to share the pitching
chores.

Seniors Jack Hodges and
Ronnie Shotts will fill two of the
outfield positions with sopho
mores Glenn Davis, Neil
Hoffacker, and Jack Lynn, and
possibly Chuck Williams vying for
the third slot.
The Indians should be good
with the bat this year, with hitting
leader Mark Marquess at the helm
after a tremendous season in
1968. Bob Boone, who played
summer ball in Alaska and batted
at a .400 clip with 12 home runs
and a team-leading total of runs
batted-in, also looms as another
threat to opposing pitchers. Russ
Tweet, who Young considers to
be the best shortstop in the con
ference, hit .360 in limited action
last year, and should add greatly
to the Indian hitting attack.
Young sees the Indians as a
running ball club, with both Mar
quess and second baseman Mike
Arrimirato promising to be formi
dable threats on the basepaths. Al
though Stanford stole a record
number of bases last year, it is
hoped that the output in that de
partment will be even greater in
1969.
In assessing the other teams,
Young cited USC, UCLA, Cal, and
Washington State as the big guns
in this year's Pac-8 race. What
USC lost through graduation it
regained through transfers.
