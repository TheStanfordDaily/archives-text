# Weekly Preview Of Campus Films
## 
### TODD McCARTHY 
Another average week for films
on campus; there is at least one
great picture being shown every
night.
In Geology 320 on Tuesday
and Wednesday, Clive Miller is
presenting, "a great double
bill,"â€”Preston Struges' The Palin
Beach Story and Bette Davis in
Now, Voyager. Palm Beach Story,
a marvelous comedy-satire, made
by Sturges during his prime years,
stars Claudette Colbert, Joel
McCrea and Rudy Vallee. Now,
Voyager is described by several
sources as an excessively romantic
woman's picture, but Clive says,
"Come and you'll cry your hearts
out . .
The Western Civ film series this
week is presenting Eisenstein's
classic, Alexander Nevsky. Dealing
with the confrontation between
Teutonic and Russian forces in
1242, the film features the re
nown Battle on the Ice, which is
considered the father of more re
cent spectacular battle scenes. It
will be shown at 4:15 and 7:30 on
both Tuesday and Wednesday in
Cubberley.
The I-Center film series is
screening two extraordinary and
highly influential films on Thurs
day at Cubberley. Blood of a Poet
was French surrealist, Jean
Cocteau's first film. Made in
1930, it was considered so bizarre
that Cocteau didn't make another
film for ten years. Stan Brakhage's
Dog Star Man is considered to be
one of the major works of the
American underground cinema.
Made over a five year period, it
features many innovative tech- r
niques, such as quadruple-imposi
tion, and is a remarkable personal
expression in the film medium.
Fires on the Plain, being shown
at Cubberley on Friday night at
7:30 and 10, is one of the top
achievements of the Japanese cin
ema. It tells of a desperate strug
gle for survival which results in
cannibalism, and was highly
praised by Pauline Kael:
"Cautious as I am about superla
tives," she said, "I think the term j
'masterpiece' must be applied to j
Fires on the Plain. It has the dis
turbing power of great art: it
doesn't leave you quite the same."
The Marx Brothers' A Night at
the Opera is Tresidder's Friday
Comedy feature. Though, slightly
overpraised (several of the brot
hers' films are more consistently ;
funny than this one), Opera still
contains some uproariously funny |
sequences. Showing with this is a
Keystone Cops' short, The Knock
out.
Two very famous underground
films are being shown at Tresid
der's Friday Experimental film
series at 11 p.m. in Geology 320. *
Fireworks was made by Kenneth

Anger when he was just 15 years
old at a cost of about $50. Anger
himself appears in the picture and
its "climax" may shotk more than
a few members of 4he audience.
Stan Brakhage's Window Water
Baby -Moving is also strong fare,
for it shows Brakhage's wife
"pregnant, taking a bath, giving
birth, and Brakhage's joyful face,
photographed by Mrs. Brakhage
minutes after the birth." Also be
ing shown are Early Abstractions,
Time of Locust and The Gray Un
namable.
Children of Paradise is one of
the greatest and most important
French films ever produced. Made
under the confines of the Nazis
between 1943 and 1945, the pic
ture according to Bosley Crowther
was intended "to soothe and re
fresh the national spirit in a time
of deep distress." Crowther lists it
as one of the "50 greatest motion
pictures of all time."
Two weeks ago I mistakenly
wrote that the Sunday flick was
Dr. Strangelove but, finally, it is
here. Again, if you have only seen
it on the tube, it is worth catching
again. Stanley Kubrick directed
this marvelous, biting satire on the
military "fail-safe" system.
