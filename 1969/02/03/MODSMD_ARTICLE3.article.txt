# SDS Slates March On Judicial Chairman
## 
### 
The ranks of Stanford Students for a
Democratic Society (SDS) met last
night to discuss methods of approaching
the Judicial Council procedures which
begin Tuesday. Approximately thirty
students have received summons con
cerning the disruption of the Trustees
meeting on January 14 and have re
ceived individual appointments with the
Council.
SDS has decided, to march en masse
from Tresidder to the Law School to
morrow morning and present five re
quests to Professor Jack Friedenthal,
chairman of the council. These sugges
tions include: (l)a group arraignment
at that time, (2) an open continuing
hearing in a large auditorium open to all
members of the community, (3) a re
quest for legal aid financed by the uni
versity, (4) pictures of those Trustees
present at the meeting in question to
enable those charged to supoena desired
witnesses, (5) that the political implica
tions of the disruption (Stanford's in
volvement in Southeast Asia) are not
separated from the court's inquiries.
They plan to use the Councils system
"to get whatever we can out of it."

Also present at the meeting was
John Henney, a student judicial aide on
the Council, who delivered two addi
tional summons. Henney is allegedly
being paid three dollars per hour for his
services by the University.
SDS members also criticized the
Council for its "kangaroo court" tactics
and the Daily's "biased" reporting of
the Faculty Club demonstration.
An SDS car pool left this morning
for Richmond to aid Standard Oil work
ers in their strike. SDS members hope
this action will enable student-workers
to form a coalition in their attempts to
obtain similar objectives.
SDS is also sponsoring three lectures
on Cuba by Edward Boorstein, an
economist who worked under Che
Guevara in the Cuban National Bank
and Bank of Foreign Commerce be
tween 1960 and 1963.

ing authorities, lectures include "Cuba:
Case Study in U.S. Imperialism," "Ten
