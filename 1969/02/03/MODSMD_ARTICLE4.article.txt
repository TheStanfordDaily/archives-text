# Funds Transfer Blocked
## Hayes Vetoes Two LASSU Bills 
### DAVID DAVENPORT 
With the first presidential negation of
LASSU legislation in nearly four years,
ASSU President Denis Hayes vetoed two
LASSU measures Friday afternoon.
One bill was to transfer $5000 of
funds which were previously marked for

the Professorial Commission into gener
al contingency, and the other was to
grant $4000 to the Speech Association
from general contingency.
Outlining his position on the vetoes
in a letter to LASSU Speaker Yale
Braunstein, Hayes stated that the first
bill was refused because it was "the
unanimous opinion of all the officers of
the Association that the $5000 is
needed for the operating reserves of the
Student's Organizations Fund."
Officers of the Speech Association
are now preparing a statement concern
ing Hayes' vetoes.
$9000 Disagreement
Originally the $5000 was part of a
larger appropriation to bring an ASSU
professor to Stanford. Since only part
of the funds were necessary for the pro
fessor, $5000 remained free for
LASSU's use.
David Swift, Student Financial
Manager, recommended in his report to
LASSU Wednesday night that the legis
lature place the $5000 into operating re
serves from which money had earlier
been removed.
Swift hoped to have money returned
to operating reserves before attempting
to bargain with university officials for
an increase in LASSU funds, antici
pating that the move might help show a
greater sense of fiscal responsibility in
LASSU.

Hayes supplied a number of reasons
for refusing to approve the grant to the
Speech Association. He noted that the
$4000 bill would mean a total of $7000
given to the association this year from
LASSU.
Questions Value
He voiced the opinion that "the
Speech Association is simply not worth
$7000 to the Stanford student body."
Another consideration dealt with the
fact that this was the Speech Associa
tion's second request for funds this
year. The ASSU By-Laws specify that
an organization can receive ASSU funds
only with the understanding that
"nothing further will be appropriated
during the ensuing year save in the event
of an extraordinary emergency."
Hayes closed his letter to LASSU by
-erommending that the Speech appro
priation be put to a referendum of the
student body. "The opposing sides in
LASSU are too well defined to allow for
open consideration of this emotional
issue."
Braunstein received the vetoes Friday
night and stated that he would report
the matter to LASSU at the next regular
meeting, which apparently will be next
week. A motion to override the vetoes
will then be in order, but will require a
two-thirds vote.
One of the most controversial issues
throughout the consideration of the ap

propriation has been the question of
Speech Association members packing
the LASSU meetings.
Mayes Commends
Opponents of the bill claim that
speech people "raid and run." That is,
they attend only meetings when their
money is to be considered, receive the
funds, and leave.
In his letter to Braunstein, Hayes
commended the members of the Speech
Association for their participation in
student government this year. "Al
though I'm sure they were motivated by
fnancial considerations to attend their
first LASSU meeting last fall," he said,
"They have continued to attend even
when LASSU was not dealing with mat
ters of direct relevance to their organi
zation."
"They have generally constituted the
most sensible and most articulate group
in LASSU."
The final LASSU vote on the speech
appropriation was 47-10, with one
representative abstaining. A comparison
of voting records with the Speech As
sociation membership list showed that
eighteen speech members voted on the
bill Wed. night.
As Ron Oster, chairman of the De
bate Council, noted: "Even without the
Speech Association's LASSU representa
tives, the appropriation received 73 per
cent of the remaining vote."

With the first presidential negation of
LASSU legislation in nearly four years,
ASSU President Denis Hayes vetoed two
LASSU measures Friday afternoon.
One bill was to transfer $5000 of
funds which were previously marked for

the Professorial Commission into gener
al contingency, and the other was to
grant $4000 to the Speech Association
from general contingency.
Outlining his position on the vetoes
in a letter to LASSU Speaker Yale
Braunstein, Hayes stated that the first
bill was refused because it was "the
unanimous opinion of all the officers of
the Association that the $5000 is
needed for the operating reserves of the
Student's Organizations Fund."
Officers of the Speech Association
are now preparing a statement concern
ing Hayes' vetoes.
$9000 Disagreement
Originally the $5000 was part of a
larger appropriation to bring an ASSU
professor to Stanford. Since only part
of the funds were necessary for the pro
fessor, $5000 remained free for
LASSU's use.
David Swift, Student Financial
Manager, recommended in his report to
LASSU Wednesday night that the legis
lature place the $5000 into operating re
serves from which money had earlier
been removed.
Swift hoped to have money returned
to operating reserves before attempting
to bargain with university officials for
an increase in LASSU funds, antici
pating that the move might help show a
greater sense of fiscal responsibility in
LASSU.

Hayes supplied a number of reasons
for refusing to approve the grant to the
Speech Association. He noted that the
$4000 bill would mean a total of $7000
given to the association this year from
LASSU.
Questions Value
He voiced the opinion that "the
Speech Association is simply not worth
$7000 to the Stanford student body."
Another consideration dealt with the
fact that this was the Speech Associa
tion's second request for funds this
year. The ASSU By-Laws specify that
an organization can receive ASSU funds
only with the understanding that
"nothing further will be appropriated
during the ensuing year save in the event
of an extraordinary emergency."
Hayes closed his letter to LASSU by
-erommending that the Speech appro
priation be put to a referendum of the
student body. "The opposing sides in
LASSU are too well defined to allow for
open consideration of this emotional
issue."
Braunstein received the vetoes Friday
night and stated that he would report
the matter to LASSU at the next regular
meeting, which apparently will be next
week. A motion to override the vetoes
will then be in order, but will require a
two-thirds vote.
One of the most controversial issues
throughout the consideration of the ap

propriation has been the question of
Speech Association members packing
the LASSU meetings.
Mayes Commends
Opponents of the bill claim that
speech people "raid and run." That is,
they attend only meetings when their
money is to be considered, receive the
funds, and leave.
In his letter to Braunstein, Hayes
commended the members of the Speech
Association for their participation in
student government this year. "Al
though I'm sure they were motivated by
fnancial considerations to attend their
first LASSU meeting last fall," he said,
"They have continued to attend even
when LASSU was not dealing with mat
ters of direct relevance to their organi
zation."
"They have generally constituted the
most sensible and most articulate group
in LASSU."
The final LASSU vote on the speech
appropriation was 47-10, with one
representative abstaining. A comparison
of voting records with the Speech As
sociation membership list showed that
eighteen speech members voted on the
bill Wed. night.
As Ron Oster, chairman of the De
bate Council, noted: "Even without the
Speech Association's LASSU representa
tives, the appropriation received 73 per
cent of the remaining vote."
