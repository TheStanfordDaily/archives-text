# Beta Chi Bust Nets Non-Student
## 
### CRAIG WILSON 
In what is apparently the first drug
arrest in a Stanford living residence,
plainclothesmen arrested John "Ty"
Fosdick a non-student late Friday after
noon at the Beta Chi fraternity house
and charged him with possession of
marijuana.
The officers, from both Santa Clara
and San Mateo County, took Fosdick to
San Jose for booking. He was originally
charged with possession of marijuana,
possession of dangerous drugs, and sale
of marijuana. However, on Saturday,
Santa Clara authorities only listed the
first two charges. The status of the third
charge is presently unclear.
Fosdick was released Saturday after
noon on $1250 bail. He is scheduled to
appear in San Jose for arraignment on
February 13.

Details of the arrest have been
sketchy since the police report has not
yet been filed and few students were
witnesses to the arrest.
According to Resident Assistant
Charles Kuntz the arrest was set up by
an undercover man who closely re
sembled a student.
"The undercover man came here to
buy, and he got in touch with this boy
who is a guest here.
"The guy bought from him and
officers came and arrested him."
The arrest occurred shortly before
5:00 p.m.
Charles Field a friend of Fosdicks,
said that "the police must have felt that
there was something going on here.
"The informer was sent over, a guy
of student age. The guy came in, Tv was
in the house and the contact was made.
"Five or six policemen immediately
came after the deal was made."
Fosdick, 22, has been a guest at Beta
Chi since the end of August when he
began living in a downstairs living quar
ters.
He is from New York and is cur
rently an employee of Graham-Bond in
San Francisco and manages. a rock
group.
According to Kuntz he does not eat
his meals at the fraternity house and is
simply a guest of some friends in the
house.
Both Dean of Students Joel Smith
and Associate Dean of Students Willard
Wyman were out of town and could not
b<* reached for comment.
According to Kuntz, Tom Amis the
President of the House called the Dean
after the police got there. They arrived
during the arrest.
"They were very surprised. In fact
they looked more shocked than anyone
else here."
When The DAILY called on Sunday
afternoon the Stanford Police had still
not been informed of the arrest.
Stanford Police Sergeant Hermann
Williams was on duty at the time of the
arrest and stated that "this is within the
Sheriff's jurisdiction. They can do what
they want. We were not informed."
Various descriptions by Beta Chi resi
dents said the informer, who strongly
resembled a student, was six feet tall,
medium to heavy set, had red hair with
long sideburns and acne.
The Santa Clara County Sheriff's De
partment said that the Fosdick had in
his possession 2 kilos or approximately
4.4 pounds of marijuana. A full report is
expected today.
Early last month John Lanthier, a
student, was arrested and charged with
possession of marijuana after 38 lids
were found in a locker registered to his
name.

charged with possession of marijuana,
possession of dangerous drugs, and sale
of marijuana. However, on Saturday,
Santa Clara authorities only listed the
first two charges. The status of the third
charge is presently unclear.
Fosdick was released Saturday after
noon on $1250 bail. He is scheduled to
appear in San Jose for arraignment on
February 13.

Details of the arrest have been
sketchy since the police report has not
yet been filed and few students were
witnesses to the arrest.
According to Resident Assistant
Charles Kuntz the arrest was set up by
an undercover man who closely re
sembled a student.
"The undercover man came here to
buy, and he got in touch with this boy
who is a guest here.
"The guy bought from him and
officers came and arrested him."
The arrest occurred shortly before
5:00 p.m.
Charles Field a friend of Fosdicks,
said that "the police must have felt that
there was something going on here.
"The informer was sent over, a guy
of student age. The guy came in, Tv was
in the house and the contact was made.
"Five or six policemen immediately
came after the deal was made."
Fosdick, 22, has been a guest at Beta
Chi since the end of August when he
began living in a downstairs living quar
ters.
He is from New York and is cur
rently an employee of Graham-Bond in
San Francisco and manages. a rock
group.
According to Kuntz he does not eat
his meals at the fraternity house and is
simply a guest of some friends in the
house.
Both Dean of Students Joel Smith
and Associate Dean of Students Willard
Wyman were out of town and could not
b<* reached for comment.
According to Kuntz, Tom Amis the
President of the House called the Dean
after the police got there. They arrived
during the arrest.
"They were very surprised. In fact
they looked more shocked than anyone
else here."
When The DAILY called on Sunday
afternoon the Stanford Police had still
not been informed of the arrest.
Stanford Police Sergeant Hermann
Williams was on duty at the time of the
arrest and stated that "this is within the
Sheriff's jurisdiction. They can do what
they want. We were not informed."
Various descriptions by Beta Chi resi
dents said the informer, who strongly
resembled a student, was six feet tall,
medium to heavy set, had red hair with
long sideburns and acne.
The Santa Clara County Sheriff's De
partment said that the Fosdick had in
his possession 2 kilos or approximately
4.4 pounds of marijuana. A full report is
expected today.
Early last month John Lanthier, a
student, was arrested and charged with
possession of marijuana after 38 lids
were found in a locker registered to his
name.
In what is apparently the first drug
arrest in a Stanford living residence,
plainclothesmen arrested John "Ty"
Fosdick a non-student late Friday after
noon at the Beta Chi fraternity house
and charged him with possession of
marijuana.
The officers, from both Santa Clara
and San Mateo County, took Fosdick to
San Jose for booking. He was originally
charged with possession of marijuana,
possession of dangerous drugs, and sale
of marijuana. However, on Saturday,
Santa Clara authorities only listed the
first two charges. The status of the third
charge is presently unclear.
