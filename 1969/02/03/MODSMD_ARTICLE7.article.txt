# A 						Turkey or Not?
## 
### 
The question of whether you are hold
ing a journalistic turkey in your hands is
only for you to judge. A turkey or not, it is
rather obvious that some mutations oc
cured over the weekend. Most notably the
front page now has six rather than seven
columns, and the flag, The Stanford Daily,
is set in a new type face.
The editorial page is free of advertising
and full of opinion, something we hope will
continue, though ads have a way of de
manding highest priority. Diversity of
opinion, if lacking today, will soon be pres
ent if our search for new columnists and car
toonists achieves success. Just call Margie at
The Daily if you want to write a column.
There is not much to say about the
news. We haven't changed the news over
the weekend. Not that we will insist on
covering only crisis and confrontation
stories. We hope to touch all bases and re
port on news generated by the right and
middle as well as the left. We do not at
tempt to control or manage the news.
Those who cry The Daily serves as folio for
SDS might better direct their attention
toward offering alternatives to SDS. We
won't cover SDS if it is not making news.

Perhaps The Daily mirrors the campus
more than many readers care to admit.
People clamor for wider news coverage, yet
the great majority of Stanford students re
main apathetic about the University around
them and reporting apathy continually is
rather dull reading. We may reflect the fact
that radicals and dissent make more waves
on campus than people studying in the
library.
While one man's objectivity is another
man's bias, you have a right to expect our
coverage to be fair and complete. The
reams of letters on the SDS encounter with
conservatives last Wednesday only confirms
that no single person can claim total objec
tivity. However, if you are angered by our
reporting, please write us a letter. Far bet
ter, why not join the staff and make certain
that improvements are made.
Wilbur dining hall eggs and The Daily
may make or fracture your morning, but
we hope we can occasionally bring some
cheer into your warmed-over oatmeal.
Good humor is the most difficult of arts. In
a community of more than 20,000 there
must be some few who will share a good
laugh. Wherever you are, we need you.
