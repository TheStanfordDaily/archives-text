## Chinese Questions 'Racist' Charges 
### 
Editor, THE DAILY:
I have never met Professor
Koff and so I do not know if he is
a racist. But it seems very difficult
to accept the argument that since
he asked a black girl some ques
tions she felt humiliating, he is
therefore a white racist.
Some of those questions, if
put to me, would not make me
feel humiliated. Just those ques
tions are not sufficient ground to
support the argument that Profes
sor Koff is a white racist.
As a Chinese I am not with
out personal experiences of some
white people's ugly attitudes
toward me.
Not long ago on a plane a
white man sitting no V + —

pointing this out over the years. It
has given over column after col
umn to SDS apologists, has writ
ten tepid little articles which
blandly ignore or condone SDS
excesses, and has utterly failed to
point out the dangers to the dem
ocratic process that the SDS rep
resents. For this the Daily cannot
be forgiven. In a time of need,
when the campus was crying for
balanced, objective reporting and
analysis in the face of an intoler
ant wave as strong as Joe McCar
thyism, the Daily has been found
to be sadly lacking.

• A EL Closing Defended
Editor, THE DAILY:
I would like to comment on an
aspect of Marshall Hopper's letter
to the Editor in the January 30
Stanford Daily, that concerning
access to the Applied Electronics
Laboratory building. Since the
building is normally accessible to
all, it was Mr. Hopper's view that
the SDS group was denied its
rights when the building was
locked last Wednesday afternoon.
It was declared at the noon
time rally that the SDS would
march to AEL, mill in, and inter
fere with the activities in the Lab
oratory. There are surely circum
stances when it is unreasonable

cation, the Study of Education at
Stanford Report on Housing made
the preferences of the student
population extremely clear. Un
fortunately, there are still some
administrators who seem unable
to understand the report. The
existence of Durand and Mayfield
House are clear manifestations of
this lack of administrative com
prehension.
Commendations to Pacoima's
lovely Linda Winthrop for her fine
