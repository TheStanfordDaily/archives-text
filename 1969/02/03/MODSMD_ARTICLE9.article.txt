## An Epitaph For SDS? 
### Michael Sweeney 
Last week a short-haired, clean
cut student slipped into an SDS
meeting and watched the radicals
squabble over militant tactics. On
the way out, I overheard him say
to a companion: "It's just like
Dave Harris said—people like this
want to throw bottles, and they'll
find a way to throw bottles, no
matter what."
This blunt comment could well
be the epitaph of the radical
movement at Stanford. Evoking
the name of Dave Harris, student
body president in 1966, it cate
gorizes the radicals in two words.
Bottle throwers.
As a point of fact, Dave Harris
probably wouldn't apply that
label to SDS. He would be more
likely to point out how radical
tactics have been self-defeating.
People don't listen to bottle
throwers; they tune them out.
The ugly confrontation be
tween screaming right-wing stu
dents and SDS members on Wed
nesday was an inevitable conse
quence of the cancerous decay of
the radical image. The right-wing-

ers have been itching to unleash
their hatred of Stanford's Left,
ever since a mob of fraternity
men ambushed Dave Harris in
1966 and shaved his head. The
backlash against that attack
showed the Right that action was
unwise as long as the Left had the
moral support of most Stanford
students. But on Wednesday, the
Right felt free at last to treat SDS
like bottle throwers.
Now you probably expect me
to feed you the old liberal hom
ilies about how SDS should learn
its lesson and stick to law-abiding
democratic methods. No, that's
not the lesson.
SDS is having trouble because
it has stopped treating revolution
as personal. The radicals seem to
have lost touch with the most
fundamental goal of any revolu
tionary movement—freeing minds.
Dave Harris freed minds. He spoke
of conscience, nonviolence, love.
He organized nationwide draft
resistance. He helped jam the pri
sons in October, 1967, with stu
dents who shared his belief in the

moral necessity of civil disobed
ience. By the simple power of his
words and example, Harris has in
fluenced thousands of students to
take responsibility for their own
lives.
The radicals still give lip-service
to the idea of moral persuasion.
But they believe that non-violence
is dead. Frustrated and impatient,
radicals lash out at convenient in
stitutions. Gradually they come to
believe their own slogans that the
Establishment is a sinister conspir
acy, overlooking the fact that it is
more like a dumb animal. They
relax into hatred. The radicals
cease to see their opponents as
people, and therefore cease to un
derstand them. Eventually their
style overshadows their message.
To make matters worse, the
white radicals are driven to more
forceful tactics by the militancy
of black students. But the blacks
have a much simpler objective -
prodding a sluggish bureaucracy
into specific, material concessions.
Force is sometimes effective for
this purpose. But force inevitably

backfires when the objective is the
liberation of human minds, as a
famous Jewish revolutionary
pointed out 2,000 years ago.
SDS is worried about a growing
revulsion among students. The
radicals point out the bitter irony
of being damned as "fascist and
violent" for a sincere effort to end
an insane war. But when SDS
wonders how to build more of a
"base" among students, the
answer is always the same: "Some
kind of action."
Last week SDS saw the result
of action based on a theme of
hatred. In the eyes of those 40
taunting right-wing demonstra
tors, waving their insulting plac
ards, the radicals could see a grue
some caricature of themselves.
SDS can survive this impasse.
As Dave Pugh put it, "Somehow
we've got to get back in contact
with human values."
