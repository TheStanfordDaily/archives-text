Engineers:
Good ideas
get off the ground
at Boeing.
So do careers.
Let's talk about it on
Tuesday and Wednesday,
February 11 and 12.
At The Boeing Company, you can be a member
of a team that's famous for making good ideas fly.
Such as the 707, America's first jetliner. And
the 727 trijet, the 737 twmjet, Boeing-Vertol
helicopters, the Boeing-built first stage for the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration's
Apollo/Saturn V moon rocket. And the NASA
Lunar Orbiter, the USAF Minuteman, and the USN
hydrofoil gunboat Tucumcari.
Boeing has exciting new projects on the way up,
too. The 747 superjet, world's largest and fastest
commercial jetliner, scheduled to make its first
flight by the end of 1968. America's supersonic
transport, now being developed at the company's
Commercial Airplane Division. Plus other ad
vanced programs in early development and on
Boeing drawing boards.
They can help get your career off to a dynamic
start in applied research, design, test, manufactur
ing, service or facilities engineering or computer
technology.
Visit your college placement office and schedule
an interview with the Boeing representative.
Boeing is an equal opportunity employer.
