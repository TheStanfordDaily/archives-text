# Speech Association Hits Double Veto By Hayes
## 
### DAVID DAVENPORT 
Action developed on two fronts
Monday in the wak2 of Denis Hayes' re
jection of LASSU's transferral of $5000
from the Professorial Commission to
general contingency, and a $4000 ap
propriation for the Speech Association.
Officers of the Speech Association
met yesterday and drafted a statement
regarding the Hayes vetoes. Ken Philpot,
Speech Association President, declared
they "will attempt to reverse the ac
tion."
Several Stanford students, headed by
LASSU member Jim Spickard, drafted a
petition to place both matters on a Feb.
18 referendum ballot of the student
body.
Circulation of the petition, which
will require the signatures of five per
cent of Stanford's students, will begin
today.
Operating Reserves
Denis Hayes and the ASSU officers
had recommended that the $5000 re
maining in the professorial fund go to
operating reserves, hoping to show grea
ter fiscal responsibility in LASSU.
The Speech Association statement
observed that the professorial fund was
Hayes' idea, and when a segment of the
program collapsed, the funds became
eligible for return to general conting
ency.
"Apparently, when money is used to
pay for a program supported by Denis,
the method of finance is both sound
and just," the Association stated.
"Should the same funds be used to sup
port some other program, however, the
same method suddenly provokes cries of
"fiscal irresponsibility'."

Objecting to Hayes' view that "the
Speech Association is simply not worth
$7000 to the Stanford student body,"
the statement explained why the funds
are necessary and how they will be used.
The Association has been attempting
to expand the speech program at the re
quest of previous legislatures. According
to the statement, it has "transformed
the speech community from a small
'club' of debaters into the largest speech
program of any university in the na
tion."
The Association called the present
$4000 request, which would bring this
year's appropriation to $7000, "con
sistent with the support approved by

law and chairman of the Stanford Judicial
Council, is faced with a march on his office

Stanford student legislatures over
the past five years."
Much University Support
Much of the program's finan
cial support comes from the uni
versity. Donald Price, Assistant
Dean of Humanities and Sciences,
pledged that the School of Hum
anities and Sciences would match,
dollar-for-dollar, any funds ap
propriated for the speech program
by LASSU.
According to the Speech As
sociation officers, the LASSU pro
posal, coupled with the matching
H&S funds, would enable them to
conduct an endowment drive. If
successful, this endowment
"would relieve the student legisla
ture and the administration of fu
ture financial responsibility."

Dr. Kenneth Mosier, Speech
Association advisor, pointed out
that the debate team has cancelled
tournament participation at San
Fernando, Harvard, and Dart
mouth because of the financial
problem.
Endowment Funds Needed
If additional funds are not re
ceived, the debate and speech pro
gram for this year would be
virtually terminated. However,
with the funds, "the debate teams
would travel with the additional
priority of speaking to alumni
groups and attempting to establish
the endowment fund," according
to Mosier.
The future of the speech ap
propriation remains extremely un
clear.
