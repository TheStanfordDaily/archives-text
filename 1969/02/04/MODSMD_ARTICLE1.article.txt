# Speech Association Hits Double Veto By Hayes
## 
### DAVID DAVENPORT 
Action developed on two fronts
Monday in the wak2 of Denis Hayes' re
jection of LASSU's transferral of $5000
from the Professorial Commission to
general contingency, and a $4000 ap
propriation for the Speech Association.
Officers of the Speech Association
met yesterday and drafted a statement
regarding the Hayes vetoes. Ken Philpot,
Speech Association President, declared
they "will attempt to reverse the ac

Several Stanford students, headed by
LASSU member Jim Spickard, drafted a
petition to place both matters on a Feb.

body.
Circulation of the petition, which
will require the signatures of five per

today.

program collapsed, the funds became
eligible for return to general conting
ency.
"Apparently, when money is used to
pay for a program supported by Denis,
the method of finance is both sound
and just," the Association stated.
"Should the same funds be used to sup
port some other program, however, the
same method suddenly provokes cries of
"fiscal irresponsibility'."

Objecting to Hayes' view that "the
Speech Association is simply not worth
$7000 to the Stanford student body,"
the statement explained why the funds
are necessary and how they will be used.
The Association has been attempting
to expand the speech program at the re
quest of previous legislatures. According
to the statement, it has "transformed
the speech community from a small
'club' of debaters into the largest speech
program of any university in the na
tion."
The Association called the present
$4000 request, which would bring this
year's appropriation to $7000, "con
