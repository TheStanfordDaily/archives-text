# In Koff's Defense
## 
### 
Editor, THE DAILY:
I have learned recently that the
moral character of Mr. Robert
Koff on the Stanford University
faculty has been called into ques
tion in connection with an alleg
edly racist incident.
May I say that I have known
Robert Koff since 1962, first as a
fellow graduate student at the
University of Chicago, and later as
a colleague in several national aca
demic associations. I have never
found any evidence of any form
of racism in his conversation or
behavior. Indeed, I have observed
his great personal and professional
concern for reducing the tensions
between divided elements of our
troubled society and bringing
about improved social relations
between all groups.
I would hope that his long
standing professional reputation
among his colleagues in univer
sities around the nation would be
considered in any deliberations
concerning a single alleged inci
dent.
