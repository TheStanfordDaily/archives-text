## Debate Council Case 
### 
Editor, THE DAILY:
Continually increasing student
participation in the past few years
has transformed the Stanford
speech community from a small
"club" of debaters into the largest
speech program of any university
in the nation. Although this wide
spread involvement has also re
quired an expanding budget, the
present financial request of the
Speech Association (bringing our
total request for the year to
$7000) is consistent with the sup
port approved by Stanford stu
dent legislatures over the past five
years. This has been possible, in
part, because of increased finan
cial backing from University of
ficials. At present, the administra
tion, through the office of the
Dean of Humanities and Sciences,
has pledged to match the legisla
ture's appropriation on a dollar
for-dollar basis. In spite of these
improvements, however, the mem
bers of the Speech Association
have continued to work toward an
ultimate goal of financial inde
pendence. An endowment drive is
currently being undertaken; if suc
cessful, it would relieve the stu
dent legislature and the adminis
tration of future financial respon
sibility.
The appropriation bill which is
now before LASSU is essential for
both the success of this endow
ment as well as the continued
operation of the speech program
for this year. LASSU has already
endorsed this bill by overwhelm
ing majorities on two separate oc
casions. Last Friday night this
measure was vetoed by Denis
Hayes.
In his accompanying veto mes
sage, Denis explained that the ap
propriations should be placed in
the LASSU Reserve Fund. It is
interesting to note that these
funds were originally scheduled to
finance a program sponsored by
Denis. When a segment of this
program collapsed, these funds be
came eligible for return to general
contingency and further appropri
ationâ€”a procedure envisioned by
last Spring's legislature. Denis now
maintains that this money cannot
be used to finance Stanford's
speech program, for such an ap
propriation would seriously jeop
ardize LASSU's financial stability.
Apparently, when money is used
to pay for a program supported
by Denis, the method of finance is
both sound and just. Should the
same funds be used to support
some other program, however, the
same method suddenly provokes
cries of "fiscal irresponsibility!"
Although his veto message gen
erously applauds the continuing
interest and contributions of
Speech members in LASSU, Denis
later asserts that the adoption of
the appropriations bill was "large
ly on the strength of Speech As
sociation votes." This convenient
rationalization is contradicted by

the facts. Even the most cursory
examination of the voting record
conclusively demonstrates that
the appropriations bill had the
overwhelming support (73%) of
those LASSU representatives who
are not members of the Speech
Association. The addition of the
"speech votes" merely raises this
already-impressive statistic to
80%.
We believe that the Stanford
student body supports the contin
uation of a program that has
managed to attain great success
without resorting to an elitist
theory of membership. It is pre
cisely because active interest in
speech programs has dramatically
increased that this budgetary
question arises at all. Indeed, pre
vious legislatures have not only
urged the Speech Association to
open its membership to all stu
dents, but have demanded this is a
prerequisite for further funding. If
the Stanford speech community is
to remain an open organization
providing every Stanford student
with an opportunity to share this
educational experience, then stu
dent support will be greatly
needed in the coming weeks.
We heartily endorse the prin
ciple of a referendum on financial
matters and will submit legislation
to LASSU that will place aspects
of the 1969-1970 ASSU budget
(to be determined in April) on .a
referendum basis.
In the interim, we strongly
urge all students to examine with
their respective representatives the
issues currently being considered
so that LASSU may reflect the
majority student opinion.
