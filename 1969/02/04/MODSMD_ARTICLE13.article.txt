# Caught In The Middle
## Neo-Nazis, Crypto Fascists 
### Thomas C. Dawson 
"What is your right to be here,
punk?"
"They're a bunch of shits,
punks."
"It's the only thing that has
ever worked against them."
"And despite any shortcomings
in their tactics, they are the only
ones who are putting themselves
on the line to oppose evils that
many others quietly accept."
The last three weeks at Stan
ford have seen an amazing surge
of intolerance, violence and the
old belief that 'the ends justify
the means.' Name calling has
reached a new peak with SDS and
YAF calling each other neo-Nazis
and crypto-fascists.
YAF claims to speak for the
"silent majority" of students and
SDS claims to speak for the ma
jority of the world. Unlike the
twins in the Certs commercial,
you're both wrong! The sheer
audacity of these two groups
claiming to "know" both what
everyone else wants, needs and
believes is only their most obvious
similarity.
YAF and SDS, at least at Stan
ford, are trying to impose their

world-views on the community in
an aggressive and, to me, very dis
pleasing manner. Yet both groups
claim to speak for substantial
numbers of students.
Similar Statements
The four statements at the be
ginning of this column are some
products of the last three weeks'
activities. The first two seem quite
similar, but in fact the first state
ment is that of an SDS member
addressing one of Stanford's trus
tees as SDS was disrupting the
monthly Board of Trustees meet
ing. The second statement is that
of an SRI employee watching the
efforts of Stanford SDS members
trying to break into SRl's Han
over street office last week.
The last two statements also on
the surface quite similar, are from
the mouths of dissimilar speakers.
YAF leader Harvey Hukari is the
author of the "only thing that has
ever worked" statement. He uses
it in justification of YAF's har
rassment of the SDS rally on cam
pus last Wednesday. The final
statement is from a student trying
to justify SDS's harrassment and
disruption of the Board of Trus
tees meeting last month.
The four statements are
symptoms of this rising tension
and intolerance. I know all four
speakers. They are all concerned
with the elimination of human
suffering and injustice. Yet they
focus their attention on a scape
goat, International Communism
(or American Imperialism), the
elimination of which will cure all
the world's problems.
The point I wish to make is
that SDS and YAF are guilty of
using the same distasteful tactics,
rationalizations and justifications
for their actions. Both groups say
theirs is the "only way" justice
(or morality) can be achieved. By
calling each other pigs, punks and

fascists they lessen the opportun
ity for rational dialogue which is
at the heart of the University
community.
'Guilt by Association'
Both groups rely on guilt by as
sociation for "proof" of their al
legations. On the one hand SDS
attacks the military-industrial
educational complex while YAF
delivers solemn pronouncements
on the Communist conspiracy.
YAF accuses SDS of being fas
cistic and SDS re-acts with a cry
of horror saying that such a
charge is the worst possible insult.
Just a minute. Who recoined the
phrase "Gestapo tactics" and the
taunt "Sieg Heil" except the SDS
in other situations. Apparently
the charge is only terrible when
applied to the SDS.
YAF's namecalling is just as
nearsighted as anything thought
up by SDS. In the Sharon state
ment, the guiding principles of
YAF, International Communism
is singled out as the single greatest
threat to freedom in the world.
Not hunger, ignorance, stupidity
or disease, but International Com
munism.
On the other hand, SDS seems
American imperialism as THE evil
in the world and would destroy
almost anything to rid the world
of it—SRI, the Board of Trustees,
the university, the country, the
world.
YAF justifies its disruption of
the SDS rally with the rationaliza
tion "It's the only thing that has
ever worked against them." Pre
sumably Mr. Hukari would then
have the SDS jailed if his harrass
ment tactics cease to be effective.
And what would SDS like done
with YAF?
'Sacred' Words
It is interesting that both
groups use "sacred" words in their
names—Democracy and Freedom.

Their kind of democracy and their
kind of freedom, no one else's.
What I really fear is that the
last three weeks are only the pres
age of more violence culminating
in a civil war in the university that
may bring the educational process
to a halt. It has happened else
where. More often the opponents
have been SDS and an intransig
ient administration, but YAF can
serve the same reactionary pur
pose.
The ills of the world must be
eliminated (or more realistically
eased), but emulating the tactics
of SDS and YAF will only lead to
an escalation of violence.
There's really not a dime's
worth of difference between the
tactics of SDS and YAF.

"They're a bunch of shits,
punks."
"It's the only thing that has
ever worked against them."
"And despite any shortcomings
in their tactics, they are the only
ones who are putting themselves
on the line to oppose evils that
many others quietly accept."
The last three weeks at Stan
ford have seen an amazing surge
of intolerance, violence and the
old belief that 'the ends justify
the means.' Name calling has
reached a new peak with SDS and
YAF calling each other neo-Nazis
and crypto-fascists.
YAF claims to speak for the
"silent majority" of students and
SDS claims to speak for the ma
jority of the world. Unlike the
twins in the Certs commercial,
you're both wrong! The sheer
audacity of these two groups
claiming to "know" both what
everyone else wants, needs and
believes is only their most obvious
similarity.
YAF and SDS, at least at Stan
ford, are trying to impose their

world-views on the community in
an aggressive and, to me, very dis
pleasing manner. Yet both groups
claim to speak for substantial
numbers of students.
Similar Statements
The four statements at the be
ginning of this column are some
products of the last three weeks'
activities. The first two seem quite
similar, but in fact the first state
ment is that of an SDS member
addressing one of Stanford's trus
tees as SDS was disrupting the
monthly Board of Trustees meet
ing. The second statement is that
of an SRI employee watching the
efforts of Stanford SDS members
trying to break into SRl's Han
over street office last week.
The last two statements also on
the surface quite similar, are from
the mouths of dissimilar speakers.
YAF leader Harvey Hukari is the
author of the "only thing that has
ever worked" statement. He uses
it in justification of YAF's har
rassment of the SDS rally on cam
pus last Wednesday. The final
statement is from a student trying
to justify SDS's harrassment and
disruption of the Board of Trus
tees meeting last month.
The four statements are
symptoms of this rising tension
and intolerance. I know all four
speakers. They are all concerned
with the elimination of human
suffering and injustice. Yet they
focus their attention on a scape
goat, International Communism
(or American Imperialism), the
elimination of which will cure all
the world's problems.
The point I wish to make is
that SDS and YAF are guilty of
using the same distasteful tactics,
rationalizations and justifications
for their actions. Both groups say
theirs is the "only way" justice
(or morality) can be achieved. By
calling each other pigs, punks and

fascists they lessen the opportun
ity for rational dialogue which is
at the heart of the University
community.
'Guilt by Association'
Both groups rely on guilt by as
sociation for "proof" of their al
legations. On the one hand SDS
attacks the military-industrial
educational complex while YAF
delivers solemn pronouncements
on the Communist conspiracy.
YAF accuses SDS of being fas
cistic and SDS re-acts with a cry
of horror saying that such a
charge is the worst possible insult.
Just a minute. Who recoined the
phrase "Gestapo tactics" and the
taunt "Sieg Heil" except the SDS
in other situations. Apparently
the charge is only terrible when
applied to the SDS.
YAF's namecalling is just as
nearsighted as anything thought
up by SDS. In the Sharon state
ment, the guiding principles of
YAF, International Communism
is singled out as the single greatest
threat to freedom in the world.
Not hunger, ignorance, stupidity
or disease, but International Com
munism.
On the other hand, SDS seems
American imperialism as THE evil
in the world and would destroy
almost anything to rid the world
of it—SRI, the Board of Trustees,
the university, the country, the
world.
YAF justifies its disruption of
the SDS rally with the rationaliza
tion "It's the only thing that has
ever worked against them." Pre
sumably Mr. Hukari would then
have the SDS jailed if his harrass
ment tactics cease to be effective.
And what would SDS like done
with YAF?
'Sacred' Words
It is interesting that both
groups use "sacred" words in their
names—Democracy and Freedom.

Their kind of democracy and their
kind of freedom, no one else's.
What I really fear is that the
last three weeks are only the pres
age of more violence culminating
in a civil war in the university that
may bring the educational process
to a halt. It has happened else
where. More often the opponents
have been SDS and an intransig
ient administration, but YAF can
serve the same reactionary pur
pose.
The ills of the world must be
eliminated (or more realistically
eased), but emulating the tactics
of SDS and YAF will only lead to
an escalation of violence.
There's really not a dime's
worth of difference between the
tactics of SDS and YAF.

ever worked against them."
"And despite any shortcomings
in their tactics, they are the only
ones who are putting themselves
on the line to oppose evils that
many others quietly accept."
The last three weeks at Stan
ford have seen an amazing surge
of intolerance, violence and the
old belief that 'the ends justify
the means.' Name calling has
reached a new peak with SDS and
YAF calling each other neo-Nazis
and crypto-fascists.
YAF claims to speak for the
"silent majority" of students and
SDS claims to speak for the ma
jority of the world. Unlike the
twins in the Certs commercial,
you're both wrong! The sheer
audacity of these two groups
claiming to "know" both what
everyone else wants, needs and
believes is only their most obvious
similarity.
YAF and SDS, at least at Stan
ford, are trying to impose their

world-views on the community in
an aggressive and, to me, very dis
pleasing manner. Yet both groups
claim to speak for substantial
numbers of students.
Similar Statements
The four statements at the be
ginning of this column are some
products of the last three weeks'
activities. The first two seem quite
similar, but in fact the first state
ment is that of an SDS member
addressing one of Stanford's trus
tees as SDS was disrupting the
monthly Board of Trustees meet
ing. The second statement is that
of an SRI employee watching the
efforts of Stanford SDS members
trying to break into SRl's Han
over street office last week.
The last two statements also on
the surface quite similar, are from
the mouths of dissimilar speakers.
YAF leader Harvey Hukari is the
author of the "only thing that has
ever worked" statement. He uses
it in justification of YAF's har
rassment of the SDS rally on cam
pus last Wednesday. The final
statement is from a student trying
to justify SDS's harrassment and
disruption of the Board of Trus
tees meeting last month.
The four statements are
symptoms of this rising tension
and intolerance. I know all four
speakers. They are all concerned
with the elimination of human
suffering and injustice. Yet they
focus their attention on a scape
goat, International Communism
(or American Imperialism), the
elimination of which will cure all
the world's problems.
The point I wish to make is
that SDS and YAF are guilty of
using the same distasteful tactics,
rationalizations and justifications
for their actions. Both groups say
theirs is the "only way" justice
(or morality) can be achieved. By
calling each other pigs, punks and

fascists they lessen the opportun
ity for rational dialogue which is
at the heart of the University
community.
'Guilt by Association'
Both groups rely on guilt by as
sociation for "proof" of their al
legations. On the one hand SDS
attacks the military-industrial
educational complex while YAF
delivers solemn pronouncements
on the Communist conspiracy.
YAF accuses SDS of being fas
cistic and SDS re-acts with a cry
of horror saying that such a
charge is the worst possible insult.
Just a minute. Who recoined the
phrase "Gestapo tactics" and the
taunt "Sieg Heil" except the SDS
in other situations. Apparently
the charge is only terrible when
applied to the SDS.
YAF's namecalling is just as
nearsighted as anything thought
up by SDS. In the Sharon state
ment, the guiding principles of
YAF, International Communism
is singled out as the single greatest
threat to freedom in the world.
Not hunger, ignorance, stupidity
or disease, but International Com
munism.
On the other hand, SDS seems
American imperialism as THE evil
in the world and would destroy
almost anything to rid the world
of it—SRI, the Board of Trustees,
the university, the country, the
world.
YAF justifies its disruption of
the SDS rally with the rationaliza
tion "It's the only thing that has
ever worked against them." Pre
sumably Mr. Hukari would then
have the SDS jailed if his harrass
ment tactics cease to be effective.
And what would SDS like done
with YAF?
'Sacred' Words
It is interesting that both
groups use "sacred" words in their
names—Democracy and Freedom.

Their kind of democracy and their
kind of freedom, no one else's.
What I really fear is that the
last three weeks are only the pres
age of more violence culminating
in a civil war in the university that
may bring the educational process
to a halt. It has happened else
where. More often the opponents
have been SDS and an intransig
ient administration, but YAF can
serve the same reactionary pur
pose.
The ills of the world must be
eliminated (or more realistically
eased), but emulating the tactics
of SDS and YAF will only lead to
an escalation of violence.
There's really not a dime's
worth of difference between the
tactics of SDS and YAF.
