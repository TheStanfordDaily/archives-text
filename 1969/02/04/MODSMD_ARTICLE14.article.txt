# Requirements Cut For Engineering
## 
### 
The Stanford School of En
gineering has adopted the most
flexible and least restrictive under
graduate engineering curriculum
yet devised by any major institu
tion.
Tonight at 7:30 Tau Beta Pi is
hosting an open discussion for
faculty and students in the Forum
Room of Undergraduate Library
to discuss the work of the Under
graduate Council and how it has
changed requirements.
The 24-member Council has re
laxed the old restrictions, under
which as few as 10 units were
electives. Although it was thought
very progressive when adopted 10
years ago, the old curriculum
needed revising in relation to
modern goals of engineering edu
cation.
Many Electives
The highly liberalized, four
year study program gives under
graduates from 30 to 45 units
(two to three quarters) of "free
choice" courses, according to the
announcement by Prof. James M.
Gere, associate dean for under
graduate engineering education.
"The new curriculum provides
many additional opportunities for
undergraduate students, while pre
serving all of the former options,"
said Gere.
"The principal objective is to
provide opportunity for personal
maturity and intellectual growth,
for the attainment of professional
competence, and for the develop
ment of social responsibility," the
Council stated.
Flexible Curriculum
"The curriculum is quite flex-

ible and decisions on individual
courses are, in general, left to the
student and his adviser. For a stu
dent with a well defined educa
tional goal, there is a great deal of
latitude."
To avoid over-specialization
and gain a broader viewpoint
through familiarity with other
branches of engineering, the stu
dent can now choose 30 units in
eight different subject areas.
To meet the depth requirement
he can follow the recommended
list of his major department as be
fore, or, with approval of the
council, map an "interdisciplin
ary" or an "innovative" study
program.
Interschool Programs
Two further variations which
cross school lines as well as de
partmental lines are the "Tech
nology and Society Program" and
the "Applied Science" major.
The former is designed to let
the engineering student "relate in
depth to social studies and the
humanities." Nicknamed "Hands
Across the Quad Program," it also
is expected to serve admirably
when a student wants some en
gineering proficiency before tack
ling studies in another profes
sional career, say in medicine or
law.
Student participation included
eight student-faculty seminars
which contributed numerous ideas
to a one-year Study of Engineer
ing Education at Stanford. Tau
Beta Pi, Engineering fraternity
and the Student-Faculty Liaison
Committee sponsored open
forums and discussion groups.
