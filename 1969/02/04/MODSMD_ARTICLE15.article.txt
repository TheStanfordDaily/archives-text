# Michael Novak Returns
## Radical To Campus Conservative 
### SUSAN SWARD 
Michael Novak was seen as
something of a radical when he
was at Stanford. This year he has
gone to Old Westbury in New
York to find himself viewed as a
conservative.
Somewhat tired after giving a
sermon in Memorial Church Sun
day morning, Novak smiled and
said, "I enjoy being the campus
conservative at Old Westbury. It's
so strange and odd after Stan
ford."
Novak, who came to Stanford
in 1965 as an assistant professor
of religion, is a combination phil
osopher-theologian-novelist.
"I like to be called a philoso
pher, theologian and novelist,"
Novak said. "But I let other peo
ple call me what they want to call
me. When you're concerned with
identity, there's the same set of
problems to be faced down any
alley."
Professor of Religion
At Old Westbury Novak is an
associate professor of religion and
the Director of the Common
Humanities Seminar. There are 85
students and 11 faculty members
at the school this year.
When asked to compare the
settings of Stanford and Old West
bury, Novak commented, "At Old
Westbury we feel a lack of struc
ture against which to define our

selves. When all the students at
Old Westbury are radicals in favor
of non-verbal communication,
imagination and sensitivity, then
you need to stress discipline and
analytic skills.
"Here at Stanford I feel there
is a great appetite for experiment
ation and at the same time a wait
ing for that experimentation to
start. Because you have going con
cerns here, new forms of experi
ment have to fight their way, and
they stand out."
Hirtli Control
When questioned about his
viewpoint of birth control, Novak
noted that the issue did not con
cern him very much as a Catholic.
"The Pope's statement was
very bad," Novak said. "But it's
important that the Pope not be
taken too seriously. I remember a
man in Italy saying to me, 'The
Pope has nothing to say about my
sexual activity.' "
Concerning the peace talks in
Paris which Novak visited last Oct
ober, Novak was very critical.
"The National Liberation
Front is more intransigent than it
has ever been," Novak observed.
The issue remains a difference in
orientation. Their myth about the
war is the opposite of our myth
about the war.
"You just realize there's a long
way to go. The set of facts, goals

and outcomes are different for the
two groups. It's just two worlds
that never touch."
Speaking about the advent of
the Nixon administration, Novak
sees it as a "good thing" to the
extent that student activists are
going to have to "adapt their style
and sharpen their accuracy."
According to Novak, "Student
critics have been attacking their
liberal fathers and have been let
ting their real enemies escape
scott free."
Novak is out of patience with
campus rebellions.
"Campus rebellions have made
their point," Novak said, "namely
about the depth of changes re
quired. Now there's the need for a
long march and hard work devel
oping theories and institutions to
affect those changes.
"I'm very tired of the High
Noon politics which need a con
frontation a week. I call this the
Dr. Strangelove need of weekly
action. There's been enough
shouting. There's an awful lot to
learn and a lot of work to do."
Novak spoke of an area he
wants to concentrate his attention
on in the future—the need for the
humanities to break out of west
ern civilization and encounter the
culture of the east and the culture
of the poor.
Once the humanities have re

lated themselves to these two cul
tures within and without of the
university system, an image of
man "that is more accurate con
cerning the role of instincts, im
pulse and fantasy" will emerge.
Novak believes that "analytical
reasoning must be moved out of
the center of your life."
Novak was about to leave for a
dinner engagement when he grin
ned and said, "My wife talked
about her paintings at Roth House
while we were here." Mrs. Novak
is a nationally-known artist who
has had one-man shows.
He paused and then added, "As
her paintings become better
known out here and in the East, I
get introduced to people as Karen
Novak's husband."


PRODIGAL SON—Michael Novak,
formerly a radical here, now finds him
self the campus conservative at Old
Westbury, an experimental college in
New York.
