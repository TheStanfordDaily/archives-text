# Wyman: No University Involvement In Arrest
## 
### CRAIG WILSON 
Associate Dean of Students Willard
Wyman has denied University responsi
bility concerning the arrest of John Fos
dick for possession of marijuana Friday
afternoon in Beta Chi Fraternity house.
Wyman said simply, "We are not a
sanctuary," in response to a query re
garding the arrest.
Fosdick, whose arrest marks the first
in a Stanford living residence, has been
unavailable for comment since he was
booked by the Santa Clara County Sher
iff's Department on charges of posses
sion of marijuana and possession of dan
gerous drugs.
Wyman Was Present
Wyman was present at the house
with Dean of Students Joel Smith late
Friday afternoon and witnessed the ar
rest.
However both Wyman and Smith
were not informed of the impending ar
rest until after the police arrivedâ€”and
then only by house President Tom
Amis.
"There is no reason that the police
have to tell us anything. There is no
reason that they would have to tell us
before making the arrest.
Stanford Police 'Guardians'
"The Stanford police are very much
like a guardian organization; they are
like a security force.
"The Santa Clara Police tend to stay
away because we take such good care."
He said he would "like to see the uni
versity withdraw from dealing in any
thing but academic crimes, but students
are loathe to do this. They would like us
to intervene in things like the Beta Chi
arrest."
Arrest Possible
Associate Dean of Students Bob
Rosch commented that "an arrest is
possible under two circumstances'

If "probable cause" is demonstrated
or if they have, a warrant which must
be obtained from a judge.
"In this case the agent entered the
house with the consent of Fosdick and
witnessed the illegal sale. In this case the
probable cause was enough to allow the
officers to enter Beta Chi and make the
arrest.
"There is no guarantee that this
won't happen again. It is very unlikely
that the Dean's office is going to be told
in the future.
Corporate Citizen
"The University is a corporate citi
zen. If our internal relations break
down, this will lead to increased police
on campus."
The police report on the arrest was
released yesterday, but Field Enforce
ment Supervisor C. D. Marron, who
spoke to The Daily, was reluctant to
give details.
Marron said that the story that an
agent had solicited a pusher in Beta Chi
was "not necessarily true."
After Investigation
Marron said the arrest was made after
a probing investigation had identified
Fosdick as a source of marijuana.
However the timing of the arrest, ac
cording to sources at Beta Chi, came
soon after the alleged sale was made.
Marron said they came "at the most
opportune time," but would not com
ment on how they knew saying, "he did
not want to jeopardize the case."
He did say that marijuana was re
covered from the residence but refused
to give the amount.
The Daily learned Sunday from the
same source, The Santa Clara County
Sheriff's Department, that Fosdick had
2 kilos or 4.4 pounds of marijuana in his
possession.
