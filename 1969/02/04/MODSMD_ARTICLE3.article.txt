# Poli Sci Faculty Ends Course Requirements
## 
### 
All specific course requirements for
undergraduate political science majors
have been eliminated.
By a unanimous vote at its regular
faculty meeting last week, the depart
ment limited major requirements to 45
units of political science courses, includ
ing an advanced course or seminar in at
least three of the department's six fields
and at least one seminar.
The change means that majors are no
longer required to take Political Science
150, nor must they have a combination
of two courses chosen from Political
Science 10, 15A, 158, and 20 as in the
past.

The proposal for this change was pre
sented to the department on January 7
by the Undergraduate Curriculum Com
mittee.
According to the committee's chair
man, Raymond Wolfinger, the idea for
eliminating specific requirements had
occurred to most faculty members at
one time or another, but no one had
taken any concrete action.
The general feeling behind the
changes he stated, is that in a field as
diverse as political science there is no
specific body of knowledge that must
be mastered before advanced study can
be undertaken.
Accepted Almost Immediately
Wolfinger said that as soon as the
idea was proposed, it was accepted with
little discussion or debate.
The change, however, does not mean
that professors cannot require certain
prerequisites for their courses.
In addition the department's Under
graduate Curriculum Committee has
( completed selection of three student
members. Roger Boesche, Joan Berg
holt, and William Berry will participate
with the committee's five faculty mem
bers in all future curriculum recom
mendations.
