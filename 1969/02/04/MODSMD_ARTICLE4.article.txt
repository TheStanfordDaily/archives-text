## 
### JENNY MATTHEWS 
In advance of a threatened march on
his office today, professor Jack Fried
enthal, chairman of the Stanford Judic
ial Council (SJC), yesterday parried pro
tests from Students for a Democratic
Society (SDS).
The Council has summoned for hear
ings more than 30 students charged as
violators of the campus policy on dem
onstrations during disruption of the last
trustee meeting. Most defendants are in
SDS.
SDS plans to march on Friedenthal's
law school office today at 10 a.m. to
press for acceptance of four recom
mendations concerning SJC proceed
ures.
Apart from SDS activities, Fried
enthal has planned individual confer
ences beginning today with violators to
explain the precise charges against them.
Formal hearings will begin next week.
Charges Dropped
Friedenthal admitted yesterday that
some of the charges may be dropped in
cases of erroneous identification.
This is one of the reasons, the law
professor added that a list of the sum
moned students has not been published.
"We're not hiding the names," Fried
enthal emphasized. "We simply don't
want to involve these students in char
ges that may hinder their future car
eers."
The students who are charged will
have the opportunity to further undergo
two sets of hearings.
"The first hearing," Friedenthal ex
plained, "will be to study the truth of
each student's acts, and the second set
of hearings will be conducted to analyze
the reasons behind these acts."
Five Requests
The SDS has already published a ser
ies of five requests that they will present
to Friedenthal.
In response to the first SDS demand
that a group arraignment be scheduled,
Friedenthal explained that "the judicial
council's charter requires that each
charged student be given a set of allega
tions concerning the acts with which he

is charged. "Individual charges cannot
be appropriately explained in a
group. . . It would have to follow that
not all of the accused students may wish
to have a group arraignment. . .
"By disagreeing with the request for
a group hearing, however I'm not deny
ing it."
Open Hearing
Friedenthal continued that the sec
ond SDS request which calls for "an
opening continuing hearing in a large
auditorium open to all members of the
community" has already been provided
for during the preliminary hearings.
As to the third proposal which asks
for legal aid financed by the university
for students, Friedenthal suggested that
the SDS contact the dean of students
office which would be the proper place
to consider such an allocation.
Friedenthal stated that the fourth de

mand is also being taken care of. This
request calls for "pictures of those Trus
tees present at the meeting in question"
to be made available to implicated stu
dents.
Political Implications
Concerning the final SDS demand
that the political implications of the dis
ruption are not separated from the
court's inquiries, Friedenthal empha
sized that "the students will be given
every chance to explain the justification
for their acts. . . .
"The Council will listen to all the
students' reasons and will make every
effort to be open-minded."
The law professor also insisted that
"my door is open to anyone who would
like to discuss the hearings.
"I believe that student body has a
right to be generally informed on what's
going on."

when the demonstrators entered the meeting room. The SDS plans a march on SJC Chairman
Friedenthal's law office today to press their requests on judicial Council proceedings arising out
of the disruption of the meeting.
