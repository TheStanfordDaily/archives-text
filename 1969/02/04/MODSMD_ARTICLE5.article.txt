## SDS And BSU: No Cooperation? 
### THOMAS DAWSON 
The Black Students' Union (BSU)
and the Stanford Students for a Demo
cratic Society (SDS) have each announ
ced rallies for today, raising the interes
ting question of coordination between
the two groups, both of which are work
ing for a significant change in the func
tioning, if not the structure and philos
ophy, of the University. Their sharing
the spotlight could detract from the at
tention paid each group.
The scheduling of both rallies for to
day appears to be only a coincidence as
BSU chairman Nate Kirtman did not
even know of the slated SDS march
when contacted last evening. In fact,
SDS has moved up the time of its dem
onstration from H:l5 to 10 in the
morning eliminating the potential time
conflict. Nevertheless, the question of
the relationship of the BSU and white
radicals is a relevant one.
No Close Coordination
Unlike some other colleges, Stanford
has never seen close coordination and
cooperation between the BSU and white
radicals. Few blacks are members of
Stanford SDS. The only time both
groups have acted at all together was

last spring when the BSU presented its
ten demands for changes in Stanford's
treatment of minority students and em
ployees.
After the BSU presented its demands
a group of white students formed the
Students Against White Racism. This
group, however, did not really have
much impact on acceptance of the
BSU's demands as sympathy in the uni
versity was overwhelmingly on the side
of the BSU.
The BSU has not been acting entirely
on its own, however, as evidenced by

consultation between the BSU and the
Mexican-American Students' Confeder
ation (MASC) over last weekend on the
BSU's stand on education school profes
sor Robert Koff, accused of rascist be
havior in an interview of a black co-ed
applying to graduate school at Stanford.
The BSU will announce its position
on Koff today at a noon rally on White
Plaza and has asked all interested mem
bers of the community to attend.
This BSU-MASC communication

may presage the formation of some
working alliance on their mutual prob
lems, but it still leaves unanswered the
question of white radical participation
in minority groups' efforts for increased
admissions and employment as well as
for cultural studies' courses like the re
cently announced Afro-American Stud
ies major.
SDS and other students are also pres
sing for employment of radical profes
sors and courses on radical subjects
taught by radicals.
Students queried as to the reasons
for the lack of apparent communication
and cooperation between the activist
groups respond with similar answers,
stressing the lack of any unifying issue,
the socio-economic gap between blacks
and whites on campus, black pride and
the concern of the BSU on substantive
problems that aren't politically radical.
BSU members last night indicated
they did not want to comment on the
question, saying they preferred to wait
until today's noon rally to make any
public statements.
The question transcends today's near
conflict, however. Former LASSU
speaker Micheal Weinstein commented,

"The blacks at Stanford are moderate.
They don't have politically radical
goals." Weinstein pointed out that
SDS's approach is one of a total change
in structure in contrast to the BSU.
On the matter of unifying issues, a
student close to the SDS said, "There
are no real issues to unite them. The
blacks are concerned with more black
admissions and black teachers. White
radicals here cannot really get worked
up over these issues." He did go on to
say that the situation could well change if
the administration became intransgient
on any issue. He cited San Francisco
State as a case in which some unity was
attained.
The question of black pride is an ex
tremely touchy one, probably unan
swerable by any casual white observer.
It cannot be written off as a factor,
however.
White students have little knowledge
of the workings of the BSU. White rad
icals are no exception. Many appear
anxious to be of help, as evidenced by
last night's rescheduling of the SDS
march, but as one SDS member said last
night, "We don't know exactly what
their plans are."
