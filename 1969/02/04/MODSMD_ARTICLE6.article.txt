# 'Ramparts' Founder Sees Biafran Strife As Holy War
## 
### DIARMUID McGUIRE 
It is about seven thousand miles in a
straight line from the shady lanes of
Atherton to the green countryside of
Biafra. You have to fly about twice that
far to get there, but Ed Keating, a Stan
ford graduate and father of five, made
the trip last week.
He came back with a strongly parti
san view of the tragic African conflict.

"I totally identify with Biafra,"
Keating says. He agrees with many Bi
afrans that the predominantly Muslem
Hausa and Fulani troops of the Federal
Government are waging jihad, or holy
war, on the Ibos of the Eastern Region,
many of whom are Anglican or Catho
lic.
Keating, whose fiery career includes
the founding of Ramparts, an unsuccess

ful campaign for a San Mateo Con
gressional seat and active defense of
Black Panther leader Huey Newton, ex
plained his views of Biafra to a Memor
ial Church audience Sunday night as
part of the Biafran relief campaign.
Protein Deficiency
The initial starvation, which was
caused by Kwashiorkor, or protein de
ficiency, and which killed many child
ren, has been nearly eliminated by air
lifts of protein concentrate, he says
But a second stage of the famine is
on the horizon. "Unless there is a cease
fire within 60 or 90 days, people will be
dropping like flies, but from lack of car
bohydrate rather than protein deficien
cy," Keating says.
At this point the Biafrans have eaten
most of their yams, cassavas and other
sources of carbohydrate, along with the
seeds for next year's crop. The planting
season has come but there is nothing to
plant.
"Everybody from Ojukwu on down
looks to the U.S. to pressure Britain and
other powers to force a cease fire,"
Keating says. "Unless that happens the
Biafran people are literally in mortal
danger."
Military Stalemate
Keating sees the military situation as
relatively stable. One sign of the stale
mate is that the central government has
not eliminated Biafra's single airstrip,
which is the only route bv which food

and supplies can reach the land-locked
rebels.
"If they shut it down 4 or 5 nights in
a row, half the children of Biafra would
be dead," Keating says. "Since they
haven't, it would seem that there are
some very serious political considera
tions behind all this."
Adverse world opinion and a possible
insurrection in the Western Region are
two factors that may prevent Nigeria
from delivering a final blow to the seces
sionist republic, in Keating's opinion.
Biafrans Trapped
Meanwhile about 12 million Biafrans
are trapped in an area about the size of
Delaware. In Keating's words, "There is
no economy in Biafra, virtually no cur
rency, very little commodity. A
chicken, if it were available, would sell
for about $14.40; a pack of cigarettes
for three English pounds."
The plain-talking former publisher of
Ramparts does not hesitate to identify
the source of the Biafran conflict: it is
ojl. "Shell has 800 million dollars in
vested in the tideland oilfields of Nigeria
and in Port Harcourt facilities," he says.
"The British have had a favored position
in terms of royalties on this oil."
Keating more than hints that Britain
is responsible for the Nigerian situation.
"The British are probably among the
most evil people who have ever lived,"
he says.

He blames them first for precipi
tously abandoning unstable African
colonies when they became unprofit
able, then for meddling in Nigeria's af
fairs when oil was discovered there.
Keating went to Biafra as part of a
fact-finding mission sponsored by the
American Committee to Keep Biafra
Alive. Other observers included: C. Ed
ward Crowther, an Anglican Bishop who
was deported by the Union of South
Africa, and Robert L. Hall, the black
director of Operation Bootstrap in Los
Angeles.
The circuitous route to Biafra led
Keating's group through Lisbon, Angola
and the island of Sao Tome, a Portugese
possession off the Nigerian Coast. Ten
relief aircraft each make two round trips
to Biafra from this island every night.
Mercenaries Spies
Sao Tome, Keating says, is "like
something out of a Hemingway
novel." The island is crowded with mer
cenaries, spies and pilots, some of whom
earn thousands of dollars a week for
"dueling with death, like matadors."
Once in Biafra, the fact-finders
visited refugee camps, had an audience
with the President and paid a brief visit
to the front. A week in the beleaguered
country was obviously enough to teach
Keating real affection for the Biafran
people.
"Biafrans are convinced to a man, to

a child, that the vandals [their name for
Nigerian soldiers] mean to exterminate
them," he says. "They are highiy moti
vated to defend themselves."
Devastated Territory
The tough Irishman's face becomes
animated as he recalls the realities of life
in the devastated African territory.
"You thank God for a glass of water,"
he says. "You don't ask if there is any
ice in it."
As for Biafra's future, Keating is sure
of one thing: "You will never get any
kind of stability if you try to force an
artificial Nigeria. It would be like trying
to make one state out of Israel and
Jordan."

earn thousands of dollars a week for
"dueling with death, like matadors."
Once in Biafra, the fact-finders
visited refugee camps, had an audience
with the President and paid a brief visit
to the front. A week in the beleaguered
country was obviously enough to teach
Keating real affection for the Biafran
people.
"Biafrans are convinced to a man, to

a child, that the vandals [their name for
Nigerian soldiers] mean to exterminate
them," he says. "They are highiy moti
vated to defend themselves."
Devastated Territory
The tough Irishman's face becomes
animated as he recalls the realities of life
in the devastated African territory.
"You thank God for a glass of water,"
he says. "You don't ask if there is any
ice in it."
As for Biafra's future, Keating is sure
of one thing: "You will never get any
kind of stability if you try to force an
artificial Nigeria. It would be like trying
to make one state out of Israel and
Jordan."


RAMPARTS EDlTOR—Edward Keating, taking a break during his campaign last year for tlx
House of Representatives.
It is about seven thousand miles in a
straight line from the shady lanes of
Atherton to the green countryside of
Biafra. You have to fly about twice that
far to get there, but Ed Keating, a Stan
ford graduate and father of five, made
the trip last week.
He came back with a strongly parti
san view of the tragic African conflict.

"I totally identify with Biafra,"
Keating says. He agrees with many Bi
afrans that the predominantly Muslem
Hausa and Fulani troops of the Federal
Government are waging jihad, or holy
war, on the Ibos of the Eastern Region,
many of whom are Anglican or Catho
lic.
Keating, whose fiery career includes
the founding of Ramparts, an unsuccess

ful campaign for a San Mateo Con
gressional seat and active defense of
Black Panther leader Huey Newton, ex
plained his views of Biafra to a Memor
ial Church audience Sunday night as
part of the Biafran relief campaign.
Protein Deficiency
The initial starvation, which was
caused by Kwashiorkor, or protein de
ficiency, and which killed many child
ren, has been nearly eliminated by air
lifts of protein concentrate, he says
But a second stage of the famine is
on the horizon. "Unless there is a cease
fire within 60 or 90 days, people will be
dropping like flies, but from lack of car
bohydrate rather than protein deficien
cy," Keating says.
At this point the Biafrans have eaten
most of their yams, cassavas and other
sources of carbohydrate, along with the
seeds for next year's crop. The planting
season has come but there is nothing to
plant.
"Everybody from Ojukwu on down
looks to the U.S. to pressure Britain and
other powers to force a cease fire,"
Keating says. "Unless that happens the
Biafran people are literally in mortal
danger."
Military Stalemate
Keating sees the military situation as
relatively stable. One sign of the stale
mate is that the central government has
not eliminated Biafra's single airstrip,
which is the only route bv which food

and supplies can reach the land-locked
rebels.
"If they shut it down 4 or 5 nights in
a row, half the children of Biafra would
be dead," Keating says. "Since they
haven't, it would seem that there are
some very serious political considera
tions behind all this."
Adverse world opinion and a possible
insurrection in the Western Region are
two factors that may prevent Nigeria
from delivering a final blow to the seces
sionist republic, in Keating's opinion.
Biafrans Trapped
Meanwhile about 12 million Biafrans
are trapped in an area about the size of
Delaware. In Keating's words, "There is
no economy in Biafra, virtually no cur
rency, very little commodity. A
chicken, if it were available, would sell
for about $14.40; a pack of cigarettes
for three English pounds."
The plain-talking former publisher of
Ramparts does not hesitate to identify
the source of the Biafran conflict: it is
ojl. "Shell has 800 million dollars in
vested in the tideland oilfields of Nigeria
and in Port Harcourt facilities," he says.
"The British have had a favored position
in terms of royalties on this oil."
Keating more than hints that Britain
is responsible for the Nigerian situation.
"The British are probably among the
most evil people who have ever lived,"
he says.

He blames them first for precipi
tously abandoning unstable African
colonies when they became unprofit
able, then for meddling in Nigeria's af
fairs when oil was discovered there.
Keating went to Biafra as part of a
fact-finding mission sponsored by the
American Committee to Keep Biafra
Alive. Other observers included: C. Ed
ward Crowther, an Anglican Bishop who
was deported by the Union of South
Africa, and Robert L. Hall, the black
director of Operation Bootstrap in Los
Angeles.
The circuitous route to Biafra led
Keating's group through Lisbon, Angola
and the island of Sao Tome, a Portugese
possession off the Nigerian Coast. Ten
relief aircraft each make two round trips
to Biafra from this island every night.
Mercenaries Spies
Sao Tome, Keating says, is "like
something out of a Hemingway
novel." The island is crowded with mer
cenaries, spies and pilots, some of whom
earn thousands of dollars a week for
"dueling with death, like matadors."

in terms of royalties on this oil."
Keating more than hints that Britain
is responsible for the Nigerian situation.
"The British are probably among the
most evil people who have ever lived,"
he says.

He blames them first for precipi
tously abandoning unstable African
colonies when they became unprofit
able, then for meddling in Nigeria's af
fairs when oil was discovered there.
Keating went to Biafra as part of a
fact-finding mission sponsored by the
American Committee to Keep Biafra
Alive. Other observers included: C. Ed
ward Crowther, an Anglican Bishop who
was deported by the Union of South
Africa, and Robert L. Hall, the black
director of Operation Bootstrap in Los
Angeles.
The circuitous route to Biafra led
Keating's group through Lisbon, Angola
and the island of Sao Tome, a Portugese
possession off the Nigerian Coast. Ten
relief aircraft each make two round trips
to Biafra from this island every night.
Mercenaries Spies
Sao Tome, Keating says, is "like
something out of a Hemingway
novel." The island is crowded with mer
cenaries, spies and pilots, some of whom
earn thousands of dollars a week for
"dueling with death, like matadors."
Once in Biafra, the fact-finders
visited refugee camps, had an audience
with the President and paid a brief visit
to the front. A week in the beleaguered
country was obviously enough to teach
Keating real affection for the Biafran
people.
"Biafrans are convinced to a man, to

a child, that the vandals [their name for
Nigerian soldiers] mean to exterminate
them," he says. "They are highiy moti
vated to defend themselves."
Devastated Territory
The tough Irishman's face becomes
animated as he recalls the realities of life
in the devastated African territory.
"You thank God for a glass of water,"
he says. "You don't ask if there is any
ice in it."
As for Biafra's future, Keating is sure
of one thing: "You will never get any
kind of stability if you try to force an
artificial Nigeria. It would be like trying
to make one state out of Israel and
Jordan."


RAMPARTS EDlTOR—Edward Keating, taking a break during his campaign last year for tlx
House of Representatives.
It is about seven thousand miles in a
straight line from the shady lanes of
Atherton to the green countryside of
Biafra. You have to fly about twice that
far to get there, but Ed Keating, a Stan
ford graduate and father of five, made
the trip last week.
He came back with a strongly parti
san view of the tragic African conflict.

"I totally identify with Biafra,"
Keating says. He agrees with many Bi
afrans that the predominantly Muslem
Hausa and Fulani troops of the Federal
Government are waging jihad, or holy
war, on the Ibos of the Eastern Region,
many of whom are Anglican or Catho
lic.
Keating, whose fiery career includes
the founding of Ramparts, an unsuccess

ful campaign for a San Mateo Con
gressional seat and active defense of
Black Panther leader Huey Newton, ex
plained his views of Biafra to a Memor
ial Church audience Sunday night as
part of the Biafran relief campaign.
Protein Deficiency
The initial starvation, which was
caused by Kwashiorkor, or protein de
ficiency, and which killed many child
ren, has been nearly eliminated by air
lifts of protein concentrate, he says
But a second stage of the famine is
on the horizon. "Unless there is a cease
fire within 60 or 90 days, people will be
dropping like flies, but from lack of car
bohydrate rather than protein deficien
cy," Keating says.
At this point the Biafrans have eaten
most of their yams, cassavas and other
sources of carbohydrate, along with the
seeds for next year's crop. The planting
season has come but there is nothing to
plant.
"Everybody from Ojukwu on down
looks to the U.S. to pressure Britain and
other powers to force a cease fire,"
Keating says. "Unless that happens the
Biafran people are literally in mortal
danger."
Military Stalemate
Keating sees the military situation as
relatively stable. One sign of the stale
mate is that the central government has
not eliminated Biafra's single airstrip,
which is the only route bv which food

and supplies can reach the land-locked
rebels.
"If they shut it down 4 or 5 nights in
a row, half the children of Biafra would
be dead," Keating says. "Since they
haven't, it would seem that there are
some very serious political considera
tions behind all this."
Adverse world opinion and a possible
insurrection in the Western Region are
two factors that may prevent Nigeria
from delivering a final blow to the seces
sionist republic, in Keating's opinion.
Biafrans Trapped
Meanwhile about 12 million Biafrans
are trapped in an area about the size of
Delaware. In Keating's words, "There is
no economy in Biafra, virtually no cur
rency, very little commodity. A
chicken, if it were available, would sell
for about $14.40; a pack of cigarettes
for three English pounds."
The plain-talking former publisher of
Ramparts does not hesitate to identify
the source of the Biafran conflict: it is
ojl. "Shell has 800 million dollars in
vested in the tideland oilfields of Nigeria
and in Port Harcourt facilities," he says.
"The British have had a favored position
in terms of royalties on this oil."
Keating more than hints that Britain
is responsible for the Nigerian situation.
"The British are probably among the
most evil people who have ever lived,"
he says.
