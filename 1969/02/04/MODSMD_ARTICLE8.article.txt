In an era when public support for higher educa
tion is withdrawing or settling, Stanford and other
universities need more effective spokesmen for the
needs, goals, and processes of what we're all about.
Too often, the needs and desires of the Univer
sity community are lost, distorted, or unreported
with the context of 'distasteful tactics'. The pop
ular myths surrounding SDS, San Francisco State,
Black Student Unions, and other groups would
have us believe that violence and irrationality are
the orders of the day on campus.
The Stanford Observer, while sometimes por
traying Stanford as a happy farm of booking and
quibbling, has made significant strides in this area.
The Alumni Association has also taken on a more
educative role. But this is not enough.

We have seen universities floundering in the
past two years over the draft laws, the research
cuts, and anti-riot amendments. There is no long
range input by universities into public policy that
directly affects them. Kingman Brewster of Yale is
the only official of a major university who spoke up
early enough to have some influence on the Selec
tive Service System. Later pressure was slow in
coming and virtually ineffective.
Stanford also has special problems as a prestig
ious, private university which should be brought to
the attention of Congress. The need for effective
lobbyists for education is painfully apparent. We
can't wait until another crisis comes along and sets
the University aquiver.
It's time for a little activism from administra
tive ranks before it's too late.
