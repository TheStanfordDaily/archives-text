## Relevance In Frats 
### Bill Freivogel 
Exclusion and intolerance of
diversity and two interrrelated is
sues that have risen to the top of
the murky pool of problems rele
vant to the 1960'5.
"I'm sorry, I can't serve you at
this lunch counter." "I'm sorry, it
seems as though one of the mem
bers has blackballed your mem
bership in the KNIGHTS OF
COLUMBUS." "I'm sorry, but
you don't seem to have enough
support to get in THE HOUSE."
The fraternity like the social
club institutionalizes clutching at
uniformity. How relevant can this
attitude be in the contemporary
academic community?
There are the days when stu
dents are supposed to be rejecting
false society—rejecting the anti
intellectualism of the 1950's—re
jecting the slothful pursuit of soc
ial justive. Or that is what I hear.
And these are the days of aca
demic relevance. Surely I can be
certain of that—Harvey Hukari
even agrees.
Rush
Fraternities are structured on
the false social situation of rush.
In the midst of students' hastened
intellectualism and social concern,
rush maintains a uniformity that
expresses concern in terms of
intramurals and Saturday nights.
The Stanford fraternity system
loses relevance as long as it stands
on the shoulders of the present
rush procedure. It is for this rea
son that some within the system
itself have moved to alter rush.
Their plan for a minimum of
selectivity aggregated into a draw
system promises considerable im
provement. It would reduce the
importance of the absurd notion
that the superficial relationship of
rush can serve as a gauge of the
rushee's personality. Most pres
sure would be removed from the
shoulders of the rushee. Ru'sh
would be transformed from a les
son in "confrontation social rela
tions" to a more relaxed inter
change of personality.
'Less Desirable'
Still some object. There seems
to be a widespread fear that the
"less desirable elements" of the
campus will infiltrate and destroy
the fraternal system—kind of like
the Communists would do if we
let them.
This consideration is a far too
simplistic and pessimistic view of
man. I would question the as
sumption that it is the few rather
than the many who are compat
ible. It is unreasonable to predict
that the proposed system would
admit a larger number of incom
patible members that the rush sit
uation does at present. Rush is
not an accurate measure of per
sonality, and there just are not

that many UNDESIRABLES.
The same argument applies to
the criticism that fewer desirables
will be admitted. Such an opinion
presumes that some people are
more desirable, that people can
guage which are more desirable,
and, finally, that the rush system
is conducive to this judgement. At
least the last of these assumptions
is invalid.
Fraternity does mean brother
hood. But the rush system incor
porates into the Sranford Frater
nities an intolerant, exclusive, un
feeling sense of brotherhood. As
such, fraternities are part of a
false definition of brotherhood.
And it is the definition of brother
hood that all of this student dis
content and protest are about. It
is the heart of our relevancy. And
the Stanford fraternal system has
not yet responded.
