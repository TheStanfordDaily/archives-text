# The 						Fourth Virtue
## The 						Bare Facts 
### Felicity Barringer 
Increasing concern over the ex
hibitionist who has been frequen
ting the stacks has moved the
Stanford Police to issue a set of
directives to co-eds on campus.
This list is entitled "Things
You Can Do To Help Stop Exhibi
tionists." It is obvious that this
piece of deathless prose came
from the same tradition that in
spired such stirring rallying cries
as "Stand Up and Be Counted In
the Fight Against Communism."
For the edification of all those co
eds who did not get a chance to
see this list, The Daily -vyill give a
resume of the directives.
The first rule is to try to get a
look at his face. The importance
of this cannot be overstated. The
face of an exhibitionist can tell
you a great deal about him. The
sorrow which he may have exper
ienced in his childhood could be
deeply etched in the lines above
his forehead. The pain of early re
jection might show in his eyes.
And these might be useful to note
if you ever had to pick him out of
a police line-up.
The importance of Rule 1 is
shown by Rule 2, which states,
"If in the library stacks get down
onto the floor if you have to, to
be able to get a look at his face."
The psychology behind this
rule is obvious. How often have
you seen someone lying on the
floor in the stacks? An exhibition
ist is as curious as anyone else,
and besides that, most exhibition
ists are very kindhearted. If you're
lying on the floor, you might be
sick. Any concerned exhibitionist
would come over to check, and
then you would have a good op
portunity to look at his face.
The third rule is extremely im
portant for identification pur
poses. You should look carefully

to see what kind of clothing, the
color, the type, and the amount,
which the exhibitionist had on. If
he wasn't wearing anything, you
may disregard this rule.
The fourth rule states, "Call
out to anyone near by so that
they can see him, too." It is nice
to know that the Stanford Police
Department advocates unselfish
ness. Let other people in on the
fun.
The fifth and sixth rules are of
the "which way did he go" var
iety. If the exhibitionist is in a
car, take down the make, license
number, color and equipment.
Being an exhibitionist, he would
probably have a red or perhaps an
orange sports car. As there are not
many of these in the stacks, the
police should be able to find him
easily.
The final requests show the in
tricacy of police procedure in
cases like this. When the police
come, you must be ready to tell
them "Why did you notice him in
the first place, did he do some
thing to get you to look at him?"
This will enable the police to de
termine whether he was an exhibi
tionist or not.
The exhibitionist, or exhibi
tionists on campus have been
holding office hours at the stacks,
and have been known to appear
near the women's gym and behind
Dinkelspiel, in the bushes. You
can find out the exact informa
tion on their hours by calling the
Stanford Police.
Please follow these instructions
carefully. You may disconcert the
poor exhibitonist enough that he
will turn himself in.
