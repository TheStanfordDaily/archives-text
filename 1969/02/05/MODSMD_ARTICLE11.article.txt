## Chicano: Black Or White? 
### Agustin Medina, Jr 
"But I'm not Caucasian, I'm
Mexican," insisted the young
Chicano as a Sergeant (who also
happened to be Mexican Ameri
can) challenged the former's desig
nation of himself as "Mexican"
when the p re-induction form
called for respondent's "race."
This incident points up an issue
that is of great concern to many
Mexican Americans today. For if
one dichotomizes the human pop
ulation into the "colored" and the
"colorless" where does the Mexi
can American stand? White people
of Spanish surname or Brown peo
ple?
The matter was brought to the
forefront some time ago when
someone decided that Chicanos
were officially white. And many
Mexicans, having inculcated that
fundamental American value cal
led racism, have chosen to cling
tenaciously to this psychological
crutch of identity with the Cauca
sian community.
If racism is very crudely de
fined as the positioning of one
group of people as superior to any
others based on considerations of
race, then it is palpably the case
that in order to perpetuate a
system whereby white people are
arbitrarily rewarded with more
opportunities in whatever the
realm of social life, it is necessary
not only for white people to feel
superior and be willing to exploit
and discriminate against colored
peoples, it is also necessary for the
latter to feel inferior and believe
that white is superior.
Thus many Mexicans, finding it
to their advantage, socially and
economically, to pass for Cau
casian end up by resorting to ex
treme, though pathetically amus
ing means in order to accomplish
this. Finding the surname "Val
enzuela" too restrictive of social
mobility, an uptight Chicano will
change it to, for him, a more pal
atable "Valens." One individual

who was the spitting image of
Benito Juarez insisted he was
French Canadian. And one with a
Spanish accent at that!
But just as many Mexicans find
solace in being legally classified as
Caucasian, many more are reject
ing this manner of gaining accep
tance by white society. Under
lying much of the militancy of
Chicano youth organizations to
day is the insistence that they will
no longer attempt to cast them
selves in the Anglo's image in
order to gain entrance into the
great mainstream.
They are saying that Chicanos
will mold and define themselves
and that white society will have to
accept them on these terms.
Though someone in Washington
might proclaim that Mexicans are
Caucasians, that doesn't help a
Chicano in Texas in dealing with
the rabid anti-Mexican Texans
that fester there.
Mexicans Not White
Many Mexicans do not look
white, most are not treated like
whites, and most importantly, all
should realize that there is no in
trinsic virtue in being white. But
the tenacles of racism have ex
tended too far and penetrated too
deep into the psyches of many
Mexicans to be able to help them.
And so it is a tragic thing to hear
Mexican children ask their parents
in moments of candor "Why did I
have to be born with dark skin?"
Or consider another manifesta
tion of psychological decay where
Mexican parents will point with
pride, in however subtle a manner,
to the fact that their children have
fair skins. What irony that many
whites seasonally undergo a tortu
ous ritual called sunbathing to ac
quire something Chicanos are
given by birthright but that many
are ashamed of!
Indeed, one of the most form
idable obstacles facing the initia

tion of a monolithic Mexican-
American movement toward equal
rights is this matter under discus
sion. For the "white" Mexican
there are really no problems with
in the Mexican-American com
munity that are not the result of
the Mexican's insistence on being
Mexican, pero firme.
If only Mexicans would
abandon the use of Spanish, if
only they would give up frijoles
and tortillas, if only they would
stop being Mexican and model
themselves after such truly Ameri
can families as the Reagans or the
Nixons. Then they would not be
culturally deprived.
If Chicanos could only eduate
themselves and thus be armed
with the proper attitudes and
social skills for the quest after the
almighty dollar so that they might
all have color TV sets and swim
ming pools, then they would have
culture. Chicanos must learn to be
Americans, these vendidos insist!
After all, there are many Mexicans
who have been in this country for
decades and have not learned that
the sanctity of private property
takes precedence over being your
self.
Nevertheless, at least with re
spect to language there are cer
tainly benefits to be gained by
knowing English as well as Span
ish. To cite one example pointed
out by a Chicano professor, if
more agricultural workers in De
lano commanded a better grasp of
the Enligh language, they might
be able to convey to growers such
sentiments as "Pick your own
damn grapes!"

Liberation Needed
And so it is that organizations
such as MASC see as one of their
main tasks the resocializing of
Mexican Americans who are con
fused as to what they are. It is a
matter of arousing their hermanos
from self-hate and sense of worth
lessness, to make them understand
that they must cease their rela
tionships vis-a-vis Anglos in terms
of subordinate to superordinate.
This is liberation.
As for American society as a
whole, racial harmony will be
come a reality only when whites
are able to conceive how a person
could have a choice of color and
not chose white. Americans of
color, for their part, should be
concerned with arriving at a
mutual understanding with white
people on this point.
For in the end, it is the propen
sity of whites to frequent out
bursts of barbaric behavior dir
ected against people of color that
augurs ill for the future of this
country. For it is evident that
rarely has white America dis
played either the incredible pati
ence of Black people or the polite
ness of the Mexican.

realm of social life, it is necessary
not only for white people to feel
superior and be willing to exploit
and discriminate against colored
peoples, it is also necessary for the
latter to feel inferior and believe
that white is superior.
Thus many Mexicans, finding it
to their advantage, socially and
economically, to pass for Cau
casian end up by resorting to ex
treme, though pathetically amus
ing means in order to accomplish
this. Finding the surname "Val
enzuela" too restrictive of social
mobility, an uptight Chicano will
change it to, for him, a more pal
atable "Valens." One individual

who was the spitting image of
Benito Juarez insisted he was
French Canadian. And one with a
Spanish accent at that!
But just as many Mexicans find
solace in being legally classified as
Caucasian, many more are reject
ing this manner of gaining accep
tance by white society. Under
lying much of the militancy of
Chicano youth organizations to
day is the insistence that they will
no longer attempt to cast them
selves in the Anglo's image in
order to gain entrance into the
great mainstream.
They are saying that Chicanos
will mold and define themselves
and that white society will have to
accept them on these terms.
Though someone in Washington
might proclaim that Mexicans are
Caucasians, that doesn't help a
Chicano in Texas in dealing with
the rabid anti-Mexican Texans
that fester there.
Mexicans Not White
Many Mexicans do not look
white, most are not treated like
whites, and most importantly, all
should realize that there is no in
trinsic virtue in being white. But
the tenacles of racism have ex
tended too far and penetrated too
deep into the psyches of many
Mexicans to be able to help them.
And so it is a tragic thing to hear
Mexican children ask their parents
in moments of candor "Why did I
have to be born with dark skin?"
Or consider another manifesta
tion of psychological decay where
Mexican parents will point with
pride, in however subtle a manner,
to the fact that their children have
fair skins. What irony that many
whites seasonally undergo a tortu
ous ritual called sunbathing to ac
quire something Chicanos are
given by birthright but that many
are ashamed of!
Indeed, one of the most form
idable obstacles facing the initia

tion of a monolithic Mexican-
American movement toward equal
rights is this matter under discus
sion. For the "white" Mexican
there are really no problems with
in the Mexican-American com
munity that are not the result of
the Mexican's insistence on being
Mexican, pero firme.
If only Mexicans would
abandon the use of Spanish, if
only they would give up frijoles
and tortillas, if only they would
stop being Mexican and model
themselves after such truly Ameri
can families as the Reagans or the
Nixons. Then they would not be
culturally deprived.
If Chicanos could only eduate
themselves and thus be armed
with the proper attitudes and
social skills for the quest after the
almighty dollar so that they might
all have color TV sets and swim
ming pools, then they would have
culture. Chicanos must learn to be
Americans, these vendidos insist!
After all, there are many Mexicans
who have been in this country for
decades and have not learned that
the sanctity of private property
takes precedence over being your
self.
Nevertheless, at least with re
spect to language there are cer
tainly benefits to be gained by
knowing English as well as Span
ish. To cite one example pointed
out by a Chicano professor, if
more agricultural workers in De
lano commanded a better grasp of
the Enligh language, they might
be able to convey to growers such
sentiments as "Pick your own
damn grapes!"

Liberation Needed
And so it is that organizations
such as MASC see as one of their
main tasks the resocializing of
Mexican Americans who are con
fused as to what they are. It is a
matter of arousing their hermanos
from self-hate and sense of worth
lessness, to make them understand
that they must cease their rela
tionships vis-a-vis Anglos in terms
of subordinate to superordinate.
This is liberation.
As for American society as a
whole, racial harmony will be
come a reality only when whites
are able to conceive how a person
could have a choice of color and
not chose white. Americans of
color, for their part, should be
concerned with arriving at a
mutual understanding with white
people on this point.
For in the end, it is the propen
sity of whites to frequent out
bursts of barbaric behavior dir
ected against people of color that
augurs ill for the future of this
country. For it is evident that
rarely has white America dis
played either the incredible pati
ence of Black people or the polite
ness of the Mexican.

Though someone in Washington
might proclaim that Mexicans are
Caucasians, that doesn't help a
Chicano in Texas in dealing with
the rabid anti-Mexican Texans
that fester there.
Mexicans Not White
Many Mexicans do not look
white, most are not treated like
whites, and most importantly, all
should realize that there is no in
trinsic virtue in being white. But
the tenacles of racism have ex
tended too far and penetrated too
deep into the psyches of many
Mexicans to be able to help them.
And so it is a tragic thing to hear
Mexican children ask their parents
in moments of candor "Why did I
have to be born with dark skin?"
Or consider another manifesta
tion of psychological decay where
Mexican parents will point with
pride, in however subtle a manner,
to the fact that their children have
fair skins. What irony that many
whites seasonally undergo a tortu
ous ritual called sunbathing to ac
quire something Chicanos are
given by birthright but that many
are ashamed of!
Indeed, one of the most form
idable obstacles facing the initia

tion of a monolithic Mexican-
American movement toward equal
rights is this matter under discus
sion. For the "white" Mexican
there are really no problems with
in the Mexican-American com
munity that are not the result of
the Mexican's insistence on being
Mexican, pero firme.
If only Mexicans would
abandon the use of Spanish, if
only they would give up frijoles
and tortillas, if only they would
stop being Mexican and model
themselves after such truly Ameri
can families as the Reagans or the
Nixons. Then they would not be
culturally deprived.
If Chicanos could only eduate
themselves and thus be armed
with the proper attitudes and
social skills for the quest after the
almighty dollar so that they might
all have color TV sets and swim
ming pools, then they would have
culture. Chicanos must learn to be
Americans, these vendidos insist!
After all, there are many Mexicans
who have been in this country for
decades and have not learned that
the sanctity of private property
takes precedence over being your
self.
Nevertheless, at least with re
spect to language there are cer
tainly benefits to be gained by
knowing English as well as Span
ish. To cite one example pointed
out by a Chicano professor, if
more agricultural workers in De
lano commanded a better grasp of
the Enligh language, they might
be able to convey to growers such
sentiments as "Pick your own
damn grapes!"

Liberation Needed
And so it is that organizations
such as MASC see as one of their
main tasks the resocializing of
Mexican Americans who are con
fused as to what they are. It is a
matter of arousing their hermanos
from self-hate and sense of worth
lessness, to make them understand
that they must cease their rela
tionships vis-a-vis Anglos in terms
of subordinate to superordinate.
This is liberation.
As for American society as a
whole, racial harmony will be
come a reality only when whites
are able to conceive how a person
could have a choice of color and
not chose white. Americans of
color, for their part, should be
concerned with arriving at a
mutual understanding with white
people on this point.
For in the end, it is the propen
sity of whites to frequent out
bursts of barbaric behavior dir
ected against people of color that
augurs ill for the future of this
country. For it is evident that
rarely has white America dis
played either the incredible pati
ence of Black people or the polite
ness of the Mexican.

"But I'm not Caucasian, I'm
Mexican," insisted the young
Chicano as a Sergeant (who also
happened to be Mexican Ameri
can) challenged the former's desig
nation of himself as "Mexican"
when the p re-induction form
called for respondent's "race."
This incident points up an issue
that is of great concern to many
Mexican Americans today. For if
one dichotomizes the human pop
ulation into the "colored" and the
"colorless" where does the Mexi
can American stand? White people
of Spanish surname or Brown peo
ple?
The matter was brought to the
forefront some time ago when
someone decided that Chicanos
were officially white. And many
Mexicans, having inculcated that
fundamental American value cal
led racism, have chosen to cling
tenaciously to this psychological
crutch of identity with the Cauca
sian community.
If racism is very crudely de
fined as the positioning of one
group of people as superior to any
others based on considerations of
race, then it is palpably the case
that in order to perpetuate a
system whereby white people are
arbitrarily rewarded with more
opportunities in whatever the
realm of social life, it is necessary
not only for white people to feel
superior and be willing to exploit
and discriminate against colored
peoples, it is also necessary for the
latter to feel inferior and believe
that white is superior.
Thus many Mexicans, finding it
to their advantage, socially and
economically, to pass for Cau
casian end up by resorting to ex
treme, though pathetically amus
ing means in order to accomplish
this. Finding the surname "Val
enzuela" too restrictive of social
mobility, an uptight Chicano will
change it to, for him, a more pal
atable "Valens." One individual

who was the spitting image of
Benito Juarez insisted he was
French Canadian. And one with a
Spanish accent at that!
But just as many Mexicans find
solace in being legally classified as
Caucasian, many more are reject
ing this manner of gaining accep
tance by white society. Under
lying much of the militancy of
Chicano youth organizations to
day is the insistence that they will
no longer attempt to cast them
selves in the Anglo's image in
order to gain entrance into the
great mainstream.
They are saying that Chicanos
will mold and define themselves
and that white society will have to
accept them on these terms.

Caucasians, that doesn't help a
Chicano in Texas in dealing with
the rabid anti-Mexican Texans
