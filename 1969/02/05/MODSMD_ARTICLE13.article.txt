## A 						$4000 Debate 
### Rod McCallum John Montague 
The ASSU Speech Association
in recent weeks has forced the
Legislature to spend much of its
time considering an "emergency
appropriation" of $4000 to in
crease its allocation for the year
to $7000. This appropriation has
been vetoed by ASSU President
Denis Hayes, after having been
passed at the last LASSU meeting
by more than two thirds of those
present.
Hayes' reasons for vetoing the
appropriation can best be summed
up in a sentence taken from a let
ter trom Hayes to LASSU Speaker
Yale Braunstein: "The Speech As
sociation is simply not worth
$7000 to the Stanford student
body."
I agree wholeheartedly with
Mr. Hayes' statement.
The Speech Association's activ
ities include hosting several on
campus debates and tournaments
throughout the country to com
pete. A look at the Association's
budget and schedule for the year
points up some interesting facts
about how worthwhile their activ
ities are to the Stanford commun
ity.
The budget shows a total ap
propriation of $3000. The first
entry is $33.00 for office ex
penses. The second set of entries
entitled "On Campus Debates"
totals $1130. And the third set
for "Off Campus Debates" is
$1837.
Of the eight on campus events,
one—the Redwood National Invi
tational Tournament (appropria
tion—slso.oo) was held during
winter break, a time when very
few Stanford students were
around.

So we see that over half the ap
propriation is spent for activities
which take place where the Stan
ford community (except for the
relatively few members of the
Speech Association) can derive no
possible benefit from them.
Yet the only reason I have
been able to extract from an>
member of the Association for an
increase of $4000 in their budget
is so they can "go to more de
bates." Note, they do not say
"host more debates" but "go to
more debates."
These people want to double
their present allocation in order to
pay transportation, lodging and
other costs incurred while travel
ling all over the United States!
You and I should be so lucky as
to receive all-expense paid vaca
tions during the school year.
The ASSU Constitution states
that "nothing (beyond the orig
inal budget appropriations) will bn
appropriated during the ensuing
year save in the event of an extra -
ordinary emergency." If a trip to
the east coast for the debate team
is an "extraordinary emergency
then LASSU had better expect a
hell of a lot of requests for such
appropriations. A lot of bored stu
dents may be facing such emer
gencies right now.
It would be a good idea to
place the issue before the student
body in the form of a referendum
to see just how ethical it feels this
misuse of funds is.

one—the Redwood National Invi
tational Tournament (appropria
tion—slso.oo) was held during
winter break, a time when very
few Stanford students were
around.

So we see that over half the ap
propriation is spent for activities
which take place where the Stan
ford community (except for the
relatively few members of the
Speech Association) can derive no
possible benefit from them.
Yet the only reason I have
been able to extract from an>
member of the Association for an
increase of $4000 in their budget
is so they can "go to more de
bates." Note, they do not say
"host more debates" but "go to
more debates."
These people want to double
their present allocation in order to
pay transportation, lodging and
other costs incurred while travel
ling all over the United States!
You and I should be so lucky as
to receive all-expense paid vaca
tions during the school year.
The ASSU Constitution states
that "nothing (beyond the orig
inal budget appropriations) will bn
appropriated during the ensuing
year save in the event of an extra -
ordinary emergency." If a trip to
the east coast for the debate team
is an "extraordinary emergency
then LASSU had better expect a
hell of a lot of requests for such
appropriations. A lot of bored stu
dents may be facing such emer
gencies right now.
It would be a good idea to
place the issue before the student
body in the form of a referendum
to see just how ethical it feels this
misuse of funds is.

The ASSU Speech Association
in recent weeks has forced the
Legislature to spend much of its
time considering an "emergency
appropriation" of $4000 to in
crease its allocation for the year
to $7000. This appropriation has
been vetoed by ASSU President
Denis Hayes, after having been
passed at the last LASSU meeting
by more than two thirds of those
present.
Hayes' reasons for vetoing the
appropriation can best be summed
up in a sentence taken from a let
ter trom Hayes to LASSU Speaker
Yale Braunstein: "The Speech As
sociation is simply not worth
$7000 to the Stanford student
body."
I agree wholeheartedly with
Mr. Hayes' statement.
The Speech Association's activ
ities include hosting several on
campus debates and tournaments
throughout the country to com
pete. A look at the Association's
budget and schedule for the year
points up some interesting facts
about how worthwhile their activ
ities are to the Stanford commun
ity.
The budget shows a total ap
propriation of $3000. The first
entry is $33.00 for office ex
penses. The second set of entries
entitled "On Campus Debates"
totals $1130. And the third set
for "Off Campus Debates" is
$1837.
Of the eight on campus events,
one—the Redwood National Invi
tational Tournament (appropria
tion—slso.oo) was held during
winter break, a time when very
few Stanford students were
around.
