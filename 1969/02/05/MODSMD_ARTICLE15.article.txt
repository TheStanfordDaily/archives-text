# "Do Your Own Thing": Serra House
## 
### CICELY HATES 
Community Action is Serra
House's theme, but the multitude
of projects and services sponsored
by small groups of members with
in the house have made "doing
your own thing" the essence of
Serra life.
From tutoring to establishing a
nursery school, Serra residents
have donated much of their
energy and skills in attempts to
aid residents of the surrounding
communities, particularly in Red
wood City and East Palo Alto.
One of the oldest programs of
Serra house is its tutorial program
in Redwood City. But Serra stu
dents are changing the "tutoring"
concept. Previously, the tutors
had assisted students by creating a
study hall atmosphere in which
the students could receive help
with their academic studies. In
many cases, this method does
little to raise the educational level
of the students —for the students
cannot speak English.
To Teach English
To solve the problem, about 30
Serra tutors are instigating a pro
gram to teach English to these stu
dents. As the tutors learn how to
teach English they will teach stu
dents in the Redwood City area to
teach English to their fellow stu
dents so that the community can
eventually take over the program.
Students will be able to learn
the appropriate teaching methods
in 9 to 12 hours from Katherine
Norman who is a language expert
from the Indo-American Mission.
This phonetic based method will
enable the tutors to teach English
to non-English speaking students
in 2 to 3 months.
Peter Hoch, Serra coordinator
of the project, felt that the pro
ject will be a success. "We are
going to use the Laback method
of tutoring which means that each
tutor will teach one student. This
one to one vasis makes the stu
dent feel that he is important."
Legal Aid
In two weeks another group of
students will begin giving legal aid
to people who lack knowledge
about their basic rights and who
therefore either do not know how
to take advantage of the law or
who allow the law to take ad
vantage of them.
The groundwork for such aid
was laid fall quarter in the form of
a Legal Aid Seminar taught by the
Assistant Dean of the Law School,
Thelton Henderson, and third
year law student and Serra tutor,
Rick Bradstreet. The seminar has
taught 15 students the legal con
ditions behind such events as ar
rests, signing leases and contracts,
and marital responsibilities. By in
forming various lay-groups such as
high school students and people in

job training programs, Serra stu
dents are endeavoring to teach the
peole how to avoid legal diffi
culties.
Another project designated to
ensure fair treatment of people
before the law is the Midpeninsula
Citizens for Fair Housing. Mem
bers of this project have surveyed
apartment buildings in the sur
rounding communities to see if
they are practicing any illegal dis
crimination policies.
Pose As T enants
In some cases Black and other
minority group students have
posed as prospective tenants to
gather their information. The
gathered information can then be
used either to advise people where
they can easily rent a place to live,
or the information can be used in
future housing court cases if
housing is denied anyone for
ethnic reasons.
In East Palo Alto, several stu
dents aid in the running of a com
munity House. It is designed as a
community center where people
can gather for recreation, legal
aid, and help for their everyday
problems.
Several campfire girls programs
have been started by girls in Serra
who realize the benefits a weekly
program of arts and crafts can
provide. Lower class children
don't have the opportunity for
such programs because of the ex
penses that go with them. So
badges and uniforms, rituals and
cookies have been thrown out,
but the idea of creativity has been
kept.
Other Activities
The Stanford Committee for
Nigerian/Biafran Relief that cul- !
minated in last night's fast was
organized by Serra House.
A nursery School has been
started and financed by one Serra
resident who felt such was needed
in East Palo Alto.
Blacks in the Sequoia High
School area now have better bus
service because students spoke at
their school board meeting and
participated in a student boycott.
East Palo Alto has a Big
Brother program with many Serra
House Participants.
"Superficially Unifying"
House RA Sandra Pearson acts
as coordinator of the many pro
jects and has found that action
does not necessarily bring about
unity. 'There is often a rift be
tween those who do and those
who don't. Some students are in
volved in help projects and don't
advertise the fact, while others try
to ram action down peoples'
throats. Although the theme is
superficially unifying, it can also -
be a dividing force.
"This division seems to come i

into prominance especially where
financial matters are concerned.
"Some students say that the more
money we give to projects, the
fewer parties we have. Others say
that the parties are phony and
want to use all the money on pro
jects. The important thing is that
we just don't give money away,
but that we use it."
Presently Serra money is dolled
out in small amounts—in most
cases for people who need materi

als for their projects. The house
plans to spend $200 on its latest
Redwood City language program.
Another obstacle to house
unity is the variety of reasons of
people for living in Serra. Resi
dent Victor Owen stated that
"there are too many people living
here for reasons other than the
theme."
Students against the theme
seem to be primarily those who

were assigned to live in the house
without their having any choice.
One student described the house
to be "like a working man in trac
tion; he may twitch now and then
to show he's got some bit of life
left in him, but he's not doing his
job fully. In other words, a com
munity action theme won't work
except in a token way when the
community (Serra) is removed
from where the action is. Either
transplant Serra to East Palo Alto
or Redwood City or change the
theme because community action
does not seem to command the in
volvement of most Serra resi
dents."
Perhaps as a house theme Com
munity Action will wither, but it
is almost certain to remain very
much alive within individual mem
bers.
If Serra cannot move all its
members to action, it can at least
show concerned people where op
portunities to help others lie.

we just don't give money away,
but that we use it."
Presently Serra money is dolled
out in small amounts—in most
cases for people who need materi

als for their projects. The house
plans to spend $200 on its latest
Redwood City language program.
Another obstacle to house
unity is the variety of reasons of
people for living in Serra. Resi
dent Victor Owen stated that
"there are too many people living
here for reasons other than the
theme."
Students against the theme
seem to be primarily those who

were assigned to live in the house
without their having any choice.
One student described the house
to be "like a working man in trac
tion; he may twitch now and then
to show he's got some bit of life
left in him, but he's not doing his
job fully. In other words, a com
munity action theme won't work
except in a token way when the
community (Serra) is removed
from where the action is. Either
transplant Serra to East Palo Alto
or Redwood City or change the
theme because community action
does not seem to command the in
volvement of most Serra resi
dents."
Perhaps as a house theme Com
munity Action will wither, but it
is almost certain to remain very
much alive within individual mem
bers.
If Serra cannot move all its
members to action, it can at least
show concerned people where op
portunities to help others lie.

LEGAL All) SEMINAR—Serra House members listen to a Law School pro
fessor. Many students in lite Stern llall dormitory spend much of their time
advising minority groups on legal rights.
Community Action is Serra
House's theme, but the multitude
of projects and services sponsored
by small groups of members with
in the house have made "doing
your own thing" the essence of
Serra life.
From tutoring to establishing a
nursery school, Serra residents
have donated much of their
energy and skills in attempts to
aid residents of the surrounding
communities, particularly in Red
wood City and East Palo Alto.
One of the oldest programs of
Serra house is its tutorial program
in Redwood City. But Serra stu
dents are changing the "tutoring"
concept. Previously, the tutors
had assisted students by creating a
study hall atmosphere in which
the students could receive help
with their academic studies. In
many cases, this method does
little to raise the educational level
of the students —for the students
cannot speak English.
To Teach English
To solve the problem, about 30
Serra tutors are instigating a pro
gram to teach English to these stu
dents. As the tutors learn how to
teach English they will teach stu
dents in the Redwood City area to
teach English to their fellow stu
dents so that the community can
eventually take over the program.
Students will be able to learn
the appropriate teaching methods
in 9 to 12 hours from Katherine
Norman who is a language expert
from the Indo-American Mission.
This phonetic based method will
enable the tutors to teach English
to non-English speaking students
in 2 to 3 months.
Peter Hoch, Serra coordinator
of the project, felt that the pro
ject will be a success. "We are
going to use the Laback method
of tutoring which means that each
tutor will teach one student. This
one to one vasis makes the stu
dent feel that he is important."
Legal Aid
In two weeks another group of
students will begin giving legal aid
to people who lack knowledge
about their basic rights and who
therefore either do not know how
to take advantage of the law or
who allow the law to take ad
vantage of them.
The groundwork for such aid
was laid fall quarter in the form of
a Legal Aid Seminar taught by the
Assistant Dean of the Law School,
Thelton Henderson, and third
year law student and Serra tutor,
Rick Bradstreet. The seminar has
taught 15 students the legal con
ditions behind such events as ar
rests, signing leases and contracts,
and marital responsibilities. By in
forming various lay-groups such as
high school students and people in

job training programs, Serra stu
dents are endeavoring to teach the
peole how to avoid legal diffi
culties.
Another project designated to
ensure fair treatment of people
before the law is the Midpeninsula
Citizens for Fair Housing. Mem
bers of this project have surveyed
apartment buildings in the sur
rounding communities to see if
they are practicing any illegal dis
crimination policies.
Pose As T enants
In some cases Black and other
minority group students have
posed as prospective tenants to
gather their information. The
gathered information can then be
used either to advise people where
they can easily rent a place to live,
or the information can be used in
future housing court cases if
housing is denied anyone for
ethnic reasons.
In East Palo Alto, several stu
dents aid in the running of a com
munity House. It is designed as a
community center where people
can gather for recreation, legal
aid, and help for their everyday
problems.
Several campfire girls programs
have been started by girls in Serra
who realize the benefits a weekly
program of arts and crafts can
provide. Lower class children
don't have the opportunity for
such programs because of the ex
penses that go with them. So
badges and uniforms, rituals and
cookies have been thrown out,
but the idea of creativity has been
kept.
Other Activities
The Stanford Committee for
Nigerian/Biafran Relief that cul- !
minated in last night's fast was
organized by Serra House.
A nursery School has been
started and financed by one Serra
resident who felt such was needed
in East Palo Alto.
Blacks in the Sequoia High
School area now have better bus
service because students spoke at
their school board meeting and
participated in a student boycott.
East Palo Alto has a Big
Brother program with many Serra
House Participants.
"Superficially Unifying"
House RA Sandra Pearson acts
as coordinator of the many pro
jects and has found that action
does not necessarily bring about
unity. 'There is often a rift be
tween those who do and those
who don't. Some students are in
volved in help projects and don't
advertise the fact, while others try
to ram action down peoples'
throats. Although the theme is
superficially unifying, it can also -
be a dividing force.
"This division seems to come i

into prominance especially where
financial matters are concerned.
"Some students say that the more
money we give to projects, the
fewer parties we have. Others say
that the parties are phony and
want to use all the money on pro
jects. The important thing is that
we just don't give money away,
but that we use it."

Several campfire girls programs
have been started by girls in Serra
who realize the benefits a weekly
program of arts and crafts can
provide. Lower class children
don't have the opportunity for
such programs because of the ex
penses that go with them. So
badges and uniforms, rituals and
cookies have been thrown out,
but the idea of creativity has been
kept.
Other Activities
The Stanford Committee for
Nigerian/Biafran Relief that cul- !
minated in last night's fast was
organized by Serra House.
A nursery School has been
started and financed by one Serra
resident who felt such was needed
in East Palo Alto.
Blacks in the Sequoia High
School area now have better bus
service because students spoke at
their school board meeting and
participated in a student boycott.
East Palo Alto has a Big
Brother program with many Serra
House Participants.
"Superficially Unifying"
House RA Sandra Pearson acts
as coordinator of the many pro
jects and has found that action
does not necessarily bring about
unity. 'There is often a rift be
tween those who do and those
who don't. Some students are in
volved in help projects and don't
advertise the fact, while others try
to ram action down peoples'
throats. Although the theme is
superficially unifying, it can also -
be a dividing force.
"This division seems to come i

into prominance especially where
financial matters are concerned.
"Some students say that the more
money we give to projects, the
fewer parties we have. Others say
that the parties are phony and
want to use all the money on pro
jects. The important thing is that
we just don't give money away,
but that we use it."
Presently Serra money is dolled
out in small amounts—in most
cases for people who need materi

als for their projects. The house
plans to spend $200 on its latest
Redwood City language program.
Another obstacle to house
unity is the variety of reasons of
people for living in Serra. Resi
dent Victor Owen stated that
"there are too many people living
here for reasons other than the
theme."
Students against the theme
seem to be primarily those who

were assigned to live in the house
without their having any choice.
One student described the house
to be "like a working man in trac
tion; he may twitch now and then
to show he's got some bit of life
left in him, but he's not doing his
job fully. In other words, a com
munity action theme won't work
except in a token way when the
community (Serra) is removed
from where the action is. Either
transplant Serra to East Palo Alto
or Redwood City or change the
theme because community action
does not seem to command the in
volvement of most Serra resi
dents."
Perhaps as a house theme Com
munity Action will wither, but it
is almost certain to remain very
much alive within individual mem
bers.
If Serra cannot move all its
members to action, it can at least
show concerned people where op
portunities to help others lie.

LEGAL All) SEMINAR—Serra House members listen to a Law School pro
fessor. Many students in lite Stern llall dormitory spend much of their time
advising minority groups on legal rights.
Community Action is Serra
House's theme, but the multitude
of projects and services sponsored
by small groups of members with
in the house have made "doing
your own thing" the essence of
Serra life.
From tutoring to establishing a
nursery school, Serra residents
have donated much of their
energy and skills in attempts to
aid residents of the surrounding
communities, particularly in Red
wood City and East Palo Alto.
One of the oldest programs of
Serra house is its tutorial program
in Redwood City. But Serra stu
dents are changing the "tutoring"
concept. Previously, the tutors
had assisted students by creating a
study hall atmosphere in which
the students could receive help
with their academic studies. In
many cases, this method does
little to raise the educational level
of the students —for the students
cannot speak English.
To Teach English
To solve the problem, about 30
Serra tutors are instigating a pro
gram to teach English to these stu
dents. As the tutors learn how to
teach English they will teach stu
dents in the Redwood City area to
teach English to their fellow stu
dents so that the community can
eventually take over the program.
Students will be able to learn
the appropriate teaching methods
in 9 to 12 hours from Katherine
Norman who is a language expert
from the Indo-American Mission.
This phonetic based method will
enable the tutors to teach English
to non-English speaking students
in 2 to 3 months.
Peter Hoch, Serra coordinator
of the project, felt that the pro
ject will be a success. "We are
going to use the Laback method
of tutoring which means that each
tutor will teach one student. This
one to one vasis makes the stu
dent feel that he is important."
Legal Aid
In two weeks another group of
students will begin giving legal aid
to people who lack knowledge
about their basic rights and who
therefore either do not know how
to take advantage of the law or
who allow the law to take ad
vantage of them.
The groundwork for such aid
was laid fall quarter in the form of
a Legal Aid Seminar taught by the
Assistant Dean of the Law School,
Thelton Henderson, and third
year law student and Serra tutor,
Rick Bradstreet. The seminar has
taught 15 students the legal con
ditions behind such events as ar
rests, signing leases and contracts,
and marital responsibilities. By in
forming various lay-groups such as
high school students and people in

job training programs, Serra stu
dents are endeavoring to teach the
peole how to avoid legal diffi
culties.
Another project designated to
ensure fair treatment of people
before the law is the Midpeninsula
Citizens for Fair Housing. Mem
bers of this project have surveyed
apartment buildings in the sur
rounding communities to see if
they are practicing any illegal dis
crimination policies.
Pose As T enants
In some cases Black and other
minority group students have
posed as prospective tenants to
gather their information. The
gathered information can then be
used either to advise people where
they can easily rent a place to live,
or the information can be used in
future housing court cases if
housing is denied anyone for
ethnic reasons.
In East Palo Alto, several stu
dents aid in the running of a com
munity House. It is designed as a
community center where people
can gather for recreation, legal
aid, and help for their everyday
problems.
Several campfire girls programs
