# Debate Teams Take Tournament
## 
### DAVID DAVENPORT 
With one of the biggest sweeps
of a speech contest in the squad's
history, the Stanford debate team
captured all but one award at the
University of Utah tournament,
its most recent forensic competi
tion.
After preliminary rounds of de
bate, it was apparent that Stan
ford had the top five teams in the
tournament. Stanford teams
having won 24 of their 25 de
bates, the contest was halted with
out final rounds.
The five top debate awards
were presented to the following
Stanford teams: Ed Oster-Jim
Podczerwinski, John Mower-Skip
Stiver, Mark Beck-Chuck Fay, Jim
Baer-Mike Rogers, and Maralee
Beck-Marion Brewer.
The same debaters, all fresh
men, also captured all awards but
one in the individual speaking
events. These titles included the
top three places in impromptu
speaking, the top two honors in
oratory, and first and third places
in extemporaneous speaking.
The current financial dispute
involving LASSU, Denis Hayes,
and the Speech Association could
bring this season's debate program
to a premature halt.

Flans to send one team to Har
vard, one to Dartmouth, one to
Tulane, and six teams to San
Fernando for tournaments were
cancelled due to the financial
crisis.
Future tournament partici
pation is contingent on the out
come of the $4000 LASSU appro
priation.
II funds are received to com
plete the season, Stanford debate
teams will travel to tournaments
in two capacities. They plan to ad
dress alumni groups to aid in the
endowment drive as well as parti
cipate in the speech contests.
