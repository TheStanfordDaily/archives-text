# Paranoia Strikes Campus With 5th Bust Imminent
## 
### CRAIG WILSON 
Paranoia struck Stanford University
last night as stories of pot busts and
police raids swept the campus.
The rumors apparently were touched
off after word was spread that a warrant
was out for one student and that three
police vehicles had been seen later in the
day at Roble dormitory.
The warrant in question had been
issued by the Santa Clara County Police
Department for the arrest of Beta Chi
fraternity brother Roger Fink Monday
afternoon.
The police interrupted dinner at Beta
Chi to serve the warrant Monday even
ing. Fink was not at dinner and, accord
ing to the Santa Clara police, is still at
large. In addition two more marijuana
arrests within the last six days came to
light.
Arrest in San Jose
It was learned yesterday that Stan
ford student Steve Herasimchuk was ar
rested last Thursday evening along with
three other persons while driving in San
Jose.
The arrests were made after police in
advertantly stumbled on marijuana after
initially pulling over the car for a faulty
headlight.
Monday afternoon police arrested
John Shannon a non-student for posses
sion of marijuana on Museum Way at
Palm Drive late in the afternoon.
The arrest was the third on campus
; n *he last five days and the fourth with
in last two weeks. A warrant for a
fifth rn?.Â«rt is still outstanding.
Arrest in Library
Two weeks ago student John
Lanthier was arrested in the under
, a luate library for alleged possession
and sale of marijuana.
'.Ast Friday afternoon at Beta Chi
fraternity house John Fosdick was ar
rested for possession of marijuana and
possession of dangerous drugs. Reaction
to fhe string of events has been sub
stantial with stories and rumors of more
arrests coming from all over the campus.
esterday three police cars were seen
at Uoble dormitory setting off rumors
of another marijuana bust. Later it was
found that police were questioning a
solicitor who had improper identifi
cation.

A rumor was begun late in the after
noon that an arrest was imminent at
Soto house in the Wilbur dormitory set
ting off instant reaction from residents.
According to House Manager Jim
Glenn, "I conducted an inquiry .... I
went through the halls, and when
people asked, said that I had heard a
rumor that a bust was going on and
was trying to check it out."
The short investigation apparently
had a panicking effect. One resident
told THE DAILY last night that people
were "walking around not answering
questions, not giving any messages, and
getting rid of stuff down trash shoots
and down the toilets."
No Truth in Rumors
According to Glenn, he was "unable
to uncover any truth to any of the
rumors."
After hearing the rumor LASSU
speaker Yale Braunstein and Soto resi
dent Tim Logan rushed over to meet
with Dean of Students Joel Smith de
manding that students "be protected
from harassment and illegal arrests by
police." Associate Dean of Students Wil
lard Wyman and Assistant Dean Robert
Rosch were in attendance as well.
According to Logan, Assstant Dean
Rosch, "denied any complicity with the
recent marijuana arrests on campus."
Logan said that Braunstein proposed the
dean of students office begin a study
committee to define the legal rights of
students within the university corporate
structure.
Smith Denies Responsibility
Dean Smith said last night that he
felt he did not "have a responsibility to
protect or defend the rights of Stanford
students to use marijuana."
Logan said he told the Dean that "it
was indeed the moral responsibility of
the University to protect students in
every possible way."
He continued "that since Stanford is
a private property as well as being a
separate corporate entity, it is the Uni
versity's moral responsibility to halt
with all its money and facilities these
illegal activities by the Santa Clara
County Police."
Another Chicago
At the meeting Logan said that
"Braunstein continued that Stanford
could easily become another Chicago
unless the University takes immediate
steps to halt these immoral acts."
Logan also stated that "this summer
a foreign student at Stanford was arrest
ed for possession of marijuana. He was
released 24 hours later because the
police had no evidence that he had com
mitted a crime.
"While being interrogated, however,
the student was told that unless he co
operated, he would be deported.
"What this means," Logan con
jectured, "is that this person was told
that if he didn't turn in the nan.es of

people he might have known to possess
drugs he would be deported."
Question District Attorney
"As a member of the LASSU com
mittee to investigate off-campus police
activities, I want to question assistant
District Attorney Webb of Santa Clara
County. Webb stated that there was
nothing he could do about arrests ... it
was solely a matter for the police."
In other words, Logan contended, "if
the cops want to beat people up, there
is nothing that we can do to stop them.
"The DA refuses to halt these fla
grant violations of rights."
Last night Dean Wyman told THE
DAILY that an agreement had been
worked out with the Santa Clara
County Sheriff's office in which the uni
versity would henceforth take care of all
offenses on campus other than felonies.
Yesterday afternoon an organization
called the Campus Committee Against
Police Harassment was formed calling a
meeting for 7:30 this evening at Tre
sidder Union and issuing a circular re
counting the recent arrests on campus.
The organization called on the gener
al public, in its circular, to attend the
meeting tonight in order to "formally
call on President Pitzer to remove these
assorted local and federal law enforce
ment agents from the campus."
