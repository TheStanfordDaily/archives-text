# Indians Win Season Opener; Pros Commit Seven Errors
## 
### DAN BERNSTEIN 
It's not easy to win a ball game
when a team commits four errors.
But if that team is playing against
the Pittsburgh Pirates rookies who
are plagued with no less than
seven miscues, the tides of fortune
can easily change.
It was that kind of game
yesterday afternoon, as the Stan
ford Indians opened the 1969
baseball season by edging Pitts
burgh 5-4.
The game was a rriixture of
frustration with some clear signs
of promise, and although there
were more errors than total runs,
the hitting, as well as pitching po
tential broke through the haze of
an otherwise dull afternoon.
Stanford fell behind in the first
inning, committing three errors,
but giving up only one run. Lanky
Rod Poteete started the game for
the Indians, and settled down
after a shaky beginning.
Traling 1-0 going into the bot
tom of the second, left-fielder

Jack Hodges drew a walk, Chuck
Hoffmeister was safe on a fielder's
choice, and with one out, catcher
Bob Edie lined a single to left,
driving in one run and leaving men
on first and third.
Stanford Takes Lead
Poteete came to bat and exe
cuted a perfect squeeze play,
scoring Hoffmeister and sending
Edie to second. After reaching
base on an error, second baseman
Mike Ammirato was thrown out
trying to steal second, and Stan
ford was retired, leading by a
score of 2-1.
The Rookies quickly tied the
game in the top of the third on
Dave Arrington's 375 foot home
run. Stanford came right back in
the bottom of the inning on a
single by Mark Marquess, who had
wasted a double in the first inn
ing, followed by shortstop Russ
Tweet's blooper into shallow
centerfield.
Team captain, Bob Boone
lofted a long fly to right, allowing

both runners to advance one base.
With men on second and third and
one man out, Jack Hodges hit a
short, soft liner into centerfield,
and Marquess tagged-up and
scored, giving Stanford a 3-2 lead.
Pittsburgh tied it up once again
in their half of the fourth when
Mike Roberts, who had reached
base on a fielder's choice, went to
second on another fielder's
choice, and scored moments later
on a wild pitch from Poteete.
Keller Stops Pittsburgh
Both teams went scoreless for
the next two innings, as pitchers
on both teams were replaced, and
errors had temporarily subsided.
Phil Keller came in for the
Indians, and pitched four solid
innings in a brief but game
winning performance. Keller
moved the ball around with ex
ceptional accuracy and blazing
speed, and, along with Marquess
and Poteete, had a particularly en
couraging afternoon.
Stanford broke the tie on the
last of the sixth when Ron Shotts
smashed a grounder under the
shortstop's glove, and one out
later, Keller smashed a long fly
ball that was conveniently
dropped by the Pittsburgh left
fielder.

The Indians added what proved
to be the winning run in the
seventh on walks to Marquess and
Bob Boone, and a run-scoring
single by Jack Hodges.
Rookie Rally Fails
The Rookies tried to pull it out
in the the ninth with a
one-out single by Gene Clines
coupled with a two-out triple by
homerun king, Dave Arrington.
But the rally fell short when Kel
ler got secondbaseman Rudy
Brooks on strikes.
Thursday, the Indians face
some more rookies, this time from
Philadelphia, as they continue to
get tuned-up for an exciting and
rigorous Pacil'ic-8 schedule.

on a wild pitch from Poteete.
Keller Stops Pittsburgh
Both teams went scoreless for
the next two innings, as pitchers
on both teams were replaced, and
errors had temporarily subsided.
Phil Keller came in for the
Indians, and pitched four solid
innings in a brief but game
winning performance. Keller
moved the ball around with ex
ceptional accuracy and blazing
speed, and, along with Marquess
and Poteete, had a particularly en
couraging afternoon.
Stanford broke the tie on the
last of the sixth when Ron Shotts
smashed a grounder under the
shortstop's glove, and one out
later, Keller smashed a long fly
ball that was conveniently
dropped by the Pittsburgh left
fielder.

The Indians added what proved
to be the winning run in the
seventh on walks to Marquess and
Bob Boone, and a run-scoring
single by Jack Hodges.
Rookie Rally Fails
The Rookies tried to pull it out
in the the ninth with a
one-out single by Gene Clines
coupled with a two-out triple by
homerun king, Dave Arrington.
But the rally fell short when Kel
ler got secondbaseman Rudy
Brooks on strikes.
Thursday, the Indians face
some more rookies, this time from
Philadelphia, as they continue to
get tuned-up for an exciting and
rigorous Pacil'ic-8 schedule.
It's not easy to win a ball game
when a team commits four errors.
But if that team is playing against
the Pittsburgh Pirates rookies who
are plagued with no less than
seven miscues, the tides of fortune
can easily change.
It was that kind of game
yesterday afternoon, as the Stan
ford Indians opened the 1969
baseball season by edging Pitts
burgh 5-4.
The game was a rriixture of
frustration with some clear signs
of promise, and although there
were more errors than total runs,
the hitting, as well as pitching po
tential broke through the haze of
an otherwise dull afternoon.
Stanford fell behind in the first
inning, committing three errors,
but giving up only one run. Lanky
Rod Poteete started the game for
the Indians, and settled down
after a shaky beginning.
Traling 1-0 going into the bot
tom of the second, left-fielder

Jack Hodges drew a walk, Chuck
Hoffmeister was safe on a fielder's
choice, and with one out, catcher
Bob Edie lined a single to left,
driving in one run and leaving men
on first and third.
Stanford Takes Lead
Poteete came to bat and exe
cuted a perfect squeeze play,
scoring Hoffmeister and sending
Edie to second. After reaching
base on an error, second baseman
Mike Ammirato was thrown out
trying to steal second, and Stan
ford was retired, leading by a
score of 2-1.
The Rookies quickly tied the
game in the top of the third on
Dave Arrington's 375 foot home
run. Stanford came right back in
the bottom of the inning on a
single by Mark Marquess, who had
wasted a double in the first inn
ing, followed by shortstop Russ
Tweet's blooper into shallow
centerfield.
Team captain, Bob Boone
lofted a long fly to right, allowing

both runners to advance one base.
With men on second and third and
one man out, Jack Hodges hit a
short, soft liner into centerfield,
and Marquess tagged-up and
scored, giving Stanford a 3-2 lead.
Pittsburgh tied it up once again
in their half of the fourth when
Mike Roberts, who had reached
base on a fielder's choice, went to
second on another fielder's
choice, and scored moments later
on a wild pitch from Poteete.
