# Sailors Sweep Shields Race
## 
### 
A three-man Stanford sailing
crew swept five out of five races
to win first place in the Cornelius
Shields Trophy Race at Newport
Beach.
The other competing schools
were USC, UC Irvine Cal Poly,
and Orange Coast College.
Each team raced one-on-one
with every other team, a format
similar to the America's Cup
races.
Skipper Craig McCabe, Ray
Wilde, and Andy Rose easily out
distanced their opponent in all
five of the races.
Only USC could challenge
Stanford. After severe pre-start
maneuvering, Stanford's thirty
foot racing sloop crossed the start
ing line slightly ahead of the USC
boat.
The Southern Californians

stayed within half a boat length
until the weather mark, but Stan
ford turned on the steam (so to
speak) and had a comfortable
three-minute margin by the finish.
Stanford's Kennedy Cup Team
was selected last week.

Going to the NCAA Champion
ships at the Naval Academy this
April will be skipper Tom
McCarthy, Craig McCabe, Ray
Wilde, Steve Richards, Andy,
Rose, Larry Rosenzweig, Rod;
Calkins, and Kim Desenberg.
