# Resistance, UCM To Sponsor Discussion Of Radical Movement
## 
### BARBARA HYLAND 
For people unfamiliar with the radi
cal movement or scared off by its some
times violent tactics, the United Chris
t ,m Ministry (UCM) and the Resistance
a-e sponsoring a 4-part series of dis
c issions on the social and political
analysis of the radical position. The first
p.irt, "The Cold War: Whose Creation?"
i; tonight at 7:30 in Room 214 at
History Corner.
Paul Rupert of UCM explained that
the series originated from the noticeable
need for discussion of radical thought.
He noted that "one seldom encounters
a iy cogent radical analysis" in the class
rooms.
The purpose of the discussions is to
reasonably present "some sort of basic
radical critique of American foreign
p »l icy and the operation of the state
c »llege and university within that,"
Rupert said. He stressed that students
ould have an understanding of the
radical movement so that they will have
adequate background to attack or praise
it.
'An Extended Teach-In'
Rupert claimed, "Basic assumptions
of radical analysis have never been layed
out." He considers the program as a
"capsulated view of radical analysis" or
"an extended teach-in on imperialism."

He stressed that sponsoring the series
"doesn't mean total endorsement."
Rather it shows an awareness that the
radical perspective is often ignored and
a desire to present it. Rupert said that
"most people don't know what to read
or where to go to find an alternative
interpretation" of the history taught in
classrooms.
Since the international politics and
social priorities of the United States
have been largely shaped by our inter
pretation of the Cold War, the first dis
cussion will concern the origins and de
velopments of the Cold War.
Motives for the Cold War
Professor Barton Bernstein in history
will talk on American economy and its
influence on the judgements and moti
vations of our policy-makers. As a Cold
War revisionist, he disagrees with the be
lief that the Soviet Union started the
Cold War and that the motives for U.S.
involvement were to protect the "Free
World" from the Russian threat.
Peter Wiley of San Francisco will
speak with Bernstein on American
political economy. He is presently com
pleting a doctoral dissertation on Greece
in the post-war period for William
Appleman Williams, a leading Revision-

The second lecture, to be held on
Feb. 13, will focus on the history of the
U.S. role in Southeast Asia. Economics
Professor John Gurley will describe the
U.S. economy and relate it to other
"Free World" economies. He will give
both the liberal and Marxist interpre
tations.
Steve Weissman, a former Stanford
student presently serving a jail sentence
for his part in an Anti-Humphrey
demonstration, will also discuss America
in Southeast Asia.
Jim O'Connor will lead the third and
fourth parts in the series. O'Connor is
one of 28 striking teachers from San
Jose State College. The third lecture,
planned for Feb. 20, will concentrate on
the development of the modern corpor
ation as a major economic unit in the
private sector.
The Colleges' Role
The fourth discussion on Feb. 27 will
deal with the development of the state
as the servant of the private sector. It
will also include the question of the role
of the state college and university with
in the United States' foreign policy.
A tentative fifth discussion will view
Stanford and its function within U.S.
foreign policy and in the development
of the corporation.
