## 
### MARSHALL SCHWARTZ 
The Black Student Union (BSU)
yesterday demanded that Stanford em
bark on a major program of hiring black
administrators and faculty members,
and set up special programs for black
students.
Included in twelve demands, an
nounced at a noon White Plaza rally,
were requests for a black vice-president
in charge of all black affairs, a black
faculty member in every department,
and blacks in charge of black graduate
school admissions and black financial
aid.
The BSU also demanded that Prof.
Robert Koff of the School of Edu
cation, center of a still-brewing contro

versy, "be relieved of all duties at Stan
ford University, and that a black man
replace him as director of the STEP
(Stanford Teacher Education Program)
program."
An audience of about 600 listened
attentively as BSU vice-chairman Leo
Bazile read off the demands, which were
later presented to Provost Richard
Lyman in front of his office.
Pilzer Out of Town
Lyman, noting that President Ken
neth Pitzer was out of town, told BSU
chairman Nate Kirtman that the presi
dent would see the demands when he
returns Thursday morning, saying that
"we look forward to talking with you
about them."
No definite date for meetings was
set, but discussions are expected to be
gin early next week.
Other demands include hiring more
black staff members, adding five full
time black counselors at the Counseling
and Testing Center, revamping the
Work-Study program to provide higher
minimum wages and allow black:.; to
work in East Palo Alto community pro
jects instead of on-campus jobs, and es
tablishing an Afro-American Studies De
partment and an Afro-American Cultur
al Research Institute.
"Cultural Castration"
At the rally, Johnnie Scott, a senior
in creative writing, called the Uni
versity's attitude toward blacks "cultur
al imperialism and cultural castration."
He also blasted Koff for his remarks to a
black girl he interviewed for the STEP
program, remarks which touched off the
present controversy.
Bazile later noted that the BSU was
not asking whether or not Koff was
racist, but if the comments he made to
the student, Clarissa Stevenson, were
professional in nature.
According to the BSU, Koff asked
her if she had ever lacked the money to
buy sanitary napkins, or "have meat on
the table."
Equal Treatment?
"Our response was simply that we
wonder how many white girls who
apply for graduate school are asked
these questions," Scott said.
The Human Relations Commission is
presently investigating the charges, and
is expected to make its report in a few
days.
Commenting on the nature of the de
mands, Scott added, "For the moment,
it's reformist. But when we get to

moving, don't sit on your asses and say,
4 I don't understand why those black
folks got to act that way. Why can't
they use the traditional diplomatic
channels'?"
Institutional Racism
Leo Bazile, sophomore political
scence major from Oakland, also com
mented on institutional racism—"the
central issue for us." He questioned how
Stanford allows people to make com
ments like those of Koff.
"The Human Relations Commission
is nothing but a cooling down process,
as all democratic processes are," he said.
As for the recently established Afro-
American studies major, "Stanford is
always getting credit for a black studies
program that doesn't exist. I don't want
to study about this history of the black
in Latin America—l want to study about
me,-here," Bazile added.
"We use soul. Damn reason, logic, and
rationale. BSU has got new leadership.
We're going to be political," he con
cluded. "We're not goint to be demo
cratic. We're going to sit down and do it
the right way—once."
No More Games
After the rally, the blacks marched
to Provost Lyman's office to personally
present him with the demands. Nate
Kirtman handed them to him, com
menting, "We're not playing games any
more. We want direct action on them.
We're willing to talk."
Several administrators whose depart
ments were touched on by the demands
were contacted later in the day by the
Daily. Dr. John Black, head of Counsel
ing and Testing said, "We would love to
find one or more" black counselors, but
he said that the five demanded by the
BSU would be more than are needed.
Black Counselors Hard to Find
However, finding one is hard. It's a
difficult problem," he said. "They're in
great demand and short supply, and our
salary schedule is such that many are
beyond it already even though they
have less experience and training" than
our present counselors.
Although he has not been conducting
a major campaign to find a black for
Counseling and Testing, Black said he
didn't "know if it (the search for a
black) could be much more vigorous
than now." He added that the depart
ment presently has a black education
student working there part-time as a
trainee.
Robert P. Huff, director of Financial

Aids, said "we've tried to approach the
problems of our black students and
other minority students on an individual
basis. I think that we are going to have
to continue to do this."
"I think the basic problem has been
one of trying to take the procedures and
programs we've had available for stu
dents in the financial aid area and apply
them to black students generally. This ip
the great difficulty."
Another demand dealt with a single
black handling all black applications for
graduate admissions.
Departmental Control
Graduate Dean Virgil Whitaker notee
that, on the graduate level, "recruiting
and admissions is the function of each
department," making a job covering the
entire graduate division impossible—or
else of a "severely limited" nature.
Whitaker noted, however, that a pos
sible alternative would be to have r.
black who would be able to interest
blacks in applying to graduate school
here.
Provost Lyman sent a memo to all
faculty members last week urging them
to "be active in working toward in
creased enrollment of minority student:
at the graduate level," but the number
now enrolled is quite low.
Minority Recruitment Committee
One of the BSU requests asked that
"the minority recruitment committee
for the Medical School (set up only this
year) be given full power over minority
admissions."
Medical School Dean Robert J.
Glaser noted that acceptances had al
ready been sent to eight minority group
students for next year, and thought the
present arrangement was working well.
"I think we have a very good
relationship with the committee and I
don't sre any need to change it," ln
said. "I ..ave heard no complaints."
The School of Engineering also lu::;
some minority recruitment programs.
Associate Dean Lauress Wise noted
that the school's policy was to give
minority students two years of fellow
ship support when needed. Most nev,
students need only one year, and then
move on to research projects.
"This is really a commitment of what
we believe in," he said.
Wise also said that Robert Pritchard,
professor of electrical engineering, ha?
visited three black universities this
year-Howard, Southern, and Prairie
View A&M —to recruit blacks.

days.
Commenting on the nature of the de
mands, Scott added, "For the moment,
it's reformist. But when we get to

moving, don't sit on your asses and say,
4 I don't understand why those black
folks got to act that way. Why can't
they use the traditional diplomatic
channels'?"
Institutional Racism
Leo Bazile, sophomore political
scence major from Oakland, also com
mented on institutional racism—"the
central issue for us." He questioned how
Stanford allows people to make com
ments like those of Koff.
"The Human Relations Commission
is nothing but a cooling down process,
as all democratic processes are," he said.
As for the recently established Afro-
American studies major, "Stanford is
always getting credit for a black studies
program that doesn't exist. I don't want
to study about this history of the black
in Latin America—l want to study about
me,-here," Bazile added.
"We use soul. Damn reason, logic, and
rationale. BSU has got new leadership.
We're going to be political," he con
cluded. "We're not goint to be demo
cratic. We're going to sit down and do it
the right way—once."
No More Games
After the rally, the blacks marched
to Provost Lyman's office to personally
present him with the demands. Nate
Kirtman handed them to him, com
menting, "We're not playing games any
more. We want direct action on them.
We're willing to talk."
Several administrators whose depart
ments were touched on by the demands
were contacted later in the day by the
Daily. Dr. John Black, head of Counsel
ing and Testing said, "We would love to
find one or more" black counselors, but
he said that the five demanded by the
BSU would be more than are needed.
Black Counselors Hard to Find
However, finding one is hard. It's a
difficult problem," he said. "They're in
great demand and short supply, and our
salary schedule is such that many are
beyond it already even though they
have less experience and training" than
our present counselors.
Although he has not been conducting
a major campaign to find a black for
Counseling and Testing, Black said he
didn't "know if it (the search for a
black) could be much more vigorous
than now." He added that the depart
ment presently has a black education
student working there part-time as a
trainee.
Robert P. Huff, director of Financial

Aids, said "we've tried to approach the
problems of our black students and
other minority students on an individual
basis. I think that we are going to have
to continue to do this."
"I think the basic problem has been
one of trying to take the procedures and
programs we've had available for stu
dents in the financial aid area and apply
them to black students generally. This ip
the great difficulty."
Another demand dealt with a single
black handling all black applications for
graduate admissions.
Departmental Control
Graduate Dean Virgil Whitaker notee
that, on the graduate level, "recruiting
and admissions is the function of each
department," making a job covering the
entire graduate division impossible—or
else of a "severely limited" nature.
Whitaker noted, however, that a pos
sible alternative would be to have r.
black who would be able to interest
blacks in applying to graduate school
here.
Provost Lyman sent a memo to all
faculty members last week urging them
to "be active in working toward in
creased enrollment of minority student:
at the graduate level," but the number
now enrolled is quite low.
Minority Recruitment Committee
One of the BSU requests asked that
"the minority recruitment committee
for the Medical School (set up only this
year) be given full power over minority
admissions."
Medical School Dean Robert J.
Glaser noted that acceptances had al
ready been sent to eight minority group
students for next year, and thought the
present arrangement was working well.
"I think we have a very good
relationship with the committee and I
don't sre any need to change it," ln
said. "I ..ave heard no complaints."
The School of Engineering also lu::;
some minority recruitment programs.
Associate Dean Lauress Wise noted
that the school's policy was to give
minority students two years of fellow
ship support when needed. Most nev,
students need only one year, and then
move on to research projects.
"This is really a commitment of what
we believe in," he said.
Wise also said that Robert Pritchard,
professor of electrical engineering, ha?
visited three black universities this
year-Howard, Southern, and Prairie
View A&M —to recruit blacks.
The Black Student Union (BSU)
yesterday demanded that Stanford em
bark on a major program of hiring black
administrators and faculty members,
and set up special programs for black
students.
Included in twelve demands, an
nounced at a noon White Plaza rally,
were requests for a black vice-president
in charge of all black affairs, a black
faculty member in every department,
and blacks in charge of black graduate
school admissions and black financial
aid.
The BSU also demanded that Prof.
Robert Koff of the School of Edu
cation, center of a still-brewing contro

versy, "be relieved of all duties at Stan
ford University, and that a black man
replace him as director of the STEP
(Stanford Teacher Education Program)
program."
An audience of about 600 listened
attentively as BSU vice-chairman Leo
Bazile read off the demands, which were
later presented to Provost Richard
Lyman in front of his office.
Pilzer Out of Town
Lyman, noting that President Ken
neth Pitzer was out of town, told BSU
chairman Nate Kirtman that the presi
dent would see the demands when he
returns Thursday morning, saying that
"we look forward to talking with you
about them."
No definite date for meetings was
set, but discussions are expected to be
gin early next week.
Other demands include hiring more
black staff members, adding five full
time black counselors at the Counseling
and Testing Center, revamping the
Work-Study program to provide higher
minimum wages and allow black:.; to
work in East Palo Alto community pro
jects instead of on-campus jobs, and es
tablishing an Afro-American Studies De
partment and an Afro-American Cultur
al Research Institute.
"Cultural Castration"
At the rally, Johnnie Scott, a senior
in creative writing, called the Uni
versity's attitude toward blacks "cultur
al imperialism and cultural castration."
He also blasted Koff for his remarks to a
black girl he interviewed for the STEP
program, remarks which touched off the
present controversy.
Bazile later noted that the BSU was
not asking whether or not Koff was
racist, but if the comments he made to
the student, Clarissa Stevenson, were
professional in nature.
According to the BSU, Koff asked
her if she had ever lacked the money to
buy sanitary napkins, or "have meat on
the table."
Equal Treatment?
"Our response was simply that we
wonder how many white girls who
apply for graduate school are asked
these questions," Scott said.
The Human Relations Commission is
presently investigating the charges, and
is expected to make its report in a few
days.
Commenting on the nature of the de
mands, Scott added, "For the moment,

basis. I think that we are going to have
to continue to do this."
"I think the basic problem has been
one of trying to take the procedures and
programs we've had available for stu
dents in the financial aid area and apply
them to black students generally. This ip
the great difficulty."
Another demand dealt with a single
black handling all black applications for
graduate admissions.
Departmental Control
Graduate Dean Virgil Whitaker notee
that, on the graduate level, "recruiting
and admissions is the function of each
department," making a job covering the
entire graduate division impossible—or
else of a "severely limited" nature.
Whitaker noted, however, that a pos
sible alternative would be to have r.
black who would be able to interest
blacks in applying to graduate school
here.
Provost Lyman sent a memo to all
faculty members last week urging them
to "be active in working toward in
creased enrollment of minority student:
at the graduate level," but the number
now enrolled is quite low.
Minority Recruitment Committee
One of the BSU requests asked that
"the minority recruitment committee
for the Medical School (set up only this
year) be given full power over minority
admissions."
Medical School Dean Robert J.
Glaser noted that acceptances had al
ready been sent to eight minority group
students for next year, and thought the
present arrangement was working well.
"I think we have a very good
relationship with the committee and I
don't sre any need to change it," ln
said. "I ..ave heard no complaints."
The School of Engineering also lu::;
some minority recruitment programs.
Associate Dean Lauress Wise noted
that the school's policy was to give
minority students two years of fellow
ship support when needed. Most nev,
students need only one year, and then
move on to research projects.
"This is really a commitment of what
we believe in," he said.
Wise also said that Robert Pritchard,
professor of electrical engineering, ha?
visited three black universities this
year-Howard, Southern, and Prairie
View A&M —to recruit blacks.
The Black Student Union (BSU)
yesterday demanded that Stanford em
bark on a major program of hiring black
administrators and faculty members,
and set up special programs for black
students.
Included in twelve demands, an
nounced at a noon White Plaza rally,
were requests for a black vice-president
in charge of all black affairs, a black
faculty member in every department,
and blacks in charge of black graduate
school admissions and black financial
aid.
The BSU also demanded that Prof.
Robert Koff of the School of Edu
cation, center of a still-brewing contro

versy, "be relieved of all duties at Stan
ford University, and that a black man
replace him as director of the STEP
(Stanford Teacher Education Program)
program."
An audience of about 600 listened
attentively as BSU vice-chairman Leo
Bazile read off the demands, which were
later presented to Provost Richard
Lyman in front of his office.
Pilzer Out of Town
Lyman, noting that President Ken
neth Pitzer was out of town, told BSU
chairman Nate Kirtman that the presi
dent would see the demands when he
returns Thursday morning, saying that
"we look forward to talking with you
about them."
No definite date for meetings was
set, but discussions are expected to be
gin early next week.
Other demands include hiring more
black staff members, adding five full
time black counselors at the Counseling
and Testing Center, revamping the
Work-Study program to provide higher
minimum wages and allow black:.; to
work in East Palo Alto community pro
jects instead of on-campus jobs, and es
tablishing an Afro-American Studies De
partment and an Afro-American Cultur
al Research Institute.
"Cultural Castration"
At the rally, Johnnie Scott, a senior
in creative writing, called the Uni
versity's attitude toward blacks "cultur
al imperialism and cultural castration."
He also blasted Koff for his remarks to a
black girl he interviewed for the STEP
program, remarks which touched off the
present controversy.
Bazile later noted that the BSU was
not asking whether or not Koff was
racist, but if the comments he made to
the student, Clarissa Stevenson, were
professional in nature.
According to the BSU, Koff asked
her if she had ever lacked the money to
buy sanitary napkins, or "have meat on
the table."
Equal Treatment?
"Our response was simply that we
wonder how many white girls who
apply for graduate school are asked
these questions," Scott said.
The Human Relations Commission is
presently investigating the charges, and
is expected to make its report in a few
days.
Commenting on the nature of the de
mands, Scott added, "For the moment,
it's reformist. But when we get to

moving, don't sit on your asses and say,
4 I don't understand why those black
folks got to act that way. Why can't
they use the traditional diplomatic
channels'?"
Institutional Racism
Leo Bazile, sophomore political
scence major from Oakland, also com
mented on institutional racism—"the
central issue for us." He questioned how
Stanford allows people to make com
ments like those of Koff.
"The Human Relations Commission
is nothing but a cooling down process,
as all democratic processes are," he said.
As for the recently established Afro-
American studies major, "Stanford is
always getting credit for a black studies
program that doesn't exist. I don't want
to study about this history of the black
in Latin America—l want to study about
me,-here," Bazile added.
"We use soul. Damn reason, logic, and
rationale. BSU has got new leadership.
We're going to be political," he con
cluded. "We're not goint to be demo
cratic. We're going to sit down and do it
the right way—once."
No More Games
After the rally, the blacks marched
to Provost Lyman's office to personally
present him with the demands. Nate
Kirtman handed them to him, com
menting, "We're not playing games any
more. We want direct action on them.
We're willing to talk."
Several administrators whose depart
ments were touched on by the demands
were contacted later in the day by the
Daily. Dr. John Black, head of Counsel
ing and Testing said, "We would love to
find one or more" black counselors, but
he said that the five demanded by the
BSU would be more than are needed.
Black Counselors Hard to Find
However, finding one is hard. It's a
difficult problem," he said. "They're in
great demand and short supply, and our
salary schedule is such that many are
beyond it already even though they
have less experience and training" than
our present counselors.
Although he has not been conducting
a major campaign to find a black for
Counseling and Testing, Black said he
didn't "know if it (the search for a
black) could be much more vigorous
than now." He added that the depart
ment presently has a black education
student working there part-time as a
trainee.
Robert P. Huff, director of Financial

Aids, said "we've tried to approach the
problems of our black students and
other minority students on an individual
basis. I think that we are going to have
to continue to do this."

versy, "be relieved of all duties at Stan
ford University, and that a black man
replace him as director of the STEP
(Stanford Teacher Education Program)
program."
An audience of about 600 listened
attentively as BSU vice-chairman Leo
Bazile read off the demands, which were
later presented to Provost Richard
Lyman in front of his office.
Pilzer Out of Town
Lyman, noting that President Ken
neth Pitzer was out of town, told BSU
chairman Nate Kirtman that the presi
dent would see the demands when he
returns Thursday morning, saying that
"we look forward to talking with you
about them."
No definite date for meetings was
set, but discussions are expected to be
gin early next week.
Other demands include hiring more
black staff members, adding five full
time black counselors at the Counseling
and Testing Center, revamping the
Work-Study program to provide higher
minimum wages and allow black:.; to
work in East Palo Alto community pro
jects instead of on-campus jobs, and es
tablishing an Afro-American Studies De
partment and an Afro-American Cultur
al Research Institute.
"Cultural Castration"
At the rally, Johnnie Scott, a senior
in creative writing, called the Uni
versity's attitude toward blacks "cultur
al imperialism and cultural castration."
He also blasted Koff for his remarks to a
black girl he interviewed for the STEP
program, remarks which touched off the
present controversy.
Bazile later noted that the BSU was
not asking whether or not Koff was
racist, but if the comments he made to
the student, Clarissa Stevenson, were
professional in nature.
According to the BSU, Koff asked
her if she had ever lacked the money to
buy sanitary napkins, or "have meat on
the table."
Equal Treatment?
"Our response was simply that we
wonder how many white girls who
apply for graduate school are asked
these questions," Scott said.
The Human Relations Commission is
presently investigating the charges, and
is expected to make its report in a few
days.
Commenting on the nature of the de
mands, Scott added, "For the moment,
it's reformist. But when we get to

moving, don't sit on your asses and say,
4 I don't understand why those black
folks got to act that way. Why can't
they use the traditional diplomatic
channels'?"
Institutional Racism
Leo Bazile, sophomore political
scence major from Oakland, also com
mented on institutional racism—"the
central issue for us." He questioned how
Stanford allows people to make com
ments like those of Koff.
"The Human Relations Commission
is nothing but a cooling down process,
as all democratic processes are," he said.
As for the recently established Afro-
American studies major, "Stanford is
always getting credit for a black studies
program that doesn't exist. I don't want
to study about this history of the black
in Latin America—l want to study about
me,-here," Bazile added.
"We use soul. Damn reason, logic, and
rationale. BSU has got new leadership.
We're going to be political," he con
cluded. "We're not goint to be demo
cratic. We're going to sit down and do it
the right way—once."
No More Games
After the rally, the blacks marched
to Provost Lyman's office to personally
present him with the demands. Nate
Kirtman handed them to him, com
menting, "We're not playing games any
more. We want direct action on them.
We're willing to talk."
Several administrators whose depart
ments were touched on by the demands
were contacted later in the day by the
Daily. Dr. John Black, head of Counsel
ing and Testing said, "We would love to
find one or more" black counselors, but
he said that the five demanded by the
BSU would be more than are needed.
Black Counselors Hard to Find
However, finding one is hard. It's a
difficult problem," he said. "They're in
great demand and short supply, and our
salary schedule is such that many are
beyond it already even though they
have less experience and training" than
our present counselors.
Although he has not been conducting
a major campaign to find a black for
Counseling and Testing, Black said he
didn't "know if it (the search for a
black) could be much more vigorous
than now." He added that the depart
ment presently has a black education
student working there part-time as a
trainee.
Robert P. Huff, director of Financial

Aids, said "we've tried to approach the
problems of our black students and
other minority students on an individual
basis. I think that we are going to have
to continue to do this."
"I think the basic problem has been
one of trying to take the procedures and
programs we've had available for stu
dents in the financial aid area and apply
them to black students generally. This ip
the great difficulty."
Another demand dealt with a single
black handling all black applications for
graduate admissions.
Departmental Control
Graduate Dean Virgil Whitaker notee
that, on the graduate level, "recruiting
and admissions is the function of each
department," making a job covering the
entire graduate division impossible—or
else of a "severely limited" nature.
Whitaker noted, however, that a pos
sible alternative would be to have r.
black who would be able to interest
blacks in applying to graduate school
here.
Provost Lyman sent a memo to all
faculty members last week urging them
to "be active in working toward in
creased enrollment of minority student:
at the graduate level," but the number
now enrolled is quite low.
Minority Recruitment Committee
One of the BSU requests asked that
"the minority recruitment committee
for the Medical School (set up only this
year) be given full power over minority
admissions."
Medical School Dean Robert J.
Glaser noted that acceptances had al
ready been sent to eight minority group
students for next year, and thought the
present arrangement was working well.
"I think we have a very good
relationship with the committee and I
don't sre any need to change it," ln
said. "I ..ave heard no complaints."
The School of Engineering also lu::;
some minority recruitment programs.
Associate Dean Lauress Wise noted
that the school's policy was to give
minority students two years of fellow
ship support when needed. Most nev,
students need only one year, and then
move on to research projects.
"This is really a commitment of what
we believe in," he said.
Wise also said that Robert Pritchard,
professor of electrical engineering, ha?
visited three black universities this
year-Howard, Southern, and Prairie
View A&M —to recruit blacks.
