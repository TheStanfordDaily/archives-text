# SDS Marches
## Judicial Council Hearings Begin 
### THOMAS C. DAWSON 
Preliminary conferences between the
Judicial Council chairman and students
charged in last month's disruption of
the Trustees meeting by Stanford SDS
started yesterday amid controversy over
the proposed conduct of hearings.
Around fifty students marched at
10:10 a.m. from Tresidder Union to
Council chairman Jack Friedenthal's
office in the law annex to present nine
suggestions on conduct of hearings.
Friedenthal, a law professor, had
scheduled conferences with several of
the students on the nature of charges
against them. At least two students were
told at the conference that charges
against them were being dropped for
lack of evidence.
One of the requests by SDS was for
preliminary conferences to be held in
public if the charges students so desired.
Friedenthal agreed to this request and
after handling three students' cases in
his office with the others present moved
to the Political Science lounge where he
responded in detail to the nine SDS re
quests and also outlined the tentative
structure of future hearings.

Friedenthal explained that two sepa
rate rounds of hearings would be held.
The first round would deal with the
"factual evidence", whether the stu
dents accused were actually present
after the warning to leave the building
was issued.
This round of hearings is scheduled
to begin next Tuesday. At least two
hearings will be held, one for students
tentatively identified as being in the hall
of the faculty club and another for stu
dents accused of being in the Trustees
meeting room.
SDS members yesterday morning
protested the separation of the accused
into two groups, saying the effect was
to divide "hard militants from soft mili
tants." Friedenthal replied that the de
cision had been made by the Judicial
Council and that the intention had been
to simplify the calling of witnesses. He
did say however, that he would consider
changing the format of the first hearings
and select students alphabetically.
The second set of hearings, tentative
ly scheduled for all day February 21
and 22, will deal with "motivational evi
dence." This hearing will be a joint one
with all defendants present. Friedenthal
said students could subpoena witnesses
who had "relevant" testimony. The
question of relevance would be decided
by the council.
Forced Cooperation
There is doubt, however, as to the
power of the council to subpoena wit
nesses. Students can be forced to co
operate with the council under threat of
having their registration withheld, but
no similar sanction applies to trustees or
faculty and staff. Friedenthal himself

admitted that the power of the council
was not yet established in this matter.
The separation of "evidential" and
"motivational" evidence was also at
tacked by SDS members in their talk
with Friedenthal. SDS member David
Pugh seemed to sum up many students'
attitude, "Separating the hearings would
be more efficient from the Judicial
Council's perspective, but it obscures
the real political issues."
Friedenthal indicated that many
mitigating factors could be used as evi
dence in the second set of hearings. The
alleged illegitimacy of the campus
demonstrations policy, the motivation
behind the acts including involvement
of the Trustees in war-related activities
and the contention that the students
had been invited into the meeting.
Friendenthal did say, however, "I'm not
going to try the Trustees."
In reply to SDS's request that legal
aid be provided accused students,
Friedenthal said he did not have the
power to supply legal aid. He did sug
gest that accused students might ask
other students experienced with judicial
proceedings at Stanford to help present
their cases.
Student Finds Adviser
At least one accused student has ob
tained such an adviser. LASSU speaker
Yale Braunstein, who brought up the
matter of the alleged expiration of the
demonstrations policy, has arranged for
Richard Such, a third-year law student,
to help his case. Such was president of
the Student Judicial Council last year.
Braunstein is charged with boty
violation of the demonstrations policy
and the Fundmanental Stanford as are

most of the other students. A list of
those charged and the offenses with
which they are charged has not been
made public.
Friedenthal did indicate that some
students might be charged with some
additional charges including possibly
violence to another person. He indicated
the final determination of charges has
not been made. He also revealed that
some 35 students are presently con
sidered to have been in possible vio
lation of University regulations. The
earlier unofficial estimate was thirty.
Braunstein yesterday claimed that
the campus demonstrations policy,
which most of the students are accused
of violating, was not in effect on the
date of the student-Trustee confron
tation.
Braunstein said that the policy, pro
mulgated by acting president Cilaser on
October 7, expired January 7, a week
before the confrontation. According to
the Judicial Charter, interim rules re
main in effect a maximum of ninety
days or until modified by the Student
Conduct Legislative Council (SCLC),
which ever comes first. Braunstein con
tends that the demonstration policy is
such an interim rule.
