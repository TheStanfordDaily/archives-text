How is one to react to the Black Stu
dents Union rally of yesternoon? What is
that oft-cited, seldom-identified Average
Stanford Student feeling in the wake of
Leo Bazile's deadly serious declaration that
the question for blacks is no longer one of
readiness to die but rather of readiness to
kill? Where is the great, nebulous white
mass right now?
It seems most immediately apparent
that we are on the delivery end of a welter
of demands, questions, and paradoxes, and
feeling not a little apprehensive about the
whole business. And well we should.
Presented yesterday, on the rhetorical
level if nowhere else, was a substantial
threat to the life-style and self-image of
white, middle-class individuals, both within
this community and beyond its increasingly
uncertain borders.
This leaves us groping for an expla
nation, a rationale, however tenuous, for
the impending onslaught. Is it only the be
ginning realization of a highly justifiable,
though hitherto latent, thirst for revenge
after centuries of oppression and ex
ploitation surpassing belief? Or is there
another equally crucial facet? Could it be
more to the point to see Jeannette
McDonald's panegyric to the joy of liber
ation as inextricably entwined with a con
suming drive to "get Whitey."
Without indulging in either psychology
or value judgments beyond our compe
tence, is it not possible that the growing
movement toward black liberation and
self-assertion is predicated, at least in part,
on a concomitant denigration of whatever

self-image and group definition has been
constructed by whites.
If this is even partially true, we might
well ask what, if any, place is left for
"whites of good will" within the Black
Liberation Movement? To a considerable
and somewhat disconcerting degree (the
latter depending in some part on how
seriously you take Roy Wilkins' platitudes
on integration), this question has been
handled by Black Panther leader Bobby
Seale. Whitey's place is in his own com
munity, putting his own house in order.
Let us be clear: black people harbor no il
lusions about doing it all themselves; but it
is no less true that any help from the white
sector will be on their terms or not at all.
On a level somewhat more particular,
the twelve BSU demands raise a number of
questions on their own account. There is
no small discrepancy between the rhetoric
of yesterday's rally and the demands pres
ently before the University. On the one
hand, the BSU seems to define itself as a
radical organization, fully committed to
turning America inside out if that is what
is required to expunge the sickness which
riddles this society to its roots. Yet then,
without so much as a change of expression,
it presents a program fully grounded in the
tradition of American liberalism.
None of these questions are amenable to
ready answers, if indeed they arc answer
able at all. However, it is increasingly ap
parent that such queries are the last avenue
of relation to the black community within
this University, and they are posed with
that awareness in mind.
