## 'SDS Goal To Destroy Due Process' 
### 
Editor, THE DAILY:
This letter concerns the article
headed, "SDS Slates March on
Judicial Chairman," Stanford
Daily, Monday, February 3.
The direct relation of these tac
tics to the recommendations of
SDS National Headquarters for
destroying all campus legal proces
ses should be noted.
In a document called the
"Multiversity" written by Carl
Davidson, one of the three highest
officers of the National SDS, and
distributed from National to all
SDS locals, one finds the follow
ing quotation:
. one potentially effective
tactic for resisting the university's
disciplinary apparatus would be
the formation of a Student De
fense League. The purpose of the
group would be to make its serv
ices available to any student who
must appear before campus auth
orities for infractions of repressive
(or just plain stupid) rules and reg
ulations. The defense group would

then attend the student's hearings
en masse. However, for some
cases, it might be wise to include
law students or local radical law
yers in the group for the purpose
of making legal counter-attacks. A
student defense group would have
three major goals: 1) saving as
many students as possible from
punishment, 2) desanctifying and
rendering dis-functional the ad
ministration's repressive apparatus
and 3) using 1) and 2) as tactics
in reaching other students for
building a movement to abolish
the apparatus as a whole."
Two things are of the essence
and need to be emphasized for all
members of the campus commun
ity. First, the legal system that is
being attacked at Stanford by
SDS is not an administrative ap
paratus; on the contrary, it is an
agreed system put in force only
after separate approval by the stu
dent body in full referendum, the
faculty by vote of its governing
body, and the administration. The

Judicial Council includes members
from those three constituencies.
Second, in the absence of such
a system, there can be no due pro
cess, and no protection of any in
dividual, radical, moderate, or
reactionary, from oppression by
any group that chooses to use
coercion or force.
In short, the local SDS is not
attacking an illegitimate author
ity, but attempting to destroy the
only legitimate due process. Each
of us must decide for himself
whether we want due process un
der majority-adopted laws or the
so-called law of the jungle.

• GSA Supports BSU
Editor, THE DAILY:
For several months, members
of the Minority Recruitment
Committee of the Graduate Stu
dent Association have attempted
to initiate active recruitment of
minority students for graduate
study at Stanford. During this
time, we have worked with ap
propriate faculty members in in
dividual departments and met
with a number of administrators,
seeking both a re-thinking of trad
itional admissions criteria (as we
observe them to operate) and a
university-wide program for en
couraging applications from stu
dents who would not otherwise
consider coming to Stanford for
grad work.
As a result of these efforts, we
have heard many assurances that
"this is a good idea" and that
everyone is "concerned about it."

(We've also heard some opposition
to the basic proposal.) We have
yet to see any clear statement of
admissions criteria at the graduate
level, or any evidence that wide
spread re-examination of past
standards is taking place. Neither
are we able to devise a recruit
ment program which would be
both effective and feasible, given
the limited resources available to
us as graduate students.
Consequently, this committee
strongly endorses the BSU de
mand for a black man to coord
inate minority graduate admis
sions in all departments.

• Common Courtesy
Editor, THE DAILY:
By reporting the events at the
Old Union last Wednesday as a
conflict between progressive and
conservative aspects of political
opinion at Stanford, The Daily
has misrepresented the facts as
seen by this observer which are
that people of good faith, what
ever their political persuasion, are
beginning to get fed up with the
SDS's policy of insult, intimi
dation, and disruption.
As a past McCarthy supporter
and a registered Democrat, I have
some sympathy for the SDS's
goals. But the issues cannot be re
solved without a modicum of
common courtesy and mutual re
spect on the part of all the parties
involved. Although they may con
sider themselves agents of change,
those who violate this principal

justly earn for themselves classifi
cation as obstructionists and
fools.
As one of those present at the
demonstration on Wednesday, it
was my hope that by playing back
a page from the SDS's own book
of tactics we would leave those at
tending, SDS members included,
with a better understanding of the
bankrupt content of the local
brand of confrontation politics.
In this connection, the closing
comments of Mr. Siegel at the
Wednesday meeting are signifi
cant. In Mr. Siegel's words, "We
aren't going to change our plans
just vecause you broke up our
meeting." Is there any rational
basis for believing that the
trustees or the scientists at AEL
and SRI feel any differently?

• Daily Needs Help
Editor, THE DAILY:
Your drama review of The
Nitery's The Cyclops was "hack
neyed, unpromising and uninter
esting"—the review, that is.
Bernard Burkom's performance
was excellent and perfectly ap
propriate to the traditional story,
plus (pace, Spiro Agnew) very
Greek.
Sandi Richards as Cyclops was
so good that your vicarious Mr.
McCarthy was understandably be
wildered.
It is doubtless a coincidence
that the column under this vicar
ious review is headed: THE
DAILY NEEDS HELP.
