IF you want something more than just a stereo console, and
something less than a houseful of electronic equipment, see
the KLH* Model Twenty-Four.
The Model Twenty-Four is a complete stereo music system
that plays records, FM broadcasts, AM too if you wish, plus any
thing (such as a tape recorder) you care to plug into it. Instead of
looking like a Victorian hope chest or an electrician's nightmare,
it comes in three compact and unobtrusive walnut cabinets that
slip gracefully into a living room. It won't take up much of your
valuable living space, and it doesn't take a pilot's license to operate.
But what sets it even further apart from other stereo equip
ment is the level of performance it delivers. It sounds—believe us
—like twice the price. That's why it's the best-selling, most-talked
about stereo system on the market.
Ask anyone who owns KLH stereo equipment about its per
formance and value. Then seek out the Model Twenty-Four and
judge it critically for yourself.
Vou won't have trouble finding one in a store. Just follow that
well-beaten path. i I I Ii
