No, this isn't the cheapest small cassette recorder you
can buy. But it's certainly the best buy!
In ruggedness, in ease of operation, this little beauty
will pay off. Enjoy the convenience of the famous
T-control lever, pop-in cassettes, operation from battery of
AC power line (converter included), and Automatic Level
'Control for carefree recording without fussy adjustment of
recording settings.
Craig's 2603 recorder is Lafayette-priced at just $49.95.
See it—and hear it -this weekend at Lafayette's three Bay
Area Stores.
