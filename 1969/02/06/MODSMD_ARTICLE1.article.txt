Responding to demands that Stan
ford trustees cut their ties either with
the University or with defense-related
industry and that faculty relinquish any
defense-related advisory posts, President
Pitzer declared:
"It is unacceptable for me to con
sider, as Students for a Democratic
Society (SDS) has proposed, that we
interfere with individual freedom of
choice of trustees or faculty.
"Just as I respect the right of individ
ual students to make personal values,

decisions within the law according to
their personal values, I respect and de
fend that right for other mebmers of the
University community .. . These free
doms apply to all members of the com
munity. Stanford will not restrict them
for one group while upholding them for
another."
