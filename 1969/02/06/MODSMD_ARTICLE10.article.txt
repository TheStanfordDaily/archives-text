# From The Ivory Tower
## For Requirements 
### Walter H. Sokel 
Higher education should not
only provide p re-professional
training, but also liberate the stu
dent from the provincialism of
time and place.
Because of the great disparity
of standards in our secondary
schools, abolition or even sub
stantial reduction, of general stu
dies requirements in the university
would, in the majority of cases,
not liberate the student for intel
lectual freedom, but rather drive
him into one-sided specialization.
Higher education would be
dominated by the expectations
and tastes of the student's home
environment and reflect the pre
vailing outlook of his society
rather than critically challenge it.
For many students come to the
university with preconceived
majors in their minds. If the stu
dent is not exposed at all to other,
less immediately practical fields of
human endeavor-and he would
not be without direction by way
of requirements—one-sided spe
cialization would be much more
widespread than it is now.
The SES Report is to be com
mended for attempting to strike a
balance between society-dictated
pre-professionalism and the broad
ening and deepening intellectual
experience higher education is to
provide. However, the Report
does not go far enough in the lat
ter direction.
The subjects most suitable to
liberate the student from the pro
vincialism of time and place are
history and language. Not many
students would be exposed to
these subjects if the respected re

quirements were to be abolished.
By history I understand not
just any sequence of events, but
the study of the intellectual heri
tage of civilization. Such a study,
constantly and critically re
defined, provides all students
with a common frame of refer
ence in regard to the basic forces
which have shaped the present.
In addition, it would furnish
each student with the necessary
perspective for informed judg
ments on his own time. Without
such a perspective his outlook will
be narrow and unstable, subject to
ephemeral fashions, largely shaped
by the publicity media. He will be
subject to the passions of the
moment, which a moment will
reverse.
Language is the indispensable
tool of thought, of imaginative ex
pression, and, in the form of liter
ature, preserves the human herit
age. The cliche that the most ef
fective way for understanding
one's own language as well as the
nature of language itself is to
study a foreign language is not less
true for being a truism.
Moreover, if there is no lang
uage requirement for either admis
sions or graduation, the triumph
of provincial self-righteousness
cannot be averted. "Let 'em learn
English" is not a new slogan, but
one which the absence of any
language requirement would en
shrine as holy writ.
