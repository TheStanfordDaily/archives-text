## Agents Clean-Up Campus 
### Scott Keeney 
Late last night, while rum
maging through my mind's attic, I
came across an ancient, dust
bedecked birdcage, a fact, in
itself, of little import.
However, permanently stuck
by some sort of powerful focal ad
hesive to the bottom of the bird
cage, I found an aged Stanford
Daily, dated February 5, 1930, to
be exact.
Beneath the bits of dung and
merd which had affixed them
selves to the old Daily, I managed
to detect the following headline:
"Paranoia Strikes Campus With
sth Bust Imminent." I removed
the remaining bits of ornithologi
cal ordure to uncover the follow
ing story:
Paranoia struck Stanford Uni
versity last night as stories of
booze busts and police raids swept
the campus.
The rumors were apparently
touched off after word was spread
that a warrant had been issued for
one student, that four arrests had
already been made, and that three
police vehicles had been seen in
the vicinity of Encina Hall.

Panic ensued in several dormi
tories and fraternities. One resi
dent tells the Daily: "People were
walking around not answering
questions, not giving any
messages, and getting rid of stuff
down toilets and sinks."
One sorority girl comments:
"Our house smelled very pungent
for several hours." Another
prophesies, "If they bust this
whole campus, it'll make Elliot
Ness look like a small-town con
stable." Three students were ad
mitted to the Health Center, two
with glass cuts and one suffering
from inhalation of mash.
Harvard A 1 Fatah, LASSU
speaker, remarks, "The panic ap
pears to stem from the increased
presence of police on campus, the
new stringency with which federal
anti-liquor laws are being en
forced, and the increased inci
dence of student arrests in con
nection with these laws."
Agents Move In
Also contributing to the un
rest, A 1 Fatah thinks, is the con
troversial case of John Fukr, who
was arrested two weeks ago when

a locker registered in his name was
found to contain a large quantity
of hard liquor. "The Feds have de
cided to enforce these laws and it
looks like they're moving in" A 1
Fatah comments.
(No further arrests, however,
had been made by press time.)
Late yesterday afternoon,
Elmont Higgins presented a peti
tion signed by one thousand
people to President Jordan which
asks Jordan to "remove these as
sorted local and federal law en
forcement agents from the cam
pus."
Higgins had previously com
mented "Horsefeathers!" when
queried about Jordan's remark
that the university does not "have
a responsibility to protect or de
fend the rights of Stanford stu
dents to use hard liquor." Higgins
did not elaborate.
Earlier in the day, Higgins, A 1
Fatah, and Professor Jonas Dorch
issued a seven-point position
paper dealing with the problems
of hard liquor on campus. Among
its statements:
"If anti-liquor laws were to be
enforced equitably, fully half the

student body would have to be ar
rested."
"Hard liquor is no more
dangerous than 3.2 beer if drunk
in moderation, and certainly less
dangerous than such drugs as
marijuana and heroin whose use is
not governed by such stringent
federal laws."
"The legality of police and
federal agent interference on cam
pus is questionable."
In reply, Santa Clara Police
Chief Clarence Hogg states, "I just
enforce the laws, I don't make
'em. I just follow orders. If the
law says liquor's illegal, well, I
gotta enforce the law."
Further developments are
anxiously awaited by a nervous
student community. A senior
laments, "If it gets any rougher,
prices are going to skyrocket. I'll
have to quit school." However,
one co-ed, who seems to echo the
sentiments of the majority, is not
worried; she comments: I'll keep
drinking, but now I'll have to hide
my stuff better."
So much for 1930.
