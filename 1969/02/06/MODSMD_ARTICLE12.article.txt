## Objectives Of SRI Challenged 
### 
Editor, THE DAILY:
It has become increasingly
clear that the Stanford-SRI rela
tionship is a travesty of the values
of human dignity and human wel
fare for which universities should
stand. It is indicative of the extent
of the corruption of social and
ethical principles, which the ac
ceptance of a monstrous military
establishment has fostered on this
country, that the university is the
locus of research and development

of military weapons and war tac
tics.
It seems to me that despite the
efforts of Prof. Bernstein and the
five students, the Stanford-SRI
Study Group is unlikely to effect
a real change in the well-greased
operation that the industrialists
on the Stanford Board of Trustees
have created in SRI. Certainly
SRl's President Anderson's replies
to the Study Group's question
naire contains only bland generali
ties in the most noxious
"federalese" language.
Perhaps the greatest indictment
of SRI is its claim to "objectivi
ty." It is not particularly shocking
that advisors should tend to shape
their recommendations towards
the desires of clients ("yes" men
have been endemic in history),
but it is more insidious when
SRl's recommendations are given
the stature of objective scientific
evaluations. In a conversation
with an SRI researcher on South
America, I learned that military
style briefs, which he submitted
on political conditions in South
America, were not incorporated
into final reports unless they
fitted the pre-conceived notions
of the government client. If the
researcher did not produce such
self-affirming reports, he was
subtly threatened with being
switched away from his area of re
search interest. If such practice is
common at SRI, it seems clear
that the so-called objective re
search grants given to SRI are
really self-fulfilling wishes serving
the maw of our military establish
ment.

• Playing the Game
Editor, THE DAILY:
Commenting on the article by
Craig Wilson concerning the re
cent arrests for alleged possession
and sale of marijuana, I get the
impression that some Stanford
students are acting no better than
petulant children who have been
caught in the act of stealing candy
and don't want to be spanked.
It has been pointed out time
and time again, that the campus is
no sanctuary for smoking mari
juana, yet the same surprised and
credulous outcries are heard every
time someone else is caught. If
you're going to play the game,
you'll have to play it by the rules.

If you smoke pot, you'll have to
take the chance you might get
busted.
No one complains when police
come on campus and arrest some
one in the process of stripping a
car or raping a girl, yet all hell
breaks loose when those same
police arrest a student for actions
which are considered felonies
under the law.
If you don't like the law,
change that; don't take your frus
trated hatreds out on the peren
nial whipping boy, the cop.

• Attacks Union Oil
Editor, THE DAILY:
I have sent the following letter
to the Union Oil Company:
Enclosed find the remains of
my Union Oil Company credit
card. I return it to you because I
can, in conscience, no longer do
business with your company.
The tragedy which your com
pany has caused along the coast of
Southern California due to oil
leakage from one of your offshore
wells prompts this action. Al
though Union Oil Company has
disclaimed responsibility for this
disaster it is obvious to me that
your company is indeed responsi
ble. It is a Union Oil Company
well which is leaking and Union
Oil Company claimed to know the
sea-floor geology in the area well
enough so that such an event
could never occur.
It is extremely unfortunate
that the public, who will suffer
most from this disaster, will prob
ably have no legal recourse against
your company. I am, for this
reason, ending my business deal
ings with Union Oil Company and
urging my friends and associates
to do likewise.

• Durand Defended
Editor, THE DAILY:
We of Durand recognize that
its easy indeed to get carried away
by the sound of one's voice, or to
be blinded by the beauty of that
which one has just written. Still,
though, it seems hard that the
living situation we have enjoyed

for the last year and a half should
be casually dismissed as an ad
ministrative blunder.
This is not to say that we are
opposed to cooeducational
housing. Many of us applied for
coed housing last spring. Some
were placed in coed dorms, some
moved off campus, and some
moved back here.
The point is that Durand—we
cannot speak for Mayfield—offers
an alternative to moving off to
those who abhor concrete cell
dormitories. Living conditions are
good, the food is about the best
to be found on campus, and our
participation as a house in intra
mural activities is enthusiastic if
not awe-inspiring.
All we ask is that you remem
ber there are people living in
Durand, people who like living
here, regardless of what adminis
trative quirk created the situation
in the first place or allowed its
continued existence.

• Koff Replacement?
Editor, THE DAILY:
Emerging from the vague
periphery of self-deceit and racial
rally observation, I publicly offer
to spank Director Koff in White
Plaza whenever his rump makes
ready. I mean really, who will be
judge and jury for the charges of
professional misconduct which
stand against him?
The BSU is right. We cannot
camouflage what actually did
occur (THE QUESTIONS)
through channels of prestige or
high position. But what should be
the punishment—expulsion, cen
sure—and who should tacticly de
cide?
These questions are meant to
appeal to your sense of moral in
dignation. Don't admire the
powers-to-be if their decision
differs from yours. Perhaps there
is no difference. Then be honest
and say so. We'll draw up the lines
and start the war.
If a black man would lose his
job for acting as Koff did, then
Koff must be replaced. If anyone
would merely be reprimanded,
then my initial offer holds. Let
absurdity follow upon absurdity
until some decency and common
sense ensue.

• Debate Club Rebuttal
Editor, THE DAILY:
In reply to Rod McCallum and
John Montague on the issue of the
Speech Association's appropri
ation, I wish to comment on their
complete lack of familiarity of the
aims and objectives of the Asso
ciation and forensics in general.
A debating tournament is not,
in any sense, a vacation. It is a
learning experience. Preparation
for a tournament requires a great
deal of work; and actual partici
pation is very arduous and de
manding. Success is a small reward
in comparison to the great bene
fits derived in the form of person
ality development and individual
growth. This valid academic pur
suit is available to anybody with
the inclination, time and energy.
I suggest that the small and
narrow minds of those who wish
to curtail this activity are the ones
who could benefit most from par
ticipation.

petulant children who have been
caught in the act of stealing candy

• Attacks Union Oil
Editor, THE DAILY:
I have sent the following letter
to the Union Oil Company:
Enclosed find the remains of
my Union Oil Company credit
card. I return it to you because I
can, in conscience, no longer do
business with your company.
The tragedy which your com
pany has caused along the coast of
Southern California due to oil
leakage from one of your offshore
wells prompts this action. Al
though Union Oil Company has
disclaimed responsibility for this
disaster it is obvious to me that
your company is indeed responsi
ble. It is a Union Oil Company
well which is leaking and Union
Oil Company claimed to know the
sea-floor geology in the area well
enough so that such an event
could never occur.
It is extremely unfortunate
that the public, who will suffer
most from this disaster, will prob
ably have no legal recourse against
your company. I am, for this
reason, ending my business deal
ings with Union Oil Company and
urging my friends and associates
to do likewise.

• Durand Defended
Editor, THE DAILY:
We of Durand recognize that
its easy indeed to get carried away
by the sound of one's voice, or to
be blinded by the beauty of that
which one has just written. Still,
though, it seems hard that the
living situation we have enjoyed

for the last year and a half should
be casually dismissed as an ad
ministrative blunder.
This is not to say that we are
opposed to cooeducational
housing. Many of us applied for
coed housing last spring. Some
were placed in coed dorms, some
moved off campus, and some
moved back here.
The point is that Durand—we
cannot speak for Mayfield—offers
an alternative to moving off to
those who abhor concrete cell
dormitories. Living conditions are
good, the food is about the best
to be found on campus, and our
participation as a house in intra
mural activities is enthusiastic if
not awe-inspiring.
All we ask is that you remem
ber there are people living in
Durand, people who like living
here, regardless of what adminis
trative quirk created the situation
in the first place or allowed its
continued existence.

• Koff Replacement?
Editor, THE DAILY:
Emerging from the vague
periphery of self-deceit and racial
rally observation, I publicly offer
to spank Director Koff in White
Plaza whenever his rump makes
ready. I mean really, who will be
judge and jury for the charges of
professional misconduct which
stand against him?
The BSU is right. We cannot
camouflage what actually did
occur (THE QUESTIONS)
through channels of prestige or
high position. But what should be
the punishment—expulsion, cen
sure—and who should tacticly de
cide?
These questions are meant to
appeal to your sense of moral in
dignation. Don't admire the
powers-to-be if their decision
differs from yours. Perhaps there
is no difference. Then be honest
and say so. We'll draw up the lines
and start the war.
If a black man would lose his
job for acting as Koff did, then
Koff must be replaced. If anyone
would merely be reprimanded,
then my initial offer holds. Let
absurdity follow upon absurdity
until some decency and common
sense ensue.

Editor, THE DAILY:
In reply to Rod McCallum and
John Montague on the issue of the
Speech Association's appropri
ation, I wish to comment on their
complete lack of familiarity of the
aims and objectives of the Asso
ciation and forensics in general.
A debating tournament is not,
in any sense, a vacation. It is a
learning experience. Preparation
for a tournament requires a great
deal of work; and actual partici
pation is very arduous and de
manding. Success is a small reward
in comparison to the great bene
fits derived in the form of person
ality development and individual
growth. This valid academic pur
suit is available to anybody with
the inclination, time and energy.
I suggest that the small and
narrow minds of those who wish
to curtail this activity are the ones
who could benefit most from par
ticipation.
G.F. BOWLER
Editor, THE DAILY:
It has become increasingly
clear that the Stanford-SRI rela
tionship is a travesty of the values
of human dignity and human wel
fare for which universities should
stand. It is indicative of the extent
of the corruption of social and
ethical principles, which the ac
ceptance of a monstrous military
establishment has fostered on this
country, that the university is the
locus of research and development

of military weapons and war tac
tics.
It seems to me that despite the
efforts of Prof. Bernstein and the
five students, the Stanford-SRI
Study Group is unlikely to effect
a real change in the well-greased
operation that the industrialists
on the Stanford Board of Trustees
have created in SRI. Certainly
SRl's President Anderson's replies
to the Study Group's question
naire contains only bland generali
ties in the most noxious
"federalese" language.
Perhaps the greatest indictment
of SRI is its claim to "objectivi
ty." It is not particularly shocking
that advisors should tend to shape
their recommendations towards
the desires of clients ("yes" men
have been endemic in history),
but it is more insidious when
SRl's recommendations are given
the stature of objective scientific
evaluations. In a conversation
with an SRI researcher on South
America, I learned that military
style briefs, which he submitted
on political conditions in South
America, were not incorporated
into final reports unless they
fitted the pre-conceived notions
of the government client. If the
researcher did not produce such
self-affirming reports, he was
subtly threatened with being
switched away from his area of re
search interest. If such practice is
common at SRI, it seems clear
that the so-called objective re
search grants given to SRI are
really self-fulfilling wishes serving
the maw of our military establish
ment.

• Durand Defended
Editor, THE DAILY:
We of Durand recognize that
its easy indeed to get carried away
by the sound of one's voice, or to
be blinded by the beauty of that
which one has just written. Still,
though, it seems hard that the
living situation we have enjoyed

for the last year and a half should
be casually dismissed as an ad
ministrative blunder.
This is not to say that we are
opposed to cooeducational
housing. Many of us applied for
coed housing last spring. Some
were placed in coed dorms, some
moved off campus, and some
moved back here.
The point is that Durand—we
cannot speak for Mayfield—offers
an alternative to moving off to
those who abhor concrete cell
dormitories. Living conditions are
good, the food is about the best
to be found on campus, and our
participation as a house in intra
mural activities is enthusiastic if
not awe-inspiring.
All we ask is that you remem
ber there are people living in
Durand, people who like living
here, regardless of what adminis
trative quirk created the situation
in the first place or allowed its
continued existence.

• Koff Replacement?
Editor, THE DAILY:
Emerging from the vague
periphery of self-deceit and racial
rally observation, I publicly offer
to spank Director Koff in White
Plaza whenever his rump makes
ready. I mean really, who will be
judge and jury for the charges of
professional misconduct which
stand against him?
The BSU is right. We cannot
camouflage what actually did
occur (THE QUESTIONS)
through channels of prestige or
high position. But what should be
the punishment—expulsion, cen
sure—and who should tacticly de
cide?
These questions are meant to
appeal to your sense of moral in
dignation. Don't admire the
powers-to-be if their decision
differs from yours. Perhaps there
is no difference. Then be honest
and say so. We'll draw up the lines
and start the war.
If a black man would lose his
job for acting as Koff did, then
Koff must be replaced. If anyone
would merely be reprimanded,
then my initial offer holds. Let
absurdity follow upon absurdity
until some decency and common
sense ensue.

• Debate Club Rebuttal
Editor, THE DAILY:
In reply to Rod McCallum and
John Montague on the issue of the
Speech Association's appropri
ation, I wish to comment on their
complete lack of familiarity of the
aims and objectives of the Asso
ciation and forensics in general.
A debating tournament is not,
in any sense, a vacation. It is a
learning experience. Preparation
for a tournament requires a great
deal of work; and actual partici
pation is very arduous and de
manding. Success is a small reward
in comparison to the great bene
fits derived in the form of person
ality development and individual
growth. This valid academic pur
suit is available to anybody with
the inclination, time and energy.
I suggest that the small and
narrow minds of those who wish
to curtail this activity are the ones
who could benefit most from par
ticipation.
G.F. BOWLER
Editor, THE DAILY:
It has become increasingly
clear that the Stanford-SRI rela
tionship is a travesty of the values
of human dignity and human wel
fare for which universities should
stand. It is indicative of the extent
of the corruption of social and
ethical principles, which the ac
ceptance of a monstrous military
establishment has fostered on this
country, that the university is the
locus of research and development

of military weapons and war tac
tics.
It seems to me that despite the
efforts of Prof. Bernstein and the
five students, the Stanford-SRI
Study Group is unlikely to effect
a real change in the well-greased
operation that the industrialists
on the Stanford Board of Trustees
have created in SRI. Certainly
SRl's President Anderson's replies
to the Study Group's question
naire contains only bland generali
ties in the most noxious
"federalese" language.
Perhaps the greatest indictment
of SRI is its claim to "objectivi
ty." It is not particularly shocking
that advisors should tend to shape
their recommendations towards
the desires of clients ("yes" men
have been endemic in history),
but it is more insidious when
SRl's recommendations are given
the stature of objective scientific
evaluations. In a conversation
with an SRI researcher on South
America, I learned that military
style briefs, which he submitted
on political conditions in South
America, were not incorporated
into final reports unless they
fitted the pre-conceived notions
of the government client. If the
researcher did not produce such
self-affirming reports, he was
subtly threatened with being
switched away from his area of re
search interest. If such practice is
common at SRI, it seems clear
that the so-called objective re
search grants given to SRI are
really self-fulfilling wishes serving
the maw of our military establish
ment.

• Playing the Game
Editor, THE DAILY:
Commenting on the article by
Craig Wilson concerning the re
cent arrests for alleged possession
and sale of marijuana, I get the
impression that some Stanford
students are acting no better than
petulant children who have been
caught in the act of stealing candy
and don't want to be spanked.
It has been pointed out time
and time again, that the campus is
no sanctuary for smoking mari
juana, yet the same surprised and
credulous outcries are heard every
time someone else is caught. If
you're going to play the game,
you'll have to play it by the rules.

If you smoke pot, you'll have to
take the chance you might get
busted.
No one complains when police
come on campus and arrest some
one in the process of stripping a
car or raping a girl, yet all hell
breaks loose when those same
police arrest a student for actions
which are considered felonies
under the law.
If you don't like the law,
change that; don't take your frus
trated hatreds out on the peren
nial whipping boy, the cop.

• Attacks Union Oil
Editor, THE DAILY:
I have sent the following letter
to the Union Oil Company:
Enclosed find the remains of
my Union Oil Company credit
card. I return it to you because I
can, in conscience, no longer do
business with your company.
The tragedy which your com
pany has caused along the coast of
Southern California due to oil
leakage from one of your offshore
wells prompts this action. Al
though Union Oil Company has
disclaimed responsibility for this
disaster it is obvious to me that
your company is indeed responsi
ble. It is a Union Oil Company
well which is leaking and Union
Oil Company claimed to know the
sea-floor geology in the area well
enough so that such an event
could never occur.
It is extremely unfortunate
that the public, who will suffer
most from this disaster, will prob
ably have no legal recourse against
your company. I am, for this
reason, ending my business deal

• Debate Club Rebuttal
Editor, THE DAILY:
In reply to Rod McCallum and
John Montague on the issue of the
Speech Association's appropri
ation, I wish to comment on their
complete lack of familiarity of the
aims and objectives of the Asso
ciation and forensics in general.
A debating tournament is not,
in any sense, a vacation. It is a
learning experience. Preparation
for a tournament requires a great
deal of work; and actual partici
pation is very arduous and de
manding. Success is a small reward
in comparison to the great bene
fits derived in the form of person
ality development and individual
growth. This valid academic pur
suit is available to anybody with
the inclination, time and energy.
I suggest that the small and
narrow minds of those who wish
to curtail this activity are the ones
who could benefit most from par
ticipation.
G.F. BOWLER
Editor, THE DAILY:
It has become increasingly
clear that the Stanford-SRI rela
tionship is a travesty of the values
of human dignity and human wel
fare for which universities should
stand. It is indicative of the extent
of the corruption of social and
ethical principles, which the ac
ceptance of a monstrous military
establishment has fostered on this
country, that the university is the
locus of research and development

of military weapons and war tac
tics.
It seems to me that despite the
efforts of Prof. Bernstein and the
five students, the Stanford-SRI
Study Group is unlikely to effect
a real change in the well-greased
operation that the industrialists
on the Stanford Board of Trustees
have created in SRI. Certainly
SRl's President Anderson's replies
to the Study Group's question
naire contains only bland generali
ties in the most noxious
"federalese" language.
Perhaps the greatest indictment
of SRI is its claim to "objectivi
ty." It is not particularly shocking
that advisors should tend to shape
their recommendations towards
the desires of clients ("yes" men
have been endemic in history),
but it is more insidious when
SRl's recommendations are given
the stature of objective scientific
evaluations. In a conversation
with an SRI researcher on South
America, I learned that military
style briefs, which he submitted
on political conditions in South
America, were not incorporated
into final reports unless they
fitted the pre-conceived notions
of the government client. If the
researcher did not produce such
self-affirming reports, he was
subtly threatened with being
switched away from his area of re
search interest. If such practice is
common at SRI, it seems clear
that the so-called objective re
search grants given to SRI are
really self-fulfilling wishes serving
the maw of our military establish
ment.

• Playing the Game
Editor, THE DAILY:
Commenting on the article by
Craig Wilson concerning the re
cent arrests for alleged possession
and sale of marijuana, I get the
impression that some Stanford
students are acting no better than
petulant children who have been
caught in the act of stealing candy
and don't want to be spanked.
It has been pointed out time
and time again, that the campus is
no sanctuary for smoking mari
juana, yet the same surprised and
credulous outcries are heard every
time someone else is caught. If
you're going to play the game,
you'll have to play it by the rules.

If you smoke pot, you'll have to
take the chance you might get
busted.
No one complains when police
come on campus and arrest some
one in the process of stripping a
car or raping a girl, yet all hell
breaks loose when those same
police arrest a student for actions
which are considered felonies
under the law.
If you don't like the law,
change that; don't take your frus
trated hatreds out on the peren
nial whipping boy, the cop.

• Attacks Union Oil
Editor, THE DAILY:
I have sent the following letter
to the Union Oil Company:
Enclosed find the remains of
my Union Oil Company credit
card. I return it to you because I
can, in conscience, no longer do
business with your company.
The tragedy which your com
pany has caused along the coast of
Southern California due to oil
leakage from one of your offshore
wells prompts this action. Al
though Union Oil Company has
disclaimed responsibility for this
disaster it is obvious to me that
your company is indeed responsi
ble. It is a Union Oil Company
well which is leaking and Union
Oil Company claimed to know the
sea-floor geology in the area well
enough so that such an event
could never occur.
It is extremely unfortunate
that the public, who will suffer
most from this disaster, will prob
ably have no legal recourse against
your company. I am, for this
reason, ending my business deal
ings with Union Oil Company and
urging my friends and associates
to do likewise.

• Durand Defended
Editor, THE DAILY:
We of Durand recognize that
its easy indeed to get carried away
by the sound of one's voice, or to
be blinded by the beauty of that
which one has just written. Still,
though, it seems hard that the
living situation we have enjoyed

for the last year and a half should
be casually dismissed as an ad
ministrative blunder.
This is not to say that we are
opposed to cooeducational
housing. Many of us applied for
coed housing last spring. Some
were placed in coed dorms, some
moved off campus, and some
moved back here.
The point is that Durand—we
cannot speak for Mayfield—offers
an alternative to moving off to
those who abhor concrete cell
dormitories. Living conditions are
good, the food is about the best
to be found on campus, and our
participation as a house in intra
mural activities is enthusiastic if
not awe-inspiring.
All we ask is that you remem
ber there are people living in
Durand, people who like living
here, regardless of what adminis
trative quirk created the situation
in the first place or allowed its
continued existence.

• Koff Replacement?
Editor, THE DAILY:
Emerging from the vague
periphery of self-deceit and racial
rally observation, I publicly offer
to spank Director Koff in White
Plaza whenever his rump makes
ready. I mean really, who will be
judge and jury for the charges of
professional misconduct which
stand against him?
The BSU is right. We cannot
camouflage what actually did
occur (THE QUESTIONS)
through channels of prestige or
high position. But what should be
the punishment—expulsion, cen
sure—and who should tacticly de
cide?
These questions are meant to
appeal to your sense of moral in
dignation. Don't admire the
powers-to-be if their decision
differs from yours. Perhaps there
is no difference. Then be honest
and say so. We'll draw up the lines
and start the war.
If a black man would lose his
job for acting as Koff did, then
Koff must be replaced. If anyone
would merely be reprimanded,
then my initial offer holds. Let
absurdity follow upon absurdity
until some decency and common
sense ensue.
