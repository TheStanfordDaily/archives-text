## Case Of Financial Discrimination? 
### William Berry 
The Stanford-in-Washington
summer intern program faces a
dilemma of conscience this year.
The relevence of a summer's work
in Washington remains high. Stu
dent interest also continues to in
crease.
But Stanford-in-Washington
has financial problems. As a re
sult, the applicants to the program
tend to comprise a select group
which can afford to absorb a sum
mer's net financial loss. These stu
dents get only a small SIW stipend
or, more likely, no money at all.
The program continues, but its
basic responsibilities to the Stan
ford community as a whole are in
jeopardy.
As the oldest and largest Intern
program in Washington, SIW an
nually places some 100 interns in
Washington summer jobs. But
who are these students? Essential
ly, they are upper middle class,
white, and supported by their
parents. The willingness to work
without pay exists, and to a sur
prisingly high degree.
Discrimination is a bad word,
with both moral and legal impli
cations. And Stanford-in-
Washington discriminates, but not

because of any inherent malice on
the part of its officers. Rather it is
discrimination by necessity.
The SIW annual budget con
sists of about $5000 for direct
student aid. Summer stipends of
$250 would therefore be available
for 20 students. But $250 is a
rather small sum, representing
little more than the transportation
cost back to Washington. To this
add room, board, and miscellane
ous social and operative expenses.
Clearly $250 hardly suffices.
Summer Jobs for Interns
Last year SIW placed about
100 interns in Washington. Of
these, about 25 had paying agency
or departmental jobs. The rest, for
the most part, worked without
pay-
The Stanford Management In
tern Program, closely related to
SIW, guarantees $400 to $600 a
month salaries for its successful
applicants. Of course, these sum
mer jobs are more selective and
with private industry. Unfortun
ately the government does not
provide quite this much money
for its student employees.
Working in Washington for a
summer has been widely ac
claimed by returning Stanford stu

dents. Most of the advantages are
obvious, such as becoming better
acquainted with the processes of
the federal government through
direct contact with it. This ob
jective is satisfied as the Stanford
intern has the opportunity to
interact and participate in the
activities and responsibilities of
Congressmen, Senators, and
government officials.
Minority Student Grants
But the financial problems re
main unsettled, and demand a
prompt solution. One ambitious
proposal presently under consider
ation concerns minority students
and their special problems here at
Stanford. Attempts are now being
made to obtain a foundation grant
to support Stanford minority stu
dents during a summer's work in
Washington.
Past Stanford history with re
gard to minority students has
been rather appalling. Of the more
than 400 summer interns since the
program's inception, less than 10
have been members of the various
minority groups here on campus.
Clearly more minority students
must be able to participate. The
very people for whom a Washing
ton job might be most beneficial

have the least chance of ever ob
taining one. SIW has what
amounts to a moral responsibility
to do all it can to make the pro
gram available to the whole Stan
ford student body.
Minority students comprise a
very small percentage of the total
Stanford enrollment. The less ob
vious, but just as compelling prob
lem of the majority student also
exists. Many here on campus also
cannot afford a summer without
pay, even in Washington. With the
high tuition and living costs, many
students must work to defray
school expenses.
The minority students provide
a select group for whom the finan
cial limitations of SIW are quite
obvious. But the majority of Stan
ford students also suffer from this
same financial handicap. Steps
must be taken to better fund
Stanford-in-Washington. The pro
gram has proved its relevency and
importance. It must not lose the
participation and support of the
Stanford student body as a result
of its present financial limitations.

student aid. Summer stipends of
$250 would therefore be available
for 20 students. But $250 is a
rather small sum, representing
little more than the transportation
cost back to Washington. To this
add room, board, and miscellane
ous social and operative expenses.
Clearly $250 hardly suffices.
Summer Jobs for Interns
Last year SIW placed about
100 interns in Washington. Of
these, about 25 had paying agency
or departmental jobs. The rest, for
the most part, worked without
pay-
The Stanford Management In
tern Program, closely related to
SIW, guarantees $400 to $600 a
month salaries for its successful
applicants. Of course, these sum
mer jobs are more selective and
with private industry. Unfortun
ately the government does not
provide quite this much money
for its student employees.
Working in Washington for a
summer has been widely ac
claimed by returning Stanford stu

dents. Most of the advantages are
obvious, such as becoming better
acquainted with the processes of
the federal government through
direct contact with it. This ob
jective is satisfied as the Stanford
intern has the opportunity to
interact and participate in the
activities and responsibilities of
Congressmen, Senators, and
government officials.
Minority Student Grants
But the financial problems re
main unsettled, and demand a
prompt solution. One ambitious
proposal presently under consider
ation concerns minority students
and their special problems here at
Stanford. Attempts are now being
made to obtain a foundation grant
to support Stanford minority stu
dents during a summer's work in
Washington.
Past Stanford history with re
gard to minority students has
been rather appalling. Of the more
than 400 summer interns since the
program's inception, less than 10
have been members of the various
minority groups here on campus.
Clearly more minority students
must be able to participate. The
very people for whom a Washing
ton job might be most beneficial

have the least chance of ever ob
taining one. SIW has what
amounts to a moral responsibility
to do all it can to make the pro
gram available to the whole Stan
ford student body.
Minority students comprise a
very small percentage of the total
Stanford enrollment. The less ob
vious, but just as compelling prob
lem of the majority student also
exists. Many here on campus also
cannot afford a summer without
pay, even in Washington. With the
high tuition and living costs, many
students must work to defray
school expenses.
The minority students provide
a select group for whom the finan
cial limitations of SIW are quite
obvious. But the majority of Stan
ford students also suffer from this
same financial handicap. Steps
must be taken to better fund
Stanford-in-Washington. The pro
gram has proved its relevency and
importance. It must not lose the
participation and support of the
Stanford student body as a result
of its present financial limitations.

majoring in political science, and

ford-in-Washington program—Ed.)
The Stanford-in-Washington
summer intern program faces a
dilemma of conscience this year.
The relevence of a summer's work
in Washington remains high. Stu
dent interest also continues to in
crease.
But Stanford-in-Washington
has financial problems. As a re
sult, the applicants to the program
tend to comprise a select group
which can afford to absorb a sum
mer's net financial loss. These stu
dents get only a small SIW stipend
or, more likely, no money at all.
The program continues, but its
basic responsibilities to the Stan
ford community as a whole are in
jeopardy.
As the oldest and largest Intern
program in Washington, SIW an
nually places some 100 interns in
Washington summer jobs. But
who are these students? Essential
ly, they are upper middle class,
white, and supported by their
parents. The willingness to work
without pay exists, and to a sur
prisingly high degree.
Discrimination is a bad word,
with both moral and legal impli
cations. And Stanford-in-
Washington discriminates, but not

because of any inherent malice on
the part of its officers. Rather it is
discrimination by necessity.
The SIW annual budget con
sists of about $5000 for direct
student aid. Summer stipends of
$250 would therefore be available
for 20 students. But $250 is a
