# Poverty Blamed
## Malnutrition Stunts Growth 
### RANDEL SAMSTAG 
The conditions of poverty
widespread in Latin American to
day characterized by improper
diet and little or no medical care
profoundly alter the physical
growth of children.
Preliminary studies done in
Guatemala by Dr. Robert Klein,
psychologist with the Institute of
Nutrition of Central America and
Panama (INCAP), indicate that
malnutrition and other diet
related diseases can impare child
hood mental development as well.
Klein, speaking before a small
audience Tuesday evening, was
reticent about drawing con
clusions before more extensive re
search had been completed —"I am
not yet a believer." Still, he re
ported that he was "astonished at
the size of the differences be
tween malnourished and control
children on tests involving short
term memory."
Professional concern for a
further understanding of there

lations of mental retardation and
malnutrition is heightened by the
worsening nutritional conditions
of the children of the under
developed world.
Three to five per cent have
severe diseases of protein defi
ciency. Fifty to seventy-five per
cent are undernourished. This
amounts to a total of between
two and three hundred million
children. Klein adds, "the next
10-15 years will be much gloomier
than the present."
Research has revealed that in
fection and disease has a correl
lative relation with malnutrition.
The average child in Latin
America has six serious diarrheal
and six serious respiratory diseases
during his first year. Infant Mor
tality at two years is between 30
and 40 per cent.
Klein's researchers have iso
lated nine Guatamalan villages for
study. Each containing from 800
to 1200 people, they are cut off
from all development. The vil

lagers are poor, small landowners
living on a subsistence level.
The villages were divided into
three groups. One group received
medical care and a food supple
ment. The second received only
medical care. The control group
was not given any supplemental
assistance.
In the experimental villages ap
proximately 75 per cent of the
preschool children participated.
This degree of acceptance is ex
ceptional in light of local
suspicions of the outside world.
"There were six witch doctors in
one village," Klein says, "We lined
up all but one of them and he
only controlled a few families."
Research of this kind must face
touchy ethical problems. How
does one choose which villages
will get, a supplement? What
happens when you leave and the
villages must go without assis
tance?
Klein hopes that funding can
be found to follow up his pro
grams in the experimental villages
to sustain the nutritional progress
that has been initiated.
He suggests that his research is
"in no way going to ameliorate
any of the crushing social and eco
nomic problems of Latin America.
Ours is a narrow, scientific en
deavor with no concern in itself
with either food development or
birth control."

Commenting on current U.S.
congressional hearings concerning
malnutrition in the American
South caused Klein offers "I don't
think there is one Southern Sena
tor that would allow us to do
similar research in their states."
Political implications, Klein
thinks, would be overriding.

tor that would allow us to do
similar research in their states."
Political implications, Klein
thinks, would be overriding.
The conditions of poverty
widespread in Latin American to
day characterized by improper
diet and little or no medical care
profoundly alter the physical
growth of children.
Preliminary studies done in
Guatemala by Dr. Robert Klein,
psychologist with the Institute of
Nutrition of Central America and
Panama (INCAP), indicate that
malnutrition and other diet
related diseases can impare child
hood mental development as well.
Klein, speaking before a small
audience Tuesday evening, was
reticent about drawing con
clusions before more extensive re
search had been completed —"I am
not yet a believer." Still, he re
ported that he was "astonished at
the size of the differences be
tween malnourished and control
children on tests involving short
term memory."
Professional concern for a
further understanding of there

lations of mental retardation and
malnutrition is heightened by the
worsening nutritional conditions
of the children of the under
developed world.
Three to five per cent have
severe diseases of protein defi
ciency. Fifty to seventy-five per
cent are undernourished. This
amounts to a total of between
two and three hundred million
children. Klein adds, "the next
10-15 years will be much gloomier
than the present."
Research has revealed that in
fection and disease has a correl
lative relation with malnutrition.
The average child in Latin
America has six serious diarrheal
and six serious respiratory diseases
during his first year. Infant Mor
tality at two years is between 30
and 40 per cent.
Klein's researchers have iso
lated nine Guatamalan villages for
study. Each containing from 800
to 1200 people, they are cut off
from all development. The vil

lagers are poor, small landowners
living on a subsistence level.
The villages were divided into
three groups. One group received
medical care and a food supple
ment. The second received only
medical care. The control group
was not given any supplemental
assistance.
In the experimental villages ap
proximately 75 per cent of the
preschool children participated.
This degree of acceptance is ex
ceptional in light of local
suspicions of the outside world.
"There were six witch doctors in
one village," Klein says, "We lined
up all but one of them and he
only controlled a few families."
Research of this kind must face
touchy ethical problems. How
does one choose which villages
will get, a supplement? What
happens when you leave and the
villages must go without assis
tance?
Klein hopes that funding can
be found to follow up his pro
grams in the experimental villages
to sustain the nutritional progress
that has been initiated.
He suggests that his research is
"in no way going to ameliorate
any of the crushing social and eco
nomic problems of Latin America.
Ours is a narrow, scientific en
deavor with no concern in itself
with either food development or
birth control."

Commenting on current U.S.
congressional hearings concerning
malnutrition in the American
South caused Klein offers "I don't
think there is one Southern Sena
tor that would allow us to do
similar research in their states."
