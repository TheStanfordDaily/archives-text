In a move to bring contempor

from four Peninsula galleries are
on exhibit on the second floor of
Tresidder Memorial Union at

sion.
The four are Gallery House,
Canyon Gallery and Los Robles

the oldest gallery in the area. It is
a co-operative venture represen
ting 75 artists. Media displayed in
cludes painting, graphics, and
weaving.
Canyon Gallery specializes in
contemporary, but traditional
painting. Many of the works are
by the owner, John Canyon, and
other local artists. Los Robles Gal
lery features artists from several
parts of the country. It exhibits
jewelry, pottery, painting, and
Eskimo art. Mary Cross of the
Nine Gallery exhibits whatever
she sees and likes from her travels.
All of the galleries chose works
that they thought students would
like. "Students," says Mary Cross,
"have not been brain-washed in
their attitudes toward contempor
ary art and thus, demand more of
the artist." The exhibit runs
through Nov. 8.
