# Mrs. Stanford Stubborn
## Stanford Land For Stanford Dead 
### FELICITY BARRINGER 
Many, in fact most of the
buildings around the Stanford
campus are memorials, built in the
memory of members of the Stan
ford family. Perhaps, the building
that best epitomized this spirit is
the Stanford Mausoleum, where
Senator Stanford, his wife Jane,
and their son Leland, Jr, are
buried.
The mausoleum, erected in
1887, is set off from the rest of
the campus in the middle of a
four-acre plot between El Camino
and the Stanford Museum which
Mrs. Stanford had put aside for
campus burials. The spot is so
secluded that it has, in recent
times, become a haunt for amor
ous couples.
The four acres set aside by Mrs.
Stanford were not intended solely
for the mausoleum. A cemetery
for professors adjacent to the
Mausoleum, was at one time speci
fically designated in the plans of
the University. Four other ceme

teries, not connected to the Uni
versity, have also been discovered,
according to Ralph Hansen, the
University archivist.
"There was supposed to be a
cemetery for professors," Hansen
said, "but the professors got a
little carried away and started
bringing in old maiden aunts from
Kansas. So Mrs. Stanford put her
foot down."
'No More Interments'
In an address to the trustees of
the University in 1902, Mrs. Stan
ford stated that "No additional
interments shall be made . . .in the
cemetery adjacent to the mauso
leum."
At the time the University was
formed, Dennis Marlin had a small
family burying ground near the
spot where the Stanford Linear
Accelerator now stands. The
bodies in this cemetery were
moved to the Alta Mesa cemetery
when the University took over the
land.
The Mausoleum itself was built

before Senator and Mrs. Stanford
died, at an estimated cost of
$100,000. It was described at the
time as being built of "granite
from Barre, Vermont, and Carrara
marble from the famous quarries
in Italy of the same name."
Free License
The architect of the mauso
leum, a Mr, Carrington, was given
a free license to spend as much as
he thought was necessary to built
it. The interior was done in white
marble, with a ceiling consisting
of a single, twenty-five foot arch.
The three sarcophagi, described by
Carrington as being 'when from a
single block of the purest while
marble", were placed on three
sides of the chamber. The en
trance gates to the crypt are made
of bronze.
Two sphinxes, described al
most as lavishly as the sarcophagi,
were placed in the front of the
mausoleum. These had women's
heads and women's bodies. After
Senator Stanford's death in 1893,
Mrs. Stanford decided that the
"artistic effect" of the sphinxes
was "not pleasing", and had two
male sphinzes put on the pedestals
where the female sphinxes had
stood.
The females were placed on the
ground on either side of them
until matching pedestals for them
could be erected in back of the
museum. There is no symbolism
attached to the sphinxes. Accord
ing to Mrs. Alexis Rubin, the assis
tant archivist, it is possible that
the Stanfords were so impressed
with the sphinxes they saw during
their travels that they wanted to
build some at the mausoleum.
Behind the mausoleum, a
statue called "The Angel of Grief"

was added to the memorials at the
burial ground. It was erected by
Mrs. Stanford for her brother,
Henry Lathrop, who died in 1899.
An urn containing his ashes was
interred underneath the statue. A
replica of W.W. Story's memorial
design for a member of the Paris
Rothschild family, the statue was
chosen by Mrs. Stanford from a
photograph. It was made in the
studios of the Bernieri Brothers in
Carrara, Italy.
Mr. Hansen, when asked about
the rumor that the statue was
crying because the person buried
underneath it was the black sheep
of the family, said that this was
untrue.
In 1906, a vandal was seen
taking a finger from one of the
hands of the statue. Since the en
tire marble canopy fell during the
earthquake of the same year,
chipping a large part of one wing
off the angel, it is probably that
the finger was not greatly missed.
A reproduction of the first "Angel
of Grief" was set up in 1908 to
replace the one that had been
damaged.
At one time during the mauso

leum's early history, a sentry box
was set up to guard the area. The
first man assigned to the box died
in it, and the next man, who was
superstitious, refused to occupy
the box if it was left in the same
place. The sentry box was re
moved to another part of campus.
There is at present no plan in
effect for the caretaking of the in
terior of the mausoleum. At one
point, according to Mr. Hansen, a
specific University class had the
responsibility for keeping flowers
at the mausoleum. This practice
was discontinued, however.
It is quite possible that Mrs.
Stanford would turn over in her
while marble sarcophagus if she
knew that Vicky Drake's cam
paign was started by a picture of
her, dressed in approximately the
same style of the female sphinxes,
taken at the Stanford Mausoleum.
