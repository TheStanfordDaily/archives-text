# Stanford ROTC Next For Loss Of Credit?
## 
### FRANK MILLER 
Members of the ad hoc Senate Com
mittee on ROTC at Stanford were very
reluctant to comment on the recent
action by several ivy league colleges to
remove academic credit from ROTC
courses.
Harvard joined Yale, Dartmouth, and
Cornell Tuesday when its faculty voted
to request the withdrawal of academic
credit from all courses offered in the
ROTC program and to terminate the use
of university facilities by ROTC person
nel.
Stanford's ad hoc Senate committee
has already finished writing its report
which will be delivered to the Academic
Senate early next week. For fear of
prejudicing the report, the committee
members agreed to say nothing about
the content of the report until it is re
leased.
Mark Edwards, committee member
and graduate student in the History De
partment, commented, regarding the
ROTC decisions of other colleges, "It
was not a surprise. We had been in con
tact with the other universities."
Majority, Minority Reports
Prof. Thomas Connolly of the En
gineering Department and chairman of
the committee said: "I would prefer not
to react to the decisions of the three
schools." Connolly, however, did say
that he had "no indication that there
was a cleavage in other universities such
as the one that exists in the Stanford
committee. There will be a majority and
a minority report."
Col. Robert Thomas, Prof, of Naval
Science and member of the committee,
was not quite as silent regarding the
decisions of other universities. "Yale's
decision and similar ones at Harvard and
other universities are bound to have an
adverse effect on the continuing of
Stanford ROTC. I do not believe that
ROTC can be continued as an extracur

ricular activity and still remain worthy
of the university's support or useful to
students or military people."
All members of the committee were
quick to add that the decision of the
committee was made on the basis of
Stanford's particular situation and not
on the basis of what other colleges have
done.
J. Thomas Carrato, another student
member of the committee, emphasized:
"We've been interested in what other
universities have done and we have kept
in contact. But we have tried to main
tain our integrity and we have tried to
do what is best for Stanford. In this re
spect we have come to our own con
clusions."
Personal Reaction
Carrato had a personal reaction to
the decisions of other universities, "If
they don't make other arrangements,
eliminating ROTC credit is a real shame.
Some universities, while eliminating
credit for classes, have lowered basic
course requirements so that students
could take ROTC courses and still grad
uate in the normal length of time."
According to history Prof. Lyman
Van Slyke, "The committee report is
wrapped up. The decisions of other uni
versities did not influence our decision.
I think academic credit is important but
some of the issues go beyond this and
include ROTC as an institution."
The reaction to the general trend of
eliminating credit for ROTC courses did
not seem to bother ROTC students.
Most felt that if a similar decision were
reached here at Stanford, it would not
affect them but only classes entering
Stanford in the future.
Maintain ROTC Machinery
Phil Lyman, an Army ROTC junior
said, "As long as they maintain the
machinery of ROTC I think it is fine. If
you make it an extra-curricular activity
you might lose a lot of the people who
are in ROTC for poor reasons."

committee. There will be a majority and
a minority report."
Col. Robert Thomas, Prof, of Naval
Science and member of the committee,
was not quite as silent regarding the
decisions of other universities. "Yale's
decision and similar ones at Harvard and
other universities are bound to have an
adverse effect on the continuing of
Stanford ROTC. I do not believe that
ROTC can be continued as an extracur

ricular activity and still remain worthy
of the university's support or useful to
students or military people."
All members of the committee were
quick to add that the decision of the
committee was made on the basis of
Stanford's particular situation and not
on the basis of what other colleges have
done.
J. Thomas Carrato, another student
member of the committee, emphasized:
"We've been interested in what other
universities have done and we have kept
in contact. But we have tried to main
tain our integrity and we have tried to
do what is best for Stanford. In this re
spect we have come to our own con
clusions."
Personal Reaction
Carrato had a personal reaction to
the decisions of other universities, "If
they don't make other arrangements,
eliminating ROTC credit is a real shame.
Some universities, while eliminating
credit for classes, have lowered basic
course requirements so that students
could take ROTC courses and still grad
uate in the normal length of time."
According to history Prof. Lyman
Van Slyke, "The committee report is
wrapped up. The decisions of other uni
versities did not influence our decision.
I think academic credit is important but
some of the issues go beyond this and
include ROTC as an institution."
The reaction to the general trend of
eliminating credit for ROTC courses did
not seem to bother ROTC students.
Most felt that if a similar decision were
reached here at Stanford, it would not
affect them but only classes entering
Stanford in the future.
Maintain ROTC Machinery
Phil Lyman, an Army ROTC junior
said, "As long as they maintain the
machinery of ROTC I think it is fine. If
you make it an extra-curricular activity
you might lose a lot of the people who
are in ROTC for poor reasons."
Members of the ad hoc Senate Com
mittee on ROTC at Stanford were very
reluctant to comment on the recent
action by several ivy league colleges to
remove academic credit from ROTC
courses.
Harvard joined Yale, Dartmouth, and
Cornell Tuesday when its faculty voted
to request the withdrawal of academic
credit from all courses offered in the
ROTC program and to terminate the use
of university facilities by ROTC person
nel.
Stanford's ad hoc Senate committee
has already finished writing its report
which will be delivered to the Academic
Senate early next week. For fear of
prejudicing the report, the committee
members agreed to say nothing about
the content of the report until it is re
leased.
Mark Edwards, committee member
and graduate student in the History De
partment, commented, regarding the
ROTC decisions of other colleges, "It
was not a surprise. We had been in con
tact with the other universities."
Majority, Minority Reports
Prof. Thomas Connolly of the En
gineering Department and chairman of
the committee said: "I would prefer not
to react to the decisions of the three
schools." Connolly, however, did say
that he had "no indication that there
was a cleavage in other universities such
as the one that exists in the Stanford
committee. There will be a majority and
a minority report."
