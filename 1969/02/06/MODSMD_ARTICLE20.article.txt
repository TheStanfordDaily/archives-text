# Playing Different Roles
## Coffee House Has Identity Problem 
### LYNNE McCALLISTER 
When the Coffee House was
closed down on Jan. 22 because
two couples refused to stop danc
ing, many of the customers were
annoyed by the inconvenience.
Few realized that this incident
was a symptom of a struggle to

define the role of the Coffee
House in the Stanford commun
ity.
While one member of the staff
said that "this thing about no
dancing was just ridiculous,"
another explained that it was a
misunderstanding, resulting from

"the coffee house not knowing
what it should be."
He stated, "the Coffee House is
playing different roles, and the
roles are in conflict with each
other."
Greg Yahna, the Program Dir
ector said that the decision was
"an interpretation of Coffee
House policy against the place be
coming a cabaret."
The day of the incident a
pamphlet was circulated by an
organization which called itself
the Protestors, Troublemakers,
and Anarchists (PTA), announcing
a party in the Coffee House that
night. A decision was made to
close the Coffee House. Later the
decision was revoked and another
pamphlet was circulated.
Dancing Stops Parly
The group came in to talk with
the manager, and the party start
ed. Later two couples started
dancing and the manager, Richard
Elsworth, decided to close the
Coffee House for the evening.
Tension arising from the fact
that the Coffee House was oper
ating on a trial basis in January
also influenced the decision. Jan
uary was the first full month of
normal operations for the Coffee
House. Last quarter was interrup
ted by breaks and vacations, by
training personnel and making
structural improvements.
The Coffee House has to prove
that it is financially sound before
it can get the funds needed for im
provements.
Richard Elsworth, the manager
of the Coffee House, said, "We
can't hope to satisfy all the de
mands of the community." He
feels that the common denomin
ator is "the quality foods and
drinks people get here," and that
they should provide the "type of
atmosphere they can consume
these in."
Elsworth had worked in five
other coffee house operations, in
cluding ones in San Francisco and
Berkeley when the Coffee House
Committee asked him to manage
the Stanford Coffee House. "I was
trained by a lady from Italy who
knew the business from years of
European coffee house ownership
and management in Switzerland,"
he said.
Policy Discussed
After the Wednesday night in
cident, the Coffee House Commit
tee met to discuss policy. A sim
ple explanation of this committee
was offered: "They created them
selves and the Coffee House." The

Committee decided that its role
was not to define what goes on in
the Coffee House. As one member
said, "people should be able to do
what they want there."
As the Program Director ex
plained, "If the committee re
nounces its programming func
tion, then planning is between the
students and the programming
committee." Yahna feels that the
atmosphere in the Coffee House
should be spontaneous, and that
activities such as dancing should
not be prevented.
Yahna has planned a number
of new programs for this quarter.
Groups are scheduled to play each
Friday night, and there will be a
cover charge for this time. Yahna
said that these shows will be
something like a concert, quiet
enough so that the audience can
appreciate the individual posi
tions. The Cleanliness and Godli
ness Skiffle Band has performed
this quarter, and The Lamb
played recently.
"Loud Saturdays"
Saturdays there will be louder
entertainment. The "coffee
hours" will be continued from last
quarter. Professors are invited to
the Coffee House from seven to
eight o'clock to talk with stu
dents. Yahna also hopes to have
poetry and prose readings in the
early evening.
Sam McGowan, a singer who
was popular in the Coffee House
last quarter will probably play a
few times, said Yahna. He is now
attending Foothill College, and is
living with the Freelens, Faculty
Residents in a Fraternity Clus
ter.
Instructors are being encour
aged to bring their classes to the
Coffee House in the afternoons
for a change of atmosphere.
Yahna says he hopes that students
will offer suggestions for programs
in the Coffee House.
Changes will also be made in
the design of the Coffee House.
First, money is being raised to
lower the ceiling.
The acoustics are now bad, so
that the room is very noisy. Low
ering the ceiling would limit the
noise.
An art class is now making de
signs for the back section of the
Coffee House. It will be a quiet
place where people can talk, cut
off from the rest of the room by a
moveable divider of old oak
doors. The section will be de
signed in fabrics, with cushions

and foam rubber on the floor. The
large window in the back is to be
screened with drapes.
The Coffee House plans to
serve light dinners in the future,
such as soups and casseroles. They
need funds, however, for adjust
ments so that they will not be
breaking fire laws. The possibility
of serving wine is also being ex
plored.

At a subsequent meeting, the
Coffee House Committee discus
sed its own role, and what it
should do in the future. Elsworth,
the manager, said that he felt the
committee should act as a link
with the Stanford community. "I
want to manage a student Coffee
House," he said.
The Committee talked aboui,
ways to make the Coffee House
"a functioning unit of the cam
pus." They discussed bringing
members of different campus con
stituencies on to the committee.
They want the Coffee House to be
a place where poets and writers
come to talk and give readings.
"We want a place which is vi
brant," they said.

was not to define what goes on in
the Coffee House. As one member
said, "people should be able to do
what they want there."
As the Program Director ex
plained, "If the committee re
nounces its programming func
tion, then planning is between the
students and the programming
committee." Yahna feels that the
atmosphere in the Coffee House
should be spontaneous, and that
activities such as dancing should
not be prevented.
Yahna has planned a number
of new programs for this quarter.
Groups are scheduled to play each
Friday night, and there will be a
cover charge for this time. Yahna
said that these shows will be
something like a concert, quiet
enough so that the audience can
appreciate the individual posi
tions. The Cleanliness and Godli
ness Skiffle Band has performed
this quarter, and The Lamb
played recently.
"Loud Saturdays"
Saturdays there will be louder
entertainment. The "coffee
hours" will be continued from last
quarter. Professors are invited to
the Coffee House from seven to
eight o'clock to talk with stu
dents. Yahna also hopes to have
poetry and prose readings in the
early evening.
Sam McGowan, a singer who
was popular in the Coffee House
last quarter will probably play a
few times, said Yahna. He is now
attending Foothill College, and is
living with the Freelens, Faculty
Residents in a Fraternity Clus
ter.
Instructors are being encour
aged to bring their classes to the
Coffee House in the afternoons
for a change of atmosphere.
Yahna says he hopes that students
will offer suggestions for programs
in the Coffee House.
Changes will also be made in
the design of the Coffee House.
First, money is being raised to
lower the ceiling.
The acoustics are now bad, so
that the room is very noisy. Low
ering the ceiling would limit the
noise.
An art class is now making de
signs for the back section of the
Coffee House. It will be a quiet
place where people can talk, cut
off from the rest of the room by a
moveable divider of old oak
doors. The section will be de
signed in fabrics, with cushions

and foam rubber on the floor. The
large window in the back is to be
screened with drapes.
The Coffee House plans to
serve light dinners in the future,
such as soups and casseroles. They
need funds, however, for adjust
ments so that they will not be
breaking fire laws. The possibility
of serving wine is also being ex
plored.

At a subsequent meeting, the
Coffee House Committee discus
sed its own role, and what it
should do in the future. Elsworth,
the manager, said that he felt the
committee should act as a link
with the Stanford community. "I
want to manage a student Coffee
House," he said.
The Committee talked aboui,
ways to make the Coffee House
"a functioning unit of the cam
pus." They discussed bringing
members of different campus con
stituencies on to the committee.
They want the Coffee House to be
a place where poets and writers
come to talk and give readings.
"We want a place which is vi
brant," they said.
When the Coffee House was
closed down on Jan. 22 because
two couples refused to stop danc
ing, many of the customers were
annoyed by the inconvenience.
Few realized that this incident
was a symptom of a struggle to

define the role of the Coffee
House in the Stanford commun
ity.
While one member of the staff
said that "this thing about no
dancing was just ridiculous,"
another explained that it was a
misunderstanding, resulting from

"the coffee house not knowing
what it should be."
He stated, "the Coffee House is
playing different roles, and the
roles are in conflict with each
other."
Greg Yahna, the Program Dir
ector said that the decision was
"an interpretation of Coffee
House policy against the place be
coming a cabaret."
The day of the incident a
pamphlet was circulated by an
organization which called itself
the Protestors, Troublemakers,
and Anarchists (PTA), announcing
a party in the Coffee House that
night. A decision was made to
close the Coffee House. Later the
decision was revoked and another
pamphlet was circulated.
Dancing Stops Parly
The group came in to talk with
the manager, and the party start
ed. Later two couples started
dancing and the manager, Richard
Elsworth, decided to close the
Coffee House for the evening.
Tension arising from the fact
that the Coffee House was oper
ating on a trial basis in January
also influenced the decision. Jan
uary was the first full month of
normal operations for the Coffee
House. Last quarter was interrup
ted by breaks and vacations, by
training personnel and making
structural improvements.
The Coffee House has to prove
that it is financially sound before
it can get the funds needed for im
provements.
Richard Elsworth, the manager
of the Coffee House, said, "We
can't hope to satisfy all the de
mands of the community." He
feels that the common denomin
ator is "the quality foods and
drinks people get here," and that
they should provide the "type of
atmosphere they can consume
these in."
Elsworth had worked in five
other coffee house operations, in
cluding ones in San Francisco and
Berkeley when the Coffee House
Committee asked him to manage
the Stanford Coffee House. "I was
trained by a lady from Italy who
knew the business from years of
European coffee house ownership
and management in Switzerland,"
he said.

the manager, said that he felt the
committee should act as a link
with the Stanford community. "I
want to manage a student Coffee
House," he said.
The Committee talked aboui,
ways to make the Coffee House
"a functioning unit of the cam
pus." They discussed bringing
members of different campus con
stituencies on to the committee.
They want the Coffee House to be
a place where poets and writers
come to talk and give readings.
"We want a place which is vi
brant," they said.
When the Coffee House was
closed down on Jan. 22 because
two couples refused to stop danc
ing, many of the customers were
annoyed by the inconvenience.
Few realized that this incident
was a symptom of a struggle to

define the role of the Coffee
House in the Stanford commun
ity.
While one member of the staff
said that "this thing about no
dancing was just ridiculous,"
another explained that it was a
misunderstanding, resulting from

"the coffee house not knowing
what it should be."
He stated, "the Coffee House is
playing different roles, and the
roles are in conflict with each
other."
Greg Yahna, the Program Dir
ector said that the decision was
"an interpretation of Coffee
House policy against the place be
coming a cabaret."
The day of the incident a
pamphlet was circulated by an
organization which called itself
the Protestors, Troublemakers,
and Anarchists (PTA), announcing
a party in the Coffee House that
night. A decision was made to
close the Coffee House. Later the
decision was revoked and another
pamphlet was circulated.
Dancing Stops Parly
The group came in to talk with
the manager, and the party start
ed. Later two couples started
dancing and the manager, Richard
Elsworth, decided to close the
Coffee House for the evening.
Tension arising from the fact
that the Coffee House was oper
ating on a trial basis in January
also influenced the decision. Jan
uary was the first full month of
normal operations for the Coffee
House. Last quarter was interrup
ted by breaks and vacations, by
training personnel and making
structural improvements.
The Coffee House has to prove
that it is financially sound before
it can get the funds needed for im
provements.
Richard Elsworth, the manager
of the Coffee House, said, "We
can't hope to satisfy all the de
mands of the community." He
feels that the common denomin
ator is "the quality foods and
drinks people get here," and that
they should provide the "type of
atmosphere they can consume
these in."
Elsworth had worked in five
other coffee house operations, in
cluding ones in San Francisco and
Berkeley when the Coffee House
Committee asked him to manage
the Stanford Coffee House. "I was
trained by a lady from Italy who
knew the business from years of
European coffee house ownership
and management in Switzerland,"
he said.
Policy Discussed
After the Wednesday night in
cident, the Coffee House Commit
tee met to discuss policy. A sim
ple explanation of this committee
was offered: "They created them
selves and the Coffee House." The

Committee decided that its role
was not to define what goes on in
the Coffee House. As one member
said, "people should be able to do
what they want there."
As the Program Director ex
plained, "If the committee re
nounces its programming func
tion, then planning is between the
students and the programming
committee." Yahna feels that the
atmosphere in the Coffee House
should be spontaneous, and that
activities such as dancing should
not be prevented.
Yahna has planned a number
of new programs for this quarter.
Groups are scheduled to play each
Friday night, and there will be a
cover charge for this time. Yahna
said that these shows will be
something like a concert, quiet
enough so that the audience can
appreciate the individual posi
tions. The Cleanliness and Godli
ness Skiffle Band has performed
this quarter, and The Lamb
played recently.
"Loud Saturdays"
Saturdays there will be louder
entertainment. The "coffee
hours" will be continued from last
quarter. Professors are invited to
the Coffee House from seven to
eight o'clock to talk with stu
dents. Yahna also hopes to have
poetry and prose readings in the
early evening.
Sam McGowan, a singer who
was popular in the Coffee House
last quarter will probably play a
few times, said Yahna. He is now
attending Foothill College, and is
living with the Freelens, Faculty
Residents in a Fraternity Clus
ter.
Instructors are being encour
aged to bring their classes to the
Coffee House in the afternoons
for a change of atmosphere.
Yahna says he hopes that students
will offer suggestions for programs
in the Coffee House.
Changes will also be made in
the design of the Coffee House.
First, money is being raised to
lower the ceiling.
The acoustics are now bad, so
that the room is very noisy. Low
ering the ceiling would limit the
noise.
An art class is now making de
signs for the back section of the
Coffee House. It will be a quiet
place where people can talk, cut
off from the rest of the room by a
moveable divider of old oak
doors. The section will be de
signed in fabrics, with cushions

and foam rubber on the floor. The
large window in the back is to be
screened with drapes.
The Coffee House plans to
serve light dinners in the future,
such as soups and casseroles. They
need funds, however, for adjust
ments so that they will not be
breaking fire laws. The possibility
of serving wine is also being ex
plored.
