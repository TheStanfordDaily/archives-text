COFFEE HOUSEâ€”The coffee house, plagued by disruption and identity prob
lems, has planned a number of new programs for this quarter. There will be cover
charges on Friday night and there will be "loud entertainment" on Saturdays.
Members of the coffee house staff believe that "the coffee house is playing
different roles, and the roles are in conflict with each other." Program Director
Greg Yahna does not want the "place to become a cabaret."
