# Malcolm Cowley:
## Writing Lacks Temporal Form 
### 
Malcolm Cowley, poet and
critic, criticized the lack of temp
oral form in modern writing in a
lecture last Tuesday evening, "In
Defense of the Story."
A florrid, white-haired gentle
man, Cowley poked fun at what
he called the "contemporary ef
fort not to tell a story." He de
plored the diffusion, non-heroes,
and lack of movement and se
quence in modern writing, the
"raw confessions torn from the
subconscious, thrown in front of
the reader like a piece of butcher's
meat."
Among his examples were
Adrienne Kennedy's plays and
Andy Warhol's A. He described
the latter as 24 hours of talk by a
young man who was homosexual,
high on amphetemines, and loqua
tious.
This type of writing, he said,
has the quality of snap-shot phot
ography, of pure objective obser
vation. It treats the totality of the
world in space but not in time.

However, it is the temporal ele
ment which holds the story to
gether. "We live in a world of time
that is also a world of events."
Cowley said that the story has
four elements. It consists of (1) a
person or group of persons (2) in
volved in a situation, (3) who per
form a series of acts (4) in which
something is changed.
"Every story," he said, "is a
fable with at least an implied
moral Life," he went on, "pro
vides patterns to satisfy a longing
for this moral logic." He used the
example of a bus hitting a pedes
trian. Busses, he said, only run
over people who blindly step in
front of them. "Life is still the

creator of stories," he concluded.
Wallace Stegner, head of the
Creative Writing Department, in
troduced Cowley, saying that
"Malcolm Cowley has made his
peace with Chronos." Cowley,
former editor of The New Repub
lic, has taught and lectured at
Stanford. His works include Black
Cargoes, a history of the slave
trade in America.
Cowley's talk was one of a
series of lectures given in honor of
Edith Mirrielees, who taught Eng
lish at Stanford for fifty years and
was later editor of the Pacific
Spectator. She was author of a
history of Stanford University,
and left part of her estate to the
Creative Writing Department.
