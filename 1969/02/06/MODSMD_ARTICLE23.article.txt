# Theater Focuses On Fortas Debate
## 
### 
The Theater of the Congres
sional Record is embarking on an
experiment this month which is
designed to make its dramatic
presentations of congressional de
bates more relevant to present
political problems. Instead of
dramatizing something like the
1868 impeachment proceeding of
President Andrew Johnson or the
all-night debate over U.S. entry in
to World War I, Theater members
will concentrate on recreating re
cent debates on critical import
ance to America.
It is quite possible that debates
of even recent weeks could be per
formed, thereby becoming some
thing of a living newsreel pheno
menon, a monitor of Congress,"
suggests Gordon Wickstrom, a
member of the Theater players.
"The imagination dazzles at the
notion of a Congress kept on its
toes by having its double opera
ting behind it in the shadow world
of the theater."
Although not denying the
value of dramatizing events which
were important in America's his-

Tory, theater players now view
their performances as a medium
for political education in current
issues.
To this end, the players will re
create on Feb. 25 and March 4 the
filibuster that blocked the nomin
ation of Abe Fortas to Chief Jus
tice of the Supreme Court.
Fortas, unhesitatingly endorsed
by The American Bar Association,
was grilled by the Senate about
his legal stand on such issues as
pornography, judicial ethics, the
rights of a criminal, and the role
of the court in our society.
By dramatizing these proceed
ings, Theater players hope to em
phasize how the Senate's stand on
Fortas' nomination can affect the
entire legal system of the United
States.
Casting for "The Fortas De
bate" will be this week and next.
John Kulsar, originator of the
Theater, says, "We are not partic
ularly looking for widely exper
ienced actors. Rather, the Theater
is a chronicle that really asks foi
an interest in what it is portraying
as the criterion for its players."
