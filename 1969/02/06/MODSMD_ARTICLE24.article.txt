## Frosh Spark Swimming Resurgence

Stanford's chances for a 1969 NCAA swimming championship are
getting better all the time.
Two sophomores and a pair of sensational freshmen have been
providing Coach Jim Gaughran with the kind of performances that
may pave the way to the Tribe's second national title.
The sophomores—Brent Berk and John Ferris—currently have the
best times in the nation in their events. The two freshmen—Dave
Shilling and Mark Shelley—qualified for the NCAA's in a total of five
events last weekend.
Friday afternoon Stanford engaged Cal in a non-scoring,
Championship Events Meet. Already casting an eye towards the
NCAA finals, Coach Gaughran hoped that several of his swimmers
would qualify for the meet. In particular, Gaughran hoped that the
freshmen, who are ineligible in dual meets but eligible for the national
meet, would post qualifying times.
Shelley and Shilling didn't let Gaughran down.
Shelley led three Stanford swimmers to qualifying times in the
1650-yerd freestyle, clocking an excellent 17:00.9. Berk was right
behind Shelley, in 17:04.5, while Bert Mason swam a 17:33.5. Shilling
swam a lifetime best of 1:01.1 in the 100 breaststrole to qualify for
the nationals in that event.
Saturday afternoon the Indians faced Cal in the regular dual meet,
and romped to an easy 82-31 win. The freshman slaughtered the Cal
yearlings 84-18.

Berk timed a sensational 9:58.1 in the 1000 freestyle, the top
effort in the nation so far this year. Ferris went 1:53.3 in the 200
butterfly, easily the best time in the nation this season.
Two other varsity swimmers registered outstanding times Saturday
afternoon. Senior captain Pete Siebert clocked 2:00.8 in the 200 IM
and sophomore Fred Haywood swam a 2:01.5 200 backstroke. Both
are among the country's top 10 times in these events.
But the show-stealer was Shilling. The phenomenal freshman shat
tered his own NCAA frosh record in the 200 breaststroke with a
fantastic 2:12.1. Aside from Dave's own 2:12.9 in the same event, it is
the top time in the country this year by 2Vi seconds.
Shilling didn't stop there. He also blazed to a 2:01 clocking in the
200 IM to qualify for an NCAA berth in that event.
Shelley, proving that his effort in the 1650 freestyle a day earlier
was only a preview of things to come, qualified for the nationals in
the 200 butterfly with a 2:00.8 time.
Another freshman, Jim Morris, continued to show great improve
ment in the breaststroke.Morris went 1:02.3 in the 100 and 2:21.8 in
the 200. Since the Tribe varsity is somewhat thin in the breaststroke,
Morris could give a big boost to Stanford's chances in the NCAA meet
by working his way up to a national-qualifying time.

far-and-away the top effort in the country this season.
