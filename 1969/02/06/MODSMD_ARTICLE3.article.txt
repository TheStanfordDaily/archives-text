# 'Archaic Pot Laws'
## Busts Spur Student Vote 
### CRAIG WILSON 
The possibility of a student refer
endum condemning the actions of out
side "police entering the Stanford cam
pus" as well as condemning "archaic
marijuana laws" has been raised in stu

dent response to the recent marijuana
arrests.
The idea for the referendum, which
could be placed on the ballot for the
Feb. 18 and 19 ASSU student elections,
came about last night at a meeting of
the newly formed Campus Committee
Against Police Harassment.
The meeting came just a day follow
ing the fourth arrest in little more than
four days for possesion of marijuana
either by a Stanford student or on the
Stanford campus.
The gathering of more than 50 peo
ple included law professor John Kaplan
as well as John Lanthier who was ar
rested in the Undergraduate library two
weeks ago for possession of marijuana.
Referendum
The referendum deals specifically
with a statement issued by the commit
tee today.
In part the statement said that "the
Trustees should declare the University
Private Property and energetically pros
ecute anyone trespassing upon it. No
permission should be given to any law
enforcement agency without reference
to the Judicial Council or Standing
Policy Statements formulated by the
S.C.L.C. and ratified by all constituen
cies.
Professor Kaplan gave a brief resume
of various university practices involving
the concept of "in loco parentis".
He said the"the lessening of super
vision of the students by the University
has made the University unwilling to
trust it with this task.
Heavy Use
"Police officials," he said, "as well as
University officials know that use of
marijuana is extremely heavy.
"Last year the level of use was meas
ured at 50 per cent and this year it is
closer to 70 per cent."
In response to the committees de
mand that all warrants served be served
upon the Trustee as property owners,
THE DAILY spoke with Associate Dean
of Students Willard Wyman yesterday
who corrected an inaccuracy reported in
TIIF DAILY yesterday.

According to Wyman, "the statement
that the University would henceforth
take care of all offenses on campus other
than felonies is incorrect. What he
should have said is that the administra
tion has, through the office of Dan
DeYoung, University Director of Public
Safety, and Stanford Police Chief Tom
Bell, worked out an arrangement to
serve warrants for traffic violations
through the Stanford Police Department
rather than by Santa Clara County Of
ficers contacting students in their resi
dents."
According to Dick Ragsdale of Zeta
Psi fraternity the policy change comes
after an incident two nights ago in
which two plainclothes police officers
asked to see a member of the house.
The police told him they had a war
rant for his arrest because of the unpaid
ticket.
Said Ragsdale "the whole thing
seemed highly unusual to the guys and
the rest of the house. The guys were
pretty unnerved about it and they re
sented it quite a bit."
Soon after the incident Ragsdale met
with Dean of Students Joe Smith and
Wyman and the announcement of the
policy came soon after.

THE DAILY spoke with Associate Dean
of Students Willard Wyman yesterday
who corrected an inaccuracy reported in
TIIF DAILY yesterday.

According to Wyman, "the statement
that the University would henceforth
take care of all offenses on campus other
than felonies is incorrect. What he
should have said is that the administra
tion has, through the office of Dan
DeYoung, University Director of Public
Safety, and Stanford Police Chief Tom
Bell, worked out an arrangement to
serve warrants for traffic violations
through the Stanford Police Department
rather than by Santa Clara County Of
ficers contacting students in their resi
dents."
According to Dick Ragsdale of Zeta
Psi fraternity the policy change comes
after an incident two nights ago in
which two plainclothes police officers
asked to see a member of the house.
The police told him they had a war
rant for his arrest because of the unpaid
ticket.
Said Ragsdale "the whole thing
seemed highly unusual to the guys and
the rest of the house. The guys were
pretty unnerved about it and they re
sented it quite a bit."
Soon after the incident Ragsdale met
with Dean of Students Joe Smith and
Wyman and the announcement of the
policy came soon after.

STUDENT RIGHTS—Law Professor John Kaplan paid a short visit to the Campus Committee
Against Police Harassment meeting last night utid delivered a short lecture on student rights.
The Committee decided to challenge "archaic marijuana laws" in a referendum which it hopes
to place on the ASSU elections ballot Feb. 18 and 19.
The possibility of a student refer
endum condemning the actions of out
side "police entering the Stanford cam
pus" as well as condemning "archaic
marijuana laws" has been raised in stu

dent response to the recent marijuana
arrests.
The idea for the referendum, which
could be placed on the ballot for the
Feb. 18 and 19 ASSU student elections,
came about last night at a meeting of
the newly formed Campus Committee
Against Police Harassment.
The meeting came just a day follow
ing the fourth arrest in little more than
four days for possesion of marijuana
either by a Stanford student or on the
Stanford campus.
The gathering of more than 50 peo
ple included law professor John Kaplan
as well as John Lanthier who was ar
rested in the Undergraduate library two
weeks ago for possession of marijuana.
Referendum
The referendum deals specifically
with a statement issued by the commit
tee today.
In part the statement said that "the
Trustees should declare the University
Private Property and energetically pros
ecute anyone trespassing upon it. No
permission should be given to any law
enforcement agency without reference
to the Judicial Council or Standing
Policy Statements formulated by the
S.C.L.C. and ratified by all constituen
cies.
Professor Kaplan gave a brief resume
of various university practices involving
the concept of "in loco parentis".
He said the"the lessening of super
vision of the students by the University
has made the University unwilling to
trust it with this task.
Heavy Use
"Police officials," he said, "as well as
University officials know that use of
marijuana is extremely heavy.
"Last year the level of use was meas
ured at 50 per cent and this year it is
closer to 70 per cent."
In response to the committees de
mand that all warrants served be served
upon the Trustee as property owners,
