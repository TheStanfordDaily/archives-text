## Committee Show Lacking Humor 
### ANDREA HINE 
I wanted to like the new Com
mittee Show which opened Wed
nesday night at 622 Broadway in
San Francisco. I really did. I'd
seen them several times before,
and the satires had always been
sharp and very funny. So the pros
pects for this- new show were
promising, and the audience (com
posed of a mixture of people rang
ing from jeweled gray-haired
ladies to young miniskirted teen
agers) seemed as expectant as I.
Somehow, though, between
the intention of the actors to put
on a sophisticated and humorous
collection of skits, and the fin
ished product itself—which came
out more cloying than cure, more
sticky than sophisticated—some
thing went wrong. Applause was
merely polite; the laughter often
seemed forced; and when the
show was over, the audience strag

gled out into the rain and neon
lights of North Beach looking
somewhat forlorn and disappoin
ted. I didn't blame them.
It's hard to pinpoint exactly
what went wrong. Humor is very
elusive, both to define and pro
duce, and Wednesday night,
seemed more conspicuous, agile,
and talented. The three girls, in
short colorful dresses, were pro
vacative or childlike, exuberent or
bored, as the occasion demanded;
and the four men equally versa
tile.
Rather the fault lay with the
script. The former Committee
shows were highly political and
geared to reflect the irony of cur
rent life (for better or worse). The
new show had few jibes of this
nature (including a request at an
international airport for Eldridge
Cleaver to please report at the
white courtesy telephone). Con

troversy was glossed over in favor
of the traditional satirical themes
of boy-meets-girl-and-makes-it-or
breaks-it (usually the latter); sex
education for the sophisticated
audience; art; music; dope; crime;
disease; and other human foibles,
One had the uncomfortable feel
ing that all these situations had
been enacted before (and better)
in everyday life. Why pay $2.50
(special student weekend price) to
have professional actors enact
them again?
The best number, entitled
"Junque Symphony." began as a
satire on modern music, with the
members of the Committee, com
plete with conductor, performing
together such melodious feats as
blowing up a balloon, turning the
hands of an alarm clock, pouring
water from a coffee pot, dialing a
telephone, scratching a fork over a
blackboard, (ouch!) clashing

cymbols, rattling bowls, and flip
ping the pages of a book. How
ever, after five minutes, a real
composition emerged— a salute to
modern man and the trappings of
his mechanized world.
The skits were interspersed
with philosophical homey mono
logues by the individual actors;
and one of them seemed ironically
appropriate in describing the all
too-tedious and trite Committee
show. The actor, in describing his
childhood relationship with his
grandmother, repeated her sage
advice to him: "Boy, you talk too
much—when you die, you won't
have nothin' to say!"
