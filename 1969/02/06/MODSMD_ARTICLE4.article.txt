# Unrest Continues At UC Berkeley
## 
### 
Compiled From The Associated Press
Gov. Reagan proclaimed an unprec
edented "state of extreme emergency"
Wednesday on the University of Califor
nia's troubled Berkeley campus so that
highway patrolmen can be kept there.
Reagan also proposed emergency leg
islation to keep students and faculty
convicted of campus disorders from re
turning to their schools.
"These actions will clearly indicate
that the State of California is deter
mined to exercise its responsibility to
maintain law and order on the campuses
of our university as well as all other edu
cational institutions," Reagan told a
special news conference.
"A similar situation would be met in
a similar way on another campus,"
Reagan said.
UC Officials Agreed
Reagan said his proclamation was
made with concurrence of UC officials.
Sheriff Frank Madigan of Alameda
County said Berkeley Chancellor Roger
W. Heyns "concurred that some addi
tional police action was necessary."
A student strike began two weeks
ago at Berkeley and erupted into severe
beatings Tuesday. Twenty strikers were
arrested and two officers and six non
strikers required hospital treatment.
Most of those arrested were young
white men, although the strike was
called by Negro and other non-white
students to enforce racial demands.
Picketing and Marching
Student strikers picketed and
marched around the campus in the rain
yesterday but avoided any repetition of
Tuesday's battles with police.
Two white students were arrested,
one for assault and one for obstructing a
public passageway.
About 300 strikers and sympathizers
met in the Student Union in midafter
noon. Jim Nabors, Black Students
Union leader, told them the policy was
to avoid confrontations with police.
Of the 20 persons arrested Tuesday
in a series of clashes with police, 11
were identified as nonstudents.
Third World Front
The strike was called Jan. 22 by the
Third World Liberation Front, a loose
coalition of dissidents, to enforce de
mands for an autonomous school of
ethnic studies and other racial conces
sions.
In supporting Gov. Reagan's move,
Chancellor Heyns said, "Our experience
confirmed by professional opinion has
indicated that we are most successful in
maintaining a peaceful, orderly campus
when we have adequate manpower avail-

Sheriff Madigan pointed out that
Reagan's statement was made for prac
tical reasons as well since the Berkeley
police were over-extended trying to
cover the campus in addition to their
normal assignments. The state of emer
gency order enables the local police
force to use highway patrol officers to
supplement their own force.
University of Chicago
Students at the University of Chicago
carried their occupation of a university
administration into its seventh day, but
there were signs that negotiations be
tween the students and administration
may take place.
The steering committee of rebel stu
dents said Tuesday that it was seeking
formal talks with the administration on
all the dissidents demands.
The students took the building a
week ago to enforce demands that a
woman sociology professor be rehired.
They also are asking that students have
an equal voice with the faculty in the
hiring and firing of faculty members.
Michigan State Disturbance
Yelling "On Strike—Shut It Down"
some 400 students marched out of
Michigan State University's administra
tion building rather than be arrested
Monday after a more than three-hour
sit-in.
Rallying to protest the firing of a
psychology professor the group voted to
regather at a dormitory instead of facing
trespassing charges in the administration
building.
The protest centers around Dr. Ber
tram Garskof, an assistant professor of
psychology, who has been fired for
what his department considered "Un
satisfactory"' teaching techniques. Stu
dents in his classes were permitted to
grade themselves.
Santa Cruz Activity
1000 students at the University of
California at Santa Cruz boycotted clas
ses today in support of naming one of
the future campus colleges after black
leader Malcolm X.
In addition the students are also ask
ing that they be given the right to select
future campus speakers without admin
istration approval.
An estimated 50 carloads of Santa
Cruz residents rolled on campus Mon
day night to support the college admin
istration and Chancellor Dean McHenry
during a rumored confrontation with
students outside his home. The confron
tation failed to come off and the resi
dents, calling themselves the "Taxpayers
for Higher Education," left quietly.

Of the 20 persons arrested Tuesday
in a series of clashes with police, 11
were identified as nonstudents.
Third World Front
The strike was called Jan. 22 by the
Third World Liberation Front, a loose
coalition of dissidents, to enforce de

ethnic studies and other racial conces
sions.
In supporting Gov. Reagan's move,
Chancellor Heyns said, "Our experience

Sheriff Madigan pointed out that
Reagan's statement was made for prac

police were over-extended trying to
cover the campus in addition to their
normal assignments. The state of emer
gency order enables the local police
force to use highway patrol officers to
supplement their own force.
University of Chicago
Students at the University of Chicago
carried their occupation of a university
administration into its seventh day, but
there were signs that negotiations be
tween the students and administration
may take place.
The steering committee of rebel stu
dents said Tuesday that it was seeking
formal talks with the administration on
all the dissidents demands.
The students took the building a
week ago to enforce demands that a
woman sociology professor be rehired.
They also are asking that students have
an equal voice with the faculty in the
hiring and firing of faculty members.
Michigan State Disturbance
Yelling "On Strike—Shut It Down"
some 400 students marched out of
Michigan State University's administra
tion building rather than be arrested
Monday after a more than three-hour
sit-in.
Rallying to protest the firing of a
psychology professor the group voted to
regather at a dormitory instead of facing
trespassing charges in the administration
building.
The protest centers around Dr. Ber
tram Garskof, an assistant professor of
psychology, who has been fired for
what his department considered "Un
satisfactory"' teaching techniques. Stu
dents in his classes were permitted to
grade themselves.
Santa Cruz Activity
1000 students at the University of
California at Santa Cruz boycotted clas
ses today in support of naming one of
the future campus colleges after black
leader Malcolm X.
In addition the students are also ask
ing that they be given the right to select
future campus speakers without admin
istration approval.
An estimated 50 carloads of Santa
Cruz residents rolled on campus Mon
day night to support the college admin
istration and Chancellor Dean McHenry
during a rumored confrontation with
students outside his home. The confron
tation failed to come off and the resi
dents, calling themselves the "Taxpayers
for Higher Education," left quietly.
Compiled From The Associated Press
Gov. Reagan proclaimed an unprec
edented "state of extreme emergency"
Wednesday on the University of Califor
nia's troubled Berkeley campus so that
highway patrolmen can be kept there.
Reagan also proposed emergency leg
islation to keep students and faculty
convicted of campus disorders from re
turning to their schools.
"These actions will clearly indicate
that the State of California is deter
mined to exercise its responsibility to
maintain law and order on the campuses
of our university as well as all other edu
cational institutions," Reagan told a
special news conference.
"A similar situation would be met in
a similar way on another campus,"
Reagan said.
UC Officials Agreed
Reagan said his proclamation was
made with concurrence of UC officials.
Sheriff Frank Madigan of Alameda
County said Berkeley Chancellor Roger
W. Heyns "concurred that some addi
tional police action was necessary."
A student strike began two weeks
ago at Berkeley and erupted into severe
beatings Tuesday. Twenty strikers were
arrested and two officers and six non
strikers required hospital treatment.
Most of those arrested were young
white men, although the strike was
called by Negro and other non-white
students to enforce racial demands.
Picketing and Marching
Student strikers picketed and
marched around the campus in the rain
yesterday but avoided any repetition of
Tuesday's battles with police.
Two white students were arrested,
one for assault and one for obstructing a
public passageway.
About 300 strikers and sympathizers
met in the Student Union in midafter
noon. Jim Nabors, Black Students
Union leader, told them the policy was
to avoid confrontations with police.
