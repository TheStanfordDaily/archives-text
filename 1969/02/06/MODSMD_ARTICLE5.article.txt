# Opinions Vary
## Students React To BSU Demands 
### FELICITY BARRINGER 
The latest demands of the Black Stu
dents Union (BSU) have produced
widely varying reactions around the
Stanford campus. Opinions range from
the extremes of complete, uncondi
tional support of the demands to com
plete rejection, with at least one group
recommending the formation of a com
mittee to look into the issues.
Several members of the faculty of
the School of Education have issued a
statement which says, in part, that
"... the recent racial issues which have
been raised with regard to the school are
symptoms of a far more serious condi
tion ... of not having responded ade
quately to the needs of minority stu
dents." The statement also suggests,
"For purposes of addressing issues
which require extensive analysis and
planning that the Dean [H.T. Janes, of
the School of Education] appoint a rel
evant faculty committee."

Students on campus were not think
ing of the demands in terms of commit
tees, however. Discussing the issue in
volving Professor Koff, June Baldwin,
a member of the BSU, commented that
"It shouldn't have gone to the Human
Relation Commission in the first place.
They're trying to put us in a bag, pat
ting us on the head like little children so
we'll be quiet."
Another student had a different view
of the first BSU demand, which asks
that Koff be "relieved of all duties at
Stanford and that a black man replace
him as director of the STEP program."
Lucy Wheeling, a Roble resident and
member of the SDS/said, "They might
as well ask all the Stanford professors to
leave. Koff's no more racist than the
rest of them." She added that she was
"sort of skeptical of the BSU at Stan
ford." The reason she gave for this opin
ion was that "most of the members, not

the leaders, but the members, are upper
middle class Negroes."
Some Demands Justified
Jupe Barceloux, a resident of Laguan
ita, thought that the demands as far as
Koff were concerned, were justified, but
added that "He wasn't any more racist
than gross."
Another vociferous reaction to the
BSU demands came from Dan Bennett,
a junior who is a member of the Alpha
Delta Phi fraternity. Bennett stated,
"The fact that they're demanding is
bad. Stanford is a private University.
They have no right to demand." Con
cerning Prof. Koff, Bennett remarked,
"What do they want from the man? His
life's blood?"
The demands of the BSU do have
support in the Stanford community, but
the dissenting element seems to be find
ing its voice.

"For purposes of addressing issues
which require extensive analysis and
planning that the Dean [H.T. Janes, of
the School of Education] appoint a rel
evant faculty committee."

Students on campus were not think
ing of the demands in terms of commit
tees, however. Discussing the issue in
volving Professor Koff, June Baldwin,
a member of the BSU, commented that
"It shouldn't have gone to the Human
Relation Commission in the first place.
They're trying to put us in a bag, pat
ting us on the head like little children so
we'll be quiet."
Another student had a different view
of the first BSU demand, which asks
that Koff be "relieved of all duties at
Stanford and that a black man replace
him as director of the STEP program."
Lucy Wheeling, a Roble resident and
member of the SDS/said, "They might
as well ask all the Stanford professors to
leave. Koff's no more racist than the
rest of them." She added that she was
"sort of skeptical of the BSU at Stan
ford." The reason she gave for this opin
ion was that "most of the members, not

the leaders, but the members, are upper
middle class Negroes."
Some Demands Justified
Jupe Barceloux, a resident of Laguan
ita, thought that the demands as far as
Koff were concerned, were justified, but
added that "He wasn't any more racist
than gross."
Another vociferous reaction to the
BSU demands came from Dan Bennett,
a junior who is a member of the Alpha
Delta Phi fraternity. Bennett stated,
"The fact that they're demanding is
bad. Stanford is a private University.
They have no right to demand." Con
cerning Prof. Koff, Bennett remarked,
"What do they want from the man? His
life's blood?"
The demands of the BSU do have
support in the Stanford community, but
the dissenting element seems to be find
ing its voice.
The latest demands of the Black Stu
dents Union (BSU) have produced
widely varying reactions around the
Stanford campus. Opinions range from
the extremes of complete, uncondi
tional support of the demands to com
plete rejection, with at least one group
recommending the formation of a com
mittee to look into the issues.
Several members of the faculty of
the School of Education have issued a
statement which says, in part, that
"... the recent racial issues which have
been raised with regard to the school are
symptoms of a far more serious condi
tion ... of not having responded ade
quately to the needs of minority stu
dents." The statement also suggests,
"For purposes of addressing issues
which require extensive analysis and
planning that the Dean [H.T. Janes, of
the School of Education] appoint a rel
evant faculty committee."
