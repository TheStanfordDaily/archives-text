# Economist Thinks $$ Not Cure-All For Education
## 
### JENNY MATTHEWS 
Roger A. Freeman is an economist
who doesn't believe that upgrading U.S.
education rests with more economic aid.
In a series of national articles and
publications, Freeman has expounded
his belief that furthermore, student
achievement is not substantially im
proved by "additional inundations of
mOney, teachers, classrooms, and inte
gration" in America's schools.
Presently a Senior Staff member at
the Hoover Institute, Freeman concurs
with educators who feel that "student
achievement depends largely on forces
over which today's schools exercise lit
tle control"; namely, genetic factors and
environmental differences.
Interest in Education Trends
Freeman has held his present pos
ition at the Institute since 1962. Vitally
interested in today's educational trends,
he has worked on many national educa
tional programs and has participated in
a number of presidential and congres
sonal studies.
Discussing the current economic sit
uation of education, Freeman wrote in
the Wall Street Journal, July 8, 1968,
"Financial starvation of education has

often been blamed for shortcomings in
the quality of America's education.
But . . . over the past 20 years, spending
for all education multiplied nearly eight
times, to an estimated $52 billion in
1967-68, making education America's
most ebullient industry."
Yet, Freeman stated, "somehow the
tremendous increase in input does not
seem to have produced a commensurate
improvement in the quality of 'out
put'."
Disadvantaged Schools
Attempts to upgrade disadvantaged
schools such as the "landmark" 1965
School Aid Bill and programs to help
failing slum children such as New York's
"Higher Horizons," Freeman explained,
do not produce significant advances.
"Compensatory education," he
stated, "has been shown to be a 'monu
mental failure.' The main loss, however,
is not the amount of money wasted, but
the fact that it has raised the hopes and
expectations of a lot of deprived stu
dents.
"When their hopes could not be ful
filled, they became frustrated, discour
aged, beligerent, and sometimes violent.
Some educators feel that this failure, to

a large extent, has accounted for the
trouble in some of the cities. The real
failure of the compensatory education
attempt is the hostility it has created."
Equality of Education
Freeman also believes that equality
of education is not achieved souly
through racial integration of the
schools.
"There is no evidence," he stated,
"that racial mixing per se, whether by
open enrollment, bussing, or any other
plan, advances measurable achievements
of lagging children.
"It has been shown that when forced
integration has taken place in white
suburban schools, while it has not re
duced the achievement of the white stu
dents, it did not produce any substantial
improvement in achievement of under
privileged minority students."
Differences Wide in Schools
In fact, "achievement differences,"
Freeman pointed out, "are far wider
within any given school than between
the test score averages of various
schools."
If it were all the fault of disparity
between schools, he said, "the impact of
each school ought to be uniform."

Freeman, however, believes that
"the major responsibility for differences
in student achievement rests with two
factors: first, the genetic, and secondly,
the environmental situation of each
individualâ€”with some interaction be
tween the two.
Determined By Background
"A person's achievement," Freeman
emphasized, "is heavily determined by
his background and his natural ability
which both set certain limits on him."
Freeman, therefore, concludes that
"the individual's educational attainment
is unrelated to his racial back
ground . . . Desegregation, nevertheless,
is an important goal to work for . . . But
attainment is related to the student's
personal background, whether because
of heritage or environment, much more
than to the characteristics of the school
he attends."
Because of these significant and in
herent differences between individual
students, Freeman is hesitant to propose
any definite solution to educational dis
parity and believes that educators who
cling to attempts at simply upgrading
schools have "tunnel vision."

"The difference between many edu
cators and myself," Freeman added, "is
that they are willing to allocate $2-3
billion to a project which may not
work. I say let's first experiment on a
smaller scale.
"When people's hopes are raised, as
they were during attempts at compen
satory education, and these projects fail,
the resulting situation is worse than the
original one.
Freeman is also hesitant to any dog
matic, all-encompassing truisms about
such a complicated topic as the reasons
for problems in U.S. educational institu
tions.
"The most significant correlation was
found to exist between the student's
achievement test scores and socio-econ
omic level of his parents," Freeman
stated. "However, until continued re
search has reduced the existing heredity
environment uncertainty, explanations
of the close relation between parental
income and children's educational at
tainment will remain hypothetical. . . .
Unless we recognize (this)... we shall
continue the experience of the past few
years: Frustration, growing conflict,

hostility and mutual faultfinding, and
the waste of large resources."
A firm believer, on the other hand, in
allowing students to learn at their indi
vidual rates, Freeman continued that
most U.S. schools which practice
"heterogeneous grouping and automatic
annual promotion are confronting
teachers with the almost impossible task
of simultaneously educating in one
classroom three or more grade levels of
children.
"It is just as wrong not to segregate
children for educational purposes ac
cording to their measurable natural
capacity as it is to segregate them de
liberately by color of skin. And it is just
as destructive."
"Our emotional need to believe that
all children can be made equal is too
deep, and our national idealization of
the average man is too entrenched, to be
quickly replaced by an acceptance of
the notion that the range of educational
and occupational offerings must be kept
as wide as the range of human abilities.
"But until this awareness dawns, we
shall not do justice to children poorly
endowed by nature or to those who are
highly gifted."
