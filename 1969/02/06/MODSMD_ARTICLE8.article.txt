# We Like Pot
## 
### 
At Stanford we smoke pot.
In doing so, we are violating Section
11530 of California's Health and Safety
Code, the Marijuana Tax Act of 1956, regu
lations which attempt to impose on us the
moral standards of behavior held by legis
lators.
These laws are, for practical reasons, im
possible to enforce in such a way as to
stamp out marijuana, but cause a psycho
logical reign of terror on any college
campus when the level of enforcement is
stepped up.
Stanford is no sanctuary, as we have
learned from recent events. If it were, nar
cotics agents and outside police would not
be arresting people on campus.
Stanford students will continue to use
pot in disobedience of civil authorities. As

during the Prohibition era, we are more
protected from the evil which we might do
to ourselves than we want to be. The "drug
abuse" laws are considered unjust even by
many of those who enforce them.
An estimated $20 million a year is spent
in California on detection, conviction, and
imprisonment of marijuana sellers and
smokers. That money is being wasted.
Thousands of people are imprisoned
throughout America on charges resulting
from marijuana laws. Our belief is that they
should be freed and that people should be
free to use marijuana legally.
As for Stanford, the Dean of Students'
office seems to have urged all sides in this
conflict to use restraint. This is commend
able, and we urge those in the Dean's office
to continue their efforts.
