## Lay The Myths To Rest 
### Paul Rupert 
The following brief article ap
peared in Tuesday's Chronicle
under the head "A War Beyond
One Father's Understanding":
"Joe Garza, an odd-job handy
man who didn't even know what
or where Vietnam was, had
grieved over the battlefield death
of his son for six months.
" 'He was not happy because
he loved his son so much,' Ollie
Mayo, a friend, said yesterday.
'He knew there was a war but he
didn't understand it.'
"On Sunday, the 64-year-old
Garza, father of another son and
nine daughters, bought a gallon of
gasoline, poured it over himself,
lit a match and burned himself to
death."
So, in San Antonio, Texas,
thousands of miles from the Com
munist aggressors and a world
away from the academic debate
about the war and the peace talks
and the round table, a father who
understood only the agony of no
son did all he could to make peace
with the world.
Enlightened Cynicism
A victim of feeling and love
and poverty and unintelligible
myths who could not make sense
of the world and who summoned
up the courage to admit it perhaps

decided that a quick, clean death
in fire was preferable to the daily
immolation he could no longer en
dure. Certainly we will never
know.
All we are given is his life and
his tragedy—to learn from it what
we might, if we notice it. For
most of us here, our great advan
tage over Joe Garza is our ability
to put a world of myths and
symbols between us and those
deaths—to make them a little
easier by offering them up in the
national interest.
But our basic response is the
same: facing an inexplicable and
incomprehensible world, we bow
to the inevitability of such
tragedies. Ours is a more en
lightened cynicism, but a cynicism
just the same. And in the face of
what we feel and occasionally
understand to be an irrational
social order, we make an occasion
al protest and go on expecting no
response.
Most of us came here with
some idea that education and free
dom were somehow related. Try
as they might, even American high
schools couldn't convince all of us
that learning and liberation
weren't supposed to go hand-in
hand.

Even after I left Stanford and a
four-year struggle to learn in spite
of much of my formal education,
I was almost ecstatic to read on
the wall of the chapel of the Uni
versity of Chicago (my new home
for graduate school last year) the
motto: "You shall know the truth
and the truth shall make you
free." Unfortunately the motto
remained largely on the wall, and
up against it, I left.
You can imagine my surprise
to find that same bit of inspri
ation last week in the chapel of
the San Francisco County Jail in
San Bruno. While waiting to visit
Steve Weissman—who had been ar
rested for disturbing the peace at
a Humphrey demonstration last
Fall and given thirty days
(Humphrey was found not
guilty)—l looked into the prison
chapel with its steel doors and saw
a large white poster.
Truth and Education
It had the inspriational message
between an American flag and a
loudspeaker, next to the altar of
God. The quote was attributed to
Christ Jesus. I couldn't help but
feel He would be offended.
For in fact, the truth is not the
acceptable American way so
taught in the American university;
it is not a social despair and a
wretched disorder in which we
acquiesce: at root it can be no
separation of mind and body, of
thought and action built on a
body of lies, myths and half
truths.
Rather, the truth and edu
cation and the university—were
they not about the serving of
heavily vested interest here and

abroad—might intersect with
human life at the point of action.
We might come here to learn not
merely what to think, but also
what to do—the skills of the actor
and the innovator as well as those
of the scribe and consultant.
To Know Where It's At
If the truth is to have any
meaning at all, if its end is to be
the possibility of freedom, then a
discipline or a set of disciplines
that speak uncritically of this
society and of men are worthless
to men who would change their
lives and the world so that we
might cease immolating ourselves.
It is unfortunately that such a
task falls to students. We are
mostly young and inexperienced
and hardly knowledgeable. But we
understand at least the shallow ex
planations that have gone before.
We know where Vietnam is: but
we cannot yet stop it. We know
there is racism; but it continues.
In our better moments, we at
tempt to pull together a series of
speakers, or some films or a rally
or a flamboyant action to teach
ourselves and others. They are
often chaotic, dull, bad. Or excit
ing, instructive, liberating.
But there is no doubt that they
will go on, that we will grow, that
we will move the academy. For
the sake of ourselves and our
brothers, our "enemies" and the
desperate Joe Garzas of the world,
the myths must be laid to rest. We
can settle for nothing less, and
continue to call ourselves men.

The following brief article ap
peared in Tuesday's Chronicle
under the head "A War Beyond
One Father's Understanding":
"Joe Garza, an odd-job handy
man who didn't even know what
or where Vietnam was, had
grieved over the battlefield death
of his son for six months.
" 'He was not happy because
he loved his son so much,' Ollie
Mayo, a friend, said yesterday.
'He knew there was a war but he
didn't understand it.'
"On Sunday, the 64-year-old
Garza, father of another son and
nine daughters, bought a gallon of
gasoline, poured it over himself,
lit a match and burned himself to
death."
So, in San Antonio, Texas,
thousands of miles from the Com
munist aggressors and a world
away from the academic debate
about the war and the peace talks
and the round table, a father who
understood only the agony of no
son did all he could to make peace
with the world.
Enlightened Cynicism
A victim of feeling and love
and poverty and unintelligible
myths who could not make sense
of the world and who summoned
up the courage to admit it perhaps

decided that a quick, clean death
in fire was preferable to the daily
immolation he could no longer en
dure. Certainly we will never
know.
All we are given is his life and
his tragedy—to learn from it what
we might, if we notice it. For
most of us here, our great advan
tage over Joe Garza is our ability
to put a world of myths and
symbols between us and those
deaths—to make them a little
easier by offering them up in the
national interest.
But our basic response is the
same: facing an inexplicable and
incomprehensible world, we bow
to the inevitability of such
tragedies. Ours is a more en
lightened cynicism, but a cynicism
just the same. And in the face of
what we feel and occasionally
understand to be an irrational
social order, we make an occasion
al protest and go on expecting no
response.
Most of us came here with
some idea that education and free
dom were somehow related. Try
as they might, even American high
schools couldn't convince all of us
that learning and liberation
weren't supposed to go hand-in
hand.

Even after I left Stanford and a
four-year struggle to learn in spite
of much of my formal education,
I was almost ecstatic to read on
the wall of the chapel of the Uni
versity of Chicago (my new home
for graduate school last year) the
motto: "You shall know the truth
and the truth shall make you
free." Unfortunately the motto
remained largely on the wall, and
up against it, I left.
You can imagine my surprise
to find that same bit of inspri
ation last week in the chapel of
the San Francisco County Jail in
San Bruno. While waiting to visit
Steve Weissman—who had been ar
rested for disturbing the peace at
a Humphrey demonstration last
Fall and given thirty days
(Humphrey was found not
guilty)—l looked into the prison
chapel with its steel doors and saw
a large white poster.
Truth and Education
It had the inspriational message
between an American flag and a
loudspeaker, next to the altar of
God. The quote was attributed to
Christ Jesus. I couldn't help but
feel He would be offended.
For in fact, the truth is not the
acceptable American way so
taught in the American university;
it is not a social despair and a
wretched disorder in which we
acquiesce: at root it can be no
separation of mind and body, of
thought and action built on a
body of lies, myths and half
truths.
Rather, the truth and edu
cation and the university—were
they not about the serving of
heavily vested interest here and

abroad—might intersect with
human life at the point of action.
We might come here to learn not
merely what to think, but also
what to do—the skills of the actor
and the innovator as well as those
of the scribe and consultant.
To Know Where It's At
If the truth is to have any
meaning at all, if its end is to be
the possibility of freedom, then a
discipline or a set of disciplines
that speak uncritically of this
society and of men are worthless
to men who would change their
lives and the world so that we
might cease immolating ourselves.
It is unfortunately that such a
task falls to students. We are
mostly young and inexperienced
and hardly knowledgeable. But we
understand at least the shallow ex
planations that have gone before.
We know where Vietnam is: but
we cannot yet stop it. We know
there is racism; but it continues.
In our better moments, we at
tempt to pull together a series of
speakers, or some films or a rally
or a flamboyant action to teach
ourselves and others. They are
often chaotic, dull, bad. Or excit
ing, instructive, liberating.

that speak uncritically of this
society and of men are worthless
to men who would change their
lives and the world so that we
might cease immolating ourselves.
It is unfortunately that such a
task falls to students. We are
mostly young and inexperienced
and hardly knowledgeable. But we
understand at least the shallow ex
planations that have gone before.
We know where Vietnam is: but
we cannot yet stop it. We know
there is racism; but it continues.
In our better moments, we at
tempt to pull together a series of
speakers, or some films or a rally
or a flamboyant action to teach
ourselves and others. They are
often chaotic, dull, bad. Or excit
ing, instructive, liberating.
But there is no doubt that they
will go on, that we will grow, that
we will move the academy. For
the sake of ourselves and our
brothers, our "enemies" and the
desperate Joe Garzas of the world,
the myths must be laid to rest. We
can settle for nothing less, and
continue to call ourselves men.

The following brief article ap
peared in Tuesday's Chronicle
under the head "A War Beyond
One Father's Understanding":
"Joe Garza, an odd-job handy
man who didn't even know what
or where Vietnam was, had
grieved over the battlefield death
of his son for six months.
" 'He was not happy because
he loved his son so much,' Ollie
Mayo, a friend, said yesterday.
'He knew there was a war but he
didn't understand it.'
"On Sunday, the 64-year-old
Garza, father of another son and
nine daughters, bought a gallon of
gasoline, poured it over himself,
lit a match and burned himself to
death."
So, in San Antonio, Texas,
thousands of miles from the Com
munist aggressors and a world
away from the academic debate
about the war and the peace talks
and the round table, a father who
understood only the agony of no
son did all he could to make peace
with the world.
Enlightened Cynicism
A victim of feeling and love
and poverty and unintelligible
myths who could not make sense
of the world and who summoned
up the courage to admit it perhaps

decided that a quick, clean death
in fire was preferable to the daily
immolation he could no longer en
dure. Certainly we will never
know.
All we are given is his life and
his tragedy—to learn from it what
we might, if we notice it. For
most of us here, our great advan
tage over Joe Garza is our ability
to put a world of myths and
symbols between us and those
deaths—to make them a little
easier by offering them up in the
national interest.
But our basic response is the
same: facing an inexplicable and
incomprehensible world, we bow
to the inevitability of such
tragedies. Ours is a more en
lightened cynicism, but a cynicism
just the same. And in the face of
what we feel and occasionally
understand to be an irrational
social order, we make an occasion
al protest and go on expecting no
response.
Most of us came here with
some idea that education and free
dom were somehow related. Try
as they might, even American high
schools couldn't convince all of us
that learning and liberation
weren't supposed to go hand-in
hand.

Even after I left Stanford and a
four-year struggle to learn in spite
of much of my formal education,
I was almost ecstatic to read on
the wall of the chapel of the Uni
versity of Chicago (my new home
for graduate school last year) the
motto: "You shall know the truth
and the truth shall make you
free." Unfortunately the motto
remained largely on the wall, and
up against it, I left.
You can imagine my surprise
to find that same bit of inspri
ation last week in the chapel of
the San Francisco County Jail in
San Bruno. While waiting to visit
Steve Weissman—who had been ar
rested for disturbing the peace at
a Humphrey demonstration last
Fall and given thirty days
(Humphrey was found not
guilty)—l looked into the prison
chapel with its steel doors and saw
a large white poster.
Truth and Education
It had the inspriational message
between an American flag and a
loudspeaker, next to the altar of
God. The quote was attributed to
Christ Jesus. I couldn't help but
feel He would be offended.
For in fact, the truth is not the
acceptable American way so
taught in the American university;
it is not a social despair and a
wretched disorder in which we
acquiesce: at root it can be no
separation of mind and body, of
thought and action built on a
body of lies, myths and half
truths.
Rather, the truth and edu
cation and the university—were
they not about the serving of
heavily vested interest here and

abroad—might intersect with
human life at the point of action.
We might come here to learn not
merely what to think, but also
what to do—the skills of the actor
and the innovator as well as those
of the scribe and consultant.
To Know Where It's At
If the truth is to have any
meaning at all, if its end is to be
the possibility of freedom, then a
discipline or a set of disciplines
that speak uncritically of this
society and of men are worthless
to men who would change their
lives and the world so that we
might cease immolating ourselves.
