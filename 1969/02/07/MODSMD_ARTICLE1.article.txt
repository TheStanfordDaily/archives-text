# Grad Admissions Criteria 'Biased'
## 
### WILLIAM BANKS 
Current graduate school methods for
the recruitment of minority students ad
mit the cream of the crop but do not, as
originally designed, admit the poten
tially capable disadvantaged student.
This was the consensus of a six mem
ber panel sponsored by the Graduate
Student Association. They felt tra
ditional admission standards are not ap
plicable to the minority recruitment
program because test scores and grades
do not indicate ability of the minority
student.
The panel members were Assistant
Provost James Simmons, Graduate stu
dents Sylvia Lemus and Frank Satter
white, Nathaniel Pugh, Assistant Direc
tor of Business School Admissions, and
Dr. Jose Aguilar of Stanford Medical
center.
The panelists agreed that minority
student admission should be based on
interviews. The applicant, they said,
should be interviewed by members of
their own minority group because white
administrators are unable to establish
the needed rapport.
Miss Lemus, speaking on the behalf
of Mexican-American students offered a
set of proposals for admissions criteria
at the School of Education. The pro
posals included the hiring of a Mexican-
American professor to teach on the
graduate level, the admission of a
Mexican-American to Ph.D. programs
and the creation of courses to deal with
Mexican-American culture and prob
lems.
Miss Lemus concluded saying that
the need for such programs is acute. "I
hate to be pessimistic", she said, "but I
am."
Aguilar said that present minor
ity admissions policy accept the aca
demically superior minority student and
ignores the "disenfranchised" student
who needs the education more. He con
tinued saying that those with the higher
grades are usually financially secure and
therefore are not in need of a special
program.
Commenting on this, Satterwhite
said,"Admissions tests tell you what he
has accomplished but not what he will
accomplish."
Also refuting the grade criterion for
admissions, Pugh said that leadership
potential and maturity are major factors
in business management.
Such qualities, he pointed out, are
beyond the measure of grade point
averages, and can only be recognized
through interviews.
Simmons added that minority admis
sions, although a shared university con
cern, is often handled through the indi
vidual departments. He urged the cen
tralization of minority admissions pro
cedures emphasizing that it is still unfair
to subject disadvantaged minority stu
dents to white admission standards.

"Reform of admission criteria is abso
lutely essential," he said.
New admissions procedures alone are
not enough, the panel agreed. Recruit
ment must involve more minority ad
ministrators going out in search of can
didates. White recruiters, it was felt,
could not have as good an effect on po
tential students as the "black or brown"
interviewer.
Satterwhite mentioned that a good
deal of recruiting has been done in the
past by members of the Black Student
Union. He said however, that the stu
dents should not be responsible for this
work. "If black students take all their
time recruiting, how are they going to
study?"
"Once blacks are here" Puch asked
of the predominat« ly white audience
"Do you ever meet them? Will you be
able to see their value once we've
gone?"

tially capable disadvantaged student.
This was the consensus of a six mem
ber panel sponsored by the Graduate
Student Association. They felt tra
ditional admission standards are not ap
plicable to the minority recruitment
program because test scores and grades
do not indicate ability of the minority
student.
The panel members were Assistant
Provost James Simmons, Graduate stu
dents Sylvia Lemus and Frank Satter
white, Nathaniel Pugh, Assistant Direc
tor of Business School Admissions, and
Dr. Jose Aguilar of Stanford Medical
center.
The panelists agreed that minority
student admission should be based on
interviews. The applicant, they said,
should be interviewed by members of
their own minority group because white
administrators are unable to establish
the needed rapport.
Miss Lemus, speaking on the behalf
of Mexican-American students offered a
set of proposals for admissions criteria
at the School of Education. The pro
posals included the hiring of a Mexican-
American professor to teach on the
graduate level, the admission of a
Mexican-American to Ph.D. programs
and the creation of courses to deal with
Mexican-American culture and prob
lems.
Miss Lemus concluded saying that
the need for such programs is acute. "I
hate to be pessimistic", she said, "but I
am."
Aguilar said that present minor
ity admissions policy accept the aca
demically superior minority student and
ignores the "disenfranchised" student
who needs the education more. He con
tinued saying that those with the higher
grades are usually financially secure and
therefore are not in need of a special
program.
Commenting on this, Satterwhite
said,"Admissions tests tell you what he
has accomplished but not what he will
accomplish."
Also refuting the grade criterion for
admissions, Pugh said that leadership
potential and maturity are major factors
in business management.
Such qualities, he pointed out, are
beyond the measure of grade point
averages, and can only be recognized
through interviews.
Simmons added that minority admis
sions, although a shared university con
cern, is often handled through the indi
vidual departments. He urged the cen
tralization of minority admissions pro
cedures emphasizing that it is still unfair
to subject disadvantaged minority stu
dents to white admission standards.

"Reform of admission criteria is abso
lutely essential," he said.
New admissions procedures alone are
not enough, the panel agreed. Recruit
ment must involve more minority ad
ministrators going out in search of can
didates. White recruiters, it was felt,
could not have as good an effect on po
tential students as the "black or brown"
interviewer.
Satterwhite mentioned that a good
deal of recruiting has been done in the
past by members of the Black Student
Union. He said however, that the stu
dents should not be responsible for this
work. "If black students take all their
time recruiting, how are they going to
study?"
"Once blacks are here" Puch asked
of the predominat« ly white audience
"Do you ever meet them? Will you be
able to see their value once we've
gone?"
Current graduate school methods for
the recruitment of minority students ad
mit the cream of the crop but do not, as
originally designed, admit the poten
tially capable disadvantaged student.
