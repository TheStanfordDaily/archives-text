Do graduate students have a
right to a I-S deferment provided
they have not received a 11-S an an
undergraduate since June 30,
1967? A decision by a Federal
Court, filed in Austin, Texas on
January 27, 1969 indicated that
they do. This is a decision which
conceivably could affect several
hundred graduate students now at
Stanford.
Albert Armendariz, Jr., a
second year law student at the
University of Texas, held a 11-S
graduate deferment during the
1967 school year. During the
Autumn of 1968, as a second year
graduate student, he was reclassi
fied I-A, given an Armed Forces
Physical examination, . then
ordered for induction.
He requested an I-S from his
local board was was denied on the
basis of Local Board Memoran
dum 87 which rules that any
graduate student who has received
a 11-S deferment of any kind since
July 1, 1967, may not be given a
I-S deferment.
Armendariz appealed this de
cision, was denied, and took his
case to both the State and
National Director without success.
Only then did he ask for a court
injunction on his induction order
on the grounds that he had a
statutory right to a I-S, and that

%/
Local Board Memorandum 87
conflicts with the statute itself.
The Military Selective Service Act
of 1967, in contrast to LBM 87,
excepts from the I-S only those
students who subsequently receive
11-S deferments as undergraduates.
In granting the injunction,
Judge Roberts rules that "the
rights claimed by the Petitioner to
a I-S deferment to finish out the
academic year in which he is now
engaged is a plain, unequivocal
right given to him by statute . .
Suit was brought by Armen
dariz on behalf of all other gradu
ate students, as well as for him
self. However, Judge Roberts
ruled that the injunction applied
to Armendariz alone and not to
other graduate students, "except
insofar as it may by necessity
effect that result". It could
"effect that result" when other
students bring similar suits and
cite Judge Robert's decision.
Present Selective Service regu
lations and policy, while permit
ting the local board to postpone
induction for graduate students in
such situations until the end of a
student's current term, does not
allow a I-S deferment.
Postponement may be for a
shorter period than a I-S and does

not require the local board to re
open the registrant's classification
at the end of the academic year,
with all attendant appeal rights, as
would be the case with a I-S defer
ment.
The Justice Department has
sixty days in which to appeal the
Armendariz decision. A spokes
man for the Department said in
Washington on January 31 that no
decision has been made about an
appeal.
In summary, this decision
would seem to apply clearly to
students in the same situation as
Armendariz, that is second year
graduate students who 1) have re
ceived 11-S deferments for grad
uate work only since July 1,
1967, 2) have been issued an in
duction order, 3) have requested a
I-S classification, and 4) upon de
nial have exhausted all avenues of
appeal open to them within the
Selective Service System.
For the moment, however, it
appears to be the policy of Selec
tive Service to enforce Local
Board Memorandum 87, thus re
quiring the registrant to seek a
court injunction to obtain his
right to a I-S classification.

He requested an I-S from his
local board was was denied on the
basis of Local Board Memoran
dum 87 which rules that any
graduate student who has received
a 11-S deferment of any kind since
July 1, 1967, may not be given a
I-S deferment.
Armendariz appealed this de
cision, was denied, and took his
case to both the State and
National Director without success.
Only then did he ask for a court
injunction on his induction order
on the grounds that he had a
statutory right to a I-S, and that

%/
Local Board Memorandum 87
conflicts with the statute itself.
The Military Selective Service Act
of 1967, in contrast to LBM 87,
excepts from the I-S only those
students who subsequently receive
11-S deferments as undergraduates.
In granting the injunction,
Judge Roberts rules that "the
rights claimed by the Petitioner to
a I-S deferment to finish out the
academic year in which he is now
engaged is a plain, unequivocal
right given to him by statute . .
Suit was brought by Armen
dariz on behalf of all other gradu
ate students, as well as for him
self. However, Judge Roberts
ruled that the injunction applied
to Armendariz alone and not to
other graduate students, "except
insofar as it may by necessity
effect that result". It could
"effect that result" when other
students bring similar suits and
cite Judge Robert's decision.
Present Selective Service regu
lations and policy, while permit
ting the local board to postpone
induction for graduate students in
such situations until the end of a
student's current term, does not
allow a I-S deferment.
Postponement may be for a
shorter period than a I-S and does

not require the local board to re
open the registrant's classification
at the end of the academic year,
with all attendant appeal rights, as
would be the case with a I-S defer
ment.
The Justice Department has
sixty days in which to appeal the
Armendariz decision. A spokes
man for the Department said in
Washington on January 31 that no
decision has been made about an
appeal.
In summary, this decision
would seem to apply clearly to
students in the same situation as
Armendariz, that is second year
graduate students who 1) have re
ceived 11-S deferments for grad
uate work only since July 1,
1967, 2) have been issued an in
duction order, 3) have requested a
I-S classification, and 4) upon de
nial have exhausted all avenues of
appeal open to them within the
Selective Service System.
For the moment, however, it
appears to be the policy of Selec
tive Service to enforce Local
Board Memorandum 87, thus re
quiring the registrant to seek a
court injunction to obtain his
right to a I-S classification.
