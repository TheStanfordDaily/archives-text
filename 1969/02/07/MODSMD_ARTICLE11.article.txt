## UCM-Radical Sponsorship Explained 
### 
Editor, THE DAILY
Some members of the campus
community have asked why the
University Christian Movement is
co-sponsoring a series of dis
cussions of the contemporary
radical analysis of our society.
Realizing that the reasons for this
action may not be self-evident I
would like to offer this explana
tion of our involvement.
We are moved to participation
in this series out of several con
victions about the nature of the
Christian faith, its relation to the
structures of our society, and cur
rent events within our campus
community.
The first conviction is that the
Christian faith is not merely a per
sonal individualistic experience,
but impels persons to a concern
for and involvement in thestruggle
to make more human the struc
tures of society. In this sense the
Christian faith is deeply human
istic. It affirms the sacredness of
man's humanity and his common
life. While the Christian faith pro
vides this perspective and this im
perative, it does not provide a
specific system of social, political,

and economic analysis. Therefore,
Christians, in company with all
other concerned persons, must
constantly be engaged in forging
such an analysis out of the best
thought available to them.
A second conviction that moti
vated us is that the social, politi
cal, and economic analysis that is
the basis for contemporary radical
thought and action must be given
serious consideration. The radical
movement is an important force
in our time and we must look
carefully both for the insights it
may offer into the human con
dition and for the criticisms of its
shortcomings that may need to be
made. We of the UCM realize that
we are woefully uninformed in
this regard and believe that many
in our community share this prob
lem with us. Therefore we want to
hear and help make available to
others the best possible statement
of this analytical position.
Our third conviction is that the
issues in the life of our university
that are being brought to our at
tention by radical students and
others are too important to be
lost in disagreement over methods

of confrontation. We hope that
this series will be a contribution
to dialogue, encounter, and
creative change on campus.
For these reasons we encourage
persons of all religious, political,
and economic persuasions to par
ticipate in this series of dis
cussions to the end of making
them as creative and useful as pos
sible.

â€¢ Exhibition Clarified
Editor, THE DAILY:
I am quite honored that the
news about my exhibition found
its way into The Daily one week
after the show opened in Tre
sidder and a weekend after an
article about it came out in the
Palo Alto Times, a much better
article by the way, you really
should read the Palo Alto Times.
I have received several inquiries
today about how to obtain high
magnifications of crystals. To

clarify the process, I had to write
a correction to your article.
First of all, I am an Optical
Microscopist at the Center for
Materials Research at Stanford.
You got that switched around a
little.
I realize that a paper like THE
cannot afford a big tech
nical staff, therefore, I looked up
the definition of 'photomicro
graph' in Webster's Dictionary for
you. I quote: "micrograph: a
graphic reproduction of the image
of an object formed by a micro
scope." "Photomicrograph: a
photograph of a magnified image
of a small object." Just in case
you do not know what a micro
scope is, Webster's Dictionary
says: "an optical instrument con
sisting of a lens or combination of
lenses for making enlarged images
of minute objects."
These enlarged images, which
are recorded on photographic
film, are then printed on photo
sensitive paper. You see, it is not
quite as simple as you put it.
