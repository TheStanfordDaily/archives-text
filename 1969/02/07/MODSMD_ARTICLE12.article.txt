# Radical Middle
## Grass 
### Judy Sloss 
Yeah there have been all these
pot busts. And everybody's up
tight and indignant and scared; in
dignant and scared enough to talk
about "action". Meaning to de
mand that Pitzer get the cops off
our campus.
Well, it's understandable
enough. The laws are unjust; we're
not doing ourselves or anyone else
any harm; what right have the
cops got to be here anyway, and
why can't they leave us alone?
But what are we really asking
for? That the laws be changed, of
course. But how many of us have
ever spent even half an hour doing
any kind of constructive lobbying
or picketing or writing-letters-to-
Congressmen for the cause of
legalized grass?
Basically, we don't give a damn
about changing the laws, as long
as the cops leave us alone. What
we want is that Stanford be a
special case; that we be protected.
In other words, we want Stanford
to remain the privileged upper
middle-class sanctuary it's alwavs
been.
Last year, a lot of people were
talking about in loco parentis. The
argument, over and over, was that

we're adults; we don't need the
guiding hand of university
parental authority; we don't need
special rules and restraints; and
we'll deal with society ourselves,
with no paternalistic intervention,
thank you.
But how does all this square
with our asking President Pitzer to
interpose himself bodily between
us and the civil authorities? How
does it fit with our asking Stan
ford University to take upon itself
responsibility for our personal de
cisions to break what we as indivi
duals feel is a stupid and useless
law?
We tend to classify as hy
pocrites those people who use the
privileges accorded to money and
status to evade the law. We say it's
unjust that an East Palo Alto kid
who is caught stealing may end up
in jail, while an Atherton kid may
get a fatherly reprimand for the
same offense.
Please, let's not go in for the
same kind of hypocrisy. A lot of
people out there get busted who
don't have Papa Stanford to front
for them.
By all means, let's have politi
cal action. If arrests are made il
legally, fight them. If there was
police brutality, expose it. If the
laws are archaic and unfair, let's
work to get them changed as soon
as possible. But don't ask Stan
ford to do the work that we're
too damn lazy to do ourselves.
And for God's sake, let's not
turn this thing into a simple cops
off-campus crusade, or ask that
Stanford save us from the conse
quences of our own actions. To
do so would be to perpetuate ex
actly the sort of middle-class,
self-centered, childish hypocrisy
we pretend to despise.
