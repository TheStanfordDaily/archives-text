# Guest Column
## The 						New Coalition? 
### Dick Simmermacher 
A few days ago El Cuadro
eating club was visited by S.D.S.
member Jeff Stevens. During
lunch Stevens led a discussion on
war, South-East Asia, and the
present power structure at Stan
ford.
In addition to presenting the
S.D.S. point of view on these
topics, Stevens said some things
that I was initially shocked, yet
very pleased, to hear. He contin
ually emphasized that the purpose
of his coming was to hear what
other members of the Stanford
community felt about the issues
which S.D.S. has so vociferously
spoken out upon.
He indicated that his group has
come to realize that a handful of
people disrupting certain campus
routines is accomplishing very lit
tle in terms of forcing an end to
the Vietnam War, or toward
mobilizing student power on cam
pus.
He showed an apparently
strong desire to get together with
all who were sympathetic with
S.D.S.'s major concerns of the
present— Vietnam, Stanford's role
in world affairs, and the creation
of a more democratic university.
He did not ask that we accept

S.D.S.'s political philosophy, or
entertain its members' world
views, as a precondition for dis
cussion.
Instead, he explained that he
would like to arrive at a set of
desired goals, and means for
reaching these goals, which a large
enough number of people on cam
pus can unite behind to create an
effective political force.
This does not mean that
S.D.S.'ers or anyone else must re
linquish their long-range political
viewpoints. It does mean that
both S.D.S., and others similarly
concerned with the above men
tioned issues, will seek to com
promise on tactics for the purpose
of achieving common goals.
If Jeff Stevens is representative
of S.D.S. as a whole, this attitude
marks a significant change in the
group's approach. S.D.S. may be
taking stock of political realities
and developing into a more
mature, effective political force.
For every S.D.S.'er, I'm con
vinced that there are at least 10
others on campus who also op
pose the War, oppose Stanford's
involvement in it, and would en
joy seeing this school made into a
more democratic institution. Yet

these others, and I am one, cannot
get roused up over such ridicu
lous, futile tactics as we frequent
ly see S.D.S. using. Yes, they get
attention, and cause people to
think, but what else do they ac
complish?
Yet, while liberals can't get
worked up over S.D.S., we have
taken no initiative ourselves. We
have remained silent, and thus
done nothing to effect change.
For all our thinking and bleeding
hearts, we are about as influential
as a ladies' bridge club.
With S.D.S. offering the initial
impetus by calling on liberals to
join them in the pursuit of speci
fic goals, I believe that a sorrow
fully dormant force can wake up
to the fact that it has a vast
amount of potential influence
within its grasp.
Together, I think that a radical
liberal coalition could swell to
great enough numbers to make
whatever tactics it decided upon
more successful in achieving com
mon ends than any which S.D.S.
alone has yet tried.

A few days ago El Cuadro
eating club was visited by S.D.S.
member Jeff Stevens. During
lunch Stevens led a discussion on
war, South-East Asia, and the
present power structure at Stan
ford.
In addition to presenting the
S.D.S. point of view on these
topics, Stevens said some things
that I was initially shocked, yet
very pleased, to hear. He contin
ually emphasized that the purpose
of his coming was to hear what
other members of the Stanford
community felt about the issues
which S.D.S. has so vociferously
spoken out upon.
He indicated that his group has
come to realize that a handful of
people disrupting certain campus
routines is accomplishing very lit
tle in terms of forcing an end to
the Vietnam War, or toward
mobilizing student power on cam
pus.
He showed an apparently
strong desire to get together with
all who were sympathetic with
S.D.S.'s major concerns of the
present— Vietnam, Stanford's role
in world affairs, and the creation
of a more democratic university.
He did not ask that we accept

S.D.S.'s political philosophy, or
entertain its members' world
views, as a precondition for dis
cussion.
Instead, he explained that he
would like to arrive at a set of
desired goals, and means for
reaching these goals, which a large
enough number of people on cam
pus can unite behind to create an
effective political force.
This does not mean that
S.D.S.'ers or anyone else must re
linquish their long-range political
viewpoints. It does mean that
both S.D.S., and others similarly
concerned with the above men
tioned issues, will seek to com
promise on tactics for the purpose
of achieving common goals.
If Jeff Stevens is representative
of S.D.S. as a whole, this attitude
marks a significant change in the
group's approach. S.D.S. may be
taking stock of political realities
and developing into a more
mature, effective political force.
For every S.D.S.'er, I'm con
vinced that there are at least 10
others on campus who also op
pose the War, oppose Stanford's
involvement in it, and would en
joy seeing this school made into a
more democratic institution. Yet

these others, and I am one, cannot
get roused up over such ridicu
lous, futile tactics as we frequent
ly see S.D.S. using. Yes, they get
attention, and cause people to
think, but what else do they ac
complish?
Yet, while liberals can't get
worked up over S.D.S., we have
taken no initiative ourselves. We
have remained silent, and thus
done nothing to effect change.
For all our thinking and bleeding
hearts, we are about as influential
as a ladies' bridge club.
With S.D.S. offering the initial
impetus by calling on liberals to
join them in the pursuit of speci
fic goals, I believe that a sorrow
fully dormant force can wake up
to the fact that it has a vast
amount of potential influence
within its grasp.
Together, I think that a radical
liberal coalition could swell to
great enough numbers to make
whatever tactics it decided upon
more successful in achieving com
mon ends than any which S.D.S.
alone has yet tried.
