## Whitey's 'Real' Response 
### Bradley Efron 
The times are indeed "a-chang
ing" at Stanford. It wasn't long
ago that the afternoon tables at
Tresidder were populated with
well-known campus beauties and
their hopeful coffee dates from
fraternity row. The latter wore
the perpetual nervous smiles of
men trying to impress women far
too desirable to even hope for.
Nowadays the nervous smiles
are on the faces of those few
Whites fortunate enough to be
sharing the "Black Tables" at
Tresidder. As for the Blacks, they
exhibit the cool self-confidence of
their predecessors, for like them
they know that they monopolize
a precious commodity: freedom
from the accusation of "racism."
I do not think that the White

community at Stanford has been
honest in its response to the Black
demands of the past two weeks.
In place of honest attention and
response, we have treated them
with the ginger indulgence usually
reserved for "nervous" children
who may be expected to throw a
tantrum at any moment.
This is just another form of
patronage, and is as basically
odious as "of those happy colored
folk —they just laugh and sing all
day." One need only compare the
treatment of the BSU which the
SDS has received in the letters
column of the Daily to realize
that something is seriously ham
pering the free flow of opinion.
And so, BSU members, here's
what is really going through this
Whitey's mind as he peddles his
bicycle to school in the morning:
first of all your prose is the "god
damndest" mixture of H. Rap
Brown and vintage Joe McCarthy
that has ever been written. No
doubt "cultural imperialism and
cultural castration" could mean
something given the proper cir
cumstances, but it is just so much
verbal masturbation when applied
to the current Stanford situation.
This tone of arrogant self-pity
is genuinely obnoxious. Careful
language isn't important when
people basically understand each
other, but that is not the situation
we have here. I am particularly

distressed about the language bar
rier when, after wading through
your bluster, I find that your de
mands are, for the most part,
quite modest.
Now to the subject of Soul,
which according to Leo Bazile
you use in place of reason, logic,
and rationale. You are not the
first group of students to hold to
the conceit that one can play the
university game, and get the uni
versity stamp of approval (the
degree), without at least tasting
that dryness of the soul which ac
companies a forced feeding of the
intellect. Your immediate prede
cessors are the radical activists,
and before them the drugheads,
and before them the "frat-rats"
(who, I think, came the closest of
all to emerging from Stanford as
unspoiled as they entered.)
Whatever Soul is, I'm pretty
sure Stanford doesn't have it, and
you might as well curse the desert
for being dry. These pastoral fan
tasies are dangerous when applied
in an inappropriate real environ
ment.
Mr. Koff didn't set any records
for sensitivity in his interview of
Miss Stevenson, but you were
several steps below him in issuing
your public denunciation. Given
the present situation, you have
jeopardized the man's career, and
if your gut response is "tough
shit," then I would worry a little

bit about who is playing racist this
week.
Demands Well-Founded
Well now, I feel much better.
Basically, BSU, I think your de
mands for more Blacks at every
level of the Stanford community
are well-founded. (I know that I
would not want to be one of only
250 Whites in a school of 12,000
Blacks.)
And so, as they say, more
(Black) power to you. But, on the
other hand, do you really want to
become part of a totally Black
sub-university that just happens to
share a name and some buildings
with White Stanford? And is it
really necessary to squander your
legitimate moral authority on san
itary napkins and "hidden rac
ism"? Your proposal for an organ
ized and recognized BSU project
in East Palo Alto (if I read de
mand 6 correctly) is far more im
pressive than reams of rhetoric on
the inherent racism of Stanford U.
Finally, I hope that this does
not win me the coveted title of
"campus redneck." If there is
such a thing as hidden racism at
Stanford, I think it lies in the re
fusal of Whites and Blacks to re
spond honestly to one another,
with anger or with pleasure as the
situation demands.

mands for more Blacks at every
level of the Stanford community
are well-founded. (I know that I
would not want to be one of only
250 Whites in a school of 12,000
Blacks.)
And so, as they say, more
(Black) power to you. But, on the
other hand, do you really want to
become part of a totally Black
sub-university that just happens to
share a name and some buildings
with White Stanford? And is it
really necessary to squander your
legitimate moral authority on san
itary napkins and "hidden rac
ism"? Your proposal for an organ
ized and recognized BSU project
in East Palo Alto (if I read de
mand 6 correctly) is far more im
pressive than reams of rhetoric on
the inherent racism of Stanford U.
Finally, I hope that this does
not win me the coveted title of
"campus redneck." If there is
such a thing as hidden racism at
Stanford, I think it lies in the re
fusal of Whites and Blacks to re
spond honestly to one another,
with anger or with pleasure as the
situation demands.

The times are indeed "a-chang
ing" at Stanford. It wasn't long
ago that the afternoon tables at
Tresidder were populated with
well-known campus beauties and
their hopeful coffee dates from
fraternity row. The latter wore
the perpetual nervous smiles of
men trying to impress women far
too desirable to even hope for.
Nowadays the nervous smiles
are on the faces of those few
Whites fortunate enough to be
sharing the "Black Tables" at
Tresidder. As for the Blacks, they
exhibit the cool self-confidence of
their predecessors, for like them
they know that they monopolize
a precious commodity: freedom
from the accusation of "racism."
I do not think that the White

community at Stanford has been
honest in its response to the Black
demands of the past two weeks.
In place of honest attention and
response, we have treated them
with the ginger indulgence usually
reserved for "nervous" children
who may be expected to throw a
tantrum at any moment.
This is just another form of
patronage, and is as basically
odious as "of those happy colored
folk —they just laugh and sing all
day." One need only compare the
treatment of the BSU which the
SDS has received in the letters
column of the Daily to realize
that something is seriously ham
pering the free flow of opinion.
And so, BSU members, here's
what is really going through this
Whitey's mind as he peddles his
bicycle to school in the morning:
first of all your prose is the "god
damndest" mixture of H. Rap
Brown and vintage Joe McCarthy
that has ever been written. No
doubt "cultural imperialism and
cultural castration" could mean
something given the proper cir
cumstances, but it is just so much
verbal masturbation when applied
to the current Stanford situation.
This tone of arrogant self-pity
is genuinely obnoxious. Careful
language isn't important when
people basically understand each
other, but that is not the situation
we have here. I am particularly

distressed about the language bar
rier when, after wading through
your bluster, I find that your de
mands are, for the most part,
quite modest.
Now to the subject of Soul,
which according to Leo Bazile
you use in place of reason, logic,
and rationale. You are not the
first group of students to hold to
the conceit that one can play the
university game, and get the uni
versity stamp of approval (the
degree), without at least tasting
that dryness of the soul which ac
companies a forced feeding of the
intellect. Your immediate prede
cessors are the radical activists,
and before them the drugheads,
and before them the "frat-rats"
(who, I think, came the closest of
all to emerging from Stanford as
unspoiled as they entered.)
Whatever Soul is, I'm pretty
sure Stanford doesn't have it, and
you might as well curse the desert
for being dry. These pastoral fan
tasies are dangerous when applied
in an inappropriate real environ
ment.
Mr. Koff didn't set any records
for sensitivity in his interview of
Miss Stevenson, but you were
several steps below him in issuing
your public denunciation. Given
the present situation, you have
jeopardized the man's career, and
if your gut response is "tough
shit," then I would worry a little

bit about who is playing racist this
week.

and rationale. You are not the
first group of students to hold to
the conceit that one can play the
university game, and get the uni
versity stamp of approval (the
degree), without at least tasting
that dryness of the soul which ac
companies a forced feeding of the
intellect. Your immediate prede
cessors are the radical activists,
and before them the drugheads,
and before them the "frat-rats"
(who, I think, came the closest of
all to emerging from Stanford as
unspoiled as they entered.)
Whatever Soul is, I'm pretty
sure Stanford doesn't have it, and
you might as well curse the desert
for being dry. These pastoral fan
tasies are dangerous when applied
in an inappropriate real environ
ment.
Mr. Koff didn't set any records
for sensitivity in his interview of
Miss Stevenson, but you were
several steps below him in issuing
your public denunciation. Given
the present situation, you have
jeopardized the man's career, and
if your gut response is "tough
shit," then I would worry a little

bit about who is playing racist this
week.
Demands Well-Founded
Well now, I feel much better.
Basically, BSU, I think your de
mands for more Blacks at every
level of the Stanford community
are well-founded. (I know that I
would not want to be one of only
250 Whites in a school of 12,000
Blacks.)
And so, as they say, more
(Black) power to you. But, on the
other hand, do you really want to
become part of a totally Black
sub-university that just happens to
share a name and some buildings
with White Stanford? And is it
really necessary to squander your
legitimate moral authority on san
itary napkins and "hidden rac
ism"? Your proposal for an organ
ized and recognized BSU project
in East Palo Alto (if I read de
mand 6 correctly) is far more im
pressive than reams of rhetoric on
the inherent racism of Stanford U.
Finally, I hope that this does
not win me the coveted title of
"campus redneck." If there is
such a thing as hidden racism at
Stanford, I think it lies in the re
fusal of Whites and Blacks to re
spond honestly to one another,
with anger or with pleasure as the
situation demands.
