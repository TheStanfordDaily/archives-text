## Mom Gets Serious Problem 
### Cissie Bonini 
Dear Mom,
I really enjoy your column in
the Daily. Everything else in there
is too serious. Why must so much
attention be given to being pertin
ent?

Dear Kenneth,
I agree, dear. But some people
get angry when the students are
impertinent! You just can't please

everyone. I'm glad you brought
up The Daily, as I think there are
many things wrong such as (Edi

been lost.)
Dear Mom,
I gained a lot of weight over
Christmas and I need a quick re
ducing diet. Have you any sugges
tions?

Dear Chubby,
The fastest weight-loss I know
of was a friend who lost thirty
pounds over-night. But she had a
leg amputated, which you are
probably reluctant to do.
Of course, there are always fad
diets such as the one in which you
eat only the containers in which
your favorite foods are packed.
Anyway, good luck, dear. Some
day we must pull up three or four
chairs and discuss this further.
Lovingly,
M om
