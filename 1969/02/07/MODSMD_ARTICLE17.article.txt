# Testing Center
## Counselors See Students Changing 
### SUSAN SWARD 
The student with boyfriend
girlfriend, roommate, vocational
or parental problems may end up
on the third floor of the Old
Union—asking the secretary at the
Counseling and Testing Center for
an appointment with a counselor.
As one of the counselors at
C&T phrased it, "We are so broad
from our point of view, and we
are often so narrowly perceived."
John D. Black, who has di
rected the Center since its incep
tion in 1950, heads a staff of 10
psychologists— not all of whom
are full-time. The staff handles
problems which range from voca
tional choice to personal relation
ships.
"Over the years we've handled
about 45 percent 'of the under
graduates at one time or another,"
said Black.
According to Black and to
Marion Bairos and Guy Browning,
counselors at the Center, the face
of the Stanford student body does

change over the years in ways that
can be recognized.
"Between the class that en
tered in 1966 and the entering
class this year," noted Black,
"There has been an enormous in
crease in those who say they're
vocationally undecided.
Life Philosophy
"Today the objective consid
ered essential is to find a philoso
phy of life. One possible interpre
tation of this finding is that stu
dents are attaching greater
importance to humanistic goals
and decreasing importance to
practical, career-oriented objec
tives.
Black offered another possible
interpretation of the finding that
students seem to care less about
the financial and security con
cerns today.
"Students may be less certain
about their future role in the
world," he said. "The interest in
encounter groups may be a sign of
this uncertainty. There's so much

superficiality that people are look
ing for something beyond."
Guy Browning, who has been
with the Center for 16 years, is
the Associate Director. Marion
Bairos, a senior counselor, has
been there 11 years. Both agree
that while it may be possible to
make some generalizations about
the changing Stanford student
body, it is very difficult to do so.
"People would consume less."
He explained that it is just the op
posite in today's society where
there is so much advertising that
you are pressured into consuming
more than you think you want.
Existential Queries
"During the last several years
there has been a shift from the
very old-fashioned, neurotic con
cerns to the more existential ques
tions," observed Miss Bairos.
"There is a fuller sense of social
consciousness at Stanford today.
Students don't want jobs with
banks and insurance companies.
They are concerned with urban
problems or racial prejudice."
Browning commented on a
growing "sense of the need to
make decisions for oneself." Ac
cording to Browning, this need
may arise from the student's ques
tion, "What part of what I'm
doing now did I decide?" In short,

many students feel they are acting
out a script "that somebody else
wrote."
Both Browning and Bairos
agreed students today arrive at
Stanford more concerned and in
formed on the social issues of the
day than did students of the
1950'5. But Browning admitted,
No Total Apathy
"At no time is it possible to
put all students in an apathetic or
concerned bag. The function of
the college experience is to shake
up students' values. The Univer
sity is failing, I think, if this
shake-up doesn't occur."
Miss Bairos mentioned the con
fining influence the draft has on
many male students. She went on
to observe, "But the boys who
feel they can't leave here may be
the ones pressing to have the uni
versity system offer them more.
Black said he wanted to em
phasize that not "everyone is
walking around here in a com
pletely amorph'ous condition. But
the world is such a mess that it
isn't surprising that people are
struggling with the question of
how they can be part of the sys
tem without contributing to the
evil already present."

When questioned about
whether or not Stanford students
are lonely, Black thought for a
moment. In December of 1967
Black authored a report entitled
"The Stanford Community as
Seen by Students: Scholarly,
Aware and Lonely."
"A lot of students are lonely,"
he replied. "By the usual criteria
Stanford shouldn't be a lonely
place because it's small and resi
dential. Presumably the intense
demands make for an atmosphere
where the student is busy and
competitive. But a lot of kids are
lonely."
"Maybe if you're uncertain
about who you are," he mused,
"this makes you hold back in rela
tionships."
Whatever the image of Stan
ford may be in the outside world,
the questions and problems
brought to Counseling and Testing
seem to indicate that all is not
continually sunshine down on the
farm.

graduates at one time or another,"
said Black.
According to Black and to
Marion Bairos and Guy Browning,
counselors at the Center, the face
of the Stanford student body does

change over the years in ways that
can be recognized.
"Between the class that en
tered in 1966 and the entering
class this year," noted Black,
"There has been an enormous in
crease in those who say they're
vocationally undecided.
Life Philosophy
"Today the objective consid
ered essential is to find a philoso
phy of life. One possible interpre
tation of this finding is that stu
dents are attaching greater
importance to humanistic goals
and decreasing importance to
practical, career-oriented objec
tives.
Black offered another possible
interpretation of the finding that
students seem to care less about
the financial and security con
cerns today.
"Students may be less certain
about their future role in the
world," he said. "The interest in
encounter groups may be a sign of
this uncertainty. There's so much

superficiality that people are look
ing for something beyond."
Guy Browning, who has been
with the Center for 16 years, is
the Associate Director. Marion
Bairos, a senior counselor, has
been there 11 years. Both agree
that while it may be possible to
make some generalizations about
the changing Stanford student
body, it is very difficult to do so.
"People would consume less."
He explained that it is just the op
posite in today's society where
there is so much advertising that
you are pressured into consuming
more than you think you want.
Existential Queries
"During the last several years
there has been a shift from the
very old-fashioned, neurotic con
cerns to the more existential ques
tions," observed Miss Bairos.
"There is a fuller sense of social
consciousness at Stanford today.
Students don't want jobs with
banks and insurance companies.
They are concerned with urban
problems or racial prejudice."
Browning commented on a
growing "sense of the need to
make decisions for oneself." Ac
cording to Browning, this need
may arise from the student's ques
tion, "What part of what I'm
doing now did I decide?" In short,

many students feel they are acting
out a script "that somebody else
wrote."
Both Browning and Bairos
agreed students today arrive at
Stanford more concerned and in
formed on the social issues of the
day than did students of the
1950'5. But Browning admitted,
No Total Apathy
"At no time is it possible to
put all students in an apathetic or
concerned bag. The function of
the college experience is to shake
up students' values. The Univer
sity is failing, I think, if this
shake-up doesn't occur."
Miss Bairos mentioned the con
fining influence the draft has on
many male students. She went on
to observe, "But the boys who
feel they can't leave here may be
the ones pressing to have the uni
versity system offer them more.
Black said he wanted to em
phasize that not "everyone is
walking around here in a com
pletely amorph'ous condition. But
the world is such a mess that it
isn't surprising that people are
struggling with the question of
how they can be part of the sys
tem without contributing to the
evil already present."

When questioned about
whether or not Stanford students
are lonely, Black thought for a
moment. In December of 1967
Black authored a report entitled
"The Stanford Community as
Seen by Students: Scholarly,
Aware and Lonely."
"A lot of students are lonely,"
he replied. "By the usual criteria
Stanford shouldn't be a lonely
place because it's small and resi
dential. Presumably the intense
demands make for an atmosphere
where the student is busy and
competitive. But a lot of kids are
lonely."
"Maybe if you're uncertain
about who you are," he mused,
"this makes you hold back in rela
tionships."
Whatever the image of Stan
ford may be in the outside world,
the questions and problems
brought to Counseling and Testing
seem to indicate that all is not
continually sunshine down on the
farm.

Black offered another possible
interpretation of the finding that
students seem to care less about
the financial and security con
cerns today.
"Students may be less certain
about their future role in the
world," he said. "The interest in
encounter groups may be a sign of
this uncertainty. There's so much

superficiality that people are look
ing for something beyond."
Guy Browning, who has been
with the Center for 16 years, is
the Associate Director. Marion
Bairos, a senior counselor, has
been there 11 years. Both agree
that while it may be possible to
make some generalizations about
the changing Stanford student
body, it is very difficult to do so.
"People would consume less."
He explained that it is just the op
posite in today's society where
there is so much advertising that
you are pressured into consuming
more than you think you want.
Existential Queries
"During the last several years
there has been a shift from the
very old-fashioned, neurotic con
cerns to the more existential ques
tions," observed Miss Bairos.
"There is a fuller sense of social
consciousness at Stanford today.
Students don't want jobs with
banks and insurance companies.
They are concerned with urban
problems or racial prejudice."
Browning commented on a
growing "sense of the need to
make decisions for oneself." Ac
cording to Browning, this need
may arise from the student's ques
tion, "What part of what I'm
doing now did I decide?" In short,

many students feel they are acting
out a script "that somebody else
wrote."
Both Browning and Bairos
agreed students today arrive at
Stanford more concerned and in
formed on the social issues of the
day than did students of the
1950'5. But Browning admitted,
No Total Apathy
"At no time is it possible to
put all students in an apathetic or
concerned bag. The function of
the college experience is to shake
up students' values. The Univer
sity is failing, I think, if this
shake-up doesn't occur."
Miss Bairos mentioned the con
fining influence the draft has on
many male students. She went on
to observe, "But the boys who
feel they can't leave here may be
the ones pressing to have the uni
versity system offer them more.
Black said he wanted to em
phasize that not "everyone is
walking around here in a com
pletely amorph'ous condition. But
the world is such a mess that it
isn't surprising that people are
struggling with the question of
how they can be part of the sys
tem without contributing to the
evil already present."

When questioned about
whether or not Stanford students
are lonely, Black thought for a
moment. In December of 1967
Black authored a report entitled
"The Stanford Community as
Seen by Students: Scholarly,
Aware and Lonely."
"A lot of students are lonely,"
he replied. "By the usual criteria
Stanford shouldn't be a lonely
place because it's small and resi
dential. Presumably the intense
demands make for an atmosphere
where the student is busy and
competitive. But a lot of kids are
lonely."
"Maybe if you're uncertain
about who you are," he mused,
"this makes you hold back in rela
tionships."
Whatever the image of Stan
ford may be in the outside world,
the questions and problems
brought to Counseling and Testing
seem to indicate that all is not
continually sunshine down on the
farm.

The student with boyfriend
girlfriend, roommate, vocational
or parental problems may end up
on the third floor of the Old
Union—asking the secretary at the
Counseling and Testing Center for
an appointment with a counselor.
As one of the counselors at
C&T phrased it, "We are so broad
from our point of view, and we
are often so narrowly perceived."
John D. Black, who has di
rected the Center since its incep
tion in 1950, heads a staff of 10
psychologists— not all of whom
are full-time. The staff handles
problems which range from voca
tional choice to personal relation
ships.
"Over the years we've handled
about 45 percent 'of the under
graduates at one time or another,"
said Black.
According to Black and to
Marion Bairos and Guy Browning,
counselors at the Center, the face
of the Stanford student body does

change over the years in ways that
can be recognized.
"Between the class that en
tered in 1966 and the entering
class this year," noted Black,
"There has been an enormous in
crease in those who say they're
vocationally undecided.
Life Philosophy
"Today the objective consid
ered essential is to find a philoso
phy of life. One possible interpre
tation of this finding is that stu
dents are attaching greater
importance to humanistic goals
and decreasing importance to
practical, career-oriented objec
tives.
