# Minds, Men, And Machines
## Computers Relate To Man 
### BARBARA RITZ 
"A computer can have as much
free will as we do if we make it
complex enough," suggested elec
trical engineering professor
Michael Arbib in a lecture on
"The Metaphorical Brain"
Wednesday night in the Physics
Lecture Hall. But that's if we're to
assume that man has free will."
Speaking to an overflow audi
ence Professor Arbib discussed
how human beings and computers
can relate to each other in a tech
nical society. The lecture pre
sented Wednesday was the fourth
of a series, devised by Arbib, en

titled ''Minds, Men, and
Machines." The fifth lecture will
be next Wednesday at 7:45 pm.
Computers As Aids
"In the future machines can be
used to help us, not to be us, or to
supplant us," Arbib said. He des
cribed certain "evils" that people
could devise for a society in which
computers do much of the work
and keep records of everything
that happens. One of them was a
fear of the computer bank, which
records and keeps the actions of
individuals on file, then at some
later date, may feed the infor
mation to some investigating com

mittee. There wouldn't be any
thing that could be kept secret.
"It's not the computers you
should worry about," Arbib ex
plained. "In history this is the
same thing that Joe McCarthy
exercized before anyone ever
thought about using computers to
track people down."
Arbib outlined the benefits of
computers helping to educate
human beings and to further cre
ative instincts.
"Computers can be used as an
aid to human creativity as, for ex
ample, you could write poems by
computer. Arbib also suggested
the idea of using the computer
consul as a shortcut to writing,
that you could let the computer
do the mechanics of writing, while
the person is left free to create.
He described computer aid-to
education, in which there could
be more individual instruction in
the future, and by the use of such
tools, man is thus given a new di
mension for action.
Arbib stressed the concept of
man as a machine. "Having com
puters do much of the brainwork
will be a challenge for understand
ing what it is to be human."
"People used to get upset when
you told them about evolution
and man's descent from the apes,"
he said. You have to get accus
tomed to seeing man in a new
framework, if not man in the
jungle with the animals, then man
with all his tools. Arbib explained
that human beings have to under
stand the conflict between body
and mind, and that the real hang
up comes in relating these things
to each other.
Human Consciousness
A human being will exhibit a
certain response when given ap
propriate stimuli, he said. If you
attach electrodes to a person's
sensory mechanism, you could
create pleasurable sensations for
him. He raised the question of

man's creating an artificial en
vironment for himself where the
machine does the work, and man
experiences sensations, for ex
ample, merely by pressing a
button.
Saying that man is conscious of
his own reactions and thought
processes is taking a lot on faith,
Arbib commented. "Our brains
could be stuffed with cotton
wool, and we could be controlled
by radar." He explained that there
is more to being human than
merely recognizing sensory re
sponses that make up the quality
of humanness. Man could live to
an extreme of passiveness, Arbib
said, with a future of pressing but
tons and getting pleasure stimulus,
intravenous feeding, or sitting in
front of the video tube from birth
till death, until man becomes
more like the machine which he
has created.
Computer Consciousness
Arbib also described the possi
bility of having computers that
seemed to be conscious. "The
computer could be like a growing
organism, it could adapt itself in
its environment, and with this
ability to adapt, the computer
could work things out for itself."
If you program a computer to be
sympathetic, Arbib commented,
it's possible that you could begin
to believe that it was conscious.

that human beings have to under
stand the conflict between body
and mind, and that the real hang
up comes in relating these things
to each other.
Human Consciousness
A human being will exhibit a
certain response when given ap
propriate stimuli, he said. If you
attach electrodes to a person's
sensory mechanism, you could
create pleasurable sensations for
him. He raised the question of

man's creating an artificial en
vironment for himself where the
machine does the work, and man
experiences sensations, for ex
ample, merely by pressing a
button.
Saying that man is conscious of
his own reactions and thought
processes is taking a lot on faith,
Arbib commented. "Our brains
could be stuffed with cotton
wool, and we could be controlled
by radar." He explained that there
is more to being human than
merely recognizing sensory re
sponses that make up the quality
of humanness. Man could live to
an extreme of passiveness, Arbib
said, with a future of pressing but
tons and getting pleasure stimulus,
intravenous feeding, or sitting in
front of the video tube from birth
till death, until man becomes
more like the machine which he
has created.
Computer Consciousness
Arbib also described the possi
bility of having computers that
seemed to be conscious. "The
computer could be like a growing
organism, it could adapt itself in
its environment, and with this
ability to adapt, the computer
could work things out for itself."
If you program a computer to be
sympathetic, Arbib commented,
it's possible that you could begin
to believe that it was conscious.
"A computer can have as much
free will as we do if we make it
complex enough," suggested elec
trical engineering professor
Michael Arbib in a lecture on
"The Metaphorical Brain"
Wednesday night in the Physics
Lecture Hall. But that's if we're to
assume that man has free will."
Speaking to an overflow audi
ence Professor Arbib discussed
how human beings and computers
can relate to each other in a tech
nical society. The lecture pre
sented Wednesday was the fourth
of a series, devised by Arbib, en

titled ''Minds, Men, and
Machines." The fifth lecture will
be next Wednesday at 7:45 pm.
Computers As Aids
"In the future machines can be
used to help us, not to be us, or to
supplant us," Arbib said. He des
cribed certain "evils" that people
could devise for a society in which
computers do much of the work
and keep records of everything
that happens. One of them was a
fear of the computer bank, which
records and keeps the actions of
individuals on file, then at some
later date, may feed the infor
mation to some investigating com

mittee. There wouldn't be any
thing that could be kept secret.
"It's not the computers you
should worry about," Arbib ex
plained. "In history this is the
same thing that Joe McCarthy
exercized before anyone ever
thought about using computers to
track people down."
Arbib outlined the benefits of
computers helping to educate
human beings and to further cre
ative instincts.
"Computers can be used as an
aid to human creativity as, for ex
ample, you could write poems by
computer. Arbib also suggested
the idea of using the computer
consul as a shortcut to writing,
that you could let the computer
do the mechanics of writing, while
the person is left free to create.
He described computer aid-to
education, in which there could
be more individual instruction in
the future, and by the use of such
tools, man is thus given a new di
mension for action.
Arbib stressed the concept of
man as a machine. "Having com
puters do much of the brainwork
will be a challenge for understand
ing what it is to be human."
"People used to get upset when
you told them about evolution
and man's descent from the apes,"
he said. You have to get accus
tomed to seeing man in a new
framework, if not man in the
jungle with the animals, then man
with all his tools. Arbib explained
that human beings have to under
stand the conflict between body
and mind, and that the real hang
up comes in relating these things
to each other.
