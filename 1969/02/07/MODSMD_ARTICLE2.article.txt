# University-Wide Conference Set To Debate SES Recommendations
## 
### MICHAEL KUHL 
The plans are final, and beginning
Sunday night the University is
scheduled to become deeply involved in
consideration of the first two reports of
the Study of Education at Stanford
(SES).
The University-Wide Conference on
Educational Objectives, which grew out
of student concern early this quarter
about implementation of SES sug
gestions, will open on Monday with
speeches by renowned educators David
Riesman and Irving Howe.
"To date, students have had many
opportunities to become well versed on
SES," notes Conference chairman John
Kramer, a junior in political science.
"Unfortunately, the level of understand
ing is still rather low."
The Academic Senate begins con
sideration of the first six proposals con
tained in the SES report on Under
graduate Curriculum February 27. Prior
to this on February 17-18, a special
election will be held to select the 40
student members to meet jointly with
the faculty.
Eight Panels
Each of the eight panels will prepare
a summary covering the discussion and
suggested amendments to the report in
their particular topic area. These papers
and the texts of Howe's and Riesman's
speeches will be passed on to the faculty
and made available for general distri
bution.
"I think there is as much diversity on

the panels as there is in the University,"
says Kramer. "We made a very con
scious effort to draw on different
opinions as well as differing back
grounds."
The format of the two day program
has been arranged to allow students,
faculty, and administrators to make
their "unique contributions" based on
particular interests and background, ac
cording to Kramer.
Dinners
The dinners in 18 faculty members
and administrators' homes will allow for
joint discussions with six to eight stu
dents on SES proposals.
Howe has indicated that he will deal
largely with the social role of education
during his 4:15 speech in Memorial
Auditorium on Monday. Riesman, on
the other hand, will focus primarily on
cirricular reform.
History and education grad student
Tom Grissom will offer a commentary
on the two presentations before the pro
gram is opened up to questions from the
audience.
Meal Tickets
Faculty members who want to eat in
various campus residences that night
will be able to obtain meal tickets at
Memorial Auditorium.
The following six houses will hold
additional discussions on the after
noon's program: Adelpha in Lagunita,
Mirlo in Florence Moore, Alpha Delta
Phi, Serra, Branner, and Soto in Wilbur.
Discussion on the various SES pro

posals will open at 9 Tuesday morning
in Tresidder and various residence
lounges. The Daily will carry a com
plete schedule of topics and panel
members.
Opening Portion
The opening portion of the programs
will center around presentations by
panel members, who will outline the
actual proposals and offer critical
analyses.
The steering committee is still await
ing a definite commitment from one or
more speakers to close out the confer
ence that afternoon.
Senate Endorsement
The Academic Senate, in endorsing
the purpose of the Conference, urged in
dividual faculty members to consider
suspending or alternate scheduling of
classes Tuesday to allow as many stu
dents as possible to take part in the
program.

suspending or alternate scheduling of
classes Tuesday to allow as many stu
dents as possible to take part in the
program.
The plans are final, and beginning
Sunday night the University is
scheduled to become deeply involved in
consideration of the first two reports of
the Study of Education at Stanford
(SES).
The University-Wide Conference on
Educational Objectives, which grew out
of student concern early this quarter
about implementation of SES sug
gestions, will open on Monday with
speeches by renowned educators David
Riesman and Irving Howe.
"To date, students have had many
opportunities to become well versed on
SES," notes Conference chairman John
Kramer, a junior in political science.
"Unfortunately, the level of understand
ing is still rather low."
The Academic Senate begins con
sideration of the first six proposals con
tained in the SES report on Under
graduate Curriculum February 27. Prior
to this on February 17-18, a special
election will be held to select the 40
student members to meet jointly with
the faculty.
Eight Panels
Each of the eight panels will prepare
a summary covering the discussion and
suggested amendments to the report in
their particular topic area. These papers
and the texts of Howe's and Riesman's
speeches will be passed on to the faculty
and made available for general distri
bution.
"I think there is as much diversity on

the panels as there is in the University,"
says Kramer. "We made a very con
scious effort to draw on different
opinions as well as differing back
grounds."
The format of the two day program
has been arranged to allow students,
faculty, and administrators to make
their "unique contributions" based on
particular interests and background, ac
cording to Kramer.
Dinners
The dinners in 18 faculty members
and administrators' homes will allow for
joint discussions with six to eight stu
dents on SES proposals.
Howe has indicated that he will deal
largely with the social role of education
during his 4:15 speech in Memorial
Auditorium on Monday. Riesman, on
the other hand, will focus primarily on
cirricular reform.
History and education grad student
Tom Grissom will offer a commentary
on the two presentations before the pro
gram is opened up to questions from the
audience.
Meal Tickets
Faculty members who want to eat in
various campus residences that night
will be able to obtain meal tickets at
Memorial Auditorium.
The following six houses will hold
additional discussions on the after
noon's program: Adelpha in Lagunita,
Mirlo in Florence Moore, Alpha Delta
Phi, Serra, Branner, and Soto in Wilbur.
Discussion on the various SES pro

posals will open at 9 Tuesday morning
in Tresidder and various residence
lounges. The Daily will carry a com
plete schedule of topics and panel
members.
Opening Portion
The opening portion of the programs
will center around presentations by
panel members, who will outline the
actual proposals and offer critical
analyses.
The steering committee is still await
ing a definite commitment from one or
more speakers to close out the confer
ence that afternoon.
Senate Endorsement
The Academic Senate, in endorsing
the purpose of the Conference, urged in
dividual faculty members to consider
suspending or alternate scheduling of
classes Tuesday to allow as many stu
dents as possible to take part in the
