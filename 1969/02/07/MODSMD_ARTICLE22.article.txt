# Economist Blasts US Action In Cuba
## 
### RANDAL SAMSTAG 
What means this word, imper
ialism? It means simply, "The US
would put the devil himself in
power if he would keep order,
tranquility, and the proper invest
ment climate. In fact it has, many
times."
So says Edward Boorstein, a
Bronx born economist who
worked under Che Guevara in the
Cuban National Bank and Bank of
Foreign Commerce between 1960
and 1963. He spoke, appropriate
ly, at Bishop Auditorium, the
Stanford Business School, to a
medium-sized audience last Wed
nesday evening on "Cuba: a case
study in US imperialism."
Boorstein's lectures this week
and next Monday are being spon
sored by Stanford SDS ?s part of
its month of solidarity with the
tenth anniversary of the Cuban
Revolution.
US Imperialism in Cuba
"The way to understand Amer
ican imperialism," says Boorstein,
"is to be at the other end of the
stick. The Cuban people were
among the first to understand im
perialism. When you're on that end
of the stick you learn quick."
He spoke of Jose Marti, nine
teenth century Cuban revolution
ary who, writing 25 years before
Lenin's Imperialism: the Highest
Stage of Capitalism, saw that, "US
corporations were moving into
Cuba. It would do no good to ex
change the master Spain for a big
ger and more powerful master, the
United States." The revolutionary
traditions of Cuba, Boorstein sug
gests, begin with Marti.
Boorstein went on, "We have
to strain to look at it from the
point of view of the people. Now,
you remember those old Wallace
Beery movies with the marines

landing in Cuba. (They landed in
1906, 1912, and 1917.) Well,
those marines were taking the lo
cal resources, the local girls and
roaring drunk across the coun
try."
"For the US imperialism is a
policy, but for the people of Latin
America it is a hard fact." As for
the US presidency, "The Presi
dent?— Well you have two kinds,
some are bad and some are worse.
They are all imperialists because
they all are part of an imperialist
system."
Cuban Economic Ills
Boorstein described some of
the economic problems that Cuba
shares with the rest of Latin
America. "Before the revolution
the per capita income was $312
per year. In the countryside it was
$100-that's two bucks a week!
■ Unemployment was over 20% dur
ing harvest season.
"These are tfS Dept. of Com
merce figures, but you don't need
statistics to figure out how the
people were living."
He pointed out that the stand
ard US policy of signing reciprocal
trade agreements with underdevel
oped countries is a way to stifle
infant industry in the country.
I "It's like me fighting Joe Louis
and we fight by the Marquis of
Queensbury rules— all very legit."
Boorstein concludes that only
revolution could have solved the
root problems of Cuba. "If you're
at a dead end, what do you
do?—you make a revolution. The
Cubans were boxed in, they had
to take the bull by the horns." So
they did and so, suggests Boor
stein, will the rest of Latin Amer
ica.
