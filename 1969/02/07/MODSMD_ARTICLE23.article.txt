# Population Forum Panel Discusses Sex Education
## 
### CLAIRE DARLEY 
"Sex education does not deal
primarily with the techniques of
intercourse but should be called
more properly education for sex
uality," Dr. Mary Calderone said
on a panel discussing sex educa
tion in the public schools and in
the society. The program, pre
sented Wednesday evening in
Dinkelspiel Auditorium, was the
third in a series sponsored by
Stanford's Population and Envi
ronment Forum.
Panelists included Dr. Mary
Calderone, executive director of
the Sex Information and Educa
tion Council of the U.S.
(SIECUS); Dr. Lewis Noltemeyer,
San Francisco psychiatrist noted
for his opposition to several Cal
ifornia sex education programs;
and Dr. Harry Bryan, Stanford
professor of health education,
who teaches "Marriage and the
Family."
Dr. Calderone, grandmother of
five, opened the discussion by ex
plaining the purpose of SIECUS,
"The schools are not our major
focus. We are more interested in
adult sex education because the
adults are the ones who have gone
off the track . . .

Sexuality, according to Dr.
Calderone, is "the process of
learning how to live with and
manage sex. The adult world bears
the responsibility for the sexual
ization of the child. The sex of a
newborn baby is differentiated
only by his genital organs. The
actual job of turning him into a
man or a woman depends on his
parents. No one comes into the
world a homosexual."
Our "sex obsessed society" has
much influence on children Dr.
Calderone feels. "T.V. is sexually
assaulting our children. By the time
he reaches kindergarten, the aver
age child has been exposed to
7,000 hours of unsupervised view
ing .. .
"It's a society that uses sex
hostility between people—as a
medium of exchange, of barter. I
think that's sick. And that's what's
being passed on to our kids."
Noltemeyer raised several ob
jections to the public school pro
grams. He is "not opposed to sex
education per se," but feels that
in instituting the programs intro
duced in California, the children
"stand to lose their individuality."
These programs contain only
about 10 percent on sexuality and

include extensive portions on
sociology and economics.
"The home should remain the
basic unit in our society, Nolte
meyer said. "These programs tend
to transfer the development of at
titudes to the shoulders of the
teachers or children away from
the parents."
Both Noltemeyer and Bryan
consider qualifications of teachers
to be a "hang up," But, Bryan
commented, "I would be inclined
to think that the strength of the
group would come as much from
the members as from the leaders.
"I think you'll stop forever if
you begin asking what the quali
fications are. I think that you do
with as best that the community
can supply." During the ques
tion-answer period that followed
the discussion, Dr. Calderone chal
lenged society to "decide for itself
where we will allocate responsi
bility for the psycho-sexual evolu
tion of the child.
"I'm not going to accept the
challenge because I don't think
it's mine —but I do challenge the
young. I'm willing, however, to
help you think and I'm willing to
bring you knowledge and informa
tion that will help you base your
own decision."

who teaches "Marriage and the
Family."
Dr. Calderone, grandmother of
five, opened the discussion by ex
plaining the purpose of SIECUS,
"The schools are not our major
focus. We are more interested in
adult sex education because the
adults are the ones who have gone
off the track . . .

Sexuality, according to Dr.
Calderone, is "the process of
learning how to live with and
manage sex. The adult world bears
the responsibility for the sexual
ization of the child. The sex of a
newborn baby is differentiated
only by his genital organs. The
actual job of turning him into a
man or a woman depends on his
parents. No one comes into the
world a homosexual."
Our "sex obsessed society" has
much influence on children Dr.
Calderone feels. "T.V. is sexually
assaulting our children. By the time
he reaches kindergarten, the aver
age child has been exposed to
7,000 hours of unsupervised view
ing .. .
"It's a society that uses sex
hostility between people—as a
medium of exchange, of barter. I
think that's sick. And that's what's
being passed on to our kids."
Noltemeyer raised several ob
jections to the public school pro
grams. He is "not opposed to sex
education per se," but feels that
in instituting the programs intro
duced in California, the children
"stand to lose their individuality."
These programs contain only
about 10 percent on sexuality and

include extensive portions on
sociology and economics.
"The home should remain the
basic unit in our society, Nolte
meyer said. "These programs tend
to transfer the development of at
titudes to the shoulders of the
teachers or children away from
the parents."
Both Noltemeyer and Bryan
consider qualifications of teachers
to be a "hang up," But, Bryan
commented, "I would be inclined
to think that the strength of the
group would come as much from
the members as from the leaders.
"I think you'll stop forever if
you begin asking what the quali
fications are. I think that you do
with as best that the community
can supply." During the ques
tion-answer period that followed
the discussion, Dr. Calderone chal
lenged society to "decide for itself
where we will allocate responsi
bility for the psycho-sexual evolu
tion of the child.
"I'm not going to accept the
challenge because I don't think
it's mine —but I do challenge the
young. I'm willing, however, to
help you think and I'm willing to
bring you knowledge and informa
tion that will help you base your
own decision."
"Sex education does not deal
primarily with the techniques of
intercourse but should be called
more properly education for sex
uality," Dr. Mary Calderone said
on a panel discussing sex educa
tion in the public schools and in
the society. The program, pre
sented Wednesday evening in
Dinkelspiel Auditorium, was the
third in a series sponsored by
Stanford's Population and Envi
ronment Forum.
Panelists included Dr. Mary
Calderone, executive director of
the Sex Information and Educa
tion Council of the U.S.
(SIECUS); Dr. Lewis Noltemeyer,
San Francisco psychiatrist noted
for his opposition to several Cal
ifornia sex education programs;
and Dr. Harry Bryan, Stanford
professor of health education,
who teaches "Marriage and the
