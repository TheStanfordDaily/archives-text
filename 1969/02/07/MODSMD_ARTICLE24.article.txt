# Radical View Of The Cold War
## US Capitalism Led To Iron Curtain 
### BARBARA HYLAND 
Prefacing his remarks by saying
how difficult it is for a leftist his
torian to gain access to govern
ment documents, Peter Wiley, a
Revisionist from San Francisco,
explained how capitalistic motives
on the part of the U.S. played
significant role in producing the
Cold War. This speech "The
Cold War: Whose Creation?" was
given Wednesday night in History
Corner as the first in a series spon
sored by the Resistance and the
United Christian Ministry. The
series will present a social and
political analysis of the radical
view of the American political
economy. Professor Bart Bern
stein who was publicized to speak
with Wiley could not appear due
to a misunderstanding in schedul
ing.
Wiley, a graduate of the Uni

versity of Wisconsin, is presently
writing his doctoral dissertation
on Greece in the post-war period.
He has studied under William Ap
pleman Williams, a leading Re
visionist. He ,is also an editor for
"Leviathan"a radical magazine
which will publish its first edition
this month.
Need For Foreign Markets
Wiley said that the Cold War
should not be viewed in a moral
light but "as a conflict between
two nation states that represented
two economic systems." He stated
that it was a "struggle essentially
for power."
Other contingent issues were
the control of markets, resources,
raw materials, and key strategic
areas Wiley explained.
From the settlement in Europe
after the war, the United States
hoped to gain markets to drain off

America's economic surplus.
Wiley said, "One of the United
States' primary concerns is the
development of foreign markets."
Economic Unity
Wiley maintained that the
United States felt that "Europe
had to be reconstructed as a total
economic entity." The northwest
ern industrial areas of Europe
would be linked with the South
eastern European bread basket. As
the strongest industrial power in
the world, the U.S. didn't want
any trade barriers in East Europe.
Wiley asserted that the U.S.
conception of Europe after re
construction was "an integrated
Europe and a reconstructed cap
italist Europe and a democratic
Europe." This was in direct con
flict with the Soviet Union's con
ception.
Search lor Defense Perimeter
The Soviet Union "sought in
Europe a defense perimeter", ac
cording to Wiley. Its policy was
not based on desires to create a
Communist conspiracy, but on
"protection of the Soviet mother
land." It hoped to establish
friendly governments sympathetic
to the USSR along its border. As
it had lost 1/3 of its industry in
the war, the Soviet Union wanted
large scale credits from the United
States or industrial reparations
from Germany.

Other Russian aspirations were
to gain a warm water outlet in the
Mediterranean, a port in Man
churia, some control over the
Dardanelles, and trade with the
West.
Wiley said that the Soviet
Union saw trade as the "basis of
rapprochement with the West."
However while the U.S. hoped for
a capitalist, integrated Europe, the
Soviet Union wanted a bifurcated
Europe with a strong Soviet in
fluence in the East.
Early Occupational Government!)
In the occupational govern
ments set up in Italy and Ru
mania, Wiley felt the Soviet Union
gained a premonition of what
would happen after the war. In
both countries a tri-partite govern
ment was established in which the
Soviet Union had no decision
making power.
In 1944 Churchill and Stalin
decided how to divide influence in
Greece, Yugoslavia, Rumania and
Hungary. The U.S. however ar
gued over this spheres of influence
agreement because it would
threaten capitalism and free trade,
according to Wiley. He remarked
that there really was not any prin
ciple behind the U.S. argument
since we did reach a spheres of in
fluence agreement in Asia.

Wiley said, "The real hardening
of positions came over Poland."
The USSR had occupied it and
saw it as "absolutely essential to
its security." Concurrently a right
wing resistance group taking its
orders from London tried to un
dermine the government.
Atom Bomb Used As Threat
At this same time Wiley as
serted that the United States
began to use the proposal of giv
ing the Soviet Union credit as a
tool in bargaining. Other histor
ians have claimed that the U.S.
used the threat of an atomic
bomb "dangling from Truman's
hip pocket" for persuasion.
The Soviet Union became
"wary of the allies." Wiley noted.
He said, "It began to feel that
there was very little possibility for
rapprochement." Ultimately they
decided that "they would have to
go it alone."
The USSR tore up industry in
Eastern Europe and shipped it
back to Russia. It made the deci
sion to impose a Soviet monolithic
government on the satellite coun
tries.
By 1945, the United States rec
ognized that a "rationalized, cap
italized, integrated" Europe was
an impossibility. The Eastern Eui
opean nations had been lost.
