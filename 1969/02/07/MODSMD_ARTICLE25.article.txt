# New Pavilion OK For Sports, But Music Goes On And On

An informal test of the acous
tics of the new Maples Basketball
Pavilion has revealed that for cer
tain musical and dramatic events,
the clarity of sound may be very
poor.
As a result The Stanford Com
mittee on Public Exercises has de
cided to cancel a concert to be
held by the San Francisco
Symphony Orchestra. Although a
contract had not been signed, the
concert had been scheduled for
February 25. Part of the news
release announcing the cancella
tion reads: " . . .additional acous
tical treatment will be required in
the Pavilion before symphonic
events are scheduled there."
The unsatisfactory nature of
the acoustics was discovered last
Thursday night (Jan. 30) during a
practice held by the Stanford
Orchestra in the Pavilion. Echoes
and reverberations of the music
took about ten seconds to die
down, and due to the building's
great size, individual musicians
were unable to hear one another.
Even though solo and unampli
fied concerts will sound poorly,
highly amplified rock concerts
probably will not be affected, ac
cording to Don Carlson of the
University Relations Office. As to

what will actually be done, Carl
son says that since, "No precise
measurements have been taken
. . .we will not know until a study
is done by a competent engineer
ing firm."

Solutions for the problem may
entail use of a shell to focus the
sound and strategically located
dampening to lessen reverber
ations from the steel and concrete
insides of the building.
