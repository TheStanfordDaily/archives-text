# Battles Of The Beaten
## Indians Roll North Against Oregons 
### FRED MANN 
If Stanford is ever going to make a run at a
descent finish in the Pacific Eight basketball race,
it better be during the next two weeks.
The Indians, currently lodged in seventh place
in the conference, are up in the snowy northwest
for a two game series with the sixth and eighth
place teams, Oregon State and Oregon.
Next weekend, Howie Dallmar's troops con
tinue the battle at home in Maples Pavilion against
the same opponents.
Tonight, the Tribe takes on the last place
Ducks, 0-4 (8-8 overall) in Eugene. Stanford's sea
son record stands at 1-4 in league and a dismal
5-11 overall.
Oregon may be tougher than their record
shows. They won the Far West Basketball Classic
in December, and have had bad luck with injuries
and illness ever since.
Stanford comes off a good and bad weekend
stay in Los Angeles. The Cards upset USC, 66-56,
before being mutilated by mighty UCLA, 98-61.
The Ducks have been resting for a week, and
will be ready for the Bay Area invaders. However,
any home court advantage that Oregon might have

enjoyed has been nullified by 34 inches of snow.
All week, their home stadium, McArthur Court,
has been closed due to the mounds of white stuff
on the old roof. A cave-in was feared.
The sophomore-studded Ducks will be attempt
ing to break a five-game losing streak against Stan
ford. Lanky center Stan Love, a prep star in
Southern California, is enjoying a fine first varsity
year. Love is hitting for 17.2 a game. Guard Billy
Gaskins is averaging 16.6, but he is out with the
flu, and will see no action.
Without Gaskins, Oregon will suffer defensively
as well as offensively. He is usually assigned to the
top guard of the enemy, in this case, Stanford's
Dun Griffin. Without a suitable replacement, Griff
might be able to up his average above his amazing
22.4 pace.
Tomorrow, the Indians move over to Corvallis
to meet the Beavers, 1-3 in conference, and 8-8
overall.
OSU has always been a very deliberate type
team, controlling the ball and slowing down the
tempo of the ball game. Coach Paul Valenti's
squad won two non-league victories last week,
both against the University of Portland.

Southern California, is enjoying a fine first varsity
year. Love is hitting for 17.2 a game. Guard Billy
Gaskins is averaging 16.6, but he is out with the
flu, and will see no action.
Without Gaskins, Oregon will suffer defensively
as well as offensively. He is usually assigned to the
top guard of the enemy, in this case, Stanford's
Dun Griffin. Without a suitable replacement, Griff
might be able to up his average above his amazing
22.4 pace.
Tomorrow, the Indians move over to Corvallis
to meet the Beavers, 1-3 in conference, and 8-8
overall.
OSU has always been a very deliberate type
team, controlling the ball and slowing down the

CAGERS IN ACTION — Mike Michel (above) shoots over USF defen
der in recent contest. Below, Dave Druliner does the same. The team

Oregon may be tougher than their record
shows. They won the Far West Basketball Classic
in December, and have had bad luck with injuries
and illness ever since.
Stanford comes off a good and bad weekend
stay in Los Angeles. The Cards upset USC, 66-56,
before being mutilated by mighty UCLA, 98-61.
The Ducks have been resting for a week, and
will be ready for the Bay Area invaders. However,
any home court advantage that Oregon might have

enjoyed has been nullified by 34 inches of snow.
All week, their home stadium, McArthur Court,
has been closed due to the mounds of white stuff
on the old roof. A cave-in was feared.
The sophomore-studded Ducks will be attempt
ing to break a five-game losing streak against Stan
