# ASSU Professor
## Mrs.`Robinson's Plans Set 
### THOMAS C. DAWSON 
As announced in NEWSWEEK maga
zine and elsewhere, Stanford students
are hiring their own professor Spring
Quarter. She is Joan Robinson, a
66-year old economist from Cambridge
University in England, hired with $5000
in ASSU funds.
A widely acclaimed economic
theorist, Mrs. Robinson has been a pro
fessor at Cambridge for more than
thirty years and comes to Stanford with
enthusiastic recommendations from
Stanford economists.
Lorie Tarshis, chairman of the eco
nomics department, calls Mrs. Robinson
"one of the outstanding living eco
nomists in the world." Tarshis also says
she is "warm with students, but often
impatient with her colleagues."
According to ASSU Professor Com
mission member Mike Weinstein, "her
knowledge of and broad interests in
philosophic and social questions make
her highly suited to be our professor."
Affinity With Students
Her affinity with students is demon
strated by her refusal to accept a visiting
professorship from the Stanford eco
nomics department. Instead Mrs. Robin
son prefers to be completely student ap
pointed, a unique position for such a
noted scholar.
Tarshis believes Mrs. Robinson would
not have come to Stanford if asked by
the economics department, but "she
was tickled to be asked by students."
The refusal of the courtesy visiting
professorship has prompted an unusual
reaction from the Stanford adminis
tration. In a letter to ASSU president
Denis Hayes last week, Assistant Provost
Ray Bacchetti said Mrs. Robinson could
not formally be called a professor while
at Stanford since whe will not hold an
appointment from any department.
Like Coke
In his letter Bacchetti said "just as
everything with a cola taste is Coke"
Mrs. Robinson will be called Professor
"in informal discourse," but "officially"
she will not be a professor according to
Bacchetti. Mrs. Robinson is one of three
professors of economics in the thirty
two colleges at Cambridge. In the

English system attaining the rank of
professor is a very high honor, particu
larly at Cambridge.
Her courses are being listed under
economics and economics students
taking her courses will get credit for
their major. "We'd be fools not to count
her courses as economics," Tarshis says.
For the most part, her courses will be
pass-fail.
The exact titles of the courses Mrs.
Robinson will be teaching have not yet
been determined, but Commission mem
ber Weinstein believes she'll be offering
a lecture course in the Political Econo

my of Advanced Capitalist Countries
and seminars in Marxian Economics, the
Economic Development of India and
China and Topics in Modern Economics.
Tentatively, they are all three unit
courses. Sign-up lists will be available in
the ASSU office early next week for the
courses.
Mrs. Robinson has indicated that
whatever courses students are interested
in, she'll be happy to teach. Conse
quently, Weinstein is still hunting for
suggestions from interested students as
to possible courses. At least one of her
courses will be a lecture, while most will
be seminar in form.
