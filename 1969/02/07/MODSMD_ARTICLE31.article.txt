# Wrestlers Clobbered
## 
### 
The Stanford wrestling team,
still looking for its first victory of
the season, was massacred three
times in the past eight days.
First, San Francisco State
burned the Indians 22-11 on Janu
ary 29. Cal Poly of San Luis Obis
po and Oregon State then raided
Encina last Friday and Tuesday
respectively. Both opponents rode
home with plenty of scalps. Cal
Poly romped, 31-3, and Oregon
State, led by Olympic heavy
weight Jess Lewis, ran up a 42-3
score over Coach Dave Reed's
men.
Borchers Gets By
Only captain Len Borchers sur
vived the onslaught of excellent
wrestlers, but even he had trou
bles. Each of his matches was tied
early in the second round, but he
pulled away to remain undefeated
on the season.
Borchers whipped SFS captain,
Ashlee Sherman, by a score of
22-5 with a horde of predicament
and near fall points in the second
and third rounds. However, his
other matches were much closer.
He wore down a Cal Poly wrestler
7-2 and edged past a very slippery
OSU man, 5-3.
Thomas Wins, Loses
Dave Thomas pinned Paul Wal
foort of SFS in the third round of
their 137-pound bout after domi
nating the first two rounds. He
was beaten 16-6 in the Cal Poly
match.
Rodger Weigel of OSU beat
Thomas 4-2 as he was once again
beaten on riding time.
Junior Bill Ross was the only
other Stanford winner. He con
trolled Joe Asturias of SFS 3-1 at
177 pounds. He fought hard in his
other two matches, but lost each
6-0.
The rest of the Indians were
simply outclassed. For example,
little Bobby Toda, a sophomore
123-pounder, had to wrestle men
like SFS's Art Chavez, a member
of the 1969 Greco-Roman World
Team. He was pinned in the first
round.
Suttle's Split
Senior John Suttle came close
to winning one as he fought Dan
Lucas of SFS on even terms, but
he missed some opportunities and
lost 4-1. However, his freshman
brother, Dick, trounced the same
Dan Lucas in an exhibition match
10-4.
In other exhibition matches,
Coach Reid turned loose three
other impressive freshmen: heavy
weights Lee Fair and Arthur
Smiley, and Glen Smith.

their 137-pound bout after domi
nating the first two rounds. He
was beaten 16-6 in the Cal Poly
match.
Rodger Weigel of OSU beat
Thomas 4-2 as he was once again
beaten on riding time.
Junior Bill Ross was the only
other Stanford winner. He con
trolled Joe Asturias of SFS 3-1 at
177 pounds. He fought hard in his
other two matches, but lost each
6-0.
The rest of the Indians were
simply outclassed. For example,
little Bobby Toda, a sophomore
123-pounder, had to wrestle men
like SFS's Art Chavez, a member
of the 1969 Greco-Roman World
Team. He was pinned in the first
round.
Suttle's Split
Senior John Suttle came close
to winning one as he fought Dan
Lucas of SFS on even terms, but
he missed some opportunities and
lost 4-1. However, his freshman
brother, Dick, trounced the same
Dan Lucas in an exhibition match
10-4.
In other exhibition matches,
Coach Reid turned loose three
other impressive freshmen: heavy
weights Lee Fair and Arthur
Smiley, and Glen Smith.
The Stanford wrestling team,
still looking for its first victory of
the season, was massacred three
times in the past eight days.
First, San Francisco State
burned the Indians 22-11 on Janu
ary 29. Cal Poly of San Luis Obis
po and Oregon State then raided
Encina last Friday and Tuesday
respectively. Both opponents rode
home with plenty of scalps. Cal
Poly romped, 31-3, and Oregon
State, led by Olympic heavy
weight Jess Lewis, ran up a 42-3
score over Coach Dave Reed's
men.
Borchers Gets By
Only captain Len Borchers sur
vived the onslaught of excellent
wrestlers, but even he had trou
bles. Each of his matches was tied
early in the second round, but he
pulled away to remain undefeated
on the season.
Borchers whipped SFS captain,
Ashlee Sherman, by a score of
22-5 with a horde of predicament
and near fall points in the second
and third rounds. However, his
other matches were much closer.
He wore down a Cal Poly wrestler
7-2 and edged past a very slippery
OSU man, 5-3.
Thomas Wins, Loses
Dave Thomas pinned Paul Wal
foort of SFS in the third round of
their 137-pound bout after domi
nating the first two rounds. He
was beaten 16-6 in the Cal Poly
match.

Thomas 4-2 as he was once again
beaten on riding time.
