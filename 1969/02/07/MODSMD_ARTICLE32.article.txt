# Art Harris, Pro-- 'The Good Life'
## 
### DAVE NOLAND 
"It's a good life," said Seattle Supersonic rookie Art Harris, drying
himseli ofl alter a shower in the dingy visitors' locker room at the
Cow Palace.
The Sonics had just beaten the Warriors, 116-111. Harris had con
tributed 11 points, four rebounds, and three assists in the 30 minutes
he'd played. He starts most games for the Sonics but this time sat out
most ol the second half, watching third-year man Tommie Kron play
in his place.
Art Harris spent very little time sitting on the bench in his three
years at Stanford.
Art led the Tribe in scoring for three seasons, and set an all-time
Stanford season scoring record last year.
But the NBA is a tough league. The quickness, agility, and hard
nosed aggressiveness that brought Harris stardom at Stanford are still
there, to be sure. But everybody in the NBA is quick, agile, and
aggressive. And some of them are seven feel tall.
Contact
"It's a totally different game," said Harris, throwing the towel over
his shoulder. "There's more contact, more running, better shooting.
Some people have said UCLA is good enough to play in the pros. I
don't think they'd stand a chance in this league."
Changes
The old Harris flair has remained intact of course, but Art has had
to make some major changes in his game to adapt to NBA play.
At Stanford, his outside jump shot was slow and graceful, and he
started the shot noticeably low, about hip level.
"I tried that shot a few times earlier this year and never even got
one off. Now I've developed a much quicker release." Two of his
buckets against the Warriors were quick, long jumpers.
Defense
Art has also been concentrating much harder on defense. He ball
hawks aggressively, often picking up his man at half-court. "I usually
take the other team's highest-scoring guard," said Art. Against the
Warriors, he guarded Jeff Mullins, who averages 23 points a game.
That night Mullins got 25.
Back to Guard
At 6-5, Art plays guard for the Sonics, a position he played his
sophomore year at Stanford. But height problems forced Coach
Howie Dallmar to move him up to the front line his junior and senior
seasons.
"It's good to be in the backcourt again. I'm really a guard at
heart."
But he still manages to get near the basket quite often. The fantas
tic Harris inside moves have remained unchanged—twice he beat much
taller Warriors underneath for layups, turning one into a three-point
play.
Playing with Len Wilkens at the other guard gives me a lot of
freedom to free-lance to the basket. He's a real pro." Wilkens, a
10-year veteran had 28 points and eight assists.
Money
When asked whether he'd like to see Lew Alcindor in the NBA, Art
answered, "I'd like to see him go where the most money is."
Art Harris is a businessman basketball is his career, and it promises
to be a long and rewarding one.
"Pro basketball is a good life. I've got no complaints."
"I've gotta go get dressed now," he said, ambling toward the door
to the dressing room. "Say hi to everybody at Stanford."

to the dressing room. "Say hi to everybody at Stanford."
"It's a good life," said Seattle Supersonic rookie Art Harris, drying
himseli ofl alter a shower in the dingy visitors' locker room at the
Cow Palace.
The Sonics had just beaten the Warriors, 116-111. Harris had con
tributed 11 points, four rebounds, and three assists in the 30 minutes
he'd played. He starts most games for the Sonics but this time sat out
most ol the second half, watching third-year man Tommie Kron play
in his place.
Art Harris spent very little time sitting on the bench in his three
years at Stanford.
Art led the Tribe in scoring for three seasons, and set an all-time
Stanford season scoring record last year.
But the NBA is a tough league. The quickness, agility, and hard
nosed aggressiveness that brought Harris stardom at Stanford are still
there, to be sure. But everybody in the NBA is quick, agile, and
aggressive. And some of them are seven feel tall.
Contact
"It's a totally different game," said Harris, throwing the towel over
his shoulder. "There's more contact, more running, better shooting.
Some people have said UCLA is good enough to play in the pros. I
don't think they'd stand a chance in this league."
Changes
The old Harris flair has remained intact of course, but Art has had
to make some major changes in his game to adapt to NBA play.
At Stanford, his outside jump shot was slow and graceful, and he
started the shot noticeably low, about hip level.
"I tried that shot a few times earlier this year and never even got
one off. Now I've developed a much quicker release." Two of his
buckets against the Warriors were quick, long jumpers.
Defense
Art has also been concentrating much harder on defense. He ball
hawks aggressively, often picking up his man at half-court. "I usually
take the other team's highest-scoring guard," said Art. Against the
Warriors, he guarded Jeff Mullins, who averages 23 points a game.
That night Mullins got 25.
Back to Guard
At 6-5, Art plays guard for the Sonics, a position he played his
sophomore year at Stanford. But height problems forced Coach
Howie Dallmar to move him up to the front line his junior and senior
seasons.
"It's good to be in the backcourt again. I'm really a guard at
heart."
But he still manages to get near the basket quite often. The fantas
tic Harris inside moves have remained unchanged—twice he beat much
taller Warriors underneath for layups, turning one into a three-point
play.
Playing with Len Wilkens at the other guard gives me a lot of
freedom to free-lance to the basket. He's a real pro." Wilkens, a
10-year veteran had 28 points and eight assists.
Money
When asked whether he'd like to see Lew Alcindor in the NBA, Art
answered, "I'd like to see him go where the most money is."
Art Harris is a businessman basketball is his career, and it promises
to be a long and rewarding one.
"Pro basketball is a good life. I've got no complaints."
"I've gotta go get dressed now," he said, ambling toward the door
to the dressing room. "Say hi to everybody at Stanford."
