# Forum Probes SRI Objectives
## 
### DENNIS PERLUSS 
Opposing views on the research ob
jectives of the Stanford Research Insti
tute (SRI) and its ties with the Uni
versity were aired yesterday afternoon
at an open forum.
SRI president Charles Anderson and
Daily editor Philip Taubman most clear
ly presented the two opposing view
points. The more radical elements of the
Stanford community, however, were
conspicuously absent.
Anderson told the Memorial Audi
torium audience of 250 that "we view it
as our obligation to support through in
dependent and objective research the
various and diverse efforts of our
government." Taubman, however,
termed some of the research done by
SRI "odious to every principle of
human existence."
Anderson and Taubman were joined
on the panel by Kenneth Pitzer; Prof.
Kenneth Scott, chairman of the ad hoc
s t u d en t - fa c u 1 ty committee on
University-SRI relations; and James
Potter, graduate student in electrical
engineering.
Prepared Remarks
Anderson explained in his prepared
remarks that "we do a wide variety of
work for our government, ranging from
our well publicized activities in Thai
land, to work on the educational prob
lems of our disadvantaged youth.
"We believe that this work, per
formed in support of programs for agen
cies of the U.S. government, is in the
public interest. Thus, we seek to sup
port, to the extent of our capabilities,
the work of our government and we do
not attempt to distinguish among
government agencies or departments on
the basis of the function they perform."
Taubman, speaking immediately be
fore Anderson, vehemently asserted that
such distinction was vital. "Perhaps my
values," he declared, "are not widely ac
cepted today and those of SRI are held
in high esteem by most Americans.
Then let America decline and fall as
have all other civilizations. But I hope
for more from America. I hope for
greater enlightenment from SRI."
Primary Question
Taubman posed as the primary ques
tion for consideration whether or not

SRI is capable of altering its principles
of operation to include a more humani
tarian approach to research.
"In a world, and even a nation,
plauged by starvation and lack of edu
cation, it would seem far more en
lightening for SRI to turn its attention
toward these areas."
He continued by suggesting that "if
SRI will not change by itself, then it
becomes the duty of Stanford to push
SRI away from destructive research."
President Pitzer, who began the pro
gram, declared that one of his primary
reasons for participating on the panel
was to learn more about the issues in
volved.
Pitzer did state, however, that "just
as students and faculty want to be heard
in decisions concerning the University;
likewise the views of the SRI staff must
be considered."
He later remarked that to become ef
fective, "change within the university
community must be based on a broad
consensus among those most directly af
fected, both faculty and students. In a
university community, change cannot
be imposed by fiat."
Question Period
Before the question period began,
Prof. Scott explained how the ad hoc
committee was conducting its investi
gation. He mentioned questionaires, dis
cussions with the management of SRI,
open hearings, and questions addressed
to other universities with a similar prob
lem as methods employed to aid in the
gathering of data.
Potter, a self-declared member of the
"silent majority," briefly explained his
belief that in a world where nationalistic
strife constitutes a major element of the
environment, a university cannot always
achieve its desired goal of complete aca
demic freedom.
The first questions of the discussion
period dealt with Anderson's contention
that SRI researchers freely choose their
areas of inquiry. Anderson declared
"they are not coerced to participate in
research projects against their will."
An SRI physicist directly contra
dicted this statement when he declared
that he was coerced into working on his
current assignment, research on the dis
semination of tear gas.
