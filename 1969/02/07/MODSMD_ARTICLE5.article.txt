# "Extreme Emergency"
## Berkeley Protest: A Quiet Ritual 
### CRAIG WILSON 
It was nearly two p.m. and the police
were slowly leaving the University
walking in pairs. The first day of "ex
treme emergency" at Berkeley was at an
end.
It has been like that for a couple of
weeks now. Students congregating
during the day, reaching a high point at
noon, and then slowly dissipating as the
afternoon draws on.
But this Thursday was a little differ
ent. Today the police gathered in large
numbers, just as the students had done
for weeks.
Governor Reagan had proclaimed an
unprecedented "state of extreme emer
gency" today on the University campus
to allow highway patrolmen to be used
to control campus disruption.
Guard Campus
The plethora of policemen were not
ironically guarding the campus from the
students in anticipation of an eruption
such as occurred two days before. Eight
students were hospitalized and fifteen
arrested in that melee.
The cause has been the creation of a
Department of Afi'o-American Studies.
But at times the presence of the po
lice seems to blur the cause.

The police, with their night sticks
and riot gear, patrol in waves mostly
near Sather Gate breaking up congestion
and keeping the entrance near the gate
clear.
They are in great numbers. It is al
most frightening. The highway patrol is
clad in yellow raincoats and blue and
gold helmets. They move in a line
toward the crowd, forming an ever en
largening circle as they spread the stu
dents.
Others are dressed in blue overalls
outfitted in leather jackets graced with a
holster and gun. Plainclothesmen are
said to be mixed-in as well.
Student Observers
There seem to be as many student
observors as participants. The pillars in
side the gates are layered with on
lookers.
Many students busy themselves dis
tributing various position papers and
petitions protesting the Governors latest
proclamation.
Studnets march in a large circle in
side the campus, but away from the
gate, chanting.
Favorite Chant
Their favorite is "whose making love
to your old lady while you're out stand

ing guard." At times a black cheerleader
from the Third World Liberation Front
enters the circle and begins to shout
"Third World College." The crowd joins
in.
The news media is everywhere. A
brace of photographers snap pictures
from every conceivable angle and re
porters wait anxiously for violence to
develop.
And waves of police penetrating the
crowd with stone faces. Its a religious
ritual. And today is a feast day.
But not much happens. Some stu
dents begin to talk with the police. The
picket line begins to deplete. The rele
vancy of education is a problem—but a
problem that will have to wait until af
ternoon classes are over.
But no violence will develop today.
Chancellor Heyns will make it through
another day—or at least another lunch
hour.
The campus newspaper has called for
a shut-down, police are everywhere, and
the creation of an Afro-American Stud
ies Department seems remote.
The governor has labeled it a time of
"extreme emergency." But now the
police are leaving.
It's been a quiet "emergency."

ironically guarding the campus from the
students in anticipation of an eruption
such as occurred two days before. Eight
students were hospitalized and fifteen
arrested in that melee.
The cause has been the creation of a
Department of Afi'o-American Studies.
But at times the presence of the po
lice seems to blur the cause.

The police, with their night sticks
and riot gear, patrol in waves mostly
near Sather Gate breaking up congestion
and keeping the entrance near the gate
clear.
They are in great numbers. It is al
most frightening. The highway patrol is
clad in yellow raincoats and blue and
gold helmets. They move in a line
toward the crowd, forming an ever en
largening circle as they spread the stu
dents.
Others are dressed in blue overalls
outfitted in leather jackets graced with a
holster and gun. Plainclothesmen are
said to be mixed-in as well.
Student Observers
There seem to be as many student
observors as participants. The pillars in
side the gates are layered with on
lookers.
Many students busy themselves dis
tributing various position papers and
petitions protesting the Governors latest
proclamation.
Studnets march in a large circle in
side the campus, but away from the
gate, chanting.
Favorite Chant
Their favorite is "whose making love
to your old lady while you're out stand

ing guard." At times a black cheerleader
from the Third World Liberation Front
enters the circle and begins to shout
"Third World College." The crowd joins
in.
The news media is everywhere. A
brace of photographers snap pictures
from every conceivable angle and re
porters wait anxiously for violence to
develop.
And waves of police penetrating the
crowd with stone faces. Its a religious
ritual. And today is a feast day.
But not much happens. Some stu
dents begin to talk with the police. The
picket line begins to deplete. The rele
vancy of education is a problem—but a
problem that will have to wait until af
ternoon classes are over.
But no violence will develop today.
Chancellor Heyns will make it through
another day—or at least another lunch
hour.
The campus newspaper has called for
a shut-down, police are everywhere, and
the creation of an Afro-American Stud
ies Department seems remote.
The governor has labeled it a time of
"extreme emergency." But now the
police are leaving.
It's been a quiet "emergency."
It was nearly two p.m. and the police
were slowly leaving the University
walking in pairs. The first day of "ex
treme emergency" at Berkeley was at an
end.
It has been like that for a couple of
weeks now. Students congregating
during the day, reaching a high point at
noon, and then slowly dissipating as the
afternoon draws on.
But this Thursday was a little differ
ent. Today the police gathered in large
numbers, just as the students had done
for weeks.
Governor Reagan had proclaimed an
unprecedented "state of extreme emer
gency" today on the University campus
to allow highway patrolmen to be used
to control campus disruption.
