## Palo Alto Bombing Incidents On Increase 
### LANG ATWOOD 
What began several months ago as
window-breaking attacks on various in
stitutions has escalated in past weeks to
bombings directed against the homes
and vehicles of several outspoken Mid
peninsula figures.
The first attacks were directed
against the Midpeninsula Free Uni
versity (MFU) and other liberal and left
organizations. Two bookstores owned
and operated by Roy Kepler, who
teaches several courses at the Free U.,
have also been the favorite targets of
pellet-gunners and bombers striking
under the cover of darkness.
Recently, however, incidents in
volving buildings of both liberals and
conservatives have been increasing in
both number and intensity.
The latest bombing occurred
Wednesday night when an explosive de
vice blew out a window at The Tangent
restaurant in downtown Palo Alto.
'Potentially Lethal'
Police termed the blast "potentially
lethal" as glass and bomb fragments
were blown throughout one room of the
establihsment. Manager Frank CI.

Spinetta felt the concussion from the
blast in another room.
The Tangent at one time rented
rooms to the MFU and they currently
host "illegitimate theater" and folk
workshops which include protest songs.
Last Thursday, a station wagon be
longing to Harris Yeates, a member of
the Palo Alto School District's Mutli
cultural Activities Committee, was
bombed.
Stanford Employee
Yeates is a research assistant in the
neurology department at the Stanford
Medical Center.
The blast shattered the front
windshield of the car and brought neigh
bors out of their houses to see what had
happened. Yeates had just carried some
groceries inside his home when the car
bon dioxide cartridge, which had been
taped to the windshield, exploded.
Five days earlier, a bomb fashioned
from pipe, explosive, buckshot and nails
exploded against the front door of the
home of Palo Alto City Councilman
Kirke Comstock.
Telephone Warning
While the police were at his house
conducting an investigation, Comstock

received a telephone call, presumably
from the bomber, which warned, "Keep
it up and you'll get more of the same."
Comstock is a liberal member of the
council, and has agreed to teach a class
in local politics at the MFU. He and his
family were not home at the time of the
blast.
These bombings bring to almost 35
the total number of bombings, window
breakages, pellet sniping, break-ins and
vandalism directed at liberal or left
organizations in recent months.
Other Targets
Other terrorist targets have been
Kepler's bookstores in Menlo Park and
Los Altos, which have had their win
dows repeatedly broken and bombed;
the MFU store in Menlo Park, which
had its window broken so many times
that it has been replaced with plexiglas;
The Palo Alto Concerned Citizens house
and Resistance headquarters was also
the target of a pipe bomb, resulting in
sixteen broken windows; and the same
night of the Yeates' bombing car win
dows were smashed outside a Mid
peninsula Citizens for Fair Housing
Committee meeting.
This list does not include a wave of

window smashing apparently from the
left directed against "war industries"
and "anti-people" government agencies
and corporations. These include the
U.S. Army Recruiting Station in Palo
Alto, which has replaced its windows
with plywood; two branches of the
Wells Fargo Bank, Utah Mining and
Construction, Dean Witter & Company,
Lytton Savings and Loan, Western
Surety Company, Royal Typewriter
Company and the North Santa Clara
County Courthouse.
The increasing intensity of the at
tacks in recent weeks has reulted in a
stepped-up police investigation by agen
cies from Redwood City to Mountain
View. Captain Guy Wathen, commander
of the Investigation Division of the Palo
Alto Police Department, is in charge of
their efforts and coordination with the
other departments.
INo Comment
He would not comment on the inves
tigation other than to say "we're working
on it."
The FBI is not conducting an investi
gation of its own at this time, but ac
cording to a spokesman, they are in
daily contact with local police agencies

and have made their laboratory and
other facilities available.
Palo Alto Mayor Edward Arnold re
cently deplored the bombings and said,
". . . a segment of our society is sick.
Democracy is being tested as it has
never been tested before in peacetime."
Recent Editorials
The Palo Alto Times in recent editor
ials has labeled the attacks "outrageous"
and "despicable." They called the ter
rorist activity "a mix of Marxist pro
letariat incitement, urban guerrilla war
fare and Ku Klux Klan nightriderism."
