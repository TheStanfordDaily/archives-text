Once again, the ASSU Speech Associa
tion is trying to fleece the student govern
ment's money.
Appropriations for the Speech Associa
tion have a long history of controversy. For
the past five years, until this year, the
organization received $7000 from the
Legislature, but this year it was scaled
down to $3000.
The reasons behind the budget cut last
spring were entirely logical and not a fit of
leftist hysteria, as some of the Association
members have intimated this fall.
First, it was felt that, with a member
ship of little over 100, "the Speech Associ
ation is simply not worth $7000 to the
Stanford student body." $7000 is ten per
cent of the ASSU discretionary budget.
Secondly, in 1967 budget considerations
representatives of the Speech Association
promised to sponsor more on-campus de
bates on campus issues, so the entire cam
pus could benefit from the group's work.
At the same time, the group agreed to look
into alternative sources of support, and cut
expenses on trips and hotels.
The promised changes never material
ized and their budget was consequently
cut.
Unwilling to let the $3000 appropri
ation stand, the Speech Association em
barked on a more fruitful, if less ethical,
program this year to pack the Legislature
with members and friends.
Their plan worked and, after several ef

forts, they managed to pass over
whelmingly an additional "emergency ap
propriation" for $4000. In the interest of
the student body at large and ASSU fiscal
responsibility, ASSU President Denis Hayes
vetoed it.
It is constructive to go beyond the fact
of the aborted appropriation to note that
in reality there is no ASSU money to sup
port the move. When the ASSU Professor
Commission was set up last year, $10,000
was taken from ASSU special reserves, in
order to support it. If the ASSU Professor
Commission only needed $5000, the re
maining money was to be returned to the
reserves, intended for new, innovative pro
grams.
The Speech Association didn't see it
that way. They and their supporters voted
the $5000 to general contingency funds
and then gave $4000 to the Association,
rejecting a previously arranged compromise
calling for a long-term $4000 loan.
There is currently a petition circulating
for a referendum on this issue. While it is a
bad precedent for a student referendum on
budget appropriations, the inability of
LASSU to act ethically on this one makes
it necessary. We urge you to sign the peti
tion and to reject both the transfer of
funds and the appropriation, if it comes to
a vote.
Furthermore, legislators should rescind
their earlier action. Fiscal irresponsibility is
not a light charge.

into alternative sources of support, and cut
expenses on trips and hotels.
The promised changes never material
ized and their budget was consequently
cut.
Unwilling to let the $3000 appropri
ation stand, the Speech Association em
barked on a more fruitful, if less ethical,
program this year to pack the Legislature
with members and friends.
Their plan worked and, after several ef

forts, they managed to pass over
whelmingly an additional "emergency ap
propriation" for $4000. In the interest of
the student body at large and ASSU fiscal
responsibility, ASSU President Denis Hayes
vetoed it.
It is constructive to go beyond the fact
of the aborted appropriation to note that
in reality there is no ASSU money to sup
port the move. When the ASSU Professor
Commission was set up last year, $10,000
was taken from ASSU special reserves, in
order to support it. If the ASSU Professor
Commission only needed $5000, the re
maining money was to be returned to the
reserves, intended for new, innovative pro
grams.
The Speech Association didn't see it
that way. They and their supporters voted
the $5000 to general contingency funds
and then gave $4000 to the Association,
rejecting a previously arranged compromise
calling for a long-term $4000 loan.
There is currently a petition circulating
for a referendum on this issue. While it is a
bad precedent for a student referendum on
budget appropriations, the inability of
LASSU to act ethically on this one makes
it necessary. We urge you to sign the peti
tion and to reject both the transfer of
funds and the appropriation, if it comes to
a vote.
Furthermore, legislators should rescind
their earlier action. Fiscal irresponsibility is
not a light charge.
Once again, the ASSU Speech Associa
tion is trying to fleece the student govern
ment's money.
Appropriations for the Speech Associa
tion have a long history of controversy. For
the past five years, until this year, the
organization received $7000 from the
Legislature, but this year it was scaled
down to $3000.
The reasons behind the budget cut last
spring were entirely logical and not a fit of
leftist hysteria, as some of the Association
members have intimated this fall.
First, it was felt that, with a member
ship of little over 100, "the Speech Associ
ation is simply not worth $7000 to the
Stanford student body." $7000 is ten per
cent of the ASSU discretionary budget.
Secondly, in 1967 budget considerations
representatives of the Speech Association
promised to sponsor more on-campus de
bates on campus issues, so the entire cam
pus could benefit from the group's work.
At the same time, the group agreed to look
into alternative sources of support, and cut
expenses on trips and hotels.
