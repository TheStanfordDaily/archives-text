Help wanted:
Does the growing
youth market offer
a new potential ?
Situation: By 1972, 46% of the U.S. population will be
under the age of 25. If this is a new market with
substantial potential, should we base our product
concept on economy or performance characteristics?
Consideration: The under 25 market poses some interesting
opportunities. For one, today 142% more young
people work toward advanced college degrees than
did the youth 7tiarket of 10years ago. That would
seem to indicate a need for a new car based on
economy of purchase and operation.
But, market affluence and the increasing number of
multiple car households could indicate that a
new vehicle should be developed around high style
and, high performance.
