# SCLC Deliberates Alternatives To Interim Demonstration Policy
## 
### KIM THORBURN 
The Student Conduct Legislative
Council (SCLC) met on Friday to con
sider a proposed demonstration policy
to replace the University's interim
policy which has been in effect since
last October. In the light of the recent
confrontation between SDS and the
Trustees, there has been some question
about whether the policy, because of its
interim status, is still valid.
The controversy arises from a rule
that states that SCLC interim policies
are in effect for ninety days. Last fall
Acting' President Robert J. Glaser made
his rulipg before SCLC existed and it is
not subject to this rule.
When his policy was released, Glaser
stated, "Its interim character is empha
sized because we anticipate further
action by the proposed Student Con
duct Legislative Council. Subsequent
actions of these bodies may confirm,
amend or supersede the temporary
policy which will be in effect until such
actions are taken."
Clarification Hoped For
SCLC hopes to clarify some parts of
the old policy in the proposal written
by Richard Such. The violation will be
carefully defined. Many claim that the
present policy isn't being broken until
the violators are told so. The motive will
then be considered in deciding the
penalty.
Section A of the rule has been ac
cepted by SCLC. It reads: "It is the ob
ligation of all members of the University
community t<s not:
1) Cause physical harm or a substan

tial risk of physical harm to any person;
2) Destroy or damage the property
of any person or of the University;
3) Prevent the use by any person of
any necessary means or access to any
place to which such person has right of
access;
4) prevent the effective enjoyment
of private residential property; or
5) Prevent the effective conduct of
any activity by any person or group
which such person or group has a right
to conduct.
Breach of Obligation
Any voluntary or reckless breach of
such obligation by any person is a vio
lation of the Rules of the SCLC, for
which sueh person may be subject to a
disciplinary hearing before the Stanford
Judicial Council and to disciplinary
action prescribed by the said Council."
The committee will continue con
sideration on the rest of the proposal
Wednesday afternoon. It reads:
B) No member of the University
community may be suspended, expelled
or dismissed for any breach of the obli
gation defined in (A) above in con
nection with a given matter if:
1) At least twenty-four hours
prior to such violation such per
son has signed and the President
or other official of the University
acting in his stead has received a
declaration in connection with
that matter, substantially in the
following form:
TO THE PRESIDENT
OF THE UNIVERSITY:

Students, the Academic

and implementation.
The undersigned will
charge the persons desig
nated by them to pursue
such discussions with dili
gence and in good faith, and

gation defined in A above
does not breach or threaten

or
2) The President of the
University, the Chairman of
the Academic Senate, or the
President of the Associated
Students, or persons posses
sing for the purposes of
such discussions their full

powers do not enter into
such discussions during the
period defined in B(l)
above or do not pursue such
discussions diligently or in
good faith."
Concern in SCLC
There is some concern among
the members of SCLC that section
B will encourage the use of ulti
mata. Such argued that the
twenty-four hour warning pre
vents any threat.
Professor Dean Yates chaired
the meeting in the absence of Pro
fessor Horn who has submitted his
resignation. His successor has not
yet been appointed.
Eric Espen was appointed to
replace Phil Taubman who resig
ned when he became editor of
The Daily. Espen was fourth in
the number of votes received in
the student body elections last fall
but there was some question
about the legality of his appoint
ment because he is not a student
this quarter. Often summer stu
dent government officials are not
enrolled, and since Espen is re
enrolling this spring, his case is
considered to be comparable.
SCLC will be holding an open
hearing Sunday, Feb. 16, from
8:30 to 10:30 p.m.
