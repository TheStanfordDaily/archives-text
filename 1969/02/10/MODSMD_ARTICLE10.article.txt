## 'Profs, Get Off My Back' 
### Jack Kaplan 
Undoubtedly the evolution of
liberal education to its present
status has a complicated history.
We can, though, find a clue to its
development in Professor Sokel's
column in last Thursday's Daily.
Professor Sokel concludes that
"the triumph of provincial self
righteousness cannot be averted"
unless universities compel stu
dents to learn a foreign language.
Professor Sokel is (surprise) a
language teacher.
I personally do not believe that
Professor Sokel's position is moti
vated by self-interest. I think he
honestly believes that, as he
wrote, "the subjects most suitable
to liberate the student from the
provincialism of time and place
are history and language."
I disagree. In my opinion, an
thropology best frees the student
from the biases and values of our
particular culture. More im
portantly, however, I do not wish
to see my attitude imposed on
Professor Sokel, as Professor
Sokel argues that his attitude
should be imposed on me.
Since intellectuals are often
thoroughly interested in their
fields, it is perhaps natural that
their enthusiasm will lead them
into thinking about everybody
should be exposed to their sub
jects. Professor Sokel has been
"liberated from time and place"
by language and history and,
understandably, he thinks every
body should be so liberated.
Other Cases
Professors in other fields can,
I'm sure, make equally persuasive
cases for the importance of their
subjects. For example:
The Physicist: "Science has

played such a major role in the
development of Western Man that
anyone who ignores it is turning
his back on one of the chief influ
ences in his life."
The Philosopher: "As Socrates
once said, 'An unexamined life is
not worth living', any aware per
son is a philosopher. It's only a
question of whether he's a good
philosopher or a bad philosopher.
If life has any meaning, it will be
found in philosophy."
The Historian: "People are
largely a product of their past
heritage. One can't understand
oneself without studying one's
ancestors "
'Get Off My Back'
Professors, Will You Get Off
My Back? It's inspiring that you
have found something which has
given meaning and direction to
your life. But it may not give
meaning or direction to mine.
Some things I must discover for
myself, or else I won't discover
them at all.
It makes little sense for a
father to take his son aside as
soon as he reaches puberty to tell
him:
"Son, you are growing up, and
you will eventually fall in love
with one girl, marry her, and
spend the rest of your life with
her.
"To help you make the choice,
I am scheduling dates for you
with all different sorts of girls for
the next seven years. The only
way you can decide what girls you
like is by being exposed to all
kinds.
"On your 20th birthday, you
must choose a wife. If you don't
choose your wife on your 20th

birthday, then you can't date any
more."
But that is strikingly similar to
what we are now doing with edu
cation.
"Student, you are growing up,
and you must eventually embark
upon a career.
"To help you make the de
cision, I have decided, in my in
finite wisdom, upon the following
courses.
"Freshman and sophomore
years in college: Western Civili
zation 1,2 and 3; Freshman
English 1,2 and 3; 17 units of
science including a laboratory
science; 2 of 7 Social Science in
troductory courses; a sequence in
mathematics or a foreign
language; and 8 units of humani
ties courses in at least two fields.
"After your sophomore year,
you must choose your major or
you won't be eligible for register
ing for the next quarter."
May we please enact Herbert
Packer's idea of the self-directed
educatfon?
May we abolish, or at least
drastically reduce, all General
Studies Requirements?
Professor " Sokel, there is
nothing more provincial than be
lieving that your way is the only
way.

'Get Off My Back'
Professors, Will You Get Off
My Back? It's inspiring that you
have found something which has
given meaning and direction to
your life. But it may not give
meaning or direction to mine.
Some things I must discover for
myself, or else I won't discover
them at all.
It makes little sense for a
father to take his son aside as
soon as he reaches puberty to tell
him:
"Son, you are growing up, and
you will eventually fall in love
with one girl, marry her, and
spend the rest of your life with
her.
"To help you make the choice,
I am scheduling dates for you
with all different sorts of girls for
the next seven years. The only
way you can decide what girls you
like is by being exposed to all
kinds.
"On your 20th birthday, you
must choose a wife. If you don't
choose your wife on your 20th

birthday, then you can't date any
more."
But that is strikingly similar to
what we are now doing with edu
cation.
"Student, you are growing up,
and you must eventually embark
upon a career.
"To help you make the de
cision, I have decided, in my in
finite wisdom, upon the following
courses.
"Freshman and sophomore
years in college: Western Civili

English 1,2 and 3; 17 units of
science including a laboratory

mathematics or a foreign
language; and 8 units of humani
ties courses in at least two fields.
"After your sophomore year,
you must choose your major or
you won't be eligible for register
ing for the next quarter."
May we please enact Herbert
Packer's idea of the self-directed

May we abolish, or at least
drastically reduce, all General

Professor " Sokel, there is
nothing more provincial than be
lieving that your way is the only

(Jack Kaplan is a junior major
ing in mathematics—Ed.)
Undoubtedly the evolution of
liberal education to its present
status has a complicated history.
We can, though, find a clue to its
development in Professor Sokel's
column in last Thursday's Daily.
Professor Sokel concludes that
"the triumph of provincial self
righteousness cannot be averted"
unless universities compel stu
dents to learn a foreign language.
Professor Sokel is (surprise) a
language teacher.
I personally do not believe that
Professor Sokel's position is moti
vated by self-interest. I think he
honestly believes that, as he
wrote, "the subjects most suitable
to liberate the student from the
provincialism of time and place
are history and language."
I disagree. In my opinion, an
thropology best frees the student
from the biases and values of our
particular culture. More im
portantly, however, I do not wish
to see my attitude imposed on
Professor Sokel, as Professor
Sokel argues that his attitude
should be imposed on me.
Since intellectuals are often
thoroughly interested in their
fields, it is perhaps natural that
their enthusiasm will lead them
into thinking about everybody
should be exposed to their sub
jects. Professor Sokel has been
"liberated from time and place"
by language and history and,
understandably, he thinks every
body should be so liberated.
Other Cases
Professors in other fields can,
I'm sure, make equally persuasive
cases for the importance of their
subjects. For example:
The Physicist: "Science has

played such a major role in the
development of Western Man that
anyone who ignores it is turning
his back on one of the chief influ
ences in his life."
The Philosopher: "As Socrates
once said, 'An unexamined life is
not worth living', any aware per
son is a philosopher. It's only a
question of whether he's a good
philosopher or a bad philosopher.
