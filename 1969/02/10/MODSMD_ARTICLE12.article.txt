# Conference Panels List Focus Of Deliberations
## 
### 
(A central portion of the two-day Con
ference on Educational objectives is to
morrow's panel discussions. To inform
the University community of the scope
of considerations involved, THE
DAILY asked each panel to discuss the
central topics of their deliberations. A
list of times, places, and panel mem
bers will appear in tomorrow's
DAILY.—Ed.)
Freshman Year
The panel on Freshman Year
will consider SES recommen
dations for a one semester
"writing experience (!)" and a one
semester course in "historical
studies."
Tiptoing through the tulips of
transition, Robert Polhemus, As
sociate Prof, of English and Direc
tor of Freshman English, feels
that the SES proposals will allow
students and teachers more free
dom of choice. Trampling through
the tulips, Anne Kostelanetz, As
sistant Prof, of English, believes
that there should be no require
ments at all.
Paul Seaver, Assistant Prof, of
History and Director of the
Western Civilization program, and
Oliver Holmes, History instructor,
are also included among the panel
ists. Mr. Holmes thinks that
Western Civilization should not be
compulsory for freshmen.
Another panelist is Sanford
Dornbusch, Prof, of Sociology
and Director of the Freshmen
Seminars, who declared, "I do not
accept the idea that the freshman
year can be dramatically changed
without massive influsions of
»nr»nev. M
University Housing
The SES proposals on universi
ty housing are largely noncontro
versial but do offer with a wide
range of suggestions.

Central to the proposals is the
requirement that the University
continue to maintain a variety of
residence opportunities. At the
same time, there is a need to de
crease crowded conditions in Uni
versity Residences.
Ed Nelson, president of Stan
ford's chapter of the American
Federation of Teachers, will com
ment on the need for increased
graduate student housing. He will
emphasize the nature of the situ
ation which his group has termed
a "crisis."
Co-op housing, something not
extensively explored in the SES
report, will be a further focus of
attention for panel members.
The pros and cons of co-ed
housing will receive detailed de
liberation. Panel members bring a
great deal of personal experience
to this particular area.
Finally, the panel hopes to dis
cuss various means of integrating
freshmen into various living ar
rangement. Panel moderator Barry
Askinas, a graduate student in
sociology, maintains that there is
a pressing need for steps in this
J ircction.
Calendar
and Schedule
Discussion of the quarter vs the
semester system in Stanford's aca
demic configuration has drawn
particular attention. In a sense,
the final decision in this area will
have a great impact on many
other academic considerations.
Prof. Donald Kennedy of
biology points out that the first
six recommendations contained in
the SES report on undergraduate
curriculum are closely tied to pro
posals 17-20 in the same report.
Aside from this problem of
separation, Kennedy suggests that
there is a need to insure that the

freedom of action guaranteed in
the calendar and schedule pro
posals is not unnecessarily
abridged in other proposals.
The SES report suggests that
the structured quarter or semester
does not allow sufficient time for
independent or honors work or
self-directed work. It proposes
that dead week would offer an op
portunity for intensive study and
reflection.
Assistant Prof, of Electrical En
gineering Michael Arbib will re
flect on his experiences with both
the quarter and the semester
system in this country and in
Australia.
The course credit system raises
additional considerations. Arbib
suggests that the SES proposal
offers little clue as to how credit
"should be determined by the in
dividual instructor, subject to de
partmental approval," especially
when courses are compared to
each other.
Finally, there are consider
ations of class scheduling. Depart
ments need to consider coordin
ation of their time listings with
those of other departments.
Special Programs
Dean Lawrence Ryan will
present a description of current
programs and speak to the prob
lems of financing other efforts of
the same nature. Dean Robert
Hind, who was on the SES Steer
ing Committee, will contribute
general observations on the possi
bilities for success of the various
proposals.
Also commenting on the
general philosophy of the idea of
special programs will be David
Pugh, a junior political science
major and a member of SDS.
David Grey, Assistant Prof, of
communications, will speak about
the interdisciplinary social

sciences programs and the rele
vance of off-campus work to a
student's overall studies.
A description of the engine
ering "design your own major"
option will be given by Eckhard
Schulz, a graduate student in
electrical engineering. He will also
present a criticism of the work
study and honors co-op programs.
Two student members of the
panel will discuss proposals for
new programs. Mike Menke, a
physics graduate student who was
on the SES Steering Committee,
will present the model of the Edu
cation College. Another idea, the
Institute of Student Affairs, will
be proposed by Pat Shea, a junior
who worked with the Coalition in
getting a student voice in SES de
liberations.
Examinations
and Grading
Grading
1. The only grades given are A,
B, C and Pass.
2. There are no D, F, or Fail
grades; if a student does not com
plete a course satisfactorily, he
gets no credit for it toward gradu
ation.
3. Courses can be taken over
to improve a grade.
4. Any course can be taken on
a Pass option with the instructor's
consent.
5. Credit for a course can be
earned by a written or oral ex
amination or by completion of
other specified criteria.
Examinations
1. The faculty uses essay ex
aminations, take home examin
ations, and papers where they are
appropriate.
2. Faculty members have two
weeks after a final exam before
turning in grades.

Fraternities
What should be the role of the
fraternity at Stanford? Should
they continue to exist as they are
now, should they be forced to
change some of their procedures
and programs?
Or should fraternities be
abolished all-together?
The SES report has stated that
the fraternities have severe short
comings, including racial dis
crimination, the "promotion, in
many instances, of an anti
intellectual atmosphere quite out
of keeping in a university," and
unfair selection procedures.
The report recommends that
the fraternities take immediate
action to end discrimination, take
positive steps to adopt in-house
programs and service activities,
and be required to adopt a mutual
preference system for selecting
members.
Should these recommendations
bf> nut into effect?
Campus
Community
". . . Stanford, because of its
solitude, has a unique opportunity
to create an academic community
in which buildings, service facili
ties, and cultural programs con
tribute to the education of those
who use them."
Our panel will begin with this
statement from the SES report
and move out from it to a con
sideration of specific proposals
which will seek to further a sense
of community at Stanford.
Should a "Main Street" be
tween Dinkelspiel and Campus
Drive be constructed? What are
the architectural needs of the Uni
versity today?
Rather than "a suit of armor"
the University should have "a

modern suit of clothing, which
can be altered, mended, and re
placed when it has outlived its
utility."
We intend to extrapolate from
the aesthetics of the physical
plant to the feelings engendered in
the University populace by such
structures as the Faculty Club,
Tresidder Union, the Clubhouse,
the International Center, and the
Coffee House.
Distribution
Policies
and Requirements
The stresses encountered by
the individual freshman will be
discussed by Guy Browning,
Lecturer in Education and Assis
tant Director of the Coseling and
Testing Center.
Student opinion will be re
flected by Jeffrey Kane, a senior
majoring in physiological psy
chology, who speaks persuasively
against requirements, and by
Geoffrey White, a junior in politi
cal science, who is concerned
about the departmental structure
of the freshman year. The inside
view will be presented by a fresh
man, Greg Larsen.
In a fractionated society of
specialists, the University stands
in the place of mediator between
two radically different education
al ideals: the development of the
often specialized interests and po
tentials of each individual, and the
exposure of all students to the
wide variety of concerns which
make up our society as a whole.
An intelligent person, besides
knowing himself and his particular
subject, needs to be able to com
municate effectively with others,
necessarily radically different indi
viduals. The panel will attempt to

air and explore the conflicts be
tween specialization and generali
zation as they relate to the con
cept of "General Studies," to
specific distributional require
ments, and to the proportional
concentration in a major field of
study.
On the most basic level, the
panel represents diverse opinions
as to the ideal means of generali
zing education.
Some support various re
castings of the traditional view
that students must be exposed to
a "common body of knowledge,"
a view which stresses a balance of
subject matter. Others emphasize
the need for exposure, not to
specific factual and interpretive
subject matter, but to the various
disciplines' methods of perceiving
and interpreting our natural and
cultural environment.
Others assert the need to intro
duce students to particularly fine
teachers or noted scholars as a
sort of baptism-by-fire into vari
ous academic disciplines as speci
fic men embody and employ
them.
The panel will also consider,
with various degrees of precision
and diversity of viewpoint, speci
fic proposed requirements.
Foreign languages, for instance,
may be rejected as superfluous in
an English-speaking world, or
recommended as providing a
necessary perspective on our own
language and a buffer against pro
vincialism.
Considering the SES proposal
for freshman tutorials itself in
volves various problems, including
the practical question of recruit
ing an appropriate group of teach
ers, and the tactical problem of
the best context and approach for
teaching writing.

University Housing
The SES proposals on universi
ty housing are largely noncontro
versial but do offer with a wide
range of suggestions.

Central to the proposals is the
requirement that the University
continue to maintain a variety of
residence opportunities. At the
same time, there is a need to de
crease crowded conditions in Uni
versity Residences.
Ed Nelson, president of Stan
ford's chapter of the American
Federation of Teachers, will com
ment on the need for increased
graduate student housing. He will
emphasize the nature of the situ
ation which his group has termed
a "crisis."
Co-op housing, something not
extensively explored in the SES
report, will be a further focus of
attention for panel members.
The pros and cons of co-ed
housing will receive detailed de
liberation. Panel members bring a
great deal of personal experience
to this particular area.
Finally, the panel hopes to dis
cuss various means of integrating
freshmen into various living ar
rangement. Panel moderator Barry
Askinas, a graduate student in
sociology, maintains that there is
a pressing need for steps in this
J ircction.
Calendar
and Schedule
Discussion of the quarter vs the
semester system in Stanford's aca
demic configuration has drawn
particular attention. In a sense,
the final decision in this area will
have a great impact on many
other academic considerations.
Prof. Donald Kennedy of
biology points out that the first
six recommendations contained in
the SES report on undergraduate
curriculum are closely tied to pro
posals 17-20 in the same report.
Aside from this problem of
separation, Kennedy suggests that
there is a need to insure that the

freedom of action guaranteed in
the calendar and schedule pro
posals is not unnecessarily
abridged in other proposals.
The SES report suggests that
the structured quarter or semester
does not allow sufficient time for
independent or honors work or
self-directed work. It proposes
that dead week would offer an op
portunity for intensive study and
reflection.
Assistant Prof, of Electrical En
gineering Michael Arbib will re
flect on his experiences with both
the quarter and the semester
system in this country and in
Australia.
The course credit system raises
additional considerations. Arbib
suggests that the SES proposal
offers little clue as to how credit
"should be determined by the in
dividual instructor, subject to de
partmental approval," especially
when courses are compared to
each other.
Finally, there are consider
ations of class scheduling. Depart
ments need to consider coordin
ation of their time listings with
those of other departments.
Special Programs
Dean Lawrence Ryan will
present a description of current
programs and speak to the prob
lems of financing other efforts of
the same nature. Dean Robert
Hind, who was on the SES Steer
ing Committee, will contribute
general observations on the possi
bilities for success of the various
proposals.
Also commenting on the
general philosophy of the idea of
special programs will be David
Pugh, a junior political science
major and a member of SDS.
David Grey, Assistant Prof, of
communications, will speak about
the interdisciplinary social

sciences programs and the rele
vance of off-campus work to a
student's overall studies.
A description of the engine
ering "design your own major"
option will be given by Eckhard
Schulz, a graduate student in
electrical engineering. He will also
present a criticism of the work
study and honors co-op programs.
Two student members of the
panel will discuss proposals for
new programs. Mike Menke, a
physics graduate student who was
on the SES Steering Committee,
will present the model of the Edu
cation College. Another idea, the
Institute of Student Affairs, will
be proposed by Pat Shea, a junior
who worked with the Coalition in
getting a student voice in SES de
liberations.
Examinations
and Grading
Grading
1. The only grades given are A,
B, C and Pass.
2. There are no D, F, or Fail
grades; if a student does not com
plete a course satisfactorily, he
gets no credit for it toward gradu
ation.
3. Courses can be taken over
to improve a grade.
4. Any course can be taken on
a Pass option with the instructor's
consent.
5. Credit for a course can be
earned by a written or oral ex
amination or by completion of
other specified criteria.
Examinations
1. The faculty uses essay ex
aminations, take home examin
ations, and papers where they are
appropriate.
2. Faculty members have two
weeks after a final exam before
turning in grades.

Fraternities
What should be the role of the
fraternity at Stanford? Should
they continue to exist as they are
now, should they be forced to
change some of their procedures
and programs?
Or should fraternities be
abolished all-together?
The SES report has stated that
the fraternities have severe short
comings, including racial dis
crimination, the "promotion, in
many instances, of an anti
intellectual atmosphere quite out
of keeping in a university," and
unfair selection procedures.
The report recommends that
the fraternities take immediate
action to end discrimination, take
positive steps to adopt in-house
programs and service activities,
and be required to adopt a mutual
preference system for selecting
members.
Should these recommendations
bf> nut into effect?
Campus
Community
". . . Stanford, because of its
solitude, has a unique opportunity
to create an academic community
in which buildings, service facili
ties, and cultural programs con
tribute to the education of those
who use them."
Our panel will begin with this
statement from the SES report
and move out from it to a con
sideration of specific proposals
which will seek to further a sense
of community at Stanford.
Should a "Main Street" be
tween Dinkelspiel and Campus
Drive be constructed? What are
the architectural needs of the Uni
versity today?
Rather than "a suit of armor"
the University should have "a

modern suit of clothing, which
can be altered, mended, and re
placed when it has outlived its
utility."
We intend to extrapolate from
the aesthetics of the physical
plant to the feelings engendered in
the University populace by such
structures as the Faculty Club,
Tresidder Union, the Clubhouse,
the International Center, and the
Coffee House.
Distribution
Policies
and Requirements
The stresses encountered by
the individual freshman will be
discussed by Guy Browning,
Lecturer in Education and Assis
tant Director of the Coseling and
Testing Center.
Student opinion will be re
flected by Jeffrey Kane, a senior
majoring in physiological psy
chology, who speaks persuasively
against requirements, and by
Geoffrey White, a junior in politi
cal science, who is concerned
about the departmental structure
of the freshman year. The inside
view will be presented by a fresh
man, Greg Larsen.
In a fractionated society of
specialists, the University stands
in the place of mediator between
two radically different education
al ideals: the development of the
often specialized interests and po
tentials of each individual, and the
exposure of all students to the
wide variety of concerns which
make up our society as a whole.
An intelligent person, besides
knowing himself and his particular
subject, needs to be able to com
municate effectively with others,
necessarily radically different indi
viduals. The panel will attempt to

air and explore the conflicts be
tween specialization and generali
zation as they relate to the con
cept of "General Studies," to
specific distributional require
ments, and to the proportional
concentration in a major field of
study.
On the most basic level, the
panel represents diverse opinions
as to the ideal means of generali
zing education.
Some support various re
castings of the traditional view
that students must be exposed to
a "common body of knowledge,"
a view which stresses a balance of
subject matter. Others emphasize
the need for exposure, not to
specific factual and interpretive
subject matter, but to the various
disciplines' methods of perceiving
and interpreting our natural and
cultural environment.
Others assert the need to intro
duce students to particularly fine
teachers or noted scholars as a
sort of baptism-by-fire into vari
ous academic disciplines as speci
fic men embody and employ
them.
The panel will also consider,
with various degrees of precision
and diversity of viewpoint, speci
fic proposed requirements.
Foreign languages, for instance,
may be rejected as superfluous in
an English-speaking world, or
recommended as providing a
necessary perspective on our own
language and a buffer against pro
vincialism.
Considering the SES proposal
for freshman tutorials itself in
volves various problems, including
the practical question of recruit
ing an appropriate group of teach
ers, and the tactical problem of
the best context and approach for
teaching writing.
(A central portion of the two-day Con
ference on Educational objectives is to
morrow's panel discussions. To inform
the University community of the scope
of considerations involved, THE
DAILY asked each panel to discuss the
central topics of their deliberations. A
list of times, places, and panel mem
bers will appear in tomorrow's
DAILY.—Ed.)
Freshman Year
The panel on Freshman Year
will consider SES recommen
dations for a one semester
"writing experience (!)" and a one
semester course in "historical
studies."
Tiptoing through the tulips of
transition, Robert Polhemus, As
sociate Prof, of English and Direc
tor of Freshman English, feels
that the SES proposals will allow
students and teachers more free
dom of choice. Trampling through
the tulips, Anne Kostelanetz, As
sistant Prof, of English, believes
that there should be no require

crease crowded conditions in Uni
versity Residences.
Ed Nelson, president of Stan
ford's chapter of the American
Federation of Teachers, will com
ment on the need for increased
graduate student housing. He will
emphasize the nature of the situ
ation which his group has termed
a "crisis."
Co-op housing, something not
extensively explored in the SES
report, will be a further focus of
attention for panel members.
The pros and cons of co-ed
housing will receive detailed de
liberation. Panel members bring a
great deal of personal experience
to this particular area.
Finally, the panel hopes to dis
cuss various means of integrating
freshmen into various living ar
rangement. Panel moderator Barry
Askinas, a graduate student in
sociology, maintains that there is
a pressing need for steps in this
J ircction.
Calendar
and Schedule
Discussion of the quarter vs the
semester system in Stanford's aca
demic configuration has drawn
particular attention. In a sense,
the final decision in this area will
have a great impact on many
other academic considerations.
Prof. Donald Kennedy of
biology points out that the first
six recommendations contained in
the SES report on undergraduate
curriculum are closely tied to pro
posals 17-20 in the same report.
Aside from this problem of
separation, Kennedy suggests that
there is a need to insure that the

freedom of action guaranteed in
the calendar and schedule pro
posals is not unnecessarily
abridged in other proposals.
The SES report suggests that
the structured quarter or semester
does not allow sufficient time for
independent or honors work or
self-directed work. It proposes
that dead week would offer an op
portunity for intensive study and
reflection.
Assistant Prof, of Electrical En
gineering Michael Arbib will re
flect on his experiences with both
the quarter and the semester
system in this country and in
Australia.
The course credit system raises
additional considerations. Arbib
suggests that the SES proposal
offers little clue as to how credit
"should be determined by the in
dividual instructor, subject to de
partmental approval," especially
when courses are compared to
each other.
Finally, there are consider
ations of class scheduling. Depart
ments need to consider coordin
ation of their time listings with
those of other departments.
Special Programs
Dean Lawrence Ryan will
present a description of current
programs and speak to the prob
lems of financing other efforts of
the same nature. Dean Robert
Hind, who was on the SES Steer
ing Committee, will contribute
general observations on the possi
bilities for success of the various
proposals.
Also commenting on the
general philosophy of the idea of
special programs will be David
Pugh, a junior political science
major and a member of SDS.
David Grey, Assistant Prof, of
communications, will speak about
the interdisciplinary social

sciences programs and the rele
vance of off-campus work to a
student's overall studies.
A description of the engine
ering "design your own major"
option will be given by Eckhard
Schulz, a graduate student in
electrical engineering. He will also
present a criticism of the work
study and honors co-op programs.
Two student members of the
panel will discuss proposals for
new programs. Mike Menke, a
physics graduate student who was
on the SES Steering Committee,
will present the model of the Edu
cation College. Another idea, the
Institute of Student Affairs, will
be proposed by Pat Shea, a junior
who worked with the Coalition in
getting a student voice in SES de
liberations.
Examinations
and Grading
Grading
1. The only grades given are A,
B, C and Pass.
2. There are no D, F, or Fail
grades; if a student does not com
plete a course satisfactorily, he
gets no credit for it toward gradu
ation.
3. Courses can be taken over
to improve a grade.
4. Any course can be taken on
a Pass option with the instructor's
consent.
5. Credit for a course can be
earned by a written or oral ex
amination or by completion of
other specified criteria.
Examinations
1. The faculty uses essay ex
aminations, take home examin
ations, and papers where they are
appropriate.
2. Faculty members have two
weeks after a final exam before
turning in grades.

Fraternities
What should be the role of the
fraternity at Stanford? Should
they continue to exist as they are
now, should they be forced to
change some of their procedures
and programs?
Or should fraternities be
abolished all-together?
The SES report has stated that
the fraternities have severe short
comings, including racial dis
crimination, the "promotion, in
many instances, of an anti
intellectual atmosphere quite out
of keeping in a university," and
unfair selection procedures.
The report recommends that
the fraternities take immediate
action to end discrimination, take
positive steps to adopt in-house
programs and service activities,
and be required to adopt a mutual
preference system for selecting
members.
Should these recommendations
bf> nut into effect?
Campus
Community
". . . Stanford, because of its
solitude, has a unique opportunity
to create an academic community
in which buildings, service facili
ties, and cultural programs con
tribute to the education of those
who use them."
Our panel will begin with this
statement from the SES report
and move out from it to a con
sideration of specific proposals
which will seek to further a sense
of community at Stanford.
Should a "Main Street" be
tween Dinkelspiel and Campus
Drive be constructed? What are
the architectural needs of the Uni
versity today?
Rather than "a suit of armor"
the University should have "a

modern suit of clothing, which
can be altered, mended, and re
placed when it has outlived its
utility."
We intend to extrapolate from
the aesthetics of the physical
plant to the feelings engendered in
the University populace by such
structures as the Faculty Club,
Tresidder Union, the Clubhouse,
the International Center, and the
Coffee House.
Distribution
Policies
and Requirements
The stresses encountered by
the individual freshman will be
discussed by Guy Browning,
Lecturer in Education and Assis
tant Director of the Coseling and
Testing Center.
Student opinion will be re
flected by Jeffrey Kane, a senior
majoring in physiological psy
chology, who speaks persuasively
against requirements, and by
Geoffrey White, a junior in politi
cal science, who is concerned
about the departmental structure
of the freshman year. The inside
view will be presented by a fresh
man, Greg Larsen.
In a fractionated society of
specialists, the University stands
in the place of mediator between
two radically different education
al ideals: the development of the
often specialized interests and po
tentials of each individual, and the
exposure of all students to the
wide variety of concerns which
make up our society as a whole.
An intelligent person, besides
knowing himself and his particular
subject, needs to be able to com
municate effectively with others,
necessarily radically different indi
viduals. The panel will attempt to

air and explore the conflicts be
tween specialization and generali
zation as they relate to the con
cept of "General Studies," to
specific distributional require
ments, and to the proportional
concentration in a major field of
study.
On the most basic level, the
panel represents diverse opinions
as to the ideal means of generali
zing education.
Some support various re
castings of the traditional view
that students must be exposed to
a "common body of knowledge,"
a view which stresses a balance of
subject matter. Others emphasize
the need for exposure, not to
specific factual and interpretive
subject matter, but to the various
disciplines' methods of perceiving
and interpreting our natural and
cultural environment.
Others assert the need to intro
duce students to particularly fine
teachers or noted scholars as a
sort of baptism-by-fire into vari
ous academic disciplines as speci
fic men embody and employ
them.
The panel will also consider,
with various degrees of precision
and diversity of viewpoint, speci
fic proposed requirements.
Foreign languages, for instance,
may be rejected as superfluous in
an English-speaking world, or
recommended as providing a
necessary perspective on our own
language and a buffer against pro
vincialism.
Considering the SES proposal
for freshman tutorials itself in
volves various problems, including
the practical question of recruit
ing an appropriate group of teach
ers, and the tactical problem of
the best context and approach for
teaching writing.
(A central portion of the two-day Con
ference on Educational objectives is to
morrow's panel discussions. To inform
the University community of the scope
of considerations involved, THE
DAILY asked each panel to discuss the
central topics of their deliberations. A
list of times, places, and panel mem
bers will appear in tomorrow's
DAILY.—Ed.)
Freshman Year
The panel on Freshman Year
will consider SES recommen
dations for a one semester
"writing experience (!)" and a one
semester course in "historical
studies."
Tiptoing through the tulips of
transition, Robert Polhemus, As
sociate Prof, of English and Direc
tor of Freshman English, feels
that the SES proposals will allow
students and teachers more free
dom of choice. Trampling through
the tulips, Anne Kostelanetz, As
sistant Prof, of English, believes
that there should be no require
ments at all.
Paul Seaver, Assistant Prof, of
History and Director of the
Western Civilization program, and
Oliver Holmes, History instructor,
are also included among the panel
ists. Mr. Holmes thinks that
Western Civilization should not be
compulsory for freshmen.
Another panelist is Sanford
Dornbusch, Prof, of Sociology
and Director of the Freshmen
Seminars, who declared, "I do not
accept the idea that the freshman
year can be dramatically changed

Discussion of the quarter vs the
semester system in Stanford's aca
demic configuration has drawn
particular attention. In a sense,
the final decision in this area will
have a great impact on many
other academic considerations.
Prof. Donald Kennedy of
biology points out that the first
six recommendations contained in
the SES report on undergraduate
curriculum are closely tied to pro
posals 17-20 in the same report.
Aside from this problem of
separation, Kennedy suggests that
there is a need to insure that the

freedom of action guaranteed in
the calendar and schedule pro
posals is not unnecessarily
abridged in other proposals.
The SES report suggests that
the structured quarter or semester
does not allow sufficient time for
independent or honors work or
self-directed work. It proposes
that dead week would offer an op
portunity for intensive study and
reflection.
Assistant Prof, of Electrical En
gineering Michael Arbib will re
flect on his experiences with both
the quarter and the semester
system in this country and in
Australia.
The course credit system raises
additional considerations. Arbib
suggests that the SES proposal
offers little clue as to how credit
"should be determined by the in
dividual instructor, subject to de
partmental approval," especially
when courses are compared to
each other.
Finally, there are consider
ations of class scheduling. Depart
ments need to consider coordin
ation of their time listings with
those of other departments.
Special Programs
Dean Lawrence Ryan will
present a description of current
programs and speak to the prob
lems of financing other efforts of
the same nature. Dean Robert
Hind, who was on the SES Steer
ing Committee, will contribute
general observations on the possi
bilities for success of the various
proposals.
Also commenting on the
general philosophy of the idea of
special programs will be David
Pugh, a junior political science
major and a member of SDS.
David Grey, Assistant Prof, of
communications, will speak about
the interdisciplinary social

sciences programs and the rele
vance of off-campus work to a
student's overall studies.
A description of the engine
ering "design your own major"
option will be given by Eckhard
Schulz, a graduate student in
electrical engineering. He will also
present a criticism of the work
study and honors co-op programs.
Two student members of the
panel will discuss proposals for
new programs. Mike Menke, a
physics graduate student who was
on the SES Steering Committee,
will present the model of the Edu
cation College. Another idea, the
Institute of Student Affairs, will
be proposed by Pat Shea, a junior
who worked with the Coalition in
getting a student voice in SES de
liberations.
Examinations
and Grading
Grading
1. The only grades given are A,
B, C and Pass.
2. There are no D, F, or Fail
grades; if a student does not com
plete a course satisfactorily, he
gets no credit for it toward gradu
ation.
3. Courses can be taken over
to improve a grade.
4. Any course can be taken on
a Pass option with the instructor's
consent.
5. Credit for a course can be
earned by a written or oral ex
amination or by completion of
other specified criteria.
Examinations
1. The faculty uses essay ex
aminations, take home examin
ations, and papers where they are
appropriate.
2. Faculty members have two
weeks after a final exam before
turning in grades.

Fraternities
What should be the role of the
fraternity at Stanford? Should
they continue to exist as they are
now, should they be forced to
change some of their procedures
and programs?
Or should fraternities be
abolished all-together?
The SES report has stated that
the fraternities have severe short
comings, including racial dis
crimination, the "promotion, in
many instances, of an anti
intellectual atmosphere quite out
of keeping in a university," and
unfair selection procedures.
The report recommends that
the fraternities take immediate
action to end discrimination, take
positive steps to adopt in-house
programs and service activities,
and be required to adopt a mutual
preference system for selecting
members.
Should these recommendations
bf> nut into effect?
Campus
Community
". . . Stanford, because of its
solitude, has a unique opportunity
to create an academic community
in which buildings, service facili
ties, and cultural programs con
tribute to the education of those
who use them."
Our panel will begin with this
statement from the SES report
and move out from it to a con
sideration of specific proposals
which will seek to further a sense
of community at Stanford.
Should a "Main Street" be
tween Dinkelspiel and Campus
Drive be constructed? What are
the architectural needs of the Uni
versity today?
Rather than "a suit of armor"
the University should have "a

modern suit of clothing, which
can be altered, mended, and re
placed when it has outlived its
utility."
We intend to extrapolate from
the aesthetics of the physical
plant to the feelings engendered in
the University populace by such
structures as the Faculty Club,
Tresidder Union, the Clubhouse,
the International Center, and the
Coffee House.
Distribution
Policies
and Requirements
The stresses encountered by
the individual freshman will be
discussed by Guy Browning,
Lecturer in Education and Assis
tant Director of the Coseling and
Testing Center.
Student opinion will be re
flected by Jeffrey Kane, a senior
majoring in physiological psy
chology, who speaks persuasively
against requirements, and by
Geoffrey White, a junior in politi
cal science, who is concerned
about the departmental structure
of the freshman year. The inside
view will be presented by a fresh
man, Greg Larsen.
In a fractionated society of
specialists, the University stands
in the place of mediator between
two radically different education
al ideals: the development of the
often specialized interests and po
tentials of each individual, and the
exposure of all students to the
wide variety of concerns which
make up our society as a whole.
An intelligent person, besides
knowing himself and his particular
subject, needs to be able to com
municate effectively with others,
necessarily radically different indi
viduals. The panel will attempt to

air and explore the conflicts be
tween specialization and generali
zation as they relate to the con
cept of "General Studies," to
specific distributional require
ments, and to the proportional
concentration in a major field of
study.
On the most basic level, the
panel represents diverse opinions
as to the ideal means of generali
zing education.
Some support various re
castings of the traditional view
that students must be exposed to
a "common body of knowledge,"
a view which stresses a balance of
subject matter. Others emphasize
the need for exposure, not to
specific factual and interpretive
subject matter, but to the various
disciplines' methods of perceiving
and interpreting our natural and
cultural environment.
Others assert the need to intro
duce students to particularly fine
teachers or noted scholars as a
sort of baptism-by-fire into vari
ous academic disciplines as speci
fic men embody and employ
them.
The panel will also consider,
with various degrees of precision
and diversity of viewpoint, speci
fic proposed requirements.
Foreign languages, for instance,
may be rejected as superfluous in
an English-speaking world, or
recommended as providing a
necessary perspective on our own
language and a buffer against pro
vincialism.
Considering the SES proposal
for freshman tutorials itself in
volves various problems, including
the practical question of recruit
ing an appropriate group of teach
ers, and the tactical problem of
the best context and approach for
teaching writing.
(A central portion of the two-day Con
ference on Educational objectives is to
morrow's panel discussions. To inform
the University community of the scope
of considerations involved, THE
DAILY asked each panel to discuss the
central topics of their deliberations. A
list of times, places, and panel mem
bers will appear in tomorrow's
DAILY.—Ed.)
Freshman Year
The panel on Freshman Year
will consider SES recommen
dations for a one semester
"writing experience (!)" and a one
semester course in "historical
studies."
Tiptoing through the tulips of
transition, Robert Polhemus, As
sociate Prof, of English and Direc
tor of Freshman English, feels
that the SES proposals will allow
students and teachers more free
dom of choice. Trampling through
the tulips, Anne Kostelanetz, As
sistant Prof, of English, believes
that there should be no require
ments at all.
Paul Seaver, Assistant Prof, of
History and Director of the
Western Civilization program, and
Oliver Holmes, History instructor,
are also included among the panel
ists. Mr. Holmes thinks that
Western Civilization should not be
compulsory for freshmen.
Another panelist is Sanford
Dornbusch, Prof, of Sociology
and Director of the Freshmen
Seminars, who declared, "I do not
accept the idea that the freshman
year can be dramatically changed
without massive influsions of
»nr»nev. M
University Housing
The SES proposals on universi
ty housing are largely noncontro
versial but do offer with a wide
range of suggestions.

Central to the proposals is the
requirement that the University
continue to maintain a variety of
residence opportunities. At the
same time, there is a need to de
crease crowded conditions in Uni
versity Residences.
Ed Nelson, president of Stan
ford's chapter of the American
Federation of Teachers, will com
ment on the need for increased
graduate student housing. He will
emphasize the nature of the situ
ation which his group has termed
a "crisis."
Co-op housing, something not
extensively explored in the SES
report, will be a further focus of
attention for panel members.
The pros and cons of co-ed
housing will receive detailed de
liberation. Panel members bring a
great deal of personal experience
to this particular area.
Finally, the panel hopes to dis
cuss various means of integrating
freshmen into various living ar
rangement. Panel moderator Barry
Askinas, a graduate student in
sociology, maintains that there is
a pressing need for steps in this
J ircction.

gineering Michael Arbib will re
flect on his experiences with both
the quarter and the semester
system in this country and in
Australia.
The course credit system raises
additional considerations. Arbib
suggests that the SES proposal
offers little clue as to how credit
"should be determined by the in
dividual instructor, subject to de
partmental approval," especially
when courses are compared to
each other.
Finally, there are consider
ations of class scheduling. Depart
ments need to consider coordin
ation of their time listings with
those of other departments.
Special Programs
Dean Lawrence Ryan will
present a description of current
programs and speak to the prob
lems of financing other efforts of
the same nature. Dean Robert
Hind, who was on the SES Steer
ing Committee, will contribute
general observations on the possi
bilities for success of the various
proposals.
Also commenting on the
general philosophy of the idea of
special programs will be David
Pugh, a junior political science
major and a member of SDS.
David Grey, Assistant Prof, of
communications, will speak about
the interdisciplinary social

sciences programs and the rele
vance of off-campus work to a
student's overall studies.
A description of the engine
ering "design your own major"
option will be given by Eckhard
Schulz, a graduate student in
electrical engineering. He will also
present a criticism of the work
study and honors co-op programs.
Two student members of the
panel will discuss proposals for
new programs. Mike Menke, a
physics graduate student who was
on the SES Steering Committee,
will present the model of the Edu
cation College. Another idea, the
Institute of Student Affairs, will
be proposed by Pat Shea, a junior
who worked with the Coalition in
getting a student voice in SES de
liberations.
Examinations
and Grading
Grading
1. The only grades given are A,
B, C and Pass.
2. There are no D, F, or Fail
grades; if a student does not com
plete a course satisfactorily, he
gets no credit for it toward gradu
ation.
3. Courses can be taken over
to improve a grade.
4. Any course can be taken on
a Pass option with the instructor's
consent.
5. Credit for a course can be
earned by a written or oral ex
amination or by completion of
other specified criteria.
Examinations
1. The faculty uses essay ex
aminations, take home examin
ations, and papers where they are
appropriate.
2. Faculty members have two
weeks after a final exam before
turning in grades.

Fraternities
What should be the role of the
fraternity at Stanford? Should
they continue to exist as they are
now, should they be forced to
change some of their procedures
and programs?
Or should fraternities be
abolished all-together?
The SES report has stated that
the fraternities have severe short
comings, including racial dis
crimination, the "promotion, in
many instances, of an anti
intellectual atmosphere quite out
of keeping in a university," and
unfair selection procedures.
The report recommends that
the fraternities take immediate
action to end discrimination, take
positive steps to adopt in-house
programs and service activities,
and be required to adopt a mutual
preference system for selecting
members.
Should these recommendations
bf> nut into effect?
Campus
Community
". . . Stanford, because of its
solitude, has a unique opportunity
to create an academic community
in which buildings, service facili
ties, and cultural programs con
tribute to the education of those
who use them."
Our panel will begin with this
statement from the SES report
and move out from it to a con
sideration of specific proposals
which will seek to further a sense
of community at Stanford.
Should a "Main Street" be
tween Dinkelspiel and Campus
Drive be constructed? What are
the architectural needs of the Uni
versity today?
Rather than "a suit of armor"
the University should have "a

modern suit of clothing, which
can be altered, mended, and re
placed when it has outlived its
utility."
We intend to extrapolate from
the aesthetics of the physical
plant to the feelings engendered in
the University populace by such
structures as the Faculty Club,
Tresidder Union, the Clubhouse,
the International Center, and the
Coffee House.
Distribution
Policies
and Requirements
The stresses encountered by
the individual freshman will be
discussed by Guy Browning,
Lecturer in Education and Assis
tant Director of the Coseling and
Testing Center.
Student opinion will be re
flected by Jeffrey Kane, a senior
majoring in physiological psy
chology, who speaks persuasively
against requirements, and by
Geoffrey White, a junior in politi
cal science, who is concerned
about the departmental structure
of the freshman year. The inside
view will be presented by a fresh
man, Greg Larsen.
In a fractionated society of
specialists, the University stands
in the place of mediator between
two radically different education
al ideals: the development of the
often specialized interests and po
tentials of each individual, and the
exposure of all students to the
wide variety of concerns which
make up our society as a whole.
An intelligent person, besides
knowing himself and his particular
subject, needs to be able to com
municate effectively with others,
necessarily radically different indi
viduals. The panel will attempt to

air and explore the conflicts be
tween specialization and generali
zation as they relate to the con
cept of "General Studies," to
specific distributional require
ments, and to the proportional
concentration in a major field of
study.
On the most basic level, the
panel represents diverse opinions
as to the ideal means of generali
zing education.
Some support various re
castings of the traditional view
that students must be exposed to
a "common body of knowledge,"
a view which stresses a balance of
subject matter. Others emphasize
the need for exposure, not to
specific factual and interpretive
subject matter, but to the various
disciplines' methods of perceiving
and interpreting our natural and
cultural environment.
Others assert the need to intro
duce students to particularly fine
teachers or noted scholars as a
sort of baptism-by-fire into vari
ous academic disciplines as speci
fic men embody and employ
them.
The panel will also consider,
with various degrees of precision
and diversity of viewpoint, speci
fic proposed requirements.
Foreign languages, for instance,
may be rejected as superfluous in
an English-speaking world, or
recommended as providing a
necessary perspective on our own
language and a buffer against pro
vincialism.
Considering the SES proposal
for freshman tutorials itself in
volves various problems, including
the practical question of recruit
ing an appropriate group of teach
ers, and the tactical problem of
the best context and approach for
teaching writing.
(A central portion of the two-day Con
ference on Educational objectives is to
morrow's panel discussions. To inform
the University community of the scope
of considerations involved, THE
DAILY asked each panel to discuss the
central topics of their deliberations. A
list of times, places, and panel mem
bers will appear in tomorrow's
DAILY.—Ed.)
Freshman Year
The panel on Freshman Year
will consider SES recommen
dations for a one semester
"writing experience (!)" and a one
semester course in "historical
studies."
Tiptoing through the tulips of
transition, Robert Polhemus, As
sociate Prof, of English and Direc
tor of Freshman English, feels
that the SES proposals will allow
students and teachers more free
dom of choice. Trampling through
the tulips, Anne Kostelanetz, As
sistant Prof, of English, believes
that there should be no require
ments at all.
Paul Seaver, Assistant Prof, of
History and Director of the
Western Civilization program, and
Oliver Holmes, History instructor,
are also included among the panel
ists. Mr. Holmes thinks that
Western Civilization should not be
compulsory for freshmen.
Another panelist is Sanford
Dornbusch, Prof, of Sociology
and Director of the Freshmen
Seminars, who declared, "I do not
accept the idea that the freshman
year can be dramatically changed
without massive influsions of
»nr»nev. M
University Housing
The SES proposals on universi
ty housing are largely noncontro
versial but do offer with a wide
range of suggestions.

Central to the proposals is the
requirement that the University
continue to maintain a variety of
residence opportunities. At the
same time, there is a need to de
crease crowded conditions in Uni
versity Residences.
Ed Nelson, president of Stan
ford's chapter of the American
Federation of Teachers, will com
ment on the need for increased
graduate student housing. He will
emphasize the nature of the situ
ation which his group has termed
a "crisis."
Co-op housing, something not
extensively explored in the SES
report, will be a further focus of
attention for panel members.
The pros and cons of co-ed
housing will receive detailed de
liberation. Panel members bring a
great deal of personal experience
to this particular area.
Finally, the panel hopes to dis
cuss various means of integrating
freshmen into various living ar
rangement. Panel moderator Barry
Askinas, a graduate student in
sociology, maintains that there is
a pressing need for steps in this
J ircction.
Calendar
and Schedule
Discussion of the quarter vs the
semester system in Stanford's aca
demic configuration has drawn
particular attention. In a sense,
the final decision in this area will
have a great impact on many
other academic considerations.
Prof. Donald Kennedy of
biology points out that the first
six recommendations contained in
the SES report on undergraduate
curriculum are closely tied to pro
posals 17-20 in the same report.
Aside from this problem of
separation, Kennedy suggests that
there is a need to insure that the

freedom of action guaranteed in
the calendar and schedule pro
posals is not unnecessarily
abridged in other proposals.
The SES report suggests that
the structured quarter or semester
does not allow sufficient time for
independent or honors work or
self-directed work. It proposes
that dead week would offer an op
portunity for intensive study and
reflection.
Assistant Prof, of Electrical En
gineering Michael Arbib will re
flect on his experiences with both
the quarter and the semester
system in this country and in
Australia.
The course credit system raises
additional considerations. Arbib
suggests that the SES proposal
offers little clue as to how credit
"should be determined by the in
dividual instructor, subject to de
partmental approval," especially
when courses are compared to
each other.
