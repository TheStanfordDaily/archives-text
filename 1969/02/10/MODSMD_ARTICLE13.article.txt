## Profs Views 'Out Of Touch'? 
### 
Editor, THE DAILY:
I could not believe my eyes
when I read Visiting Prof. Tarn's
letter to The Daily, dated Feb. 3,
1969. Is it a clever joke or is Visit
ing Prof. Tam actually visiting us
from outer space for him to be so
out of touch with the rest of the
Chinese-Americans?
In accepting the insult that all
Chinese can be nothing other than
waiters or laundrymen, and still
think no injury is done, Prof.
Tam, whether he knows it or not,
is replaying the 19th C. Chinese
attitude of "pacifying" and "con
ciliating" the barbarians by ac
cepting their insults while still be
lieving himself in command of the
situation.
The Chinese in America, too,
have exerted, a century of "bitter
strength" in silence and often in
humiliation. Yet we Chinese are
never given the recognition for
our contributions to the wealth of
this nation, state, nor here, to
Leland Stanford.
Where would the Central Pac
ific Railroad be without the Chi
nese? Of all people, we are proud
to hold our heads high at Stanford
Univ., built from the vast railroad
fortune which Leland Stanford
derived from the sweat of the Chi
nese laborers he employed. But
where is there any recognition of
this significant fact? I searched in
vain at the Stanford Museum. Not
a hint that this empire was built
by yellow hands. Only the
"Golden Spike" stared back at me
mockingly.
Among the Chinese-Americans
of this generation, a new yellow
consciousness is emerging, which
will no longer keep us meek and
silent. Already at S.F. State Col
lege and U.C. Berkeley, Chinese-
American students are equal par
ticipants along with the Blacks
and Chicanos in the Third World
Liberation Front.
In conclusion, Prof. Tarn's at
titude is hardly representative of
the growing consciousness among
Chinese-Americans today. Rather,
it better typifies the brain-washed
Chinese in a by-gone era, infused
with inferiority and self-hatred for
his race. This alientation seems to
have resulted in him an emotional
blunting which has caused him to
accept with alacrity any insult by
the white man.

•A Chicken Majority?
Editor, THE DAILY:
Right. Here it is February 1969
and not too many people here like
the war. Few want to go through

it all over again in Thailand or
Laos, though the government is
working up to that. A lot of
people around here don't want
this university involved in the
economies and consequent wars
of the South East Asian nations.
That's fine, as far as it goes.
The trouble is, it doesn't go
very far. Nobody is visibly doing
anything to get Stanford out of
South East Asia except the Left.
And from people outside the Left,
we often hear that they support
our goals and some of our de
mands, but can't support our tac
tics. Sometimes our tactics are
lousy; we stay up long winter
nights worrying about them. But
all right, if you don't like this war
and won't like the next, stop talk
ing about why you don't like SDS
and do something yourself. Right
now it looks like the BSU's Leo
Basile is right. The problem that
he sees with the majority is not
that it's silent, but that it's
chicken.
Working against the war and its
causes is risky. You pay a price to
keep from going through some
things twice. To use some more
Dylan, it's better to take a few
risks than be stuck inside of Stan
ford with the Vietnam blues
again. People on the Left have
been through changes, struggling
to end this war. We sometimes get
tired of comments from the
bleachers. If you want to end the
war and get this university out of
the next one, we'd like to see
some action. After that, we can all
talk tactics.

• Believe It or Not
Editor, THE DAILY:
On Thursday, Feb. 6, 1969 I
opened my Daily to discover a
news release that had been written
last October. It concerned a Tres
idder art show which ran through
Nov. 8, 1968. The article was ob
viously meant to be printed be
fore the end of the show.
What could I conclude from
reading a news release published 3
months after it was written?
1. The Daily's deadlines are so
elastic that if you wait long
enough, anything you submit may
be published.
2. The Daily knows of the in
vention of a time machine with
which one can return to early
November, 1968 to see the show.
3. The person who chose to
run the article and the proof
reader have obviously not been to
Tresidder lately, for if they had
they would know that this exhibit
is not being displayed.

I realize the difficulties of run
ning a newspaper, but this kind of
an error is inexcusable.
Consider this to be a personal
invitation to The Daily staff and
the rest of the student body to see
the two photography shows now
at the Union. We are exhibiting
the works of Rosemarie Koch and
Andrew Libertone.
I can only speculate on what
will happen to my next news re
lease.

• Involvement Urged
Editor, THE DAILY:
This is an invitation to the
Stanford student body to become
involved in the educational lives
of young high school students. We
are interested in persons who are
willing to give of themselves ex
tensively in enabling young pri
marily students to obtain a
satisfying and quality education.
We are asking them to do much
more than merely tutor students
on a once per week basis. We are
asking for involvement; something
on the order of a Big Brother/Sis
ter program where communica
tion, mutual respect and personal
commitments are established and
maintained. We are very definitely
interested in having foreign stu
dents and former Peace Corps
members, as well as others, partic
ipate in the program. We feel that
information regarding diverse cul
tures and experiences from know
ledgable persons is a very impor
tant contribution to our goal of a
truly multi-cultural educational
program.

I sincerely hope there are Stan
ford students who have been
wondering "Where/How can I
contribute?" and will take this op
portunity to find out if this is in
deed their "thing." For those in
terested, please contact me by
telephone at 327-7100, Ext.
6619.

• More Representation
Editor, THE DAILY:
As you reported, I was recently
selected for the Political Science
Undergraduate Curriculum Com
mittee. I would like the university
community to know, however,
that I still believe students should
have more representation on this
committee and that the students
themselves should select student
members.

• Won't You Come Home?
Editor, THE DAILY:

we have one thing to say:
Tony! Please come HOME!
