## Pitzer's Letter 
### 
The following is a letter from President Kenneth
Pitzer:
Dean Thomas James, School of Education:
I am transmitting to you the report of the
Stanford Human Relations Commission in the
case of charges invloving Prof. Robert Koff. In
light of the initial publicity surrounding the case,
I think it is significant to note that the Commis
sion has found that "no general charge of racism
was made against Dr. Koff either in the state
ment of the Black Students Union or in Miss
Stevenson's testimony."
In the course of the Commission's consider
ations of this case, a question was raised concern
ing its jurisdiction in the area of professional
competence. I replied that the area was outside
the jurisdiction of the Commission, but if it
wished to raise questions of such nature, they
would be regarded as informal suggestions to ap
propriate administrative officers or faculty
bodies. In releasing the report for publication,
therefore, I want to make it clear that I consider
Recommendation number 1 and Findings num
ber 7 and 8 underlying it—none of which contain
mention of racial matters—to fall within the area
of professional competence.
Within the area of the Commission's jurisdic
tion, the findings are convincing to me and I ac
cept its recommendations. I hope you will take
appropriate steps to implement them.
