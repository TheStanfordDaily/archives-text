Report to President K.S. Pitzer
on charges against
Professor Robert Koff
I. REFERRAL OF CHARGES TO COM
MISSION
By letter dated January 15, 1969, addressed
to Assistant Provost James Simmons, a staff
member of the Human Relations Commission,
Mr. Frank Satterwhite made certain allegations
concerning an interview held on January 6, 1969,
between Dr. Robert Koff of the School of Edu
cation and Miss Clarissa Stevenson, an applicant
for admission to the Secondary Teacher Edu
cation Program (STEP).
A meeting to discuss these allegations was
held in the School of Education on January 17,
1969. Present at that meeting in addition to Dr.
Koff, Mr. Satterwhite and Assistant Provost Sim
mons, were Dean James of the School of Edu
cation, Vice Provost Packer, and Mr. Warren Hay
man, who was previously a recruiter for the
Secondary Teacher Education Program. As an
outgrowth of this meeting, Dr. Koff wrote a let
ter to Miss Stevenson, dated January 20, 1969, in
which he attempted to clear up misunderstand
ings resulting from their interview. However, the
meeting did not result in a resolution of the mat
ter satisfactory to all persons concerned.
Certain allegations about Dr. Koff's interview
with Miss Stevenson were made in a Statement of
the Black Students Union, published in the Stan
ford Daily on January 24, 1969 . . . On that same
date, President Pitzer requested the Human Re
lations Commission to investigate and report to
him on the charges against Dr. Koff contained in
the statement of the Black Students Union.
11. HEARING
An extensive hearing was held on January 31
and February 1, 1969. All nine members of the
Commission were present throughout the hear
ing.
Based upon testimony given at the hearing,
the following account is offered as background
for the findings set out below. No attempt shall
be made to summarize the testimony of each wit
ness. Instead, we shall develop an account of the
interview between Dr. Koff and Miss Stevenson
based primarily upon the statements of the two
participants, with supporting material from the
testimony of others that deals with the aftermath
of the interview, or its purpose and design.
The general type of interview in which Dr.
Koff and Miss Stevenson participated is designed
to evaluate candidates for admission to the
Secondary Teacher Education Program, which is
a Master's degree program in the Stanford School
of Education directed by Dr. Koff. It was empha
sized by several witnesses that this program has
rather special objectives compared with those of
analogous programs in other institutions. In par
ticular, the Secondary Teacher Education Pro
gram attempts to train teachers to deal effective
ly with the "disadvantaged child"; many, though
not all, of its internship placements are in school
systems in which a number of the children fall
into this category. The interview form worked
out to evaluate applicants . . . was prepared by
Dr. Koff in collaboration with Mr. Warren Hay
man and Mr. Cecil Shaw, both recruiters for the
Secondary Teacher Education Program.
We were told that many of the applicants to
this program have a strong desire to work with
disadvantaged children, or "in the ghetto," but

lack a real understanding of what problems are
encountered in such assignments. In the past, in
adequate screening has led to real difficulties for
teacher interns, some of whom have even experi
enced psychotic episodes. The five structured
questions on the interview form are designed to
probe the candidate's understanding of the prob
lems the candidate will encounter in such com
munities, and interviewers are conscious of this
objective in asking other questions as well. No
participant in the program, however, described
the interview as one in which a candidate is sub
jected to severe emotional pressure in order to
judge his or her reaction; it is not a "stress inter
view."
Normally, such interviews last half an hour or
less; they frequently take place away from the
Stanford campus, under the stringent time pres
sure of an appointment schedule. It is common
practice to ask candidates, after the part of the
interview dealing with the five structured ques
tions, if they have questions to ask of the inter
viewer. This transition is intended to signal the
end of the formal portion of the interview, but it
is not indicated in a consistent way. Various of
ficers and faculty members of the School of Edu
cation gave us different views of what would be
clear and unambiguous cues to terminate the for
mal interview. Most of them first mentioned such
strong verbal indications as "The interview is
now over; do you have any questions to ask
me? but some felt that the setting aside of
forms and pencil with a request for questions was
enough. At the end of the procedure, the inter
viewer's impressions are recorded on a series of
forms that include a semantic differential and a
recommendation form.
Dr. Koff testified that he had interviewed
some 40 students for the Secondary Teachers
Education Program since his association with it;
all of these were on a trip to the Midwest, and all
of the students interviewed, as far as he recalls,
were white.
Miss Stevenson called Dr. Koff during the
Christmas holidays to arrange an appointment.
Interviews are normally held on three dates
during Winter Quarter on the campus. However,
since Miss Stevenson was home on vacation from
Loretto Heights College in Denver to visit her
family in East Palo Alto, a special interview was
arranged for the morning of Monday, January 6,
at 8:30 in Dr. Koff's office. In part because there
were no classes or scheduled activities on that
day, the interview lasted for a much longer time
than usual—approximately 75 minutes.
Dr. Koff's testimony indicates that the first
portion of the interview—that devoted to the five
questions listed on the form—lasted about 15-20
minutes. Miss Stevenson's statements about this
period affirm that it was without incident; she
described Dr. Koff as having been "pleasant" and
"cordial." Only one discussion that concerned
Miss Stevenson took place during this early part
of the interview. This involved a description by
Dr. Koff of a black man, a Ph.D., who had occu
pied considerable time in a large meeting with
discussions of his own "identity" problems and
with "self-justifications." Miss Stevenson re
ported that she began to wonder, at this time,
whether she might have similar problems. Her
feeling, and it is consistent with her view of later
questions, was that Dr. Koff felt her to be
"middle class," and that he told the story in
order to make Miss Stevenson aware of the prob
lems a middle-class black person encounters in
identifying with his (her) own culture.
This first portion of the interview was termin
ated, according to Dr. Koff, by Wis laying aside
his pencil and saying "I have no more questions
for you. Would you like to ask me anything?
Miss Stevenson stated that she was entirely un
aware of any transition in the interview, and re
garded the entire session as continuous and "offi
cial." She asked a question about financial aid,
and requested a waiver of the $15.00 application
fee. A discussion followed in which Dr. Koff told
her, in effect, "If I could waive that application
fee for you, I could waive it for anyone." Miss
Stevenson testified that she regarded this as a
judgment of her own financial condition, i.e., "If
you are poor enough to require me to waive the
fee, then I would have to waive it for all our
applicants." Dr. Koff, who agrees as to the sub
stance of the remark, places it in an entirely dif
ferent context. He pointed out that he has
nothing to do with the application fee waiver; he
testified that he explained this to Miss Stevenson,
and that he used the phrase "If I could waive it
for you, I could waive it for anyone" to indicate
his lack of involvement with this operation.
This difference of impression was not re
stricted to the application fee, but concerned the
whole matter of financial aid. Miss Stevenson felt
that Dr. Koff was in some position of decision
with regard to fellowship support. Dr. Koff, on
the other hand, testified that he described to her
the kinds of support available, but indicated
clearly that the awards themselves were out of
his hands.
At an earlier point in the interview, Miss
Stevenson—apparently in response to a ques
tion—had stated she thought Baltimore was the
"worst ghetto" in the United States. A conver
sation, triggered in part by that observation and
in part by Dr. Koff's learning that Miss Stevenson
was a graduate of Ravenswood High School,
began over different "ghetto" communities. Dr.

Koff testified that in his view Miss Stevenson was
taking into account primarily social indices in de
fining the ghetto, and that he therefore tried to
indicate some primarily economic indices. It was
in this context, according to Dr. Koff, that a
series of questions or statements were raised,
which provided the main focus for our inquiry.
According to Miss Stevenson, Dr. Koff asked the
following question:
"Have you ever experienced life in a real
ghetto?
"Have you ever experienced the total despair
that a black man in Philadelphia or Baltimore
experiences?
"Have you ever not had a piece of meat on
the table for a period of months?
"Have you ever not had enough money to see
a dentist or a doctor?
"Have you ever not had enough money to buy
Tampax or sanitary napkins?
Each of these questions was interpreted by Miss
Stevenson as applying directly to her, i.e., as a
personal inquiry.
Dr. Koff, on the other hand, reported an en
tirely different intent and wording. He testified
that the questions were "rhetorical" and
"heuristic," designed only to bring out possible
economic indices of ghetto life. Dr. Koff de
scribed his objectives in this conversation in
terms of trying to instruct Miss Stevenson about
a quality of ghetto life to which she had been
paying inadequate attention—a discussion in
which, he said, the ghettos of Warsaw and Cal
cutta were also used as examples. He stated that
the questions or statements were put in a differ
ent way, e.g.,
"Do you know that there are people
who . . . ."
or
"There are people who . . . ."
He did not disagree with the content of the state
ments or questions, but he claimed that they
were stated in one of the above ways.
Dr. Koff did not recollect that he received any
answers to these questions or statements. Miss
Stevenson stated that she answered "no" to the
first two, and remained silent thereafter. She in
dicated that the questions were asked in quite
rapid sequence, and thut she was confused, "dis
appointed," and. "discouraged" after the first
two. Her reactions, she said, were in part due to
her high expectations of Stanford and of edu
cated people in general. These reactions also re
lated to a feeling that the interview was not going
well and might result in a failure of her appli
cation for admission.
Concerning the question dealing with Tampax
and sanitary napkins, Miss Stevenson testified
that she felt conscious of sexual overtones that
often, in her view, accompany relationships be
tween young black women and white men. Miss
Stevenson, in discussing this point, told us that
she has come to expect such overtones, but that
she was nonetheless shocked at the question. At
a later point in the interview, when Dr. Koff
made a remark about how busy interns are, Miss
Stevenson stated that she was apprehensive about
similar overtones. That remark was made in re
sponse to Miss Stevenson's question about the
possibility of part time work. Dr. Koff claims to
have replied that interns in the program often
said they "didn't have time to go to the bath
room." According to Miss Stevenson's testimony,
the statement was more direct and personal: "If
you are in this program, you won't have time to
pee."
Toward the end of the interview, as Dr. Koff
and Miss Stevenson were moving into the outer
office, the discussion about economic factors in
ghetto life was continued. Miss Stevenson testi
fied that at this point she made a statement in
which she cautioned Dr. Koff about the basis on
which he judged applicants. Dr. Koff commented
on the fact that Miss Stevenson wore contact
lenses, and said "Do you know that many people
in ghettos can't even afford corrective glasses?"
Miss Stevenson responded that she would like to
tell him how she got them, but at that point the
conversation was terminated. Dr. Koff thanked
her for the interview and conducted her out of
the room and over to the admissions office.
A student in the School of Education, who
had been waiting for Dr. Koff in his outer office
during the interview, testified that she heard
about five minutes of the discussion, including
Dr. Koff's comment about Miss Stevenson's con
tact lenses and the statement about corrective
glasses, described above. It was this student's im
pression that Dr. Koff was relaxed and pleasant,
though Miss Stevenson appeared somewhat agi
tated. This student felt that the remark about
corrective glasses was an illustration designed to
illuminate some previous point she hadn't heard,
and that there was a difference of opinion be
tween the two participants. Though she did not
hear Miss Stevenson's reply to the question about
corrective glasses, this student reported that she
sensed some disagreement about the issue. Ac
cording to her testimony, Dr. Koff terminated
the discussion with the statement "It's been an
interesting interview" (or words to that effect),
and Miss Stevenson did not demur. Dr. Koff
stated in addition that he invited Miss Stevenson
to visit him again if she had further questions;
Miss Stevenson confirmed this, but said she felt it
an "empty" invitation.
After the interview, Miss Stevenson testified,

she was distressed. She felt that Dr. Koff had
been implying that she was "not black enough,"
and that she had probably been rejected for ad
mission. The interview report filled out by Dr.
Koff immediately afterward indicates that he had
in fact recommended her for admission, and by
his own testimony he felt that the interview had
gone well. Miss Stevenson discussed the interview
wth her mother that afternoon and said that she
wanted to talk about the situation with some
body familiar with the interview procedures and
with Stanford. She therefore tried to reach
several people including Mr. Satterwhite on the
same day. Mr. Satterwhite was not in, so she left
a message, and called again two days later. On
Friday of the same week, they met and Miss
Stevenson reported her recollection of the inter
view to Mr. Satterwhite and wrote down a list of
the questions she had been asked. Mr. Satter
white's letter to Assistant Provost James Sim
mons, dated January 15, 1969, was based on this
written statement. A similar, but entirely verbal,
report was made to Mr. Warren Hayman later the
same day.
Witnesses from the School of Education testi
fied to Dr. Koff's competence, his academic
background, and his record. These witnesses were
asked about the appropriateness of the questions
allegedly asked, either (1) on the basis that they
were rhetorical in the sense described above, or
(2) on the basis that they were personal. One
witness felt that they were acceptable on either
basis, on the ground that in his view only a
trained social psychologist should determine
what is appropriate in an interview. Another felt
that the question about sanitary napkins and the
statement about not having time to go to the
bathroom were "indelicate," and, with respect to
the former, he would have chosen another idex
of economic deprivation.
111. FINDINGS
1. No general charge of racism was made
against Dr. Koff either in the statement of the
Black Students Union or in Miss Stevenson's
testimony. Therefore the Commission did not ad
dress itself to this point, and makes no finding on
it.
2. We find that Miss Stevenson understood
the entire 75-minute period to be a continuous
screening interview, and that under the circum
stances most interviewees would have shared her
perception. Dr. Koff testified that after 15 to 20
minutes of structured interview he laid aside his
pencil, said he had no more questions and asked
Miss Stevenson if she had any questions. We find
that such a signal is clearly inadequate to termin
ate an interview and indicate that an informal
conversation is beginning.
3. There is a definite conflict in the testi
mony as to the manner in which the series of five
points admittedly discussed during the interview
(see above) were raised by Dr. Koff. We are un
able to conclude whether these subjects were in
troduced as "rhetorical" questions or "heuristic"
statements, or as direct questions to Miss Steven
son calling for answers based on her own experi
ence.
4. We find that Miss Stevenson was subjected
to undue psychological stress during the inter
view, for the following reasons:
a. the discussion of ghetto life immediate
ly following her question on financial aid led
her to conclude that Dr. Koff thought her in
sufficiently needy to qualify for aid;
b. the question (whether direct or rhetori
cal) about Tampax and sanitary napkins and
the staement about not having time to go to
the bathroom (or "to pee") were indelicate
and inappropriate for such an interview and
led her,, as a black woman, to perceive the
discussion of such topics by a white man as
involving undue familiarity and intimacy;
c. the line of discussion concerning eco
nomic conditions in the ghetto was perceived
as a suggestion that she was "too middle
class" and "not black enough." Miss Steven
son found this line of discussion particularly
stressful, since she viewed it as a suggestion of
loss of contact with the black community and
as a suggestion that she was therefore at a
disadvantage in applying for the program. Dr.
Koff's comments about her dress, her contact
lenses and her origin in East Palo Alto rein
forced her understanding that her eligibility
for financial aid and her identity with the
black community were being challenged.
5. Although we find that Miss Stevenson was
subjected to undue psychological stress, we find
that Dr. Koff did not intend to inflict this stress.
Indeed, as shown by his own testimony and that
of Miss Stevenson and the student in the outer
office, Dr. Koff seemed entirely unaware of Miss
Stevenson's agitation.
6. We find that some of Dr. Koff's questions
and comments were perceived by Miss Stevenson
as being directed at her because of her race. In
that sense they were understood by her as having
racial overtones, since she expected and wished
to be dealt with as a student, rather than as a
black student.
We find that Dr. Koff's behavior in this admis
sion interview may best be attributed to his ex
cessive zeal in the recruitment of this particular
applicant for the Secondary Teacher Education
Program. Though such zeal may be commendable
in general, in this instance it led Dr. Koff to treat

this admission interview as if it were a counseling
session for a student already enrolled in the pro
gram. The fusion of interview and counseling un
derstandably produced a slate of confusion in a
young woman who, under the stress of an appli
cation interview, could not be expected to differ
entiate direct questioning from gratuitous coun
seling.
We were unable to reach agreement on the
meaning of the charge that Miss Stevenson was
subjected to "subtle racist innuendo." However,
our findings about what occurred in the inter
view lead us to conclude that there was nothing
in Dr. Koff's questions and comments that was
intentionally deprecatory of black people.
7. We find that Dr. Koff's conduct of the
interview was inappropriate in that:
a. there was no clear-cut discontinuity be
tween the structured portion of the interview
and the portion Dr. Koff considered to be in
formal conversation;
b. the question (whether direct or rhetori
cal) about sanitary napkins and the statement
about going to the bathroom were indelicate
and out of place.
8. In addition, we find that Dr. Koff's be
havior in the interview was extremely insensitive
in that:
a. he conducted a lengthy portion of it
without attempting to elicit a response from
Miss Stevenson or to assess her feelings;
b. there was no per :eption on his part of
Miss Stevenson's feelings during much of the
interview.
IV. RECOMMENDATIONS
1. On the basis of the above findings, we
recommend that Dr. Koff not interview appli
cants for admission to the Secondary Teacher
Education Program. His insensitivity to the appli
cant's anxiety and to her reaction to his line of
inquiry raises serious questions about his appro
priateness as an interviewer.
2. We further recommend that the partici
pation and utilization of minority-group persons
in the School of Education be expanded. The
increasing involvement of the Secondary Teacher
Education Program and other programs with the
education of minority-group children and with
minority communities makes such expansion
essential.
3. Finally, we recommend that all present in
terviewers for the Secondary Teacher Education
Program review this report of the circumstances
of Dr. Koff's interview with Miss Stevenson, in
order to prevent the recurrence of such unfortun
ate incidents.
