I am pleased that the Commission and all
parties agree I am in no sense a racist.
However, I disagree with many things in the
Commission's report. Furthermore, I come away
from this experience most apprehensive for the
next person caught in the impossible position of
having to prove his innocense of charges arising
from a private, unrecorded interview. That per
f s dilemma will be further compounded if, as
I . d, he has to make such proof to a tribunal
which has not yet adopted procedures which
contain the due process safeguards all should ex
pect in such a situation.
Nonetheless, it is important that we look to
the future; steps must be taken to insure that
misunderstandings of the sort that occurred in
this instance should not occur again. For my
part, I now intend to get on with my continuing
Â»sk of making the Secondary Teacher Education
jgram and other programs within the School
x Education available and responsive to the
needs of minority students.
