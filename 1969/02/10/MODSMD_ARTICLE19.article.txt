BERLIN ( AP)—Communist
East Germany announced Sunday
it would bar West German state
and federal delegates from travel
ing to Communist-ringed West
Berlin where they are scheduled
to elect a new federal president
March 5.
The official news agency ADN
said the restictions would be ef
fective Feb. 15. It made no
mention of air links between the
West and Berlin, and most Federal
Assembly delegates were expected
to fly across the 110 miles that
separate the city from the West.
President Nixon, scheduled to
visit West Berlin Feb. 27 on his
European tour, could find himself
in the middle of a bitter confron
tation.
The West German government
denounced the East German move
as "aggressive and peace
disrupting." A spokesman in Bonn
declared: "The federal govern
ment is determined, together with
its allies, to take all necessary

measures to strengthen the via
bility of Berlin."
Representatives of the United
States. Britain and France—which
have responsibilities in West Berlin
under post-World War II agree
ments-conferred in Bonn to draft
a statement described as firm but
"low-key." It was not expected to
be published before Monday,
In Washington, neither the
State Department nor the White
House had any comment on the
Communist restrictions, but De
fense Secretary Melvin R. Laird
said: "It is not a matter directly
concerning us."
• Israel Will Wait
JERUSALEM (AP)—lsrael an
nounced Sunday it would wait
three months before putting into
effect a law which led Jordan to
demand a meeting of the U.N.
Security Council. It would bring
Arab merchants in the Old City
under Israeli control.

Diplomatic observers at the
United Nations said they expected
Jordan would press ahead with its
demand for the emergency meet
ing, despite the new date when
Arab companies must join the
Israeli business register.
Originally, Israel had said the
law would go into effect Feb. 23.
After Jordan called for the meet
ing of the Security Countil, Israel
said it would delay enforcement
of the law until May 23.
Jordan's ambassador to the
United Nations, Nuhammad el-
Farrah, charged Saturday that
Israel was trying to put through
"legislation designed to destroy
the character of the city and in
corporate the Arab life and insti
tutions into Israeli life."
• Antiballistic Missiles
WASHINGTON (AP)-
Secretary of Defense Melvin R.

Laird hinted Sunday that work
may be resumed on the contro
versial "thin" antiballistic missile
system. It was suspended recently
for further study.
Laird said The Soviet Union "is
escalating the arms race" and "has
been for the past 24 months."
He added that there has been
no decision to abandon the
Sentinel antimissile system on
which work has been halted
pending a re-study of the whole
question.
Laird declared that if he was
going to err in the area of defense
spending it would be on the side
of "sufficient and adequate mili
tary power to ensure peace," in
cluding in Southeast Asia.
• LB J: Chicago 'Tragic'
NEW YORK (APy-Former
President Lyndon B. Johnson, in
an interview he granted just be

fore leaving office, said that
"without question, the bloodshed
and terror in the streets of
Chicago was a tragic, horrible
thing."
In an article in the March issue
of True Magazine, Johnson is
quoted as saying, "At the outset, I
sympathized with the objectives
on both sides of the confron
tation . . .The violent confron
tation that occurred is a sad lesson
in what happens when decent
people on both sides abandon re
straint and understanding . .
Johnson admitted he had failed
to communicate with young
people.
"I would give us a decent grade
for our efforts," he said, "but a
poor grade on our effectiveness."
He said the protests of young
people stemmed not from the
Vietnam war itself, but from the
youths' feeling that "democratic
channels were not adequate for
the expression of .. .disagree
ment."
