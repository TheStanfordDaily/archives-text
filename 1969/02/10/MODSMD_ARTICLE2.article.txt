# Poli Sci Approves New Course Policy
## 
### DENNIS PERLUSS 
Political science faculty members
adopted last week new policies regard
ing graduate student-led courses.
At its regular meeting last Wednes
day, the department voted to adopt new
guidelines governing the conditions
under which faculty members may dele
gate to graduate students responsibility
for teaching a directed reading course
for credit.
The department faculty also ap
proved the establishment of a commit
tee of six faculty members, two gradu
ate students, and two undergraduates
majoring in political science to recom
mend action on such course proposals.
Reaction from students was swift to
the department's actions. TA Richard
Young termed the committee structure
"tokenism of the most archaic sort."
David Pugh, undergraduate in political
science, declared that sÂ«..ch a structure
"is not near to being a legitimate body."
Approved In Principle
The department decisions came three
weeks after the department had unani
mously passed a resolution which ap
proved the principle that both graduate
students and undergraduates should be
represented on the department commit
tee which considers courses initiated
and taught by students.
During the intervening three weeks
the department's Plans and Policies
Committee considered various proposals
for the membership of that committee.
Four undergraduates had presented
to the department meeting of January
15 a plan which called for a committee
of three faculty members, three gradu
ate students, and three undergraduates.
The Political Science Graduate Student
Association had submitted a proposal
for four faculty members, two grad stu
dents and two undergraduates.
The proposal finally adopted calls for
the two graduate students to be elected
by department graduate students, with
the admonition that the graduate stu
dents will be chosen at random if none
are elected. Undergraduate members of
the committee will be selected at ran
dom from among undergraduate majors,
with membership given to the first two
students willing to serve.
Faculty representation on the com
mittee consists of the chairman and di
rectors of graduate and undergraduate
studies in the department, with these
three selecting the other three faculty
committee members.
Criticizing the decision which re

sulted from the deliberation, Young de
clared, "Since the committee structure
denies significant student represen
tation, the faculty perhaps would have
been wiser in avoiding a convuluted
structure that will only raise charges of
hypocracy."
He continued that the probable
graduate student response will be to re
fuse to elect members to the committee
and to refuse to serve on it. TA Bill Mor
concurred that he expected general in
dignation on the part of undergraduates
and graduates alike.
Prof. Richard Brody, chairman of the
Plans and Policies Committee, explained
that his committee tried to satisfy both
the recognized need to include students
and the need to have members of the
committee who were qualified to evalu
ate the quality of the proposed courses.
Stating that the new committee will
serve as a basis for communication,
Brody pointed out that the objection
that the committee is faculty-controlled
is based on the fear that the professors
will vote as a block on all matters. Such
an assumption, he contended, is utterly
false.
Already Taught
The new course guidelines provide
that no delegated, directed reading
course will be approved if a similar
course is offered in the University and is
generally available to undergraduates, or
if a member of the department is willing
to teach such a course.
For a course to be considered for ap
proval, a regular departmental faculty
member, qualified in the subject matter
of the proposed course, must agree to
act as sponsor.
The graduate student proposing to
teach the course must be qualified in
the subject matter; and he must submit
a brief statement indicating the objec
tives of the course, a course outline, and
a list of required reading to the faculty
sponsor for his approval.
Pugh criticized the department for
maintaining the criterion of course
dissimilarity. He explained that students
might desire a course about Marxism
taught by a marxist. A course given by
Prof. Robert North was not the same
thing, he claimed.
Raymond Wolfinger, chairman of the
Undergraduate Curriculum Committee,
stated that decisions about similarity
will be made only after examination of
the detailed proposal for the course, in
cluding the outline and reading list, not
on the basis of its title.
