"Often we have an ample num
ber of applicants, but not enough
to give us a choice in selecting the
members. What we're actually
trying to do is change the nature
of the applicant pool so that we're
not pressured into selecting the
same type of people," said ASSU
President Denis Hayes.
Students don't seem to realize
that although there may be
enough applications, there often is
not enough variety in the appli
cants.
Four students are being sought

The first SES Floor Manage
ment Team, which will be re
