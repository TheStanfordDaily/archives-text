### 
A Stanford University student
drowned in San Francisquito
Creek at 4 p.m. Thursday after
noon, but his companion, the son
of Palo Alto City Councilman
John V. Beahrs reached safety
only after what his father called
"a last moment, super-human
burst of energy."
The two were riding a yellow,
4-man raft that was suddenly
sucked down in a vicious whirl
pool near the ridge of the Stan
ford golf course's fourth green.
The student who drowned was
identified as Arthur S. Yablonky,
25, a graduate student in psychi
atry at Stanford. Police said that
Yablonky's body apparently be
came entangled with the raft's
ropes when he and John O.

Beahrs, 28, a senior in Stanford
Medical School, were taken below
the water's surface.
Stanford police officer Ronald
Gregoire gave Yablonky 15 min
utes of closed heart massage and
members of the Menlo Park Fire
District worked at resuscitation.
Beahrs' father said the two
young men were wearing life pre
servers and remarked, "This only
proves that no one should try
going down that creek on a raft.
"A week ago I saw two boys,
and they were only 10 or 12 years
old, riding a raft down the water.
"This just proves that no mat
ter how much precaution you
take you can't be certain about
what might happen."
