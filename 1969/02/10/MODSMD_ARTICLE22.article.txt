# Stanford No Sanctuary
## Kaplan Discusses Pot Law 
### 
By LYNNE McCALLISTER
Prof. John Kaplan of the Law
School spoke at Dinkelspiel Audi
torium on Friday. Answering the
questions of Stanford students on
marijuana laws and their enforce
ment, he said that he did not be
lieve that Stanford should be a
sanctuary from the police.
Kaplan first discussed the cur
rent belief that Stanford should
be a sanctuary. The fact that Stan
ford is private property does not
mean that police are not per
mitted to come on campus.
If Stanford were a sanctuary,
any criminal could flee to the
campus and be safe from the
police.
He feels, however, that this is
also a moral question. The privi
leged students who can afford to
come to a private university
should not be exempt from laws
which are enforced in the rest of

the country. This would give just
one more right to the wealthy
classes. It would also leave the
burden of changing the marijuana
laws on those who did not have
the power to do so.
Before marijuana can be legal
ized, said Kaplan, two things must
be done. The first is to convince
people that it costs more than it is
worth to enforce the laws. The
second is that these who are
making the laws must be affected.
Change will come, he said, "when
their own kids start getting
busted."
Kaplan made fun of student
paranoia over recent arrests on
campus. "Most of you are under
the impression that they are try
ing to get you. In most cases they
are trying not to get you. They
are only interested in major solici
tors or in people who are selling
to high school kids or younger."

He said that the police arrested
Beta Chi fraternity brother
Robert Fink because they be
lieved that he was selling to high
school students. As for the belief
that there are student "Narcs" on
campus, Kaplan said that he
found it hard to believe "the
colossal naivete of the Stanford
student body." If narcotic agents
were on campus, he said, there
would have been far more arrests.
One of his objections to the
marijuana laws, Kaplan said, is
that "it turns a large section of
our population into criminals."
While it is illegal for the unversity
to ask its officials to ignore the
laws, he believes that they try to
use discretion.
It is also illegal for the police
to ignore marijuana. However, un
dercover agents are too expensive,
he said, to use for such violations.
