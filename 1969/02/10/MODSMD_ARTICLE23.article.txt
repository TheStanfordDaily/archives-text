# 'Oppressed' Women Forming Liberation Front On Campus
## 
### CICELY BATES 
"We've got to show women
that there's more in life than men
and babies," declared Marlene
Charyn of the Midpeninsula Ob
server to a small group of Stan
ford women who are considering
organizing a Women's Liberation
Front on campus.
The women gathered together
last Thursday night in response to
the growing r oeling that a new life
style is necessary if there is to be
an escape from male oppression.
Many of the discussed methods
for obtaining equality were similar
to the recent proposal passed by
the national council of the SDS
which was read at the meeting.
To gain more support for their
movement, several issues for
women to focus upon were sug
gested.
First was the issue of contra
ceptives. The women believed that
the Cowell Student Health Center
should a more liberal allocation
policy. The University was criti
cized for using "the club of preg
nancy to prevent what society
encourages—especially in its adver
tisements."
Present Policy
According to the head of the
Health Center, Dr. James
McClenahan, "while the present
policy of issuing contraceptives is
under review, the policy is to sell
them only to married students or

those about to be married." Un
married students may, however,
receive "contraceptive infor
mation" telling them what area
doctors will give them out.
The hiring of professors is
biased toward the male sex,
claimed the women. They cited
several married staff members as
examples—Professor Spindler of
anthropology, whose wife is only
a lecturer and research associate in
the same field; Professor
Drekmeier of political science,
whose wife is only a lecturer in
history.
Also discussed was the need for
a child day care center and an
equalizing of the male/female
ratio at Stanford.
Men Attacked
Men come under attack for
their treatment of the "fair sex."
One girl declared that men think
of women in terms of "objective
qualitites desired." A relationship
with a woman is vieved similarly
to owning a car. "Take good care
of her—keep up the mainten
ance—and she'll perform well."
Marriage can be limiting to
both the male and the female ac
knowledged another girl. The
woman thinks her sole role is to
serve the man and he thinks his
role is to take care of her.
Marriages among Stanford and
similarly educated couples came
under special degradation when

several women agreed that the
wife was merely making life a
little better for the science
oriented husband who was trained
in anti-humanistic ways.
Also discussed were the prob
lems of gaining employment and
admission to grad school. Because
employers and schools are afraid
that women may get pregnant or
married at any time, they are re
luctant to admit them into their
ranks. They want to be assured a
"return of investment" for their
efforts.

server to a small group of Stan
ford women who are considering
organizing a Women's Liberation
Front on campus.
The women gathered together
last Thursday night in response to
the growing r oeling that a new life
style is necessary if there is to be
an escape from male oppression.
Many of the discussed methods
for obtaining equality were similar
to the recent proposal passed by
the national council of the SDS
which was read at the meeting.
To gain more support for their
movement, several issues for
women to focus upon were sug
gested.
First was the issue of contra
ceptives. The women believed that
the Cowell Student Health Center
should a more liberal allocation
policy. The University was criti
cized for using "the club of preg
nancy to prevent what society
encourages—especially in its adver
tisements."
Present Policy
According to the head of the
Health Center, Dr. James
McClenahan, "while the present
policy of issuing contraceptives is
under review, the policy is to sell
them only to married students or

those about to be married." Un
married students may, however,
receive "contraceptive infor
mation" telling them what area
doctors will give them out.
The hiring of professors is
biased toward the male sex,
claimed the women. They cited
several married staff members as
examples—Professor Spindler of
anthropology, whose wife is only
a lecturer and research associate in
the same field; Professor
Drekmeier of political science,
whose wife is only a lecturer in
history.
Also discussed was the need for
a child day care center and an
equalizing of the male/female
ratio at Stanford.
Men Attacked
Men come under attack for
their treatment of the "fair sex."
One girl declared that men think
of women in terms of "objective
qualitites desired." A relationship
with a woman is vieved similarly
to owning a car. "Take good care
of her—keep up the mainten
ance—and she'll perform well."
Marriage can be limiting to
both the male and the female ac
knowledged another girl. The
woman thinks her sole role is to
serve the man and he thinks his
role is to take care of her.
Marriages among Stanford and
similarly educated couples came
under special degradation when

several women agreed that the
wife was merely making life a
little better for the science
oriented husband who was trained
in anti-humanistic ways.
Also discussed were the prob
lems of gaining employment and
admission to grad school. Because
employers and schools are afraid
that women may get pregnant or
married at any time, they are re
luctant to admit them into their
ranks. They want to be assured a
"return of investment" for their
efforts.
"We've got to show women
that there's more in life than men
and babies," declared Marlene
Charyn of the Midpeninsula Ob
server to a small group of Stan
ford women who are considering
organizing a Women's Liberation
Front on campus.
