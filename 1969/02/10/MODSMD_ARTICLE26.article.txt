## Movies Of The Week 
### TODD McCARTHY 
This week's films include the
best of the Marx Brothers, Eisen
stein, the Japanese cinema and
Belmondo. Not bad for a start.
Clive Miller will be showing
another one of his "favorite
double-bills" on Tuesday and
Wednesday nights in Geology 320.
The Ox-Bow Incident, a powerful
indictment of lynching laws, is
one of the most memorable films
to come out of Hollywood during

the forties. Starring Henry Fonda,
Dana Andrews and Anthony
Quinn, it was named 1943's best
picture by the National Board of
Review.
You Were Never Lovlier is an
entertaining Columbia musical
starring Fred Astaire and Rita
Hayworth. And if you've never
caught Clive's act at the films'
showings, do so soon, for he's
leaving for the Orient next quar
ter.
Eisentein's Ivan the Terrible,
parts One and Two, will be pre
sented by the history department
in Cubberley, with part One being
shown on Tuesday at 4:15 and
Wednesday at 7:30 and part Two
on Tuesday at 7:30 and Wednes
day at 4:15. Commissioned by
Stalin to make the picture,
Eisentein's eye for composition is
probably at its best herein, many
of the images being unforgettable.
War of the Buttons, directed
by Yves Robert, is Thursday's I-
Center film at Cubberley. This
French picture is concerned with
two rival boys' gangs who, to

avoid being plucked of their
buttons during combat, stage a
major battle "au natural." The
film received considerable critical
attention when released in Ameri
can in 1964.
Friday night offers two of the
greatest films ever made in their
respective genres. Rashomon,
being shown at Cubberley, won
the Grand Prize at the Venice
Film Festival and a special Oscar
in 1951. Probably the first Japan
ese film to attain "classic" stature,
it also introduced director Akira
Kurosawa and star Toshiro Mifune
to Western audiences.
Duck Soup is the Marx
Brothers' best film and could be
the funniest motion picture ever
made, bar none. Groucho is the
President of Freedonia and from
there, the hilarity is non-stop,
with the brothers running rampart
through their mythical country,
with no intrusions by snappy love
songs. Showing with it at Tre
sidder are two Chaplin shorts, The
Pawnshop and One A.M.
At Friday's experimental film
series in Geology 320 at 11 p.m.,
one of the underground's most
famous films is being shown.
Jonas Mekas' The Brig is a cinema
verite production of an actual per
formance of the play by the
Living Theatre and deals with
brutality and violence in a prison.
Shot in one evening's time, the
film won the award for best docu
mentary at 1964's Venice Film
Festival. Also showing is Stan
VanDer√üeek's films-within-a-film
Pastorale, It's All Over Now and
D'ETE.
Saturday's French cinema
series at Tresidder brings us Jean
Renoir's Picnic on the Grass.
Made in 1959 after the director's
return to Europe from the United
States, it was hailed by critic
Andrew Sarris as one of the major
works of the great artist.
The wonderfully funny That
Man From Rio is this Sunday's
flick at Mem Aud. Directed by
Philippe de Broca, this adventure
comdey offers Jean-Paul
Belmondo at his acrobatic best
and also stars the beautiful sister
of Catherine Deneuve, the late
Francoise Dorleac. It's quite a
show.
