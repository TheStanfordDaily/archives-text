# Up For SC Meet
## Swim Team Swamps Bruins 
### FRED MANN 
USC, Yale, and Indiana beware!
Stanford's nationally ranked varsity swim team is out for blood.
Coach Jim Gaughran's squad, which currently holds most of the
fastest times in the nation, went to work Saturday in the Encina
pools. The victim was always tough UCLA.
Last year, in Los Angeles, the Indians pulled out a one point win in
the next to last event. It was quite a different story this season.
The Bruins mustered only one victory in a swimming event, as
Stanford splashed their way to an impressive 80-30 triumph over the
wet and wailing Westwooders.
Ready for Trojans
The decisive win was especially important to the Tribe. Now they
are as psychologically ready as possible for the meet of the year this
Saturday. Southern California will invade The Farm and put their long
string of undefeated dual meets on the line. The meet which should be
a sellout will be shown on closed-circuit TV to any overflow crowd in
the Old Pavilion. Tickets for the live event are on sale.
After SC, the Stanford team travels back to New Haven to meet
Yale in the first ever meeting of these two swimming powers. In
pre-season polls, USC, Stanford and Yale were rated second, third,
and fourth respectively behind defending NCAA champs Indiana.
Fast Start
Getting back to UCLA, the meet was decided in the first half hour,
as Stanford got off to a fast start and never looked back. The opening
event, the 400 yard medley relay, was a good indication of things to
come.
Lead man, backstroker Fred Haywood, jumped off to a big lead,
but the Bruins closed in on the next two legs. Jeff Hammett swam
anchor, and put it away with a great burst. UCLA had two men
swimming the best times of their lives, but still were no match for the
Cards. The winning time was 3:37.0.
In the long 1000 freestyle, Stanford's Bert Mason came from be
hind to defeat Jeff Pugh of the Bruins, in 10:13.0, his best of the
season
Olympic bronze medal winner John Ferris dropped out of the race
earlv, fearing he was not getting enough air.
Brent Berk and Bob Jamison swept to the first of many one-two
finishes for Stanford in the 200 freestyle. Berk swam a 1:46.6, with
Jamison right on his heels in 1:47.8.

Rick Eagleston took a tight win in the 50 yard freestyle. He
sprinted the two laps in 22.3, off his best time, but good enough for a
win.
Captain Pete Siebert recorded the easiest victory of the afternoon
in the 200 individual medley. Siebert's time of 2:03.0 was more than
fast enough. Stanford's Jamie Knorr placed second.
Ferris came back to win the 200 butterfly, one of his specialities,
in 1:56.2, followed by Siebert with a 1:59.0. The Bruin entries were
nowhere near the finish.
Bob Jamison got into the victory act with his 47.8 win in the 100
free. Once again, Stanford was not satisfied with a mere win, but also
added the second place points to their column. Luis Nicolao placed in
48.3.
Misfire
In the 200 yard backstroke, Fred Haywood clearly jumped the gun
and laughed the length of the pool when the starter's pistol refused to
refire, signaling a false start. When the gun finally went off, the con
testants had already gone 25 meters.
The relaxed Haywood took advantage of the extra mileage traveled
by his opponents, and easily won the race after a second start, in a
time of 2:00.5.
Berk swam a seasonal best of 4:46.5 in winning the 500 free. Bert
Mason of the Tribe was a distant second with a 5:01.7.
Just when the Stanford victories were becoming delightfully
monotonous, UCLA captured their lone win in the 200 breaststroke.
Torrey Webb of the Bruins (2:17.7) took a three second victory over
Tag Leonard of the Tribe.
Stanford's 400 freestyle relay team was beaten in the closing min
utes of the meet, but not by UCLA. An Indian exhibition team nosed
out the regulars in a time of 3:13.6. The Bruins were not even close.
Diving Defeats
The only dark spot of the competition for Stanford was the diving,
where UCLA won both the one meter and three meter events.
On the first dive of the day, Stanford's Norris Heckel pulled a
shoulder muscle and was scratched from all further attempts.
The varsity was not the only winner Saturday. Stanford's great
frosh team destroyed College of the Sequoias, 94-19.
Mark Shelley swam an outstanding 200 freestyle in 1:49.6, and
Randy Wilkins was right behind with a 1:51.1. Dave Shilling went
2:03.1 in the 200 1.M., and Bob Bebb won the 100 free in 50.2.
