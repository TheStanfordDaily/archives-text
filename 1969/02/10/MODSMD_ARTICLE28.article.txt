# Free Shots Kill Last Place Cards
## 
### GARY CAVALLI 
The free throw holds a unique
place in American basketball.
It is not often that you hear a
team described as being "fantastic
from the foul line." And a player
does not earn much publicity by
being a good free thrower. Yet
this often overlooked aspect of
Dr. Naismith's popular sport has
become very important, painfully
so, for the Stanford varsity.
In two games last weekend,
Stanford somehow managed to
make only 26 of 54 free throws.
This is no ordinary accomplish
ment. For those of you not
mathematically inclined, it figures
out to 48.2 percent. Winning
teams do not shoot 48.2 percent
from the foul line.
The Indians lost the two games
by a total of three points.
P'riday night Oregon's Ducks,
who had not previously won a
league game, edged Stanford
74-72. The Ducks converted 18 of
25 free throws. Stanford hit 14 of
26.
Things went from bad to worse
the following evening, when Ore
gon State squeaked by the Indians
63-62. The Beavers, on the line
only once in the entire first half,
canned 11 of 16 attempts. Stan
ford managed but 12 of 28. You
needn't look any further for the
decisive factor in the ballgame.
The Indians were outsized in
both contests, but did a fine job
on the boards, outrebounding
both Oregon quintets. The Tribe
iilso shot well (50 percent Satur
day night) and had less turnovers
in each game. Stanford was lack
ing in only one department.
There's the rub.
The well-balanced Ducks took
control of matters early Friday
night, holding a six-to-eight-point
lead throughout most of the first
half. But with the score 30-24,
Oregon reeled off eight straight
points (six by reserve forward Len
Jackson) to make it 38-24. Only a
layin by Bill Palmer and two free
throws by Don Griffin in the
closing seconds enabled Stanford
to head for the dressing room
down by just 10.
Strong rebounding by Palmer,
and some clutch shooting by
Griffin and McElwain (who
finished with 16 points) keyed a
Stanford surge which cut the
Duck advantage to just 63-61
after 12 minutes of the second
half. Then Griffin was fouled
while making a long jumper, thus
having a chance to give Stanford
the lead for the first time since
Palmer's layin made it 2-0 in the
opening seconds. But Don missed
the charity, one of seven he failed
to hit, setting a pattern which
would be followed throughout the
remaining eight minutes.
For the next five minutes the
game was knotted up so many
times that it would've taken an
Eagle Scout to untie things.
Griffin kept Stanford even,
matching baskets with Oregon's
flick Abrahmson, Stan Love and

Larry Holliday. But Abrahmson
hit a jumper and former Del Marh
High School star Bill Drozdiak
buried a turnaround shot to give
Oregon a 73-69 bulge.
A Griffin free throw and a tip
in by Mike Michel cut it to 73-72,
but Abrahmson hit a charity to
give the Ducks a 74-72 lead with
just under two minutes left.
Neither team scored again.
Stanford began working the
ball for a basket, then Abrahmson
fouled Griffin on the dribble, put
ting Don in a one-and-one situ
ation. But Grif's shot was inches
off to the side, and Love clutched
the rebound.
With 80 seconds on the clock,
Oregon went into a stall, and
Griffin fouled Jackson. Jackson's
free throw came off long, and
Griffin grabbed the bound with
55 seconds left.
The Indians worked the ball
for 17 seconds, then called a time
out when no one could get free
for a shot. Things didn't improve
any after the time out, as Ore
gon's tight man-to-man defense
blanketed all Stanford movement.
Griffin, who would up with a
game high of 28 points, forced up
a jumper with three seconds show
ing on the clock, but it was off
the mark. The rebound fell into
Holliday's hands, and Stanford
fell into the Pacific-8 cellar.
Saturday night the Indians
went five minutes without a field
goal, as the Beavers jumped off to
a quick 10-point lead. But Griffin,
Michel, McElwain and Palmer all

began to hit consistently, and
Stanford moved into a 31-27 lead
with one minute left in the half.
OSU's 7-0 center Vic Bartolome
and 6-9 forward Gary Freeman
each scored in the waning seconds
to effect a 31-31 deadlock at half
time.
In 20 minutes Stanford had hit
13 of 21 shots from the floor, but
only 5 of 14 from the foul line.
Neither team led by more
than four points in the second
half. The lead changed hands
more times than an anti-war peti
tion at an SDS rally.
Freeman kept popping in 20
foot jumpers from the corner,
while quick Mike Markham
wafted in four 25-foot sets for
OSU. McElwain (who again tallied
16) used the backboard to bank in
three jumpers, while 6-2 Bill Halli
gan (playing in place of Dennis
O'Neill) connected on two
straight jumpers for Stanford.
Stanford led for the last time
when Griffin converted a three
point play after a sensational
drive, to make it 49-48. But six
points the big man—
Bartolome—and a tip in by the
ever-present Freeman sparked the
Beavers to a 58-55 lead.
Two missed free throws by Pal
mer with three minutes remaining
didn't prove costly, as McElwain
got the rebound off the second
miss and passed to Michel, who
hit a short jumper. Freeman's free
throw made it 59-57, but seconds
later he fouled out of the game.
Palmer, who had been hacked in

the act of shooting, went to the
line for two.
Up to this point Bill had made
just one of six from the line, but
he hit the first shot. The second
one was off, and in the ensuing
melee for the rebound, McElwain
was whistled for a foul. Bartolome
sank both ends of the one-and
one, giving the Beavers a 61-58
edge with :39 left.
Palmer muscled in a return
shot off a Griffin miss with 19
seconds on the clock, cutting the
OSU margin to one point. A con
troversial ruling followed, in
which Halligan was called for a
body foul on OSU's Bill More.
Halligan felt he had position when
the two men collided, but More
had the men in striped shirts on
his side.
More calmly meshed both ends
of the one-and-one, giving OSU an
insurmountable three-point edge
with 12 seconds to go.
McElwain was fouled dribbling
upcourt, but missed the free shot.
Griffin put in a basket just before
the buzzer to make it 63-62, but
it was meaningless. The Indians'
Pacific-8 ledger had dropped to
1-6.
Winning teams do not shoot
48.2 percent from the foul line.
