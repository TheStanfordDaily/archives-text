# HRC Report Recommends Koff No Longer Conduct Interviews
## 
### MORRIS WEE 
The Human Relations Commission
(HRC) recommended yesterday that Dr.
Robert Koff no longer interview appli
cants for admission to the Secondary
Teacher Education Program (STEP).
President Kenneth Pitzer stated in a
letter transmitting the HRC report to
Dean James of the School of Education
that this recommendation and other
matters in the report dealing with "pro
fessional competence . . . would be re
garded as informal suggestions to appro

priate administrative officers or faculty
bodies."
The Commission also recommended
that "the participation and utilization
of minority-group persons in the School
of Education be expanded," and that
"all present interviewers for the Second
ary Teacher Education Program review
this report... in order to prevent the
recurrence of such unfortunate inci
dents."
Referring to the last two recommen
dations, Pitzer said, "Within the area of
the Commissions jurisdiction, the find
ings are convincing to me and I accept
its recommendations. I hope you wiU
take appropriate steps to implement
them."
The report was issued by 7 of the 9
HRC members. Commissioner Mary
Montle attended the hearing and the de
liberations but did not vote on the find
ings or recommendations. Commissioner
Nathaniel Kirtman attended the hearing,
but did not attend the deliberations and
also did not vote.
Both Montle and Kirtman are mem
bers of the BSU and, according to the
HRC report. "A separate statement . . .
is being prepared by Miss Montle and
Mr. Kirtman.
The HRC found in its investigation
that:
"No general charge of racism was
made against Dr. Koff ..."
"We find that Miss Stevenson un
derstood the entire 75-minute period to
be a continuous screening interview, and
that under the circumstances most inter
viewees would have shared her percep
tions."
"There is a definite conflict in the
testimony as to the manner in which the

series of five points admittedly dis
cussed during the interview were raised
by Dr. Koff." (Five points are contro
versial questions during Miss Stevenson's
interview.)
"We find that Miss Stevenson was
subjected to undue psychological stress
during the interview . .
"Although we find that Miss
Stevenson was subjected to undue
psychological stress, we find that Dr.
Koff did not intend to inflict this
stress."

a. he conducted a lengthy portion
of it without attempting to elicit a
response from Miss Stevenson or to
assess her feelings;
b. there was no perception on his
part of Miss Stevenson's feelings
during much of the interview."
In a statement issued last night,
Koff said that he disagreed "with many
things" in the report. He said he was
apprehensive for persons "caught in the
impossible position of having to prove
his innocense of charges arising from a
private, unrecorded interview."
"That person's dilemma will be
further compounded if, as I did, he has
to make such proof to a tribunal which
has not yet adopted procedures which
contain the due process safeguards all
should expect in such a situation," Koff
added.
Dean James said he was "pleased that
the report contained no implication that
Prof. Koff is a racist."
He noted that two of the six
interviewers for STEP are black

"We find that some of Dr. Koff's
questions and comments were perceived
by Miss Stevenson as being directed at
her because of her race.
"We find that Dr. Koff's conduct of
the interview was inappropriate in that:
a. there was no clear-cut discon
tinuity between the structured por
tion of the interview and the por
tion Dr. Koff considered to be in
formal conversation;
b. the question (whether direct or
rhetorical) about sanitary napkins
and the statement about going to
the bathroom were indelicate and
out of place."
"In addition, we find that Dr.
Koff's behavior in the interview was ex
tremely insensitive in that:
