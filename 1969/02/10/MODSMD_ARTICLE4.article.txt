### MICHAEL KUHL 
Educators David Riesman and Irving
Howe will formally open the Universi
ty-wide consideration of Study of Edu
cation at Stanford (SES) proposals at
4:15 this afternoon in Memorial Audi
torium.
The two Fellows at the Institute for
Advanced Studies in the Behavioral
Sciences highlight a three-day program
on SES.. Included in this consideration
of undergraduate education, residences,
and campus life are dinners with faculty
members, topical discussions, and free
floating discussion of educational priori
ties.
Riesman and Howe's presentations
will discuss "in general or theoretical
terms the proper role of a private uni
versity in the education of its students,
its role as a storehouse and discoverer of
knowledge for the outside society, and
its role as a force for social change in
that society," according to Conference
chairman John Kramer.
Last night eighteen faculty members
hosted dinners and discussions with be
tween four and seven students in their
homes.

"An exchange of ideas and experi
ences, which will hopefully be sustained
during and after the conference, was the
most important ingredient," noted Jeff
Kane, a member of the organizing com
mittee.
Tomorrow morning at eight panels
will open discussion on the various
topics contained in the Conference's
focus. Page 2 of today Daily carries a
preliminary indication by panel mem
bers of their considerations.
Suggestions and comments from
members of the panel and the audience
will be recorded for use by the Aca
demic Senate when it begins joint de
liberation on SES with the 44-member
ASSU Education Council.
First Six Proposals
The first session will open on Febru
ary 27 to consider the first six proposals
in the undergraduate curriculum report.
A Senate Floor Management Commit
tee, headed by Associate Dean of
Humanities and Science Lawrence
Ryan, will select three or four people
who wish to amend or comment on the
specific proposals.

Ryan, who is also serving on a panel
Tuesday, feels that the program will in
dicate the controversy that is arising
over specific proposals in the report.
In other activities related to SES,
Student Body President Denis Hayes has
set Thursday as a deadline for turning in
applications for election to the Edu
cation Council.
Under Hare System
The election, set for February 17-18,
will be carried out by the Hare system
of proportional election.
Tonight's after-dinner discussions are
intended to be "free-flowing discussions
of educational philosophy," according
to Kramer. Meal tickets will be available
at Memorial Auditorium for faculty
members and alumni who eat in the
various residences.
The discussions are scheduled to
begin at 7:30 tonight in the Branner
dining hall and in the Soto, Serra, Mirlo,
Adelpha, and Alpha Delta Phi lounges.
The Academic Senate has urged
faculty members to consider cancelling
classes on Tuesday to allow for the

maximum amount of participation in
the conference.
Tomorrow's Daily will carry the
names of panel members, times, and
places.

members and alumni who eat in the
various residences.
The discussions are scheduled to
begin at 7:30 tonight in the Branner
dining hall and in the Soto, Serra, Mirlo,
Adelpha, and Alpha Delta Phi lounges.
The Academic Senate has urged

places.


IRVING HOWE
Educators David Riesman and Irving
Howe will formally open the Universi
ty-wide consideration of Study of Edu
cation at Stanford (SES) proposals at
4:15 this afternoon in Memorial Audi
torium.
The two Fellows at the Institute for
Advanced Studies in the Behavioral
Sciences highlight a three-day program
on SES.. Included in this consideration
of undergraduate education, residences,
and campus life are dinners with faculty
members, topical discussions, and free
floating discussion of educational priori
ties.
Riesman and Howe's presentations
will discuss "in general or theoretical
terms the proper role of a private uni
versity in the education of its students,
its role as a storehouse and discoverer of
knowledge for the outside society, and
its role as a force for social change in
that society," according to Conference
chairman John Kramer.
Last night eighteen faculty members
hosted dinners and discussions with be
tween four and seven students in their
homes.

"An exchange of ideas and experi
ences, which will hopefully be sustained
during and after the conference, was the
most important ingredient," noted Jeff
Kane, a member of the organizing com
mittee.
Tomorrow morning at eight panels
will open discussion on the various
topics contained in the Conference's
focus. Page 2 of today Daily carries a
preliminary indication by panel mem
bers of their considerations.
Suggestions and comments from
members of the panel and the audience
will be recorded for use by the Aca
demic Senate when it begins joint de
liberation on SES with the 44-member
ASSU Education Council.
First Six Proposals
The first session will open on Febru
ary 27 to consider the first six proposals
in the undergraduate curriculum report.
A Senate Floor Management Commit
tee, headed by Associate Dean of
Humanities and Science Lawrence
Ryan, will select three or four people
who wish to amend or comment on the
specific proposals.

Ryan, who is also serving on a panel
Tuesday, feels that the program will in
dicate the controversy that is arising
over specific proposals in the report.
In other activities related to SES,
Student Body President Denis Hayes has
set Thursday as a deadline for turning in
applications for election to the Edu
cation Council.
