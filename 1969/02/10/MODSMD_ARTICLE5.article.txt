# Filming Stanford Activists
## PBL: Through A Lens Radically 
### BROOKE SHEARER ANN DENTON 
Classify the PBL (Public Broadcast
ing Laboratory) crew which has spent
the last two months at Stanford as radi
cal. Rate them as student-sympathizers.
And look for them to produce a candid,
sincere film about "The Radical Chal
lenge to the University."
"The issues brought up by the radi
cals are not being dealt with on their
terms," observes Don Lenzer, co-creator
and member of the Public Broadcasting
Laboratory (PBL) which has spent the
last two months filming at Stanford.
Lenzer's views are echoed by other
members of his crew. Producer Fred
Wardenburg believes that the immediate
concern of the power elite at Stanford is
"Today's threat to the university."
"The Administration is not dealing
with the intellectual nature of the radi
cal challenge to the university," he said
in an informal meeting with Grove
House students, "but only with student
unrest. Bill Wyman's reaction, for ex
ample, about the scuffle at the SRI elec
tronics lab was one of relief. He was
scared to death that there would be a
fist fight, not about what was going on
in Southeast Asia."
"Among the reasons that we chose
Stanford as the locale for our film in the
first place," said Lenzer, "were the re
lease of the controversial SES report,
the new President's accession, and the
diversified socio-economic background
of the students here."
More to Lose
The crew found that the majority of
faculty and administrators at Stanford
to be cooperative although they were
much more guarded when the camera
was on them than the students. "They
have a whole lot more to lose than stu
dents do," said Wardenburg.

Wardenburg, a graduate of Yale,
headed a crew of seven, split into two
sections: one assigned to concentrate on
the perspectives of administrators and
faculty, and the other on that of stu
dents. The crew used over 10,000 feet
of film in making their report. The
members of the group are Dick Pearce,
another Yale graduate, Dave Grubin
from New York, Jay Freund, Anita
Pavnick and Tom Cohn.
No Heroes
"There are no heroes in our film,"
Dick explained. "I start from a specific
character of situation, because if you
have no perspective you have a major
problem ... I need a focus to use as a
pivot, but as I gradually move through
the film I get a sense of a story. No
longer does one person become the
organizing principal."
"This film is not reactive journalism
where you find symbols to express the
story that you already know or that you
have in mind that you want to tell. We
parachute behind the lines somewhere
and land in a situation that is a con
tinuum and begin to shoot."
For producer Wardenburg, "the hard
est thing in this sort of film is to end up
with a piece of work which has clarity,
and that for means simplicity."
PBL's film is directed to reach the
"opinion leaders." They are defined by
Fred Bowen, executive editor of PBL as
"people who have arrived. People, for
example who are involved in govern
ment who don't know what is going on
in the universities of this country. They
are the movers and the shakers; men
who have power beyond that which
they wield as an individual."
Opinion Leaders
Among the multitude of student
faces that the 'opinion leaders' will see
on the PBL film, eight to ten will loom

larger than the rest. Those faces belong
to students whom PBL interviewed indi
vidually and in great depth. The inter
views were psychological examinations
in many respects. Cameraman Don
Lenzer said, "we became very close
friends with most of these students,
establishing a firm bond of trust before
we began to question and film them. We
often spoke about events that we had
Filmed the day before, and tried to give
anufter-the-fact analysis."
One aspect of this study of students
at Stanford which Lenzer feels that he
neglected was the place of women in
campus activism. He interviewed only
one girl in-depth, and that was SDS
member Anne Bauer. "I feel bad about
the scant filming we did of women," he
admitted, "but I'd say that I see them as
just as seriously committed, while being
more feminine than earlier women acti
vists."
Open To Students
A partial explanation for the PBL
crew's close relationships with students
was the crew's own willingness to open
themselves up for student examination.
SDS activist David Pugh commented
on the rapport that he felt with them.
"These guys are radicals themselves.
They shared our view of the
campus. . . . We talked to them a lot
about their work and I think that we've
become life-long friends."
Producer Wardenburg complied with
Pugh's belief that he was closely allied
with the subjects that he was filming,
added, "I am conscious of the separ
ation, when I am shooting but not when
I am editing."
Art and Voyeurism
Lenzer agreed, "I often feel the
voyeur, but if one manages to create an
autonomous work of art then that
voyeurism becomes justified."

All under thirty, the members of the
PBL crew became both popular and ar
resting figures on campus. Clad in shag
buckskin and leather they spent their
spare hours forming close friendships.
Freshman Carole Lewis said, "Yes,
we spent a lot of time with them, and
we are very good friends . . . They were
planning to run a preview of the footage
which they had shot here before they
left for the East, but somehow we never
got around to it."
If all goes well with the executive
staff in Boston, where PBL is head
quartered, "The Radical Challenge to
the University" will screen in mid-April.
The Stanford community is promised a
preview.

Dick explained. "I start from a specific
character of situation, because if you
have no perspective you have a major
problem ... I need a focus to use as a
pivot, but as I gradually move through
the film I get a sense of a story. No
longer does one person become the
organizing principal."
"This film is not reactive journalism
where you find symbols to express the
story that you already know or that you
have in mind that you want to tell. We
parachute behind the lines somewhere
and land in a situation that is a con
tinuum and begin to shoot."
For producer Wardenburg, "the hard
est thing in this sort of film is to end up
with a piece of work which has clarity,
and that for means simplicity."
PBL's film is directed to reach the
"opinion leaders." They are defined by
Fred Bowen, executive editor of PBL as
"people who have arrived. People, for
example who are involved in govern
ment who don't know what is going on
in the universities of this country. They
are the movers and the shakers; men
who have power beyond that which
they wield as an individual."
Opinion Leaders
Among the multitude of student
faces that the 'opinion leaders' will see
on the PBL film, eight to ten will loom

larger than the rest. Those faces belong
to students whom PBL interviewed indi
vidually and in great depth. The inter
views were psychological examinations
in many respects. Cameraman Don
Lenzer said, "we became very close
friends with most of these students,
establishing a firm bond of trust before
we began to question and film them. We
often spoke about events that we had
Filmed the day before, and tried to give
anufter-the-fact analysis."
One aspect of this study of students
at Stanford which Lenzer feels that he
neglected was the place of women in
campus activism. He interviewed only
one girl in-depth, and that was SDS
member Anne Bauer. "I feel bad about
the scant filming we did of women," he
admitted, "but I'd say that I see them as
just as seriously committed, while being
more feminine than earlier women acti
vists."
Open To Students
A partial explanation for the PBL
crew's close relationships with students
was the crew's own willingness to open
themselves up for student examination.
SDS activist David Pugh commented
on the rapport that he felt with them.
"These guys are radicals themselves.
They shared our view of the
campus. . . . We talked to them a lot
about their work and I think that we've
become life-long friends."
Producer Wardenburg complied with
Pugh's belief that he was closely allied
with the subjects that he was filming,
added, "I am conscious of the separ
ation, when I am shooting but not when
I am editing."
Art and Voyeurism
Lenzer agreed, "I often feel the
voyeur, but if one manages to create an
autonomous work of art then that
voyeurism becomes justified."

All under thirty, the members of the
PBL crew became both popular and ar
resting figures on campus. Clad in shag
buckskin and leather they spent their
spare hours forming close friendships.
Freshman Carole Lewis said, "Yes,
we spent a lot of time with them, and
we are very good friends . . . They were
planning to run a preview of the footage
which they had shot here before they
left for the East, but somehow we never
got around to it."
If all goes well with the executive
staff in Boston, where PBL is head
quartered, "The Radical Challenge to
the University" will screen in mid-April.
The Stanford community is promised a
preview.

RADICAL VIEW-PBL Cameraman Dick
Pearee (and friend) relaxes after a day's film
ing in the Grove House lounge.
Classify the PBL (Public Broadcast
ing Laboratory) crew which has spent
the last two months at Stanford as radi
cal. Rate them as student-sympathizers.
And look for them to produce a candid,
sincere film about "The Radical Chal
lenge to the University."
"The issues brought up by the radi
cals are not being dealt with on their
terms," observes Don Lenzer, co-creator
and member of the Public Broadcasting
Laboratory (PBL) which has spent the
last two months filming at Stanford.
Lenzer's views are echoed by other
members of his crew. Producer Fred
Wardenburg believes that the immediate
concern of the power elite at Stanford is
"Today's threat to the university."
"The Administration is not dealing
with the intellectual nature of the radi
cal challenge to the university," he said
in an informal meeting with Grove
House students, "but only with student
unrest. Bill Wyman's reaction, for ex
ample, about the scuffle at the SRI elec
tronics lab was one of relief. He was
scared to death that there would be a
fist fight, not about what was going on
in Southeast Asia."
"Among the reasons that we chose
Stanford as the locale for our film in the
first place," said Lenzer, "were the re
lease of the controversial SES report,
the new President's accession, and the
diversified socio-economic background
of the students here."
More to Lose
The crew found that the majority of
faculty and administrators at Stanford
to be cooperative although they were
much more guarded when the camera
was on them than the students. "They
have a whole lot more to lose than stu
dents do," said Wardenburg.

Wardenburg, a graduate of Yale,
headed a crew of seven, split into two
sections: one assigned to concentrate on
the perspectives of administrators and
faculty, and the other on that of stu
dents. The crew used over 10,000 feet
of film in making their report. The
members of the group are Dick Pearce,

was the crew's own willingness to open
themselves up for student examination.
SDS activist David Pugh commented
on the rapport that he felt with them.
"These guys are radicals themselves.
They shared our view of the
campus. . . . We talked to them a lot
about their work and I think that we've
become life-long friends."
Producer Wardenburg complied with
Pugh's belief that he was closely allied
with the subjects that he was filming,
added, "I am conscious of the separ
ation, when I am shooting but not when
I am editing."
Art and Voyeurism
Lenzer agreed, "I often feel the
voyeur, but if one manages to create an
autonomous work of art then that
voyeurism becomes justified."

All under thirty, the members of the
PBL crew became both popular and ar
resting figures on campus. Clad in shag
buckskin and leather they spent their
spare hours forming close friendships.
Freshman Carole Lewis said, "Yes,
we spent a lot of time with them, and
we are very good friends . . . They were
planning to run a preview of the footage
which they had shot here before they
left for the East, but somehow we never
got around to it."
If all goes well with the executive
staff in Boston, where PBL is head
quartered, "The Radical Challenge to
the University" will screen in mid-April.
The Stanford community is promised a
preview.

RADICAL VIEW-PBL Cameraman Dick
Pearee (and friend) relaxes after a day's film
ing in the Grove House lounge.
Classify the PBL (Public Broadcast
ing Laboratory) crew which has spent
the last two months at Stanford as radi
cal. Rate them as student-sympathizers.
And look for them to produce a candid,
sincere film about "The Radical Chal
lenge to the University."
"The issues brought up by the radi
cals are not being dealt with on their
terms," observes Don Lenzer, co-creator
and member of the Public Broadcasting
Laboratory (PBL) which has spent the
last two months filming at Stanford.
Lenzer's views are echoed by other
members of his crew. Producer Fred
Wardenburg believes that the immediate
concern of the power elite at Stanford is
"Today's threat to the university."
"The Administration is not dealing
with the intellectual nature of the radi
cal challenge to the university," he said
in an informal meeting with Grove
House students, "but only with student
unrest. Bill Wyman's reaction, for ex
ample, about the scuffle at the SRI elec
tronics lab was one of relief. He was
scared to death that there would be a
fist fight, not about what was going on
in Southeast Asia."
"Among the reasons that we chose
Stanford as the locale for our film in the
first place," said Lenzer, "were the re
lease of the controversial SES report,
the new President's accession, and the
diversified socio-economic background
of the students here."
More to Lose
The crew found that the majority of
faculty and administrators at Stanford
to be cooperative although they were
much more guarded when the camera
was on them than the students. "They
have a whole lot more to lose than stu
dents do," said Wardenburg.

Wardenburg, a graduate of Yale,
headed a crew of seven, split into two
sections: one assigned to concentrate on
the perspectives of administrators and
faculty, and the other on that of stu
dents. The crew used over 10,000 feet
of film in making their report. The
members of the group are Dick Pearce,
another Yale graduate, Dave Grubin
from New York, Jay Freund, Anita
Pavnick and Tom Cohn.
No Heroes
"There are no heroes in our film,"
Dick explained. "I start from a specific
character of situation, because if you
have no perspective you have a major
problem ... I need a focus to use as a
pivot, but as I gradually move through
the film I get a sense of a story. No
longer does one person become the
organizing principal."
"This film is not reactive journalism
where you find symbols to express the
story that you already know or that you
have in mind that you want to tell. We
parachute behind the lines somewhere
and land in a situation that is a con
tinuum and begin to shoot."
For producer Wardenburg, "the hard
est thing in this sort of film is to end up
with a piece of work which has clarity,
and that for means simplicity."
PBL's film is directed to reach the
"opinion leaders." They are defined by
Fred Bowen, executive editor of PBL as
"people who have arrived. People, for
example who are involved in govern
ment who don't know what is going on
in the universities of this country. They
are the movers and the shakers; men
who have power beyond that which
they wield as an individual."
Opinion Leaders
Among the multitude of student
faces that the 'opinion leaders' will see
on the PBL film, eight to ten will loom

larger than the rest. Those faces belong
to students whom PBL interviewed indi
vidually and in great depth. The inter
views were psychological examinations
in many respects. Cameraman Don
Lenzer said, "we became very close
friends with most of these students,
establishing a firm bond of trust before
we began to question and film them. We
often spoke about events that we had
Filmed the day before, and tried to give
anufter-the-fact analysis."
One aspect of this study of students
at Stanford which Lenzer feels that he
neglected was the place of women in
campus activism. He interviewed only
one girl in-depth, and that was SDS
member Anne Bauer. "I feel bad about
the scant filming we did of women," he
admitted, "but I'd say that I see them as
just as seriously committed, while being
more feminine than earlier women acti
vists."

A partial explanation for the PBL
crew's close relationships with students
was the crew's own willingness to open
themselves up for student examination.
