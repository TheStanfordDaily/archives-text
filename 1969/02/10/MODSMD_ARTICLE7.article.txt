The Human Relations Commission re
port on charges against Dr. Robert Koff,
assistant professor of education and direc
tor of Secondary Teacher Education Pro
gram (STEP), is printed on page 4 of this
morning's Daily. We urge every member of
the community to read it carefully.
The report should be seen as a thorough
investigation of the facts and interpre
tations of the incident involving Dr. Koff
and Miss Clarissa Stevenson, a black woman
applying for admission to STEP.
As President Pitzer points out in his
covering letter, the recommendation that
Koff not interview applicants for STEP and
the findings that Koff's conduct of the in
terview was "inappropriate" and his be
havior in the interview was "extremely in
sensitive" are not germane to the Human
Relations Commission and should be con
sidered "informal suggestions."
We welcome the publication of this re
port in The Daily because we feel that it
will clear the air and allow informed discus
sion of the issue.

The report is now in the hands of Dean
James of the School of Education. The
Human Relations Commission has made its
suggestion; the Black Students' Union has
made its demand.
While we are inclined to believe that Dr.
Koff should be removed from the head of
the STEP program, it is clear that the Stan
ford community needs more information
about the STEP program.
What is the nature of the program and
Dr. Koffs role in it, particularly with refer
ence to minority groups?
To what extent does the insensitivity
that the Commission suggests occurred in
the interview manifest itself in Dr. Koff's
other duties as head of STEP?
These are issues of "professional compe
tence" which, President Pitzer points out,
should be dealt with by "appropriate ad
ministrative officers or faculty bodies."
We now await swift and open consider
ation of the facts by President Pitzer, Dean
James, and the faculty of the School of
Education.
We expect quick action.
