## Union Oil: In Whose Interest? 
### Jane Franklin 
May I begin with a gentle
reminder? A few years ago that
ivy-covered building, the Old
Union, was a residence known as
the most creative center on
campus.
When the Administration
decided they needed that building
for offices, faculty and students
signed petitions protesting that
the Administration was about to
abolish an important part of the
academic community. The girls
who lived there knew that if they
were evicted, nothing would
replace the Old Union, The
Administration considered the
people's opinion and found office
space elsewhere.
Sorry, I got carried away by
gentleness. The Administration
took the building. The girls were
dispersed. Once again the
Administration was successful in
their continuing efforts not to
disturb the (business) activities of
the University. Need I mention
that during last spring's sit-in in
that same building, the Adminis
tration took a different view of
the seizure of property?
The question that must be
asked and answered is: Why is a
seizure of property by those in
power regarded as legal and order
ly while a seizure of property by
those not in power is regarded as
an "assault upon the institutions

of society" and therefore illegal,
chaotic, violent?
As an example, before Union
Oil (and Gulf, Mobile, and Tex
aco) was given permission by the
Department of the Interior to drill
off the coast of Santa Barbara,
conservationists protested that
such drilling would very likely
lead to pollution of those waters.
But corporate capitalism linked
ever closer to state capitalism (in
terlinked people, mutual benefits)
and for a cash down payment of
$603 million, the oil companies
began to drill. Therefore, from
that power, we now have condi
tions of extreme pollution and
danger.
Now I don't want to hurt any
body's feelings by barging in here
and eating the desserts and drink
ing the vodka, but if trustees de
serve our respect, then why is
trustee Arthur Stewart, Board
Chairman of the Union Oil of Cal
ifornia Foundation and director
of Union Oil, taking part in such
violent invasion of our beautiful
and valuable coast?
Right now workers are conduc
ting a legal strike against several
oil companies. They are not pour
ing tons of oil into our water. But
the police club the workers and
even their wives.
Why is E. Hornsby Wasson,
newlv-named director of Standard

Oil (and an SRI director) allowing
the brutalization of striking work
ers at the Standard plant in Rich
mond?
Does he know what is happen
ing there and, if so, will he tell us
his opinion and allow us to discuss
the issues with him?
By the way, I didn't hear that
our trustworthy senators asked
our trustee Packard about his po
sitions with General Dynamics,
U.S. Steel, Crocker Citizen's, P.G.
& E., and SRI. But we can trust
that he will see to it that Law and
Order him doing any
thing violent or illegal, isn't that
right?
That's one of the reasons that
I'm going over to Richmond to
get on the line with the workers.
The drive for capital has brought
to man the power of socialized
production so vital for our libera
tion. Now, instead of using
productivity for the profits of a
few men who are not even them
selves liberated because they are
dehumanized by their view of
other men, we must achieve the
socialization of ownership so that
the people may make decisions in
view of the common welfare of us
all. Isn't that right?
