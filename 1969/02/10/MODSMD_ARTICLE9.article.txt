# The 						Tin Drum
## Koff And A Black Dilemma 
### Michael Sweeney 
Until the rally last Tuesday,
most whites at Stanford assumed
that the Black Student Union had
one demand: the dismissal of Pro
fessor Robert Koff for his alleged
racist behavior. At the rally, how
ever, it became clear that the Koff
incident was being used as a con
venient opportunity to raise hell
about everything that makes it
difficult to be a black student at
Stanford University.
Black leaders Leo Bazile and
Johnnie Scott talked very little
about the Koff incident. But they
talked a great deal about the per
sonal frustration they felt in their
dealings with white men at Stan
ford.
Bazile, sporting a yellow
Malcolm X shirt, described his
humiliation in asking a white fin
ancial aid officer for money, while
he thinks he should be earning
money to send home to his family
in Oakland. Bazile also said he
resented seeking help in planning
his courses from a white adviser.
Johnnie Scott, whose writing
has won him TV appearances and
a job at Newsweek magazine,
blasted Stanford for the "cultural
imperialism" he had experienced.
He didn't mention it at the rally,
but last summer Scott wrote a
militant script for the traditional
Big Game Gaieties. The white pro
ducers couldn't stomach it, and
cancelled the show. Scott sought
revenge Tuesday by demanding
large appropriations for all-black
drama and writing workshops.
Conviction and Militancy
As always, the blacks mesmer
ized their white audience with an
eloquence that can come only
from deep personal conviction
and reckless militancy. Of the 12
demands they made Tuesday,
only the first dealt with Koff. The
other 11 had one theme: Don't
put any white man in a position
of authority over us.
Not surprisingly, the blacks
made more threats than in the
past. Bazile said he was ready to
kill. Scott cheerfully told us not
to be surprised if firebombs hit
the bookstore and beatings started
in Tresidder Union. "From now
on we're going to be damned un
reasonable. We're going to be
damned irrational," said Bazile.
Above all. Bazile was trying to
tell his white audience that it
shouldn't expect to understand
the black demands. I disagree with
Bazile. Its very comforting to be
lieve that one is so special that no
body can understand you, but I
suggest to the BSU that more un
derstanding from whites is both
possible and desirable for the
BSU. To we gentle folk, it does
indeed seem unreasonable to
threaten mayhem over such things
as the number of black counselors
and the hourly pay in the work
studies program. Unreasonable or
not, it must be clear to all that the
demands reflect the deeply per
sonal needs of black students.
The black student at Stanford
has a pretty awful dilemma. On
one hand, he wants to get the
white man's diploma and collect
top dollar for his blackness (as
Bazile said, "Niggers is In de
mand.") On the other hand, he
must struggle to convince himself
and others that he is not "be
coming white" by slipping into a
cozy student life.
He fears losing touch with
black militants and ghetto resi
dents, who are the real guardians
of the black identity. Last month
I talked with a black graduate stu
-SSSSSS=»SSSSSSSSS=^SSSSSSSS

dent, who put it this way:
"It would be tragic to bring
black students here to whitewash
them, to isolate them from other
black people. No matter what
kind of education we get here, it
doesn't matter when kids in East
Palo Alto aren't getting any edu
cation at all, and black students
aren't becoming responsive to
their needs."
Pressure For Militancy
Coupled with this fear of being
"whitewashed" is a growing pres
sure on Stanford blacks to prove
that they are as militant as the
rest of the black community.
Stanford's recruiting drive is
bringing in more blacks from poor
ghetto backgrounds, who chal
lenge the others to prove their im
munity to Stanford's white cul
ture.
At San Francisco State and a
score of other colleges, the blacks
have announced they will refuse
to play the game any longer with
out separate black studies and
black faculty. Call it black separ
atism if you will. Maybe it's more
accurate to call it cultural self
defense.
At Stanford, the pressures
showed up long before Tuesday's
rally. The withdrawal and deliber
ate hostility of blacks toward
whites has been widely experi
enced. Black students have avoid
ed white faculty and administra
tors, turning instead to the hand
ful of black faculty and the single

black administrator, Jim Sim
mons.
All-black classes were formed
at Stanford for the first time this
quarter in the sprawling course
called "Racism and Prejudice."
After spending the freshman year
in a dormitory, the typical black
student moves to East Palo Alto
to seek out the supportive atmos
phere of a black community. The
BSU has kept up its close ties with
the East Palo Alto Mothers Club,
and has been involved in tutoring
projects.
The demands made by the BSU
on Tuesday are a logical extension
of the need of blacks to build de
fenses against our alluring, but
psychologically fatal, white uni
versity. Provost Richard Lyman,
with over a year's experience in
crisis dealings with the BSU,
should understand these needs
very well.
Lyman and President Pitzer,
proded forward by the BSU's
threats, will probably do some
thing to meet every demand
which asks for nothing besides the
expenditure of more money.
These demands include hiring
black counselors for the Counsel
ing and Testing Center, continuing
the search for black faculty in
every department, providing aca
demic credit for field work in East
Palo Alto, hiring more black ad
ministrators, and continuing the
crash effort to raise black employ
ment.

But I doubt that the admin
istration is either scared enough or
foolish enough to yield to the
more arbitrary demands of the
BSU. In particular, Robert Koff
will not be fired. The Stanford
faculty would be more likely to
let this school burn to the ground
before allowing the BSU to dic
tate the dismissal of a tenured fac
ulty member.
Sometime this week the
Human Relations Commission, a
board set up to investigate im
broglios like this one, will issue its
report on the Koff incident. (See
page four—Ed.) Judging by all
that has been said or written to
date about the dispute, the Com
mission is likely to criticize Koff
for his insensitivity, and possibly
recommend that he do no more
interviewing of black candidates
for the Secondary Teachers Edu
cation Program (STEP). But any
harsher discipline is inconceivable,
for the simple reason that the
BSU cannot prove that Koff actu
ally holds any overtly racist views
or deliberately voiced a racist
opinio^
Actually, Koff has already
served the BSU's purposes by
sparking an inflammatory issue
that the BSU used as a vehicle to
deliver its real demands for more
black autonomy on campus.

must struggle to convince himself
and others that he is not "be
coming white" by slipping into a
cozy student life.
He fears losing touch with
black militants and ghetto resi
dents, who are the real guardians
of the black identity. Last month
I talked with a black graduate stu
-SSSSSS=»SSSSSSSSS=^SSSSSSSS

dent, who put it this way:
"It would be tragic to bring
black students here to whitewash
them, to isolate them from other
black people. No matter what
kind of education we get here, it
doesn't matter when kids in East
Palo Alto aren't getting any edu
cation at all, and black students
aren't becoming responsive to
their needs."
Pressure For Militancy
Coupled with this fear of being
"whitewashed" is a growing pres
sure on Stanford blacks to prove
that they are as militant as the
rest of the black community.
Stanford's recruiting drive is
bringing in more blacks from poor
ghetto backgrounds, who chal
lenge the others to prove their im
munity to Stanford's white cul
ture.
At San Francisco State and a
score of other colleges, the blacks
have announced they will refuse
to play the game any longer with
out separate black studies and
black faculty. Call it black separ
atism if you will. Maybe it's more
accurate to call it cultural self
defense.
At Stanford, the pressures
showed up long before Tuesday's
rally. The withdrawal and deliber
ate hostility of blacks toward
whites has been widely experi
enced. Black students have avoid
ed white faculty and administra
tors, turning instead to the hand
ful of black faculty and the single

black administrator, Jim Sim
mons.
All-black classes were formed
at Stanford for the first time this
quarter in the sprawling course
called "Racism and Prejudice."
After spending the freshman year
in a dormitory, the typical black
student moves to East Palo Alto
to seek out the supportive atmos
phere of a black community. The
BSU has kept up its close ties with
the East Palo Alto Mothers Club,
and has been involved in tutoring
projects.
The demands made by the BSU
on Tuesday are a logical extension
of the need of blacks to build de
fenses against our alluring, but
psychologically fatal, white uni
versity. Provost Richard Lyman,
with over a year's experience in
crisis dealings with the BSU,
should understand these needs
very well.
Lyman and President Pitzer,
proded forward by the BSU's
threats, will probably do some
thing to meet every demand
which asks for nothing besides the
expenditure of more money.
These demands include hiring
black counselors for the Counsel
ing and Testing Center, continuing
the search for black faculty in
every department, providing aca
demic credit for field work in East
Palo Alto, hiring more black ad
ministrators, and continuing the
crash effort to raise black employ
ment.

But I doubt that the admin
istration is either scared enough or
foolish enough to yield to the
more arbitrary demands of the
BSU. In particular, Robert Koff
will not be fired. The Stanford
faculty would be more likely to
let this school burn to the ground
before allowing the BSU to dic
tate the dismissal of a tenured fac
ulty member.
Sometime this week the
Human Relations Commission, a
board set up to investigate im
broglios like this one, will issue its
report on the Koff incident. (See
page four—Ed.) Judging by all
that has been said or written to
date about the dispute, the Com
mission is likely to criticize Koff
for his insensitivity, and possibly
recommend that he do no more
interviewing of black candidates
for the Secondary Teachers Edu
cation Program (STEP). But any
harsher discipline is inconceivable,
for the simple reason that the
BSU cannot prove that Koff actu
ally holds any overtly racist views
or deliberately voiced a racist
opinio^
Actually, Koff has already
served the BSU's purposes by
sparking an inflammatory issue
that the BSU used as a vehicle to
deliver its real demands for more
black autonomy on campus.
(Michael Sweeney is aii economics
major and former editor of The Daily.)
Until the rally last Tuesday,
most whites at Stanford assumed
that the Black Student Union had
one demand: the dismissal of Pro
fessor Robert Koff for his alleged
racist behavior. At the rally, how
ever, it became clear that the Koff
incident was being used as a con
venient opportunity to raise hell
about everything that makes it
difficult to be a black student at
Stanford University.
Black leaders Leo Bazile and
Johnnie Scott talked very little
about the Koff incident. But they
talked a great deal about the per
sonal frustration they felt in their
dealings with white men at Stan
ford.
Bazile, sporting a yellow
Malcolm X shirt, described his
humiliation in asking a white fin
ancial aid officer for money, while
he thinks he should be earning
money to send home to his family
in Oakland. Bazile also said he
resented seeking help in planning
his courses from a white adviser.
Johnnie Scott, whose writing
has won him TV appearances and
a job at Newsweek magazine,
blasted Stanford for the "cultural
imperialism" he had experienced.
He didn't mention it at the rally,
but last summer Scott wrote a
militant script for the traditional
Big Game Gaieties. The white pro
ducers couldn't stomach it, and
cancelled the show. Scott sought
revenge Tuesday by demanding
large appropriations for all-black
drama and writing workshops.
Conviction and Militancy
As always, the blacks mesmer
ized their white audience with an
eloquence that can come only
from deep personal conviction
and reckless militancy. Of the 12
demands they made Tuesday,
only the first dealt with Koff. The
other 11 had one theme: Don't
put any white man in a position
of authority over us.
Not surprisingly, the blacks
made more threats than in the
past. Bazile said he was ready to
kill. Scott cheerfully told us not
to be surprised if firebombs hit
the bookstore and beatings started
in Tresidder Union. "From now
on we're going to be damned un
reasonable. We're going to be
damned irrational," said Bazile.
Above all. Bazile was trying to
tell his white audience that it
shouldn't expect to understand
the black demands. I disagree with
Bazile. Its very comforting to be
lieve that one is so special that no
body can understand you, but I
suggest to the BSU that more un
derstanding from whites is both
possible and desirable for the
BSU. To we gentle folk, it does
indeed seem unreasonable to
threaten mayhem over such things
as the number of black counselors
and the hourly pay in the work
studies program. Unreasonable or
not, it must be clear to all that the
demands reflect the deeply per
sonal needs of black students.
The black student at Stanford
has a pretty awful dilemma. On
one hand, he wants to get the
white man's diploma and collect
top dollar for his blackness (as
Bazile said, "Niggers is In de
mand.") On the other hand, he
must struggle to convince himself
and others that he is not "be
coming white" by slipping into a
cozy student life.
He fears losing touch with

more arbitrary demands of the
BSU. In particular, Robert Koff
will not be fired. The Stanford
faculty would be more likely to
let this school burn to the ground
before allowing the BSU to dic
tate the dismissal of a tenured fac
ulty member.
Sometime this week the
Human Relations Commission, a
board set up to investigate im
broglios like this one, will issue its
report on the Koff incident. (See
page four—Ed.) Judging by all
that has been said or written to
date about the dispute, the Com
mission is likely to criticize Koff
for his insensitivity, and possibly
recommend that he do no more
interviewing of black candidates
for the Secondary Teachers Edu
cation Program (STEP). But any
harsher discipline is inconceivable,
for the simple reason that the
BSU cannot prove that Koff actu
ally holds any overtly racist views
or deliberately voiced a racist
opinio^
Actually, Koff has already
served the BSU's purposes by
sparking an inflammatory issue
that the BSU used as a vehicle to
deliver its real demands for more
black autonomy on campus.

major and former editor of The Daily.)
Until the rally last Tuesday,
most whites at Stanford assumed
that the Black Student Union had
one demand: the dismissal of Pro
fessor Robert Koff for his alleged
racist behavior. At the rally, how
ever, it became clear that the Koff
incident was being used as a con
venient opportunity to raise hell
about everything that makes it
difficult to be a black student at
Stanford University.
Black leaders Leo Bazile and
Johnnie Scott talked very little
about the Koff incident. But they
talked a great deal about the per
sonal frustration they felt in their
dealings with white men at Stan
ford.
Bazile, sporting a yellow
Malcolm X shirt, described his
humiliation in asking a white fin
ancial aid officer for money, while
he thinks he should be earning
money to send home to his family
in Oakland. Bazile also said he
resented seeking help in planning
his courses from a white adviser.
Johnnie Scott, whose writing
has won him TV appearances and
a job at Newsweek magazine,
blasted Stanford for the "cultural
imperialism" he had experienced.
He didn't mention it at the rally,
but last summer Scott wrote a
militant script for the traditional
Big Game Gaieties. The white pro
ducers couldn't stomach it, and
cancelled the show. Scott sought
revenge Tuesday by demanding
large appropriations for all-black
drama and writing workshops.
Conviction and Militancy
As always, the blacks mesmer
ized their white audience with an
eloquence that can come only
from deep personal conviction
and reckless militancy. Of the 12
demands they made Tuesday,
only the first dealt with Koff. The
other 11 had one theme: Don't
put any white man in a position
of authority over us.
Not surprisingly, the blacks
made more threats than in the
past. Bazile said he was ready to
kill. Scott cheerfully told us not
to be surprised if firebombs hit
the bookstore and beatings started
in Tresidder Union. "From now
on we're going to be damned un
reasonable. We're going to be
damned irrational," said Bazile.
Above all. Bazile was trying to
tell his white audience that it
shouldn't expect to understand
the black demands. I disagree with
Bazile. Its very comforting to be
lieve that one is so special that no
body can understand you, but I
suggest to the BSU that more un
derstanding from whites is both
possible and desirable for the
BSU. To we gentle folk, it does
indeed seem unreasonable to
threaten mayhem over such things
as the number of black counselors
and the hourly pay in the work
studies program. Unreasonable or
not, it must be clear to all that the
demands reflect the deeply per
sonal needs of black students.
The black student at Stanford
has a pretty awful dilemma. On
one hand, he wants to get the
white man's diploma and collect
top dollar for his blackness (as
Bazile said, "Niggers is In de
mand.") On the other hand, he
must struggle to convince himself
and others that he is not "be
coming white" by slipping into a
cozy student life.
He fears losing touch with
black militants and ghetto resi
dents, who are the real guardians
of the black identity. Last month
I talked with a black graduate stu
-SSSSSS=»SSSSSSSSS=^SSSSSSSS

dent, who put it this way:
"It would be tragic to bring
black students here to whitewash
them, to isolate them from other
black people. No matter what
kind of education we get here, it
doesn't matter when kids in East
Palo Alto aren't getting any edu
cation at all, and black students
aren't becoming responsive to
their needs."
Pressure For Militancy
Coupled with this fear of being
"whitewashed" is a growing pres
sure on Stanford blacks to prove
that they are as militant as the
rest of the black community.
Stanford's recruiting drive is
bringing in more blacks from poor
ghetto backgrounds, who chal
lenge the others to prove their im
munity to Stanford's white cul
ture.
At San Francisco State and a
score of other colleges, the blacks
have announced they will refuse
to play the game any longer with
out separate black studies and
black faculty. Call it black separ
atism if you will. Maybe it's more
accurate to call it cultural self
defense.
At Stanford, the pressures
showed up long before Tuesday's
rally. The withdrawal and deliber
ate hostility of blacks toward
whites has been widely experi
enced. Black students have avoid
ed white faculty and administra
tors, turning instead to the hand
ful of black faculty and the single

black administrator, Jim Sim
mons.
All-black classes were formed
at Stanford for the first time this
quarter in the sprawling course
called "Racism and Prejudice."
After spending the freshman year
in a dormitory, the typical black
student moves to East Palo Alto
to seek out the supportive atmos
phere of a black community. The
BSU has kept up its close ties with
the East Palo Alto Mothers Club,
and has been involved in tutoring
projects.
The demands made by the BSU
on Tuesday are a logical extension
of the need of blacks to build de
fenses against our alluring, but
psychologically fatal, white uni
versity. Provost Richard Lyman,
with over a year's experience in
crisis dealings with the BSU,
should understand these needs
very well.
Lyman and President Pitzer,
proded forward by the BSU's
threats, will probably do some
thing to meet every demand
which asks for nothing besides the
expenditure of more money.
These demands include hiring
black counselors for the Counsel
ing and Testing Center, continuing
the search for black faculty in
every department, providing aca
demic credit for field work in East
Palo Alto, hiring more black ad
ministrators, and continuing the
crash effort to raise black employ
ment.

But I doubt that the admin
istration is either scared enough or
foolish enough to yield to the
more arbitrary demands of the
BSU. In particular, Robert Koff
will not be fired. The Stanford

kill. Scott cheerfully told us not
to be surprised if firebombs hit
the bookstore and beatings started
in Tresidder Union. "From now
on we're going to be damned un
reasonable. We're going to be
damned irrational," said Bazile.
Above all. Bazile was trying to
tell his white audience that it
shouldn't expect to understand
the black demands. I disagree with
Bazile. Its very comforting to be
lieve that one is so special that no
body can understand you, but I
suggest to the BSU that more un
derstanding from whites is both
possible and desirable for the
BSU. To we gentle folk, it does
indeed seem unreasonable to
threaten mayhem over such things
as the number of black counselors
and the hourly pay in the work
studies program. Unreasonable or
not, it must be clear to all that the
demands reflect the deeply per
sonal needs of black students.
The black student at Stanford
has a pretty awful dilemma. On
one hand, he wants to get the
white man's diploma and collect
top dollar for his blackness (as
Bazile said, "Niggers is In de
mand.") On the other hand, he
must struggle to convince himself
and others that he is not "be
coming white" by slipping into a
cozy student life.
He fears losing touch with
black militants and ghetto resi
dents, who are the real guardians
of the black identity. Last month
I talked with a black graduate stu

dent, who put it this way:
"It would be tragic to bring
black students here to whitewash
them, to isolate them from other
black people. No matter what
kind of education we get here, it
doesn't matter when kids in East
Palo Alto aren't getting any edu
cation at all, and black students
aren't becoming responsive to
their needs."
Pressure For Militancy
Coupled with this fear of being
"whitewashed" is a growing pres
sure on Stanford blacks to prove
that they are as militant as the
rest of the black community.
Stanford's recruiting drive is
bringing in more blacks from poor
ghetto backgrounds, who chal
lenge the others to prove their im
munity to Stanford's white cul
ture.
At San Francisco State and a
score of other colleges, the blacks
have announced they will refuse
to play the game any longer with
out separate black studies and
black faculty. Call it black separ
atism if you will. Maybe it's more
accurate to call it cultural self
defense.
At Stanford, the pressures
showed up long before Tuesday's
rally. The withdrawal and deliber
ate hostility of blacks toward
whites has been widely experi
enced. Black students have avoid
ed white faculty and administra
tors, turning instead to the hand
ful of black faculty and the single

black administrator, Jim Sim
mons.
All-black classes were formed
at Stanford for the first time this
quarter in the sprawling course
called "Racism and Prejudice."
After spending the freshman year
in a dormitory, the typical black
student moves to East Palo Alto
to seek out the supportive atmos
phere of a black community. The
BSU has kept up its close ties with
the East Palo Alto Mothers Club,
and has been involved in tutoring
projects.
The demands made by the BSU
on Tuesday are a logical extension
of the need of blacks to build de
fenses against our alluring, but
psychologically fatal, white uni
versity. Provost Richard Lyman,
with over a year's experience in
crisis dealings with the BSU,
should understand these needs
very well.
Lyman and President Pitzer,
proded forward by the BSU's
threats, will probably do some
thing to meet every demand
which asks for nothing besides the
expenditure of more money.
These demands include hiring
black counselors for the Counsel
ing and Testing Center, continuing
the search for black faculty in
every department, providing aca
demic credit for field work in East
Palo Alto, hiring more black ad
ministrators, and continuing the
crash effort to raise black employ
ment.

But I doubt that the admin
istration is either scared enough or
foolish enough to yield to the
more arbitrary demands of the
BSU. In particular, Robert Koff
will not be fired. The Stanford
faculty would be more likely to
let this school burn to the ground
before allowing the BSU to dic
tate the dismissal of a tenured fac
ulty member.
Sometime this week the
Human Relations Commission, a
board set up to investigate im
broglios like this one, will issue its
report on the Koff incident. (See
page four—Ed.) Judging by all
that has been said or written to
date about the dispute, the Com
mission is likely to criticize Koff
for his insensitivity, and possibly
recommend that he do no more
interviewing of black candidates
for the Secondary Teachers Edu
cation Program (STEP). But any
harsher discipline is inconceivable,
for the simple reason that the
BSU cannot prove that Koff actu
ally holds any overtly racist views
or deliberately voiced a racist
opinio^
Actually, Koff has already
served the BSU's purposes by
sparking an inflammatory issue
that the BSU used as a vehicle to
deliver its real demands for more
black autonomy on campus.
