# Riesman Discusses Difficulties In Establishing 'Ideal Curriculum'
## 
### SUSAN SWARD 
"I can't emphasize enough," said
David Riesman, "that a genuinely new
course even within a discipline is an im
mensely difficult creation, good for this
trip only and sometimes not even that."
In a speech yesterday in Memorial
Auditorium before an audience of about
500, the educator and sociologist Ries
man outlined a "Search for Alternative
Models" to existing university systems.
Riesman's remarks focused on pos
sible goals of an ideal curriculum and
emphasized probably difficulties in
establishing such a curriculum. Basical
ly, he proposed to expose students to a
variety of cognitive styles during their
undergraduate education —with as little
cohesion and threat as possible.
Educational Contest
"Historically, it was only the other
day that the arts and sciences won a
contest for allegiance over the prepro
fessional undergraduate education,"
noted Riesman. "Since this victory is so
recent, it is not easy then to persuade
the faculty members to reverse the push
in favor of liberal education and reintro
duce professionalism at the undergrad
uate level."
In his discussion of mandatory re
quirements in general education, Ries
man pointed out that "faculty members
themselves do not want captive audi
ences and want to do their own thing
which is usually more specialized." The
educator admitted that language depart
ments might possibly constitute an ex
ception to his observation.
No Fear of Failure
Speaking of alternatives to manda
tory breadth requirements, Riesman
said he would like to see students "en

couraged into areas they had previously
feared and avoided. Here, if they
wished, they would not be graded, so
that they could not plead that it would
spoil their records if they did badly."
"I would like to have students learn
that they can enjoy doing something
badly—not sloppily, but in fact as well
as they can."
According to Riesman, students
would be free to abandon fields that did
not initially appeal to them after first
exposure.
Riesman spoke of two other forms of
possible experimentation within the uni
versity system. Residential units could
become "ad hoc groupings of students
and faculty sharing mutual academic
and extra-curricular interests. This
group would constitute an ad hoc sub
college, with a claim on dormitory and
other resources and a commitment to
meet one or another of the demands for
exposure to various cognitive styles."
Another possible approach would im
plement "interim periods in which regu
lar classes would stop and lectures and
discussions would focus on a single
topic, hopefully of interest to a signif
icantly large proportion of the entire
body of students and faculty."
Vagueness Criticized
Though Riesman claimed in his
speech to have "no illusions" concern
ing the difficulties involved in establish
ing an ideal curriculum, Tom Grissom, a
graduate student in history and educa
tion, criticized Riesman's approach for
not being specific enough in its recom
mendations for betterment of the exist
ing system.
Responding to questions concerning
the university's connections with the

mil itary-industrial complex, Riesman
said, "The best defense of freedom in
the university comes from plurality.
Students have to understand that the
administrators only work here. They are
the best friends the students have, if
any."
Riesman is presently at Stanford for
a year as a Fellow at the Advanced Cen
ter for Behavioral Studies. While at the
Center, he retains his position as a
Henry Ford Professor of Social Rela
tions at Harvard. Riesman is the author
of The Lonely Crowd and more recently
the co-author of The Academic Revolu
tion.

lar classes would stop and lectures and
discussions would focus on a single
topic, hopefully of interest to a signif
icantly large proportion of the entire
body of students and faculty."
Vagueness Criticized
Though Riesman claimed in his
speech to have "no illusions" concern
ing the difficulties involved in establish
ing an ideal curriculum, Tom Grissom, a
graduate student in history and educa
tion, criticized Riesman's approach for
not being specific enough in its recom
mendations for betterment of the exist
ing system.
Responding to questions concerning
the university's connections with the

mil itary-industrial complex, Riesman
said, "The best defense of freedom in
the university comes from plurality.
Students have to understand that the
administrators only work here. They are
the best friends the students have, if
any."
Riesman is presently at Stanford for
a year as a Fellow at the Advanced Cen
ter for Behavioral Studies. While at the
Center, he retains his position as a
Henry Ford Professor of Social Rela
tions at Harvard. Riesman is the author
of The Lonely Crowd and more recently
the co-author of The Academic Revolu
tion.

EDUCATION, STANFORD AND ELSEWHERE—David Reisman (left) and Irving Howe start off the two day conference on the proposals of
the Study of Education at Stanford.
"I can't emphasize enough," said
David Riesman, "that a genuinely new
course even within a discipline is an im
mensely difficult creation, good for this
trip only and sometimes not even that."
In a speech yesterday in Memorial
Auditorium before an audience of about
500, the educator and sociologist Ries
man outlined a "Search for Alternative
Models" to existing university systems.
Riesman's remarks focused on pos
sible goals of an ideal curriculum and
emphasized probably difficulties in
establishing such a curriculum. Basical
ly, he proposed to expose students to a
variety of cognitive styles during their
undergraduate education —with as little
cohesion and threat as possible.
Educational Contest
"Historically, it was only the other
day that the arts and sciences won a
contest for allegiance over the prepro
fessional undergraduate education,"
noted Riesman. "Since this victory is so
recent, it is not easy then to persuade
the faculty members to reverse the push
in favor of liberal education and reintro
duce professionalism at the undergrad
uate level."
In his discussion of mandatory re
quirements in general education, Ries
man pointed out that "faculty members
themselves do not want captive audi
ences and want to do their own thing
which is usually more specialized." The
educator admitted that language depart
ments might possibly constitute an ex
ception to his observation.
No Fear of Failure
Speaking of alternatives to manda
tory breadth requirements, Riesman
said he would like to see students "en

couraged into areas they had previously
feared and avoided. Here, if they
wished, they would not be graded, so
that they could not plead that it would
spoil their records if they did badly."
"I would like to have students learn
that they can enjoy doing something
badly—not sloppily, but in fact as well
as they can."
According to Riesman, students
would be free to abandon fields that did
not initially appeal to them after first
exposure.
Riesman spoke of two other forms of
possible experimentation within the uni
versity system. Residential units could
become "ad hoc groupings of students
and faculty sharing mutual academic
and extra-curricular interests. This
group would constitute an ad hoc sub
college, with a claim on dormitory and
other resources and a commitment to
meet one or another of the demands for
exposure to various cognitive styles."
Another possible approach would im
plement "interim periods in which regu
lar classes would stop and lectures and
discussions would focus on a single
topic, hopefully of interest to a signif
icantly large proportion of the entire
body of students and faculty."
