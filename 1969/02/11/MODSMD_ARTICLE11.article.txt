# Youth Fare Is Fair
## 
### 
In recent years Stanford students have
been coming back to school by plane in
increasing numbers. But that may all end
soon.
A Civil Aeronautics Board examiner has
decided that the airlines' youth fare should
be eliminated because it discriminates
against adult, full-fare passengers.
Although the CAB has over the years
striven to serve the public welfare, the re
sults have not always been satisfactory. To
day it is cheaper to go from here to Los
Angeles on intrastate (unregulated) Pacific
Southwest Airlines.
Enforcing higher prices may not seem to
be in the public's interest. But the CAB
decided that it was. And it may decide that
forced higher prices for young people
(from twelve through 21 years) are also in
the public's interest.
If the new CAB ruling is upheld by the
five-member Board, youth fare will termin
ate a month later.

The youth fare plan was based on the
premises that young people have less
money to spend on air travel than adults do
and that more young people would use air
transportation if the price were lower.
The present policy of filling remaining
seats with half-fare passengers must be con
trasted with the alternative of flying
partially-empty scheduled flights.
Young people would like to have the
possibility of traveling for less fare. The air
lines would like to use their facilities at as
full capacity as possible.
Giving lower rates to families, to armed
forces personnel, and to young people in
creases the number of people who can af
ford air travel.
We concur with Congressman Arnold
Olsen of Montana, who asserts, "I fail to
see how permitting a young person to fly
half fare on a seat that would otherwise go
empty discriminates against regular passen
gers."
