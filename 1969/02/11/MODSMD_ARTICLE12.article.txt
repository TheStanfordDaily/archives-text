# Letters To The Editor
## Disputes 'A Black Dilemma' 
### 
Editor, THE DAILY:
I am writing this letter on my
own account, in response to yes
terday's column by Michael
Sweeney, so as to clear up the
many misassumptions and inac
curate statements given me by
that aspiring journalist-writer.
Michael Sweeney's head quite
obviously was in the wrong place
when Stanford's BSU held its
noon rally, otherwise he would
not have misheard what he heard
nor would he have gone off on the
sort of self-indulging dribble that
resulted in his assessing both
myself, and Leo Bazile, with mo
tives that might read well in some
Freudian-oriented sociology text
book that has not a thing at all to
do with what is going on in the
world today.
In building his case (i.e., the
BSU demands as put forth by
both Leo and myself, in the rhet
oric as such, portended violence
and threats and polarization of
the races unless justice was done),
Mr. Sweeney, who should have
known better considering his own
considerable background in jour
nalism and the publishing world
(McGraw-Hill and Co. last sum
mer, right down the street from
the Newsweek offices where I in
terned), wrote that I "cheerfully
told us (white people) not to be
surprised if firebombs hit the
bookstore and beatings started in
Tresidder Union."
Of Leo, Sweeney wrote,
"Bazile said he was ready to kill."
Both of these quotes were not
only taken out of context by Mr.
Sweeney, but they are outright
lies and the tape recording that
we, members of the BSU, made of
that rally, which includes the en
tirety of what was and was not
said, will bear us out.
But, Stanford readers, what
was going on in that aforemen
tioned article was another kind of
thing altogether —a very vicious
sort of pandering to the interests
to the sort of sheltered mentality
that looks for endless rationales to
the upheaval occuring all across
this country, from the college
campuses on down and through
both the black and white com
munities.
Michael Sweeney attributed
the motivation for my remarks to
my past incident with the Stan
ford Gaieties where, as he put it,
"He (Scott) didn't mention it at
the rally but last summer Scott
wrote a militant script for the
traditional Big Game Gaities. The
white producers couldn't stomach
it and cancelled the show. Scott
sought revenge Tuesday by de
manding large appropriations for
all-black drama and writing work
shops."
Nothing could be a clearer case
of fabrication than that state
ment. In the first place, with Dean

of Students Bill Wyman in charge,
an investigation of that entire af
fair was made by the Administra
tion and all of what Sweeney im
puted could be refuted by one
statement from the Dean's Office.
In the second place, Rams
head's producer for that show, the
final one, Stephen Ungar, will
come out and tell you where it
was not a case of how "The white
producers couldn't stomach the
script." In fact, by drawing the
distinction between black and
white as Sweeney did in talking
about "white producers," it is he,
in effect, who raises the color
question so as to move on to the
next statement that I "sought re
venge."
I say to you, Michael Sweeney,
that it was a neat ploy but you
have gotten caught, Baby, like the
saying goes, "Up the creek with
out a paddle."
You Stanford readers should
note where these charges and mis
quotes were made at the begin
ning of that article, in the sense of
laying a foundation for Sweeney's
later ruminations on the "Black
Dilemma" which amounted to a
great deal of nonsensical farting
around with an issue a good deal
more involved than Sweeney's so
called observations on the psycho
logical stresses black students at
white universities are subjected to,
whether true or not.
I did not have to have Gaieties
cancel a script in order to feel the
need for Black-to-Black dialogue
on this campus, Baby. I did not
have to seek "revenge," as you
put it, Sweeney, on the "gentle
people" of Stanford because of
that at all. You write and talk just
like a white boy who has been
liberated by a domestic mission
spent over the summer in one of
the nation's ghettoes and you are
wrong, Mike Sweeney, very wrong
if you think that 80 type-written
lines is going to place you on a
pedestal of enlightened insight
into the "Problem."
You need to listen more so
that you get your quotes straight.
You lied when you had me
"cheerfully" advocating firebomb
ing. You lied when you had me
"cheerfully" advocating assault
upon anybody, whether white or
black. You lied on Leo Bazile as
well. And where "cultural imper
ialism" is concerned, you did the
reading populace at Stanford a
great disservice in neglecting to
really search into exactly what it
is that I was talking about as well
as placing The Daily in the posi
tion of being potentially the liti
gant in a case where I would bring
charges against them for imputing
to me advocacy of anarchism and
nihilism in the name of what was,
and still remains "Reformist De
mands" (a quote you did not pick
up on).

The room for a dialogue be
tween black and white remains
open at this campus, and on a
level more involved than the in
hibited sort that now prevails. But
it is people like Michael Sweeney,
in their all-prevailing know
nothingism, who only act to ag
gravate and polarize an already
serious situation. This sort of
thing can no longer continue, and
I, personally, do not plan to toler
ate it.

• SRI Forum Helpful
Editor, THE DAILY:
The Thursday all-campus
forum on the Stanford Research
Institute seemed especially helpful
in clarifying many issues. Al
though able to attend only part of
the session, I was able —finally—to
reach some conclusion on this
complex question: the University
must either take over much more
direct control of SRI and its re
search philosophies or else divorce
itself completely from formal con
nections with SRI. It would seem
also that much of the future de
bate on SRI should be addressed
to these two alternatives—as the
only ones which the University
can now consider.
Of these two choices, the bet
ter position seems clearly for the
University to sever its formal ties
and to leave any future inter
actions on an individual basis.

F.S. THE DAILY should be ap
plauded for its "new look" and
content. Especially encouraging is
the seeming attitude as to what
THE DAILY can and should be.
Although Volume 155, Numbers
1-5 are only a start and there is a
long way to go, the corner may
have been turned in establishing
the responsible newspaper that
the Stanford community deserves
and needs?
• Race Not The Issue
Editor, THE DAILY
I am Chinese by race, Amer
ican by citizenship, but was born
and raised in a British colony;
therefore, I suppose I do not
come under the category of those
Chinese-Americans among whom
(so Miss Shirley Sun alleges) "a
new yellow consciousness is
emerging". Nor would I wish to
be one of this gorup.
I would like to ask Miss Sun
what her "Chineseness" means to
her. For myself, it means a love of
Chinese culture, and the enjoy
ment of the (inbred) ability to ex
perience life through both Chinese
and Western world views. This
contributes to my only quanti
tavely, not qualitatively; my
being Chinese does nothing to de
tract from or add to whatever

moral worth I possess. I resent
Miss Sun's attempt to make an
ethical issue out of race. "Race" is
an unfortunate concept which
some people employ to make im
mediate generalizations about in
dividuals. Surely, with the long
Chinese history of persecution
and exploitation by foreigners, we
should have learned not to use
this fallacy in evaluating others;
nor is it rational to be goaded into
defensiveness by such an ungross
ly unfair characterization. What
place does race have in one's eval
uation of oneself?
Paradoxically enough, the
"Chinese" way (if you want to be
racist about it) of reacting to the
entire issue would be diametrical
ly opposed to that of Miss Sun's,
and to her characterization of Pro
fessor Tan as a kind of "Uncle
Charlie". Defensiveness is a sign of
inadequate self respect, and it is
self-respect which renders one im
mune to slander. It was Mencius
who said, "One must first have
humiliated oneself before it be
comes possible for others to hu
miliate one." I cannot speak for
Professor Tan either as an individ
ual or as a Chinese; I can only
comment that from his letter he
seems to agree with this state
ment.

Editor, THE DAILY::
On the front page of today's
Daily there are five headlines, four
of which contain samples of the
many abbreviations now in use on
campus—SES, HRC, SCLC, etc.
Modern society, having de
humanized the student, the uni
versity, the corporation, and the
telephone company, is apparently
in the process of dehumanizing
the English language.
Undoubtedly in the future all
nouns, verbs, and adjectives will
be known only by their first let
ter, and every person will be
equipped with a portable com
puter to provide the complete
range of all possible extrapola
tions from any set of letters.
Oh, well. As Shakespeare said.
ARBAOWSAS.
