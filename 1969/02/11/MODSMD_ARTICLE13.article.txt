# Caught In The Middle
## 'Stop, Look And Listen' 
### Thomas C. Dawson 
Calls are being made for a "rad
ical-liberal coalition" to succeed
where SDS has failed—in mobil
izing the student body against the
war, Stanford's involvement in it
and in favor of "a more demo
cratic university."
These are all reasonable goal*:
for the student body to seek. But
need this striving be undertaken
by this "radical-liberal coalition"
consisting of the Stanford SDS
and "concerned" liberals? I think
not.
An alliance between campus
liberals and radicals at this point
will only serve to aid campus dis
ruption and will not bring any
closer the end of the war or a
more democratic university.
What is happening, I feel, is
that SDS has realized that its tac
tics of thL quarter have so turned
off the student body that they
enjoy pitifully little support from
anyone. SDS's tolerance, indeed
use, of violence on campus if con
trary to the will of the student
body as expressed in last spring's
campus election in which students
condemned forceful occupation
of university buildings by more
than a two-to-one margin.
Realizing this separation from
many students, SDS is backtrack
ing, trying to build up a "move
ment" in the dorms, using issues
many, if not most, students sup
port: an end to the war, an end to
Stanford's involvement in it and a
more democratic university.
Campus radicals came close to
finding a unifying issue last spring
when the Interim Judicial Body

suspended seven students in one
of the most short-sighted deci
sions in modern jurisprudence.
Even with the considerable provo
cation of the IJB, students still
voted two-to-one against the resul
tant sit-in. This was the high tide
of the radicals on campus.
They now turn to us (maybe
not me, but you) saying, "You're
against the war, you want more
say in the governance of the uni
versity. Why not join us?"
It sounds nice, but look at the
recent record of SDS here. Since
the beginning of this quarter they
have broken into a Board of Trus
tees meeting, tried to break into
an office of Stanford Research In
stitute and the Applied Electron
ics Lab here on campus. They
certainly show no signs of repent
ance for these acts and indeed
flaunt them as symbols of their
potency.

Another ploy SDS uses in their
attempt to gain support is that the
liberals "have remained silent and
thus done nothing to effect
change." If silence means not
breaking and entering, then in
deed campus liberals have been
silent.
But if silence means not work
ing to change the university, lib
erals have not been silent. Rather
they have been very active. The
Judicial Charter, the SRI invest
igating committee, student-faculty
committees, the Study of Educa
tion at Stanford and many other
activities have involved "campus
liberals" this year and significant
changes in the functioning of the
university are likely to result from
many of these activities.
To say that the SDS is the only
group "putting themselves on the
line" is true if putting oneself on
the line means physically pushing

and shoving, but if it means speak
ing out against inequities in the
world and the university then SDS
is not alone.
"Liberals," the bane of SDS's
existence, have been working for
changes in the university, have
gotten some and are working for
more. They are doing it without
provoking a vicious split in the
university.
I myself have become wary of
doing ANYTHING in conjunction
with SDS, but my advice for less
cynical "campus liberals" is to be
careful. Is SDS using you for their
own purposes? They are against
the violence in Southeast Asia.
How about in the Faculty Club?
Have liberals on campus really
achieved nothing? Stop, Look and
Listen.
