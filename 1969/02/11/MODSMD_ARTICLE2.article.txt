# Six SES Discussions Cover Varied Topics
## 
### 
Six free-floating discussions concern
ing educational reforms were held in
various dormitories last night. Yesterday
afternoon's speeches by David Riesman,
Irving Howe, and Tom Grissom served
as touchstones for the discussions.
Walter Meyerhof, Professor of
Physics, moderated the Soto House dis
cussion. Stressing the purpose of the
Study of Education at Stanford (SES)
as "making education more flexible",
Meyerhof reviewed the general aspects
of the SES proposals and called for a
free exchange from the audience of
thirty regarding the propositions.
Views expressed ranged from "I'm

here for a degree in Biology" to "My
wish is that Stanford will enable me to
determine what type of life I want to
live and how I shall live it." Or as
Meyerhof aptly stated, "How can Stan
ford help you find your identity?"
The Serra House discussion, attended
by approximately forty students, was
moderated by Professor Mosier, in
structor in the Speech and Drama De
partment, and Professor Calin, scholar
in the French Department.
The purpose of undergraduate edu
cation and the subject of grades were
the primary topics of discussion.
According to Mike Morton, junior in
political science, "the university should
be a place where people may educate
themselves" and, an institution "where
people are mature enough to decide the
course of their education."
Calin stated that "undergraduate
euucation should be liberal; graduate
schools should provide professional
training."
The virtues and vices of the pass-fail
system were also explored. Rather than
a continuation of high school with its
pressure for grades, most students felt
that it was time to educate themselves
and that grades were detrimental to this
goal.
Ten students, three professors and a
three-page proposal for the establish
ment of a Student center for "Continu
ing Research and Innovation in Edu
cation" got together in the Adelpha
lounge.
Professor Merrill J. Carlsmith,
Psychology, Professor Peter Stern,
History and Professor Ronald Mellor,
Classics, led the discussion centered
around the Student Center proposal and
the Howe, Riesman and Grissom
speeches.
The group divided quickly into two
camps—those who shared Prof. Carl
smith's view, "We don't want to give
anybody academic credit for becoming
a human being," and those who echoed
sophomore Mary Ellen Conley's senti
ments that, "The University ought to
realize that this is a time for develop
ment and try not to structure this de
velopment too much."

smith's view, "We don't want to give
anybody academic credit for becoming
a human being," and those who echoed
sophomore Mary Ellen Conley's senti
ments that, "The University ought to
realize that this is a time for develop
ment and try not to structure this de
velopment too much."
Six free-floating discussions concern
ing educational reforms were held in
various dormitories last night. Yesterday
afternoon's speeches by David Riesman,
Irving Howe, and Tom Grissom served
as touchstones for the discussions.
Walter Meyerhof, Professor of
Physics, moderated the Soto House dis
cussion. Stressing the purpose of the
Study of Education at Stanford (SES)
as "making education more flexible",
Meyerhof reviewed the general aspects
of the SES proposals and called for a
free exchange from the audience of
thirty regarding the propositions.
Views expressed ranged from "I'm

here for a degree in Biology" to "My
wish is that Stanford will enable me to
determine what type of life I want to
live and how I shall live it." Or as
Meyerhof aptly stated, "How can Stan
ford help you find your identity?"
The Serra House discussion, attended
by approximately forty students, was
moderated by Professor Mosier, in
structor in the Speech and Drama De
partment, and Professor Calin, scholar
in the French Department.
The purpose of undergraduate edu
cation and the subject of grades were
the primary topics of discussion.
According to Mike Morton, junior in
political science, "the university should
be a place where people may educate
themselves" and, an institution "where
people are mature enough to decide the
course of their education."
Calin stated that "undergraduate
euucation should be liberal; graduate
schools should provide professional
training."
The virtues and vices of the pass-fail
system were also explored. Rather than
a continuation of high school with its
pressure for grades, most students felt
that it was time to educate themselves
and that grades were detrimental to this
goal.
Ten students, three professors and a
three-page proposal for the establish
ment of a Student center for "Continu
ing Research and Innovation in Edu
cation" got together in the Adelpha
lounge.
Professor Merrill J. Carlsmith,
Psychology, Professor Peter Stern,
History and Professor Ronald Mellor,
Classics, led the discussion centered
around the Student Center proposal and
the Howe, Riesman and Grissom
speeches.
The group divided quickly into two
camps—those who shared Prof. Carl
smith's view, "We don't want to give
anybody academic credit for becoming
a human being," and those who echoed
sophomore Mary Ellen Conley's senti
ments that, "The University ought to
realize that this is a time for develop
ment and try not to structure this de
velopment too much."
