# Howe: University Has Lost Sight Of Ideals

### BARBARA RITZ 
Noted author and critic Irving Howe,
professor of English at Hunter College,
discussed "The University's Survival" in
the second speech beginning the study
of education at Stanford (SES) discus
sions.
Howe, a former professor of English
at Stanford, spoke on problems facing
the university's survival—what should
the university be, can it survive, and in
deed, should it survive?
"The university should serve as a cen
ter for disinterested learning, " he com
mented, "and should be a sanctuary for
opinion, but this is not always the sit
uation" Howe observed.
"What has been happening to the
American University is a gradual and all
too-cheerful adaptation to the surround
ing social landscape; it has become too
absorbed with weapon-producing re
search, too subject to the creed of
material growth and power, and too
caught up in the mystique of quantifica
tion."
Howe said that some of the problems
with the university and its concept of
mass-education might be better handled
if there were a self-assured intellectual
leadership within the university. This is
a leadership which protects knowledge
and sees to it that there is neither "en
croachment nor surrender" on any side,
he said.
Howe stated that the complaints
from students about the lack of social
awareness of professors are misdirected
attacks.
"The old-fashioned traditional schol
ar sticking by his narrow specialty no
matter who gets bombed or what free
dom march occurs, may not be an in
spiring model for the young; but at least
he sustains the values of disinterested
scholarship which are essential for the
survival of a true university.
"Much more menacing, as it seems to
me, is the professor-entrepreneur busy
with a mass of grants, textbooks, in
stitutes, conferences, consultations,
indeed, with everything but serious
teaching and intellectual work."
While Howe noted that such feeling

is grounded in reality, he said that more
has to be learned about the university as
an institution, and about the power of
administrative bureaucracies which re
gard the university as essentially "their"
institution.
Howe stressed the progress that has
been made over the last few decades to
lessen the power of Boards of Trustees.
"I think these powers should be
reduced to the vanishing point, approx
imately like those of an English mon
arch.
"What I find disturbing, however, is
that rebellious students should now
direct their thrust against Boards of
Trustees—rather as if Englishmen un
happy with their government, were to
urge the king to reassert his lapsed
powers.
"If enough Englishmen were to say
this, a deluded monarch might suppose
the time had come to restore absolu
tism - if enough students were to keep
insisting that the Board of Trustees is
the 'ruling class' of the university some
boards might begin trying to rule, which
would be unfortunate."

ing social landscape; it has become too
absorbed with weapon-producing re
search, too subject to the creed of
material growth and power, and too
caught up in the mystique of quantifica
tion."
Howe said that some of the problems
with the university and its concept of
mass-education might be better handled
if there were a self-assured intellectual
leadership within the university. This is
a leadership which protects knowledge
and sees to it that there is neither "en
croachment nor surrender" on any side,
he said.
Howe stated that the complaints
from students about the lack of social
awareness of professors are misdirected
attacks.
"The old-fashioned traditional schol
ar sticking by his narrow specialty no
matter who gets bombed or what free
dom march occurs, may not be an in
spiring model for the young; but at least
he sustains the values of disinterested
scholarship which are essential for the
survival of a true university.
"Much more menacing, as it seems to
me, is the professor-entrepreneur busy
with a mass of grants, textbooks, in
stitutes, conferences, consultations,
indeed, with everything but serious
teaching and intellectual work."
While Howe noted that such feeling

is grounded in reality, he said that more
has to be learned about the university as
an institution, and about the power of
administrative bureaucracies which re
gard the university as essentially "their"
institution.
Howe stressed the progress that has
been made over the last few decades to
lessen the power of Boards of Trustees.
"I think these powers should be
reduced to the vanishing point, approx
imately like those of an English mon
arch.
"What I find disturbing, however, is
that rebellious students should now
direct their thrust against Boards of
Trustees—rather as if Englishmen un
happy with their government, were to
urge the king to reassert his lapsed
powers.
"If enough Englishmen were to say
this, a deluded monarch might suppose
the time had come to restore absolu
tism - if enough students were to keep
insisting that the Board of Trustees is
the 'ruling class' of the university some
boards might begin trying to rule, which
would be unfortunate."
Noted author and critic Irving Howe,
professor of English at Hunter College,
discussed "The University's Survival" in
the second speech beginning the study
of education at Stanford (SES) discus
sions.
Howe, a former professor of English
at Stanford, spoke on problems facing
the university's survival—what should
the university be, can it survive, and in
deed, should it survive?
"The university should serve as a cen
ter for disinterested learning, " he com
mented, "and should be a sanctuary for
opinion, but this is not always the sit
uation" Howe observed.
"What has been happening to the
American University is a gradual and all
too-cheerful adaptation to the surround
ing social landscape; it has become too
absorbed with weapon-producing re
search, too subject to the creed of
material growth and power, and too
caught up in the mystique of quantifica
