# Kirtman, Montle Criticize HRC Suggestions On Koff
## 
### 
In a sharply worded letter to Presi
dent Kenneth Pitzer, the two black
members of the Human Relations Com
mission (HRC), have condemned Robert
Koff's "cocksure attitude of superior
ity" and "discriminatory conduct."
Nate Kirtman and Mary Montle also
called for his immediate removal as
Director of the Secondary Teachers
Education Program (STEP).
Professor Koff was not available for
comment. President Pitzer who has not
yet received formal delivery of the letter
although he has seen preliminary copies
would not comment.
The report, which was released Tues
day morning, recommended that Koff
no longer interview STEP applicants but
did not suggest he be dismissed from his
Directorship of the program.
Neither of the two BSU members
voted in the report for several reasons
saying lawyers for Koff claimed the
Director "could not receive a fair hear
ing unless we were disqualified as far as
voting is concerned."

Secondly, Kirtman and Montle de
clared, "it is apparent tha members of
the faculty and administration will pro
tect their own regardless, and there are
clear implications throughout their testi
mony that only Mr. Koff's 'peers' are
competent to judge 'inappropriate, ir
responsible and unprofessional' behav
ior. .
The two continued that "we find
that Human Relations Commission's
finding and recommendations particu
larly distressing since we have arrived at
very different conclusions after being
exposed to the same testimony."

The members maintained that "some
of these questions whether rhetorical or
direct were not only 'indelicate' but
within this context were unprofessional
and constituted an obvious lack of
respect. . .
Discriminatory Conduct
"There is no doubt in our mind that
there was discriminatory conduct but
more important, there was sufficient
evdence to lead us to conclude that the
intent was there as well."
They concluded, "whether or not she
was admitted (to STEP) is irrelevant,

Mr. Koff's cocksure attitude of super
iority—superiority in judging Blacks
is."
In recommending alternate action to
the report, Kirtman and Montle stated
"we strongly feel that Mr. Koff abused
his position of authority and should be
removed from the position of Director
of the STEP program."
The letter also mentioned that
Kirtman was resigning from HRC and
that Miss Montle is "strongly consider
ing such a move."

yet received formal delivery of the letter
although he has seen preliminary copies
would not comment.
The report, which was released Tues
day morning, recommended that Koff
no longer interview STEP applicants but
did not suggest he be dismissed from his
Directorship of the program.
Neither of the two BSU members
voted in the report for several reasons
saying lawyers for Koff claimed the
Director "could not receive a fair hear
ing unless we were disqualified as far as
voting is concerned."
Protect Their Own
Secondly, Kirtman and Montle de
clared, "it is apparent tha members of
the faculty and administration will pro
tect their own regardless, and there are
clear implications throughout their testi
mony that only Mr. Koff's 'peers' are
competent to judge 'inappropriate, ir
responsible and unprofessional' behav
ior. .
The two continued that "we find
that Human Relations Commission's
finding and recommendations particu
larly distressing since we have arrived at
very different conclusions after being
exposed to the same testimony."

The members maintained that "some
of these questions whether rhetorical or
direct were not only 'indelicate' but
within this context were unprofessional
and constituted an obvious lack of
respect. . .
Discriminatory Conduct
"There is no doubt in our mind that
there was discriminatory conduct but
more important, there was sufficient
evdence to lead us to conclude that the
intent was there as well."
They concluded, "whether or not she
was admitted (to STEP) is irrelevant,

Mr. Koff's cocksure attitude of super
iority—superiority in judging Blacks
is."
In recommending alternate action to
the report, Kirtman and Montle stated
"we strongly feel that Mr. Koff abused
his position of authority and should be
removed from the position of Director
of the STEP program."
The letter also mentioned that
Kirtman was resigning from HRC and
that Miss Montle is "strongly consider
ing such a move."
