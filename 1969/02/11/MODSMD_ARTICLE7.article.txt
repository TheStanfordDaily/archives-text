Dear Mr. Pitzer:
It is with a great deal of regret, anger,
and disillusionment that we direct this
letter to you regarding the Koff/Steven
son matter. We participated in the hear
ing surrounding the case and in the
majority of the subsequent deliber
ations. As students, as Black people, and
as members of the Human Rights Com
mission, we were extremely dissatisfied
with many aspects of this case, and feel
for the first time the necessity of strong
ly dissenting from the findings and
recommendations of the Commission.
It should be noted, however, that al
though we participated fully in the pro
ceedings, neither of us took part in the
voting on this matter for several reasons.
The attorneys for Mr. Koff repeatedly
made reference to our affiliation with
the Black Students Union and clearly
implied on several occasions that Mr.
Koff could not receive a fair hearing
unless we were disqualified as far as
voting is concerned. As members of the
Commission, we are convinced that the
effectiveness of the Commission's work
is only as far-reaching as the confidence
which those charged and the com
plainants have in the proceedings. To
give Mr. Koff that confidence, we have
refrained from voting at the expense of
the representation of the Black Student
community in the ultimate decisions of
the Commission.
A second reason for declining to
participate is the frequent references,
particularly by Dean James and Dr.
Hawkenshire, of the inappropriateness
of such a group as ours sitting in judg
ment of Mr. Koff in determining "un
professional ism." It is apparent that
members of the faculty will protect
their own regardless and there are clear
implications throughout their testimony
that only Mr. Koff's "peers" are com
petent to judge "inappropriate, irre
sponsible, and unprofessional" behavior
even when the charges originate from
one of our "peers." As student members
of the Commission, we refuse to con
stantly be subjected to this kind of dis
respect from members of the faculty
and/or Administration; part of our re
fusal to vote is an attempt to com
municate that we shall not participate in
a decision where our objectivity is

questioned, even tacitly, nor where our
judgment, our evaluations are not
wanted by those whom we serve.
As students, particularly Black stu
dents, we participated in the hearing, al
though angry, to offset some of the
hostility in the Black community and in
order that we might have the facts be
fore reaching any conclusions. We had
hoped to be able to bring, not only ob
jectivity, but the Black perspective, the
victim's perspective to this case, the
Black man's view of Mr. Koff's behavior
and intent. In this way, without partic
ipating in the final decision, we may at
least be informed before facing our
peers, if Mr. Koff's peers refused to act.
We find the Human Relations Com
mission's findings and recommendations
particularly distressing since we have ar
rved at very different conclusions after
being exposed to the same testimony.
We would like to address ourselves par
tcularly to the following findings:
3. With regard to the conflict in
testimony regarding the nature of
the questions, we feel that we
heard sufficient testimony from
Mr. Koff himself that at least one
of those questions—namely,
"Have you ever not had enough
money for medical care?" "I
notice you are wearing contact
lenses—do you know that there
are people in the ghetto who can
not even afford corrective
lenses?" was put to her directly.
This, coupled with the fact that
Miss Stevenson testified that she
responded negatively to the first
two questions in the series, leads
us to doubt Mr. Koff's testimony
that the questions were "rhetor
ical" or "heuristic." We further
feel that some of these questions
whether rhetorical or direct were
not only "indelicate" but within
this context were unprofessional
and constituted an obvious lack
of respect.
6. We find this particularly unac
ceptable since the implication
throughout is that the "psycho
logical stress" and "racist in
nuendo" are dependent upon Mr.
Koff's intent. In our opinion, in-
