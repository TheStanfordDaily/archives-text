Dear Mr. Pitzer:
It is with a great deal of regret, anger,
and disillusionment that we direct this
letter to you regarding the Koff/Steven
son matter. We participated in the hear
ing surrounding the case and in the
majority of the subsequent deliber
ations. As students, as Black people, and
as members of the Human Rights Com
mission, we were extremely dissatisfied
with many aspects of this case, and feel
for the first time the necessity of strong
ly dissenting from the findings and
recommendations of the Commission.
It should be noted, however, that al
though we participated fully in the pro
ceedings, neither of us took part in the
voting on this matter for several reasons.
The attorneys for Mr. Koff repeatedly
made reference to our affiliation with
the Black Students Union and clearly
implied on several occasions that Mr.
Koff could not receive a fair hearing
unless we were disqualified as far as
voting is concerned. As members of the
Commission, we are convinced that the
effectiveness of the Commission's work
is only as far-reaching as the confidence
which those charged and the com
plainants have in the proceedings. To
give Mr. Koff that confidence, we have
refrained from voting at the expense of
the representation of the Black Student
community in the ultimate decisions of
the Commission.
A second reason for declining to
participate is the frequent references,
particularly by Dean James and Dr.
Hawkenshire, of the inappropriateness
of such a group as ours sitting in judg
ment of Mr. Koff in determining "un
professional ism." It is apparent that
members of the faculty will protect
their own regardless and there are clear
implications throughout their testimony
that only Mr. Koff's "peers" are com
petent to judge "inappropriate, irre
sponsible, and unprofessional" behavior
even when the charges originate from
one of our "peers." As student members
of the Commission, we refuse to con
stantly be subjected to this kind of dis
respect from members of the faculty
and/or Administration; part of our re
fusal to vote is an attempt to com
municate that we shall not participate in
a decision where our objectivity is

questioned, even tacitly, nor where our
judgment, our evaluations are not
wanted by those whom we serve.
As students, particularly Black stu
dents, we participated in the hearing, al
though angry, to offset some of the
hostility in the Black community and in
order that we might have the facts be
fore reaching any conclusions. We had
hoped to be able to bring, not only ob
jectivity, but the Black perspective, the
victim's perspective to this case, the
Black man's view of Mr. Koff's behavior
and intent. In this way, without partic
ipating in the final decision, we may at
least be informed before facing our
peers, if Mr. Koff's peers refused to act.
We find the Human Relations Com
mission's findings and recommendations
particularly distressing since we have ar
rved at very different conclusions after
being exposed to the same testimony.
We would like to address ourselves par
tcularly to the following findings:
3. With regard to the conflict in
testimony regarding the nature of
the questions, we feel that we
heard sufficient testimony from
Mr. Koff himself that at least one
of those questions—namely,
"Have you ever not had enough
money for medical care?" "I
notice you are wearing contact
lenses—do you know that there
are people in the ghetto who can
not even afford corrective
lenses?" was put to her directly.
This, coupled with the fact that
Miss Stevenson testified that she
responded negatively to the first
two questions in the series, leads
us to doubt Mr. Koff's testimony
that the questions were "rhetor
ical" or "heuristic." We further
feel that some of these questions
whether rhetorical or direct were
not only "indelicate" but within
this context were unprofessional
and constituted an obvious lack
of respect.
6. We find this particularly unac
ceptable since the implication
throughout is that the "psycho
logical stress" and "racist in
nuendo" are dependent upon Mr.
Koff's intent. In our opinion, in-
tent is only somewhat rele
vant here just as her reac
tion is only partially the is
sue. The crucial issue is the
behavior and our objective
evaluation of it. There is no
doubt in our mind that
there was discriminatory
conduct but more impor
tant, there was sufficient
evidence to lead us to con
clude that the intent was
there as well. Mr. Koff
knowlingly held a teaching
counseling session which he
expected to have an effect
upon Miss Stevenson. The
lack of reaction on her part
was a conscious one as
much as his attempt to get
her to question herself, her
blackness, her identity was.
Because the Commission
couldn't "reach agreement
on the meaning of the
phrase 'racist innuendo,' "
they chose not to go further
and decide whether or not
the comments were not
knowingly deprecatory of
Miss Stevenson. Whether or
not she was admitted is ir
relevant, Mr. Koff's cock
sure attitude of superiority
—superiority in judging
Blacks —is.
Finally, the whole tone of this
report is that of Miss Stevenson's
"perceptions" as if there exists no
reality between what she per
ceived, what actually happened
and Mr. Koff's intent. The reality
is somewhat clearer to us and it is
that reality upon which the Hu
man Relations Commission should
have commented. We regret that
the members of the Human Rela
tions Commission could not truly
understand our perception of that
reality.
The members of the Human
Relations Commission failed to
understand—as evidenced by these
findings and recommendations—
Dr. Koff's behavior from the
point of view of the victim, the
victim who so appropriately la
beled his behavior "institutional
racism" They failed to see that
Mr. Koff's behavior and atti
tudes—however typical and per
vasive they may be here at Stan
ford—was his behavior. Institu
tional racism cannot exist unless
there are individuals who exhibit
racist behavior. Mr. Koff was Miss

Stevenson's representative of this
institution on January 6, 1969
and his remarks, his behavior were
deprecatory—not of Black people
in general but of one Black young
lady in particular.
Very clearly, Dr. Koff's be
havior constituted racist conduct
and cannot be seen outside of the
realm of discriminatory treat
ment. We are speaking here, not
of racism in the traditional sense
of the bigot who feels negatively
toward blacks but of the more
modern racism to which we are
subjected by white liberals. The
question here is whether or not
Mr. Koff, whatever his feelings in
general about Blacks are, inten
tionally subjected this young lady
to psychological abuse, knowingly
judged her blackness from his lib
eral point of view. By his own ad
mission, Mr. Koff had judged Miss
Stevenson's level of identification
with the "ghetto" community and
was attempting to get her to rec
ognize her lack of awareness, her
"middle-classness."
In our opinion, the only neces
sary condition for finding dis
criminatory conduct is the nega
tive differential treatment of a
person because of his race or
other characteristic. Mr. Koff pre
judged Miss Stevenson's racial
identification and in a very disre
spectful manner used that infor
mation to inflict psychological
stress upon her. This constitutes
dscriminatory conduct.
Recommendation
For the moment, we will only

concern ourselves with the recom
mendation regarding Mr. Koff al
though one might go far beyond
that to prevent the recurrence of
this kind of incident. Dean James
stated that anything is appropriate
as long as Mr. Koff felt that it was
so "in his professional judgment"
and that all of his employees have
his "full confidence and support."
Dr. Hawkenshire stated further
that "only a trained social psycho
logist" can evaluate the appropri
ateness of any interviewing tech
niques. If we were to accept these
premises, Mr. Koff is guilty of
nothing and students—especially
Black students—must find alter
nate means of protecting them
selves from this kind of harass
ment from those in authority.
If we do not, and feel that we
should participate—as potential
victims—in the evaluation of "pro
fessional" and/or "discrimina
tory" behavior, we must go fur
ther than the Commission's lim
ited recommendation regarding
Mr. Koff. We strongly feel that
Mr. Koff abused his position of
authority and should be removed
from the position of Director of
the STEP Program. We are not so
naive as not to realize that he
would, as Program Director, not
be interviewing any longer regard
less of the Human Relations Com
mission's decision. Nevertheless,
his insensitivity to the feelings of
others, his discriminatory behav
ior and lack of professionalism
definitely warrant his removal
from the head of a program which
purports to train teachers to deal
with members of minority groups
even on a small scale. Black peo
ple must be protected from the
Mr. Koffs who "care" so much
about them as to inflict that kind

of stress upon them. We insist
that, at the very least, we not have
to deal with "institutional racism"
in the person of Mr. Koff in the
future.
Mr. Kirtman is resigning from
the Commission effective immed
iately and Miss Montle is strongly
considering such a move. In many
ways, the Human Relations Com
mission's deliberation smacked
more of a delaying tactic than of
an attempt to evaluate the facts
from the complainant's perspec
tive. The recommendations were
predictably mild and we question
whether the Human Relations
Commission will and can be effec
tive in resolving the major con
flicts that arise in the future about
which minority group members
feel strongly. If the bodies set up
by the President cannot.deal with
them expeditiously, students will
deal with them "by any means
necessary."
Had we been convinced that
Mr. Koff was blameless, we would
have accepted the task of inter
preting the Human Relations
Commission's findings to the
Black community, of convincing
them to accept it and capitulating
from their present demand re
lating to Mr. Koff. Our participa
tion in the hearing has committed
us to silence regarding this case;
our disagreement with its findings
have led us to question the value
of its decisions and to explore al
ternative means of obtaining jus
tice for Blacks on this campus.
Sincerely,
NATHANIEL KIRTMAN
MARY MONTLE
