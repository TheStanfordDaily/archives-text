## Hits 'Wild Legislation Bills' 
### MICHAEL KUHL 
California Legislators will continue
to introduce "wild bills" against student
disruptions as long as the University
Regents and State College Trustees fail
to handle the problem, Leiutenant
Governor Ed Reinecke warned yester
day.
"And if it is the Legislature that does
it,"the former Southern California
Congressman told an audience of about
100 in Dinkelspiel Auditorium yester
day afternoon, "I think that we will
find a much more heavy handed ap
proach than we want."
Reinecke indicated that he has an
"open door and open mind" approach
to student concerns. "We need as many
inputs as possible from students and
faculty," he added.
Admitting that he was "pretty much
of a hawk" when it comes to problems
of campus distrubances, Reinecke urged
that they be "dealt with in a purely dis
ciplinary way."
Change Regency Selection
There is a need for an alternate
method of selecting Regents, Reinecke
indicated in an interview with the Daily.
"I would hope that we could get
politics out of the Board of Regents,"
Reinecke said. However, he doubts that
arbitrarily removing the elected state of
ficials who serve on the Board would
solve the situation.
After a short term in his new office,
the Lt. Governor has already an
nounced that he is seeking re-election.
With eye to the future, he allowed that
he "would be willing to consider" run
ning for Governor or Senator in 1974.
Busy Filling Vacancies
For the present, Reinecke intends to
take "as busy a role as I can" in getting
Republicans elected to posts vacated by
himself, Assemblyman John Venneman,
and the late State Senator George
Miller.

"I have told the new chairman of the
Republican State Central Committee
that outside of my statutory responsibil
ities, I will be on 100 per cent party
activities," Reinecke said.
During his three-term tenure in Con
gress, Reinecke concerned himself with
Interior and Insular Affairs Committee
in the areas of reclamation, mining, and
oceanography.
He followed through with that con
cern yesterday by blasting the failure of
the federal government to review regu
larly offshore drilling regulations.
"I feel that the state should have the
right, if it decides to make its regula
tions much more stringent than the fed
eral government's, to have its regula
tions prevail," he said.
Reinecke further called on the Inter
ior Department to require drilling be
"stopped until we are guaranteed by the
shadow of reasonable doubt that the
oil spill in Santa Barbara won't happen
again."
