# Education Council

### 
The Thursday deadline for appli
cation to the ASSU Education Council
is rapidly approaching. Already there
are serious doubts as to whether the re
quired forty students will turn in their
names for the elections to be held
February 18 and 19.
The proposal council, which will con
sider the education recommendations of
the Study of Education at Stanford
(SES), will include forty students. The
graduate and undergraduate divisions of
the student body will be equally repre
sented. In both the graduate and under
graduate divisions of the engineering
school, there have not yet been enough
applications received to fill the quota
for that school, (two members of the
undergraduate engineering division and

six from the graduate division)
There reportedly have not been suff
icient applications to the council from
any of the graduate professional
schools.
Applications to the Education Coun
cil must be signed by ten students from
the applicant's division. A student may
sign as many-petitions for other appli
cants as he wishes, but he may only sub
mit one application in his own name.
The Education Council is an out
growth of a proposal by the Coalition, a
loosely structured group of students in
terested in the SES proposals. The Co
al ition recommended joint student
faculty deliberation on the implemen
tation of the SES proposals.
