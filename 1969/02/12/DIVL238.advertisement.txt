Phonograph.
Where is it?
KLH designed the Model Eleven-W stereo
phonograph to produce a maximum of music
with a minimum of visible equipment.
You will have to look hard to spot the
Model Eleven-W in a room. Its control
center is just a bit bigger than the records
it plays, and the speakers are the size of
shoeboxes.
But you don't have to search for the
sound. It's as big as all indoors—the kind
of sound produced only by massive and
expensive audio systems.
The secret of the Model Eleven-W is a
quality of engineering that no one ever
thought of lavishing on something so
small and unpretentious. KLH designed
unique miniature speakers that can move
more air (for really deep bass) than far
larger console speakers, plus complemen
tary electronic circuitry that provides
exactly the proportion of power the
speakers need at different frequencies.
A .. . ; .
As for what you can see, there is a cus
tom built Garrard record changer with a
Pickering magnetic cartridge and diamond
stylus. And the cabinetry, what little there
is of it, is of genuine walnut veneers, not
plastic or the kind of wood that might as
well be plastic.
Come in and search out the KLH Model
Eleven-W. You will find its sound out of all
proportion to its size and cost.

Pickering magnetic cartridge and diamond
stylus. And the cabinetry, what little there
is of it, is of genuine walnut veneers, not
plastic or the kind of wood that might as
well be plastic.
Come in and search out the KLH Model
Eleven-W. You will find its sound out of all
proportion to its size and cost.

Great-Sounding
Phonograph.
Where is it?
KLH designed the Model Eleven-W stereo
phonograph to produce a maximum of music
with a minimum of visible equipment.
You will have to look hard to spot the
Model Eleven-W in a room. Its control
center is just a bit bigger than the records
it plays, and the speakers are the size of
shoeboxes.
But you don't have to search for the
sound. It's as big as all indoors—the kind
of sound produced only by massive and
expensive audio systems.
The secret of the Model Eleven-W is a
quality of engineering that no one ever
thought of lavishing on something so
small and unpretentious. KLH designed
unique miniature speakers that can move
more air (for really deep bass) than far
larger console speakers, plus complemen
tary electronic circuitry that provides
exactly the proportion of power the
speakers need at different frequencies.
A .. . ; .
As for what you can see, there is a cus
tom built Garrard record changer with a
Pickering magnetic cartridge and diamond
stylus. And the cabinetry, what little there
is of it, is of genuine walnut veneers, not
plastic or the kind of wood that might as
well be plastic.
