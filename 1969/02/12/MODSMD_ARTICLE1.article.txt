# Committee Recommends ROTC Credit End
## 
### FRANK MILLER 
ROTC is "not compatible with the
University" and no changes can remove
this basic difference, according to a
majority of a student-faculty commit
tee. Three members of the nine person
committee dissented in a separate report
to the Faculty Senate.
Recommendations of the majority
report released today included denying
academic credit for ROTC courses and
requiring any military activities on cam
pus to be conducted according to rules
governing voluntary student activities.
The minority report indicated that
such action "is inconsistent with a de
cision to continue ROTC at Stanford
and would be tantamount to abolition.
The 6 member majority indicated
that "for proper relations to exist, a
new mechanism must be createdâ€”one
that differs from the present program,
but can still serve the same purposes in
such a way as to be compatible with the
University. "
Standard Academic Practice
The minority report recommended
that the present ROTC programs at

Stanford be retained with a number of
changes "to bring them in closer con
formity with standard academic
practice."
The majority recommended that
"the role of military personnel on cam
pus be limited to administrative,
counseling and recruitment functions.
ROTC Not Compatible
According to the majority's report,
"as a formal, on-campus program, spon
sored, sanctioned, and partially support
ed by Stanford University, the ROTC
program is not compatible with the Uni
versity. The incompatibility is
inherent . . .and cannot be removed by
various changes which are from time to
time proposed."
Both majority and minority reports,
which are printed in their entirety in
The Daily, have been delivered to mem
bers of the Academic Senate. The
Senate will discuss the proposals on
Thursday.
Signing the majority report were
Prof. Thomas J. Connolly, mechanical
engineering, committee chairman;
George B. Cattermole, graduate student

in philosophy; Mark U. Edwards, gradu
ate student in history; Thomas L.
Grissom, graduate student in education;
Prof. Ani.e T. Kostelanetz, English; and
Prof. Lyman P. Van Slyke, history.
The three in the minority are: Prof.
Robert Thomas, naval science; Vice Pro
vost E. Howard Brooks; and Joseph T.
Carrato, senior in statistics.
Conflict of Interest
Prof. Kostelanetz, a member of the
majority of the committee, explained,
"We began with a definition of the Uni
versity and found an essential conflict
of interest between this and the concept
of ROTC. The report spells out very
clearly where these conflicts are."
The majority defines the university
as "a community whose members, in
cluding both faculty and students, have
a primary commitment to the creation
and dissemination of knowledge, in an
environment."
They feel that ROTC presently has
several general and specific problems at
Stanford. They cited that the officers
teaching ROTC courses have a conflict
of interest since they have primary com

mitments to both the U.S. government
and to Stanford.
Subsidy of ROTC
Other objections include: the train
ing for a position in the military by the
military, current contracts which call
lor Stanford to subsidize the ROTC pro
gram with facilities and personnel, con
tract agreements between the military
and students, and course goals.
Stressing that "the ultimate goals of
these (ROTC ] programs are fixed by
the Department of Defense." the major
ity report declares the goals to be in
compatible with the definition of the
university. It also indicates that the
"programs are clearly non-academic in
nature."
The majority considered retaining
ROTC on campus as an organized non
credit program of education and train
ing but decided that "the logic of the
general objections must apply generally
to the relations between ROTC and
Stanford."
Minority and majority reports were
required because the "members found
their overall positions to be so substan

tively different that a fair presentation
could only be made in separate
reports."
Legislation Change Needed
Col. Thomas said that if the majority
report were to be adopted, "It would be
ROTC in name only by its very nature.
It would take a change in legialation to
allow for the program as envisioned by
the majority to take place." The law
under which ROTC operates requires
that to maintain an ROTC unit, the in
stitution must adopt as a part of its cur
riculum either a four year course of
military instruction or a two year
course.
The minority report recommended
consolidation of the three military de
partments into a single department,
with a joint student-faculty committee
in charge of credit course in the military
science curriculum. New academic rank
would be given to ROTC instructors and
a new procedure would be developed
for appointing these instructors.
According to the minority, "there
has been no evidence presented to show
that ROTC programs are inimical to the
fundamental interests of Stanford Uni
versity or its students."
The minority attempted to answer
every problem in the Stanford-ROTC re
lationship mentioned by the majority.
Various Opinions
They began by stressing that various
opinions of what the University should
do for valid service to external concerns
and interests exist within the University.
They found that the ROTC presence on
campus was not "a threat to the integ
rity of the University."
Prof. Van Slyke indicated that the
majority were "not objecting to the ob
jectives of ROTC, the recruitment of
junior officers. We do object to the ve
hicle. We don't object to students under

contract attending Stanford but we do
object to on-campus training."
"All objections to ROTC were insti
tutional. The same recommendations
would have applied to any other insti
tution in similar circumstances."
Necessary to Security
Colonel Stanley Ramey, Professor of
Military Science, indicated his worry
about the effect this report would have
on the recruitment of junior officers for
the military. "ROTC is a system that at
this time is necessary to our security
and we don't have in being or in sight
another program. It produces the bulk
of the officers and it has worked in the
past.
"By the nature of recommendations
it [the report] destroys the program as
far as its usefulness. If the majority re
port is adopted, it will in effect, remove
ROTC from Stanford."
Prof. Kostelanetz said that "the com
mittee report goes beyond, although it
is in line with, what other universities
have done. The Department of Defense
will have to set up new programs in
order to attract capable young men as
junior officers."
Concept of University
Prof. Kostelanetz felt that the reason
for the need for two reports was a basic
"difference in the concept of the uni
versity."
Initiated by the Senate of the Aca
demic council Sept. 26, the Stanfrod
study report follows votes to deny
ROTC courses academic credit by facul
ty groups at Harvard, Yale, Cornell,
Pennsylvania, and Pomona.
If adopted by the Stanford faculty,
the decision to deny academic credit for
military training and education would
not become fully effective until 1973,
when students now enrolled in the pro
gram graduate.
