# Minority Reports Of ROTC Committee
## 
### 
because our charge as a committee limits us to
these programs.
The Majority believes that there are both gen
eral and specific objections which will continue
to exist as long as ROTC is a program integral to
the institutional structure of the University.
A. Conflict of Interest. The ROTC faculty,
being detailed to Stanford on a limited tour of
duty, remain professional military officers who
legally and ethically owe primary loyalty to the
branch of the service they represent, to the
armed forces, and to the U.S. government. This
means that, however high their integrity and
quality of mind, they cannot at the same time
have a primary commitment either to Stanford
University or to the academic enterprise. This
dual identity should be recognized as a conflict
of interest. The government itself recognizes very
clearly the potential peril of conflict-of-interest
situations, and rightly expects public servants
scrupulously to avoid them. It should be noted
that neither the government's position nor ours
rests upon the fact or even the presumption of
improper behavior.
Because this consideration applies to all mili
tary members of the ROTC, it therefore applies
by extension to the ROTC programs themselves.
These programs, as corporate entities—present
H&S departments—are themselves in a potential
conflict-of-interest situation with respect to the
University.
We recognize that other instances of conflict
of interest are by no means rare in the university;
these too are unfortunate. But they are individ
ual rather than collective, and they are character
ized, in nearly all cases, by a primary commit
ment to the University (note that the University
limits outside activities to an average of one day
per week).
B. Training for a specific employer, by that
employer. The ROTC programs represent the
corporate, institutional presence of an external
organization, which engages in specific training
of candidates for temporary or permanent em
ploy by that organization. The issue raised here is
not simply that of professional or pre-profes
sional training, but of such training carried on
by the armed forces, in the interests of the armed
forces. The Majority believes that such training
should not be a part of the academic structure of
the University.
C. Contractual Arrangements. The objection
able features of the present contracts can be con
sidered under two headings: contractual arrange
ments between the armed forces and Stanford
University, and between the armed forces and
individual students. While some of these arrange
ments may be subject to change, others would
not. Some are specified by the Vitalization Act
of 1964 and could not be changed except
through action by Congress.
C.l. Institutional Contracts. The contracts
between Stanford and the various military ser
vices provide for government commitment of an
academic and administrative staff, an instruc
tional program, government equipment, staff
salaries, and student financial assistance. In re
turn the University agrees to the establishment of
military science department, provision of class
rooms, offices and drill areas, appropriate aca
demic credit for military science courses, and a
minimum sustaining enrollment and output of
officers. In the case of the Army, representation
on all faculty committees whose recommenda
tions would directly affect the Department of
Military Science is stipulated. These contracts
further provide for prior approval and right of
dismissal by Stanford of all military officers as
signed to the department, assignment of the rank
of professor to the senior commissioned officer
of each service assigned to the institution and
lesser academic rank to other members of the
staffs, and the right of the Secretary of the mili
tary service involved to relieve from duty any
officer or enlisted man assigned to work at Stan
ford. These terms represent a partial abdication
of University control over the governance of its
own affairs.
It should be recognized that these arrange
ments result in a Stanford subsidy to the ROTC
programs. Stanford is obliged to provide facili
ties, services, and financial support to the ROTC
programs on a cost-free basis. For example, the
Air Force contract stipulates that Stanford pro
vide:
(1) "the necessary classrooms, administra
tive offices, storage spaces, government
vehicle parking areas, staff parking
areas and other required facilities in
the same manner and at the same level
as is provided to other Departments of
the Institution."
(2) "adequate secretarial, janitorial, and
telephone services ... on the same
basis as is provided to other Depart
ments within the Institution."
An increase in course substitution (see below
D.2.) .while desirable in some ways, will increase
the subsidy by relieving the ROTC programs of
that part of their instructional requirements. In
the Majority's view, such subsidies of the armed
forces are inappropriate.
C.2. Contractual Agreements between
Stanford ROTC Students and the Army, Navy
and Air Force. In this section the committee
states its objections to certain terms contained in
the existing contracts between Stanford ROTC
students and the three military services. It is to
be understood that the Committee does not ob
ject to a student entering into a legal and private
contractual agreement as long as the terms of
said agreement are neither contrary to the aca
demic goals and standards of the university nor
encroachments upon the university's integrity as
an institution of higher learning.
The Committee heard substantial testimony
to the effect that there exists a considerable dif
ference between de facto practice and de jure
obligations. Specifically, it has been the practice
of the three services to terminate a four-year fin
ancial-assistance contract in the first two years
without penalty or prejudice. This has a mitiga
ting effect but leaves the legal provisions of the
contracts technically intact.
C.2.a. Academic Prescriptions. All
three services require certain specified courses of
study. By contract, the student must follow this
prescribed course of study. In addition, the
Navy financial assistant program specifically ex
cludes certain courses of study, and the Air
Force contracts for certain courses of study.
These restrictions and requirements conflict with
the Majority view that Stanford undergraduates
should not be found by law to take and complete
a course of study prescribed by some agent or
agency external to the University, when that
agency also determines (directly or indirectly)
the mode and content of instruction of all or
part of the prescribed course.
All three services require that ROTC cadets
meet certain academic standards. The Majority
believes that Stanford undergraduates should not
be bound by law to maintain academic standards
prescribed by an external agency, especially
when that agency also participates in determining
whether or not such standards have been met.

C.2.b. Personal Conduct. All three
services require that the cadet maintain certain
unspecified standards of personal and moral con
duct. The Majority feels that such restrictions
can seriously limit the student's free participa
tion in all facets of intellectual inquiry and legal
political activity. Furthermore, the Navy finan
cial assistance contract stipulates that the candi
date "remain unmarried until commissioned."
These standards too are established by an agency
external to the University, and judgments con
cerning them are made by the same agency.
While the Majority recognizes the special require
ments of the armed forces and could not object
to similar conditions in contracts between indi
vidual students and the military services when
not a part of a university program or activity, it
can and does object to such conditions when
they are a part of a University-subsidized and
sanctioned activity.
C.2.c. Punitive Clauses. All three ser
vices include in their financial assistance con
tracts clauses that bind the student to a period of
enlisted service for "willfully evading" stipulated
terms. Despite the fact that these clauses have
rarely been invoked at Stanford, the Majority
deems them clearly punitive in intent, and feels
that they unduly infringe the student's freedom
within the University community.
C.2.d. Contracts for Service. To our
knowledge, the ROTC contracts are the only
University-sponsored and sanctioned contracts
on the undergraduate level that bind a student to
service. There are various loan programs such as
the NDEA which allow teaching service to act in
lieu of repayments. Still, these loan programs do
not require service, since the loans can be repaid
with appropriate interest over a period of years.
The ROTC financial assistance grants have no
such provision.
The Majority wishes to point out that these
contractual restrictions and/or obligations oper
ate as a whole. The punitive clauses operate in
relation to academic standards requirements,
course of study requirements, conduct require
ments, and service requirements. The service obli
gation is intimately related to the course of study
requirements. It is this interlocking of contrac
tual requirements, restrictions, and obligations
that makes the whole much more objectionable
than each of its parts might suggest. The Univer
sity's rights and obligations to establish, main
tain, and judge its own standards of academics,
course of study, and student conduct is funda
mental to our conception of the university as
defined above.
D. Academic Objections.
In considering the academic aspects of the
problem, the Committee heard public testimony
that ROTC courses were of very high calibre. We
do not wish to contest this, though members of
the Committee have also heard informally and
confidentially that the contrary is also sometimes
the case. Whatever may be the truth of the mat
ter, the Majority's objections do not rest on these
grounds, but on the inherent goals of these
courses.
D.l Course Goals. Although in recent
years the Department of Defense instruction
plans for the ROTC programs have allowed Pro
fessors of Military Science increasing flexibility
in the choice of text materials and in course sub
stitution, the ultimate goals of these programs
are still fixed by the Department of Defense.
These goals are not compatible with the Univer
sity's "primary commitment to the creation and
dissemination of knowledge, in an environment
of free intellectual activity." The primary goal of
the ROTC programs is to educate, train, and eval
uate junior officers for the U.S. Armed Forces.
The Plan for NROTC Instructional Program
(Navpers 93941, May 1968) defines as "major
goals":
(1) To assist in the education of the
midshipman in a major field of study of interest
to the Navy or Marine Corps leading to a bacca
laureate degree.
(2) To provide the midshipman with
the fundamental concepts and principles of Naval
Science and with the professional Naval knowl
edge necessary to establish a sound basis for his
future growth as a Naval or Marine Corps officer.
(3) To prepare the midshipman for
service with the highest sense of honor and integ
rity as a commissioned officer; to cultivate the
essential elements of military leadership; to fos
ter the growth of a strong sense of loyalty and
dedication to his Service and to the Nation.
(4) To prepare the midshipman to
undertake successfully in later periods of his
career, advanced/continuing education in a field
of application and interest to the Naval Service.
(5) To inject the values of civilian
higher education into the Naval Service by utili
zing the expertise of civilian faculty instruction
where applicable. (Italics ours)
The Army Program of Instruction states that the
objectives of ROTC are "to procure and produce
junior officers who by education, training, atti
tude and inherent qualities are suitable for con
tinued development as officers in the Army."
And the Air Force ROTC mission "is to commis
sion career-oriented second lieutenants in res
ponse to Air Force requirements" by successfully
accomplishing the following four objectives:
(1) Identify, motivate, and select
qualified students to complete the Air Force
ROTC program.
(2) Provide college-level education
that will qualify cadets for commissioning in the
U.S. Air Force.
(3) Heighten each cadet's apprecia
tion of, and dedication to, American principles,
give him an understanding of how the Air Force
serves the national interest, and develop his po
tential as a leader and manager and his under
standing of officer professionalism in the Air
Force.
(4) Commission in the U.S. Air
Force high quality second lieutenants. (Italics
ours)
The goals of these programs are clearly non
academic in nature. Given the goals of these pro
grams as defined above, Military Science instruc
tors are legally and ethically obligated to present
their course material from restricted points of
view, to evaluate the student's fitness for a mili
tary career partly on these grounds, and to report
this evaluation to higher authorities.
Since the goals of the ROTC Programs are to
educate potential officers, much of the current
Military Science course content—weapons sys
tems, small-unit tactics, Army administration, or
ientation, counter-insurgency, etc.—is of such a
narrowly pragmatic, professional nature as to be
incompatible with an undergraduate academic
credit program. Although the Minority Report's
proposed Committee on Military Studies might
deny academic credit to some of these "nuts and
bolts" courses, others might remain in the credit
program. And indeed, one might question
whether any course with the goals outlined above
merits inclusion in Stanford's academic credit
structure. Although knowledge is disseminated in
ROTC courses, it is rarely created in an environ
ment of free intellectual activity; and it is dissem
inated to the end that committed junior officers

to enter the U.S. Armed Forces. The Military
Science Programs' lack of awareness of what we
believe to be the primary commitment of the
University is further evidenced in their equation
of the "values of civilian higher education" with
the "expertise of civilian faculty where applic
able." (NROTC Goals No. 5)
D.2. Course Substitution. The substitu
tion of courses in regular academic departments
for courses presently taught by the ROTC fac
ulty (particularly U.S. military history and U.S.
foreign policy) has been frequently suggested.
This has some attractive features, but these
should not blind one to the problems it also en
tails.
D.2.a. Such courses would have to
meet the goals set forth by the armed forces.
Senior ROTC faculty are being granted wide lati
tude in determining whether or not goals are
being met by a particular course, but it is never
theless true that the scope, coverage, and content
of such courses will be under periodic review by
the military establishment.
D.2.b. If such a course is built into
the ROTC curriculum and required of all cadets,
then the presumption exists that the course will
meet the needs of the ROTC in scope, coverage,
approach, and frequency of offering. TTie faculty
member will have to take these considerations
into account in planning course changes, leave
periods, etc. If such a required course fails for
any reason to meet ROTC needs, the ROTC must
reassume part or all of the instruction in that
area, or drop the requirement. But then course
substitution is either lost or was unnecessary in
the first place.
D.2.C. If such a course is to be op
tional for ROTC cadets, then some other options
must be available. This presumes one of three
things: (a) that other equivalent courses are avail
able in the academic departments, (b) that the
ROTC faculty provide the equivalent, or (c) that
cadets need not receive training in that particular
area. The revised ROTC instructional programs
seem to rule out the last; normal University prac
tice makes the first unlikely. Thus, here too, the
advantages of course substitution may be lost.
Finally, it should be noted that it will be difficult
to ensure that the course is in fact "optional." If
other options are limited, and if cadets are
"strongly urged" to enroll in a particular course,
is that course truly optional?
D.2.d. Course substitution will in
crease both the direct and indirect subsidy of
Stanford to the ROTC by assuming part of the
training of ROTC cadets (see below). It will add
to the work of the academic department and the
individual faculty member by the number of stu
dents who would not otherwise have enrolled in
his course (this could, for example, require addi
tional expenditures for T.A.'s, readers, etc.). The
call upon the resources of the ROTC programs
will be correspondingly lightened.
D.3. Departmental Status. An academic
department shares much the same definition as
the institution of which it is a part, with particu
lar reference to a specific area and/or discipline.
When a student has demonstrated a certain com
petence in this area or discipline, he is recom
mended for a degree, either at the undergraduate
or graduate level. The Departments of Military
Science do not do this at either level; rather, they
offer commissions in the Armed Forces to the
men who successfully complete their programs.
Unlike other departments or schools in the Uni
versity, the ROTC Departments are educating
young men not to academic ends but to work for
a specific employer in a specific area.
The Minority recommends combining the
three ROTC Departments into a single Depart
ment of Military Studies, no longer to be lodged
in the School of Humanities and Sciences but to
be responsible to the Provost via a Committee on
Military Studies. The Majority believes this is a
recognition of the anomalous nature of such a
department, which has neither undergraduate nor
graduate majors and serves non-academic ends.
D.4. Faculty Search and Appointment.
The Military Science Departments' faculty is ap
pointed in an irregular way. The appointment
procedure for Military Science personnel by
passes both department-initiated search and eval
uation, and the normal administrative ratification
process. Whenever a position becomes vacant, the
appropriate branch of the Armed Services pre
sents nominations for the position to the Pro
vost's Office. The administration may veto any
military nominations. (It has done so at least
three times.) The nominee's military record and
college transcripts are examined and, whenever
possible, a personal interview is held. Though
ROTC faculty are presently members of the Aca
demic Council, they are not subject to the usual
University policy on tenure, for the Defense De
partment agrees to recall them immediately at
the request of the administration. (Stanford has
exercised this option once in recent years.) Fur
thermore, the Department of Defense reserves
the right to transfer from Stanford any assigned
military personnel. Thus, under present arrange
ments, an external organization may unilaterally
remove a member of the Stanford faculty.
This irregular appointment and retention pro
cedure violates the principle that the primary re
sponsibility for faculty appointment and status
rests with the Stanford faculty and administra
tion. Secondly, it creates a special class of faculty
members having some characteristics not shared
by the regular faculty and lacking others.
Thirdly, since Stanford cannot initiate the search
nor fully supervise the screening process, the Uni
versity loses some degree of control over the
quality of the ROTC faculty. These irregular fea
tures would continue, even under revised proced
ures.
IV. Objections to ROTC as An Organized, Non
credit, On-Campus Program
The previous section reviews our objections,
both general and specific, to ROTC as an aca
demic program at Stanford. Having come to this
point, the Majority gave serious consideration to
retention of ROTC on campus as an organized,
non-credit program of education and training. We
believe such an arrangement may be an improve
ment over both the present situation and the rec
ommendations of the Minority. But it is the con
viction of the Majority that the logic of the gen
eral objections must apply generally to the rela
tions between ROTC and Stanford. To recom
mend termination of academic credit and reten
tion of non-credit ROTC programs is to accept
the argument with respect to the former but fail
to apply it to the latter. We here recapitulate
those considerations with reference to ROTC as
an on-campus, non-credit program of training
and education.
A. What has been termed "conflict of inter
est" would continue, since ROTC would remain
the corporate representation of the armed forces
within the structure of the University, staffed by
professional military officers. If ROTC is re
tained as a non-credit program, several opera
tional problems will grow directly out of the fact

that ROTC will remain in the University but not
of the University. Any solution of these prob
lems will constitute recognition of the anomalous
nature of the arrangement.
1. Would the ROTC programs, singly or
collectively, continue as "Department(s)?" If
not, what status should they have? On what
grounds would such a decision be made?
2. The same questions apply to the status
of ROTC faculty. Shall formal academic rank be
accorded, as presently required by law? To
whom, at what level, and on what grounds?
3. How shall the University handle search
and appointment procedures for persons offering
no accredited work, but who present courses re
quired of a certain proportion of the student
body?
4. How shall the University oversee the
content and mode of instruction in these non
credit but required courses?
B. The primary goal of the ROTC programs
would remain, as before, the recruitment and
training of junior officers. Thus, specific training
for employment by an outside organization, car
ried on by members of that organization, would
continue.
C. Institutional contracts would remain,
though perhaps in a modified form. Thus, dispro
portionate subsidization of the military at Stan
ford would continue: direct subsidies in the form
of facilities, services, etc.; indirect subsidies in
the form of course substitution, etc.
D. Individual contracts, requiring participa
tion in ROTC training programs on-campus by
signatories, would continue. It is here not the
existence of such contracts that is objected to;
rather it is to the institutional sanction and sup
port given these contracts by Stanford Univer
sity.
V. Recommendations
Thus far the Majority has emphasized those
aspects of the present ROTC which make them
objectionable to the point of incompatibility
with the University. We believe such analysis,
while lengthy and complex, is necessary when
ever a significant change is recommended for an
on-going academic program. Also required is
some projection of the nature and structure of
the revised program. That is, having dealt with
objections in the relationship between Stanford
and the ROTC departments, what is considered
to be the proper relationship?
It should be noted, first, that no accurate pro
jection can be made because it is not known
what limits the Department of Defense has for its
junior officer procurement program. We cannot
predict what will be acceptable to the military
services beyond existing operational and legal
constraints.
Secondly, the Majority believes the issue of
proper relations is confused by excessive reliance
on the term "ROTC." The Majority has empha
sized the distinction between ROTC as a mech
anism and the objectives which ROTC serves.
Our arguments have been directed to the mech
anism, not the objectives or purposes. Misinter
pretation arises if this distinction is obscured. If
the language of the Senate's charge is taken to
mean that "ROTC" denotes an organized on
campus program of eduation and training, then
the Majority is compelled to state there can be
no "proper relations between the ROTC depart
ments and Stanford." This, in turn, can mis
takenly be construed to mean that the Majority
believes no proper relations can be established
between the objectives served by the existing de
partments and Stanford.
It is likely that the program which we recom
mend would not and should not be denoted as
"ROTC." This is accurate insofar as the program
has been substantially altered and does not con
form to present programs of ROTC. But any new
denotation should not be interpreted to mean
that we have sought to abolish all relations be
tween Stanford and the purposes of the existing
ROTC programs or that we have concluded that
no proper relations can be established. Rather we
believe that for proper relations to exist, a new
mechanism must be created —one that differs
from the present program, but can still serve the
same purposes in such a way as to be compatible
with the University.
We envision relations whereby each service of
the armed forces would assign personnel to
manage an administrative apparatus, with space
provided possibly in the Dean of Students' Office
of Special Services, that would concern itself
with recruitment of students into the program,
process the revised student contracts and scholar
ships, offer professional counseling and informa
tion to individuals as well as to the existing stu
dent voluntary groups representative of the three
services on campus. Further, this Armed Forces
Officers Program would arrange with enrolled
students for off-campus training and education.
We believe that all education presently offered
by the ROTC departments could be transferred
to extended summer encampments. The military
personnel on campus would be free to offer vol
untary undergraduate special courses, as are
other members of the Stanford community, fol
lowing the guidelines established by the Commit
tee on Undergraduate Education.
To these ends, we recommend the following:
1. After a transitional period (see recom
mendation 5 below), there should be no aca
demic credit received for participation in pro
grams of military training and education.
2. By the end of this period, non-credit,
required military training and education should
no longer be offered on the Stanford campus.
Consistent with these recommendations, a
scholarship or contract "program" may remain,
comprising normal academic education, supple
mented by on-campus voluntary activities and
off-campus training.
3. By the end of this period, all remaining
military programs or activities should be regu
lated by the University's general policies on Stan
ford Voluntary Organizations. No Stanford fac
ulty member or administrator, acting as a spokes
man for the University, shall encourage students
to participate in military training and education,
except in the manner in which participation in all
voluntary activities is encouraged.
4. Individual contracts between Stanford
students and the armed forces should be revised
to reflect actual practice. We recommend further
that punitive clauses involving enlisted service be
removed.
5. These provisions should be in force by
the fall term 1973. Beginning with the fall term
1970, no entering freshman shall be granted aca
demic credit for ROTC activities. The three
ROTC departments should be replaced by a sin
gle Armed Forces Officers Program no later than
fall term 1973. This program shall be for the
purposes of administration, counseling, and re
cruiting for off-campus reserve officer training
and education. (N.B. Because present institu
tional contracts specify one year's notice prior to
termination, the phase-out process cannot begin
before 1970.)
6. Appropriate University authorities
should promptly initiate action leading to re
vision or termination of the contracts between
Stanford and the armed forces (a) in order to
enable the phase-out to begin in 1970, and (b) in
order to reflect the voluntary, non-credit status
of military training at Stanford. We further rec
ommend that a committee be appointed, com
posed of representatives of faculty, administra
tion, military science department, and students,
to assist in effecting the transition.
7. During the transitional period, we rec
ommend that the status of officers presently at
tached to ROTC units remain unchanged. Until
the fall term 1973, newly assigned officers shall
carry the rank of "Lecturer," except for the
newly assigned senior officers of each branch of
the armed forces, who shall carry the rank of
"Lecturer with rank of Professor." After the be
ginning of the 1973-74 academic year, represen
tatives of the armed forces at Stanford shall carry
no academic rank. Similarly until this time, the
departmental and administrative structure of the
ROTC program shall remain as at present.
8. Students already enrolled in ROTC pro
grams, and those enrolling prior to the fall term
1970, shall continue as at present, except that
present contracts should be revised in accord
with recommendation 4.

because our charge as a committee limits us to
these programs.
The Majority believes that there are both gen
eral and specific objections which will continue
to exist as long as ROTC is a program integral to
the institutional structure of the University.
A. Conflict of Interest. The ROTC faculty,
being detailed to Stanford on a limited tour of
duty, remain professional military officers who
legally and ethically owe primary loyalty to the
branch of the service they represent, to the
armed forces, and to the U.S. government. This
means that, however high their integrity and
quality of mind, they cannot at the same time
have a primary commitment either to Stanford
University or to the academic enterprise. This
dual identity should be recognized as a conflict
of interest. The government itself recognizes very
clearly the potential peril of conflict-of-interest
situations, and rightly expects public servants
scrupulously to avoid them. It should be noted
that neither the government's position nor ours
rests upon the fact or even the presumption of
improper behavior.
Because this consideration applies to all mili
tary members of the ROTC, it therefore applies
by extension to the ROTC programs themselves.
These programs, as corporate entities—present
H&S departments—are themselves in a potential
conflict-of-interest situation with respect to the
University.
We recognize that other instances of conflict
of interest are by no means rare in the university;
these too are unfortunate. But they are individ
ual rather than collective, and they are character
ized, in nearly all cases, by a primary commit
ment to the University (note that the University
limits outside activities to an average of one day
per week).
B. Training for a specific employer, by that
employer. The ROTC programs represent the
corporate, institutional presence of an external
organization, which engages in specific training
of candidates for temporary or permanent em
ploy by that organization. The issue raised here is
not simply that of professional or pre-profes
sional training, but of such training carried on
by the armed forces, in the interests of the armed
forces. The Majority believes that such training
should not be a part of the academic structure of
the University.
C. Contractual Arrangements. The objection
able features of the present contracts can be con
sidered under two headings: contractual arrange
ments between the armed forces and Stanford
University, and between the armed forces and
individual students. While some of these arrange
ments may be subject to change, others would
not. Some are specified by the Vitalization Act
of 1964 and could not be changed except
through action by Congress.
C.l. Institutional Contracts. The contracts
between Stanford and the various military ser
vices provide for government commitment of an
academic and administrative staff, an instruc
tional program, government equipment, staff
salaries, and student financial assistance. In re
turn the University agrees to the establishment of
military science department, provision of class
rooms, offices and drill areas, appropriate aca
demic credit for military science courses, and a
minimum sustaining enrollment and output of
officers. In the case of the Army, representation
on all faculty committees whose recommenda
tions would directly affect the Department of
Military Science is stipulated. These contracts
further provide for prior approval and right of
dismissal by Stanford of all military officers as
signed to the department, assignment of the rank
of professor to the senior commissioned officer
of each service assigned to the institution and
lesser academic rank to other members of the
staffs, and the right of the Secretary of the mili
tary service involved to relieve from duty any
officer or enlisted man assigned to work at Stan
ford. These terms represent a partial abdication
of University control over the governance of its
own affairs.
It should be recognized that these arrange
ments result in a Stanford subsidy to the ROTC
programs. Stanford is obliged to provide facili
ties, services, and financial support to the ROTC
programs on a cost-free basis. For example, the
Air Force contract stipulates that Stanford pro
vide:
(1) "the necessary classrooms, administra
tive offices, storage spaces, government
vehicle parking areas, staff parking
areas and other required facilities in
the same manner and at the same level
as is provided to other Departments of
the Institution."
(2) "adequate secretarial, janitorial, and
telephone services ... on the same
basis as is provided to other Depart
ments within the Institution."
An increase in course substitution (see below
D.2.) .while desirable in some ways, will increase
the subsidy by relieving the ROTC programs of
that part of their instructional requirements. In
the Majority's view, such subsidies of the armed
forces are inappropriate.
C.2. Contractual Agreements between
Stanford ROTC Students and the Army, Navy
and Air Force. In this section the committee
states its objections to certain terms contained in
the existing contracts between Stanford ROTC
students and the three military services. It is to
be understood that the Committee does not ob
ject to a student entering into a legal and private
contractual agreement as long as the terms of
said agreement are neither contrary to the aca
demic goals and standards of the university nor
encroachments upon the university's integrity as
an institution of higher learning.
The Committee heard substantial testimony
to the effect that there exists a considerable dif
ference between de facto practice and de jure
obligations. Specifically, it has been the practice
of the three services to terminate a four-year fin
ancial-assistance contract in the first two years
without penalty or prejudice. This has a mitiga
ting effect but leaves the legal provisions of the
contracts technically intact.
C.2.a. Academic Prescriptions. All
three services require certain specified courses of
study. By contract, the student must follow this
prescribed course of study. In addition, the
Navy financial assistant program specifically ex
cludes certain courses of study, and the Air
Force contracts for certain courses of study.
These restrictions and requirements conflict with
the Majority view that Stanford undergraduates
should not be found by law to take and complete
a course of study prescribed by some agent or
agency external to the University, when that
agency also determines (directly or indirectly)
the mode and content of instruction of all or
part of the prescribed course.
All three services require that ROTC cadets
meet certain academic standards. The Majority
believes that Stanford undergraduates should not
be bound by law to maintain academic standards
prescribed by an external agency, especially
when that agency also participates in determining
whether or not such standards have been met.

C.2.b. Personal Conduct. All three
services require that the cadet maintain certain
unspecified standards of personal and moral con
duct. The Majority feels that such restrictions
can seriously limit the student's free participa
tion in all facets of intellectual inquiry and legal
political activity. Furthermore, the Navy finan
cial assistance contract stipulates that the candi
date "remain unmarried until commissioned."
These standards too are established by an agency
external to the University, and judgments con
cerning them are made by the same agency.
While the Majority recognizes the special require
ments of the armed forces and could not object
to similar conditions in contracts between indi
vidual students and the military services when
not a part of a university program or activity, it
can and does object to such conditions when
they are a part of a University-subsidized and
sanctioned activity.
C.2.c. Punitive Clauses. All three ser
vices include in their financial assistance con
tracts clauses that bind the student to a period of
enlisted service for "willfully evading" stipulated
terms. Despite the fact that these clauses have
rarely been invoked at Stanford, the Majority
deems them clearly punitive in intent, and feels
that they unduly infringe the student's freedom
within the University community.
C.2.d. Contracts for Service. To our
knowledge, the ROTC contracts are the only
University-sponsored and sanctioned contracts
on the undergraduate level that bind a student to
service. There are various loan programs such as
the NDEA which allow teaching service to act in
lieu of repayments. Still, these loan programs do
not require service, since the loans can be repaid
with appropriate interest over a period of years.
The ROTC financial assistance grants have no
such provision.
The Majority wishes to point out that these
contractual restrictions and/or obligations oper
ate as a whole. The punitive clauses operate in
relation to academic standards requirements,
course of study requirements, conduct require
ments, and service requirements. The service obli
gation is intimately related to the course of study
requirements. It is this interlocking of contrac
tual requirements, restrictions, and obligations
that makes the whole much more objectionable
than each of its parts might suggest. The Univer
sity's rights and obligations to establish, main
tain, and judge its own standards of academics,
course of study, and student conduct is funda
mental to our conception of the university as
defined above.
D. Academic Objections.
In considering the academic aspects of the
problem, the Committee heard public testimony
that ROTC courses were of very high calibre. We
do not wish to contest this, though members of
the Committee have also heard informally and
confidentially that the contrary is also sometimes
the case. Whatever may be the truth of the mat
ter, the Majority's objections do not rest on these
grounds, but on the inherent goals of these
courses.
D.l Course Goals. Although in recent
years the Department of Defense instruction
plans for the ROTC programs have allowed Pro
fessors of Military Science increasing flexibility
in the choice of text materials and in course sub
stitution, the ultimate goals of these programs
are still fixed by the Department of Defense.
These goals are not compatible with the Univer
sity's "primary commitment to the creation and
dissemination of knowledge, in an environment
of free intellectual activity." The primary goal of
the ROTC programs is to educate, train, and eval
uate junior officers for the U.S. Armed Forces.
The Plan for NROTC Instructional Program
(Navpers 93941, May 1968) defines as "major
goals":
(1) To assist in the education of the
midshipman in a major field of study of interest
to the Navy or Marine Corps leading to a bacca
laureate degree.
(2) To provide the midshipman with
the fundamental concepts and principles of Naval
Science and with the professional Naval knowl
edge necessary to establish a sound basis for his
future growth as a Naval or Marine Corps officer.
(3) To prepare the midshipman for
service with the highest sense of honor and integ
rity as a commissioned officer; to cultivate the
essential elements of military leadership; to fos
ter the growth of a strong sense of loyalty and
dedication to his Service and to the Nation.
(4) To prepare the midshipman to
undertake successfully in later periods of his
career, advanced/continuing education in a field
of application and interest to the Naval Service.
(5) To inject the values of civilian
higher education into the Naval Service by utili
zing the expertise of civilian faculty instruction
where applicable. (Italics ours)
The Army Program of Instruction states that the
objectives of ROTC are "to procure and produce
junior officers who by education, training, atti
tude and inherent qualities are suitable for con
tinued development as officers in the Army."
And the Air Force ROTC mission "is to commis
sion career-oriented second lieutenants in res
ponse to Air Force requirements" by successfully
accomplishing the following four objectives:
(1) Identify, motivate, and select
qualified students to complete the Air Force
ROTC program.
(2) Provide college-level education
that will qualify cadets for commissioning in the
U.S. Air Force.
(3) Heighten each cadet's apprecia
tion of, and dedication to, American principles,
give him an understanding of how the Air Force
serves the national interest, and develop his po
tential as a leader and manager and his under
standing of officer professionalism in the Air
Force.
(4) Commission in the U.S. Air
Force high quality second lieutenants. (Italics
ours)
The goals of these programs are clearly non
academic in nature. Given the goals of these pro
grams as defined above, Military Science instruc
tors are legally and ethically obligated to present
their course material from restricted points of
view, to evaluate the student's fitness for a mili
tary career partly on these grounds, and to report
this evaluation to higher authorities.
Since the goals of the ROTC Programs are to
educate potential officers, much of the current
Military Science course content—weapons sys
tems, small-unit tactics, Army administration, or
ientation, counter-insurgency, etc.—is of such a
narrowly pragmatic, professional nature as to be
incompatible with an undergraduate academic
credit program. Although the Minority Report's
proposed Committee on Military Studies might
deny academic credit to some of these "nuts and
bolts" courses, others might remain in the credit
program. And indeed, one might question
whether any course with the goals outlined above
merits inclusion in Stanford's academic credit
structure. Although knowledge is disseminated in
ROTC courses, it is rarely created in an environ
ment of free intellectual activity; and it is dissem
inated to the end that committed junior officers

to enter the U.S. Armed Forces. The Military
Science Programs' lack of awareness of what we
believe to be the primary commitment of the
University is further evidenced in their equation
of the "values of civilian higher education" with
the "expertise of civilian faculty where applic
able." (NROTC Goals No. 5)
D.2. Course Substitution. The substitu
tion of courses in regular academic departments
for courses presently taught by the ROTC fac
ulty (particularly U.S. military history and U.S.
foreign policy) has been frequently suggested.
This has some attractive features, but these
should not blind one to the problems it also en
tails.
D.2.a. Such courses would have to
meet the goals set forth by the armed forces.
Senior ROTC faculty are being granted wide lati
tude in determining whether or not goals are
being met by a particular course, but it is never
theless true that the scope, coverage, and content
of such courses will be under periodic review by
the military establishment.
D.2.b. If such a course is built into
the ROTC curriculum and required of all cadets,
then the presumption exists that the course will
meet the needs of the ROTC in scope, coverage,
approach, and frequency of offering. TTie faculty
member will have to take these considerations
into account in planning course changes, leave
periods, etc. If such a required course fails for
any reason to meet ROTC needs, the ROTC must
reassume part or all of the instruction in that
area, or drop the requirement. But then course
substitution is either lost or was unnecessary in
the first place.
D.2.C. If such a course is to be op
tional for ROTC cadets, then some other options
must be available. This presumes one of three
things: (a) that other equivalent courses are avail
able in the academic departments, (b) that the
ROTC faculty provide the equivalent, or (c) that
cadets need not receive training in that particular
area. The revised ROTC instructional programs
seem to rule out the last; normal University prac
tice makes the first unlikely. Thus, here too, the
advantages of course substitution may be lost.
Finally, it should be noted that it will be difficult
to ensure that the course is in fact "optional." If
other options are limited, and if cadets are
"strongly urged" to enroll in a particular course,
is that course truly optional?
D.2.d. Course substitution will in
crease both the direct and indirect subsidy of
Stanford to the ROTC by assuming part of the
training of ROTC cadets (see below). It will add
to the work of the academic department and the
individual faculty member by the number of stu
dents who would not otherwise have enrolled in
his course (this could, for example, require addi
tional expenditures for T.A.'s, readers, etc.). The
call upon the resources of the ROTC programs
will be correspondingly lightened.
D.3. Departmental Status. An academic
department shares much the same definition as
the institution of which it is a part, with particu
lar reference to a specific area and/or discipline.
When a student has demonstrated a certain com
petence in this area or discipline, he is recom
mended for a degree, either at the undergraduate
or graduate level. The Departments of Military
Science do not do this at either level; rather, they
offer commissions in the Armed Forces to the
men who successfully complete their programs.
Unlike other departments or schools in the Uni
versity, the ROTC Departments are educating
young men not to academic ends but to work for
a specific employer in a specific area.
The Minority recommends combining the
three ROTC Departments into a single Depart
ment of Military Studies, no longer to be lodged
in the School of Humanities and Sciences but to
be responsible to the Provost via a Committee on
Military Studies. The Majority believes this is a
recognition of the anomalous nature of such a
department, which has neither undergraduate nor
graduate majors and serves non-academic ends.
D.4. Faculty Search and Appointment.
The Military Science Departments' faculty is ap
pointed in an irregular way. The appointment
procedure for Military Science personnel by
passes both department-initiated search and eval
uation, and the normal administrative ratification
process. Whenever a position becomes vacant, the
appropriate branch of the Armed Services pre
sents nominations for the position to the Pro
vost's Office. The administration may veto any
military nominations. (It has done so at least
three times.) The nominee's military record and
college transcripts are examined and, whenever
possible, a personal interview is held. Though
ROTC faculty are presently members of the Aca
demic Council, they are not subject to the usual
University policy on tenure, for the Defense De
partment agrees to recall them immediately at
the request of the administration. (Stanford has
exercised this option once in recent years.) Fur
thermore, the Department of Defense reserves
the right to transfer from Stanford any assigned
military personnel. Thus, under present arrange
ments, an external organization may unilaterally
remove a member of the Stanford faculty.
This irregular appointment and retention pro
cedure violates the principle that the primary re
sponsibility for faculty appointment and status
rests with the Stanford faculty and administra
tion. Secondly, it creates a special class of faculty
members having some characteristics not shared
by the regular faculty and lacking others.
Thirdly, since Stanford cannot initiate the search
nor fully supervise the screening process, the Uni
versity loses some degree of control over the
quality of the ROTC faculty. These irregular fea
tures would continue, even under revised proced
ures.
IV. Objections to ROTC as An Organized, Non
credit, On-Campus Program
The previous section reviews our objections,
both general and specific, to ROTC as an aca
demic program at Stanford. Having come to this
point, the Majority gave serious consideration to
retention of ROTC on campus as an organized,
non-credit program of education and training. We
believe such an arrangement may be an improve
ment over both the present situation and the rec
ommendations of the Minority. But it is the con
viction of the Majority that the logic of the gen
eral objections must apply generally to the rela
tions between ROTC and Stanford. To recom
mend termination of academic credit and reten
tion of non-credit ROTC programs is to accept
the argument with respect to the former but fail
to apply it to the latter. We here recapitulate
those considerations with reference to ROTC as
an on-campus, non-credit program of training
and education.
A. What has been termed "conflict of inter
est" would continue, since ROTC would remain
the corporate representation of the armed forces
within the structure of the University, staffed by
professional military officers. If ROTC is re
tained as a non-credit program, several opera
tional problems will grow directly out of the fact

that ROTC will remain in the University but not
of the University. Any solution of these prob
lems will constitute recognition of the anomalous
nature of the arrangement.
1. Would the ROTC programs, singly or
collectively, continue as "Department(s)?" If
not, what status should they have? On what
grounds would such a decision be made?
2. The same questions apply to the status
of ROTC faculty. Shall formal academic rank be
accorded, as presently required by law? To
whom, at what level, and on what grounds?
3. How shall the University handle search
and appointment procedures for persons offering
no accredited work, but who present courses re
quired of a certain proportion of the student
body?
4. How shall the University oversee the
content and mode of instruction in these non
credit but required courses?
B. The primary goal of the ROTC programs
would remain, as before, the recruitment and
training of junior officers. Thus, specific training
for employment by an outside organization, car
ried on by members of that organization, would
continue.
C. Institutional contracts would remain,
though perhaps in a modified form. Thus, dispro
portionate subsidization of the military at Stan
ford would continue: direct subsidies in the form
of facilities, services, etc.; indirect subsidies in
the form of course substitution, etc.
D. Individual contracts, requiring participa
tion in ROTC training programs on-campus by
signatories, would continue. It is here not the
existence of such contracts that is objected to;
rather it is to the institutional sanction and sup
port given these contracts by Stanford Univer
sity.
V. Recommendations
Thus far the Majority has emphasized those
aspects of the present ROTC which make them
objectionable to the point of incompatibility
with the University. We believe such analysis,
while lengthy and complex, is necessary when
ever a significant change is recommended for an
on-going academic program. Also required is
some projection of the nature and structure of
the revised program. That is, having dealt with
objections in the relationship between Stanford
and the ROTC departments, what is considered
to be the proper relationship?
It should be noted, first, that no accurate pro
jection can be made because it is not known
what limits the Department of Defense has for its
junior officer procurement program. We cannot
predict what will be acceptable to the military
services beyond existing operational and legal
constraints.
Secondly, the Majority believes the issue of
proper relations is confused by excessive reliance
on the term "ROTC." The Majority has empha
sized the distinction between ROTC as a mech
anism and the objectives which ROTC serves.
Our arguments have been directed to the mech
anism, not the objectives or purposes. Misinter
pretation arises if this distinction is obscured. If
the language of the Senate's charge is taken to
mean that "ROTC" denotes an organized on
campus program of eduation and training, then
the Majority is compelled to state there can be
no "proper relations between the ROTC depart
ments and Stanford." This, in turn, can mis
takenly be construed to mean that the Majority
believes no proper relations can be established
between the objectives served by the existing de
partments and Stanford.
It is likely that the program which we recom
mend would not and should not be denoted as
"ROTC." This is accurate insofar as the program
has been substantially altered and does not con
form to present programs of ROTC. But any new
denotation should not be interpreted to mean
that we have sought to abolish all relations be
tween Stanford and the purposes of the existing
ROTC programs or that we have concluded that
no proper relations can be established. Rather we
believe that for proper relations to exist, a new
mechanism must be created —one that differs
from the present program, but can still serve the
same purposes in such a way as to be compatible
with the University.
We envision relations whereby each service of
the armed forces would assign personnel to
manage an administrative apparatus, with space
provided possibly in the Dean of Students' Office
of Special Services, that would concern itself
with recruitment of students into the program,
process the revised student contracts and scholar
ships, offer professional counseling and informa
tion to individuals as well as to the existing stu
dent voluntary groups representative of the three
services on campus. Further, this Armed Forces
Officers Program would arrange with enrolled
students for off-campus training and education.
We believe that all education presently offered
by the ROTC departments could be transferred
to extended summer encampments. The military
personnel on campus would be free to offer vol
untary undergraduate special courses, as are
other members of the Stanford community, fol
lowing the guidelines established by the Commit
tee on Undergraduate Education.
To these ends, we recommend the following:
1. After a transitional period (see recom
mendation 5 below), there should be no aca
demic credit received for participation in pro
grams of military training and education.
2. By the end of this period, non-credit,
required military training and education should
no longer be offered on the Stanford campus.
Consistent with these recommendations, a
scholarship or contract "program" may remain,
comprising normal academic education, supple
mented by on-campus voluntary activities and
off-campus training.
3. By the end of this period, all remaining
military programs or activities should be regu
lated by the University's general policies on Stan
ford Voluntary Organizations. No Stanford fac
ulty member or administrator, acting as a spokes
man for the University, shall encourage students
to participate in military training and education,
except in the manner in which participation in all
voluntary activities is encouraged.
4. Individual contracts between Stanford
students and the armed forces should be revised
to reflect actual practice. We recommend further
that punitive clauses involving enlisted service be
removed.
5. These provisions should be in force by
the fall term 1973. Beginning with the fall term
1970, no entering freshman shall be granted aca
demic credit for ROTC activities. The three
ROTC departments should be replaced by a sin
gle Armed Forces Officers Program no later than
fall term 1973. This program shall be for the
purposes of administration, counseling, and re
cruiting for off-campus reserve officer training
and education. (N.B. Because present institu
tional contracts specify one year's notice prior to
termination, the phase-out process cannot begin
before 1970.)
6. Appropriate University authorities
should promptly initiate action leading to re
vision or termination of the contracts between
Stanford and the armed forces (a) in order to
enable the phase-out to begin in 1970, and (b) in
order to reflect the voluntary, non-credit status
of military training at Stanford. We further rec
ommend that a committee be appointed, com
posed of representatives of faculty, administra
tion, military science department, and students,
to assist in effecting the transition.
7. During the transitional period, we rec
ommend that the status of officers presently at
tached to ROTC units remain unchanged. Until
the fall term 1973, newly assigned officers shall
carry the rank of "Lecturer," except for the
newly assigned senior officers of each branch of
the armed forces, who shall carry the rank of
"Lecturer with rank of Professor." After the be
ginning of the 1973-74 academic year, represen
tatives of the armed forces at Stanford shall carry
no academic rank. Similarly until this time, the
departmental and administrative structure of the
ROTC program shall remain as at present.
8. Students already enrolled in ROTC pro
grams, and those enrolling prior to the fall term
1970, shall continue as at present, except that
present contracts should be revised in accord
with recommendation 4.

because our charge as a committee limits us to
these programs.
The Majority believes that there are both gen
eral and specific objections which will continue
to exist as long as ROTC is a program integral to
the institutional structure of the University.
A. Conflict of Interest. The ROTC faculty,
being detailed to Stanford on a limited tour of
duty, remain professional military officers who
legally and ethically owe primary loyalty to the
branch of the service they represent, to the
armed forces, and to the U.S. government. This
means that, however high their integrity and
quality of mind, they cannot at the same time
have a primary commitment either to Stanford
University or to the academic enterprise. This
dual identity should be recognized as a conflict
of interest. The government itself recognizes very
clearly the potential peril of conflict-of-interest
situations, and rightly expects public servants
scrupulously to avoid them. It should be noted
that neither the government's position nor ours
rests upon the fact or even the presumption of
improper behavior.
Because this consideration applies to all mili
tary members of the ROTC, it therefore applies
by extension to the ROTC programs themselves.
These programs, as corporate entities—present
H&S departments—are themselves in a potential
conflict-of-interest situation with respect to the
University.
We recognize that other instances of conflict
of interest are by no means rare in the university;
these too are unfortunate. But they are individ
ual rather than collective, and they are character
ized, in nearly all cases, by a primary commit
ment to the University (note that the University
limits outside activities to an average of one day
per week).
B. Training for a specific employer, by that
employer. The ROTC programs represent the
corporate, institutional presence of an external
organization, which engages in specific training
of candidates for temporary or permanent em
ploy by that organization. The issue raised here is
not simply that of professional or pre-profes
sional training, but of such training carried on
by the armed forces, in the interests of the armed
forces. The Majority believes that such training
should not be a part of the academic structure of
the University.
C. Contractual Arrangements. The objection
able features of the present contracts can be con
sidered under two headings: contractual arrange
ments between the armed forces and Stanford
University, and between the armed forces and
individual students. While some of these arrange
ments may be subject to change, others would
not. Some are specified by the Vitalization Act
of 1964 and could not be changed except
through action by Congress.
C.l. Institutional Contracts. The contracts
between Stanford and the various military ser
vices provide for government commitment of an
academic and administrative staff, an instruc
tional program, government equipment, staff
salaries, and student financial assistance. In re
turn the University agrees to the establishment of
military science department, provision of class
rooms, offices and drill areas, appropriate aca
demic credit for military science courses, and a
minimum sustaining enrollment and output of
officers. In the case of the Army, representation
on all faculty committees whose recommenda
tions would directly affect the Department of
Military Science is stipulated. These contracts
further provide for prior approval and right of
dismissal by Stanford of all military officers as
signed to the department, assignment of the rank
of professor to the senior commissioned officer
of each service assigned to the institution and
lesser academic rank to other members of the
staffs, and the right of the Secretary of the mili
tary service involved to relieve from duty any
officer or enlisted man assigned to work at Stan
ford. These terms represent a partial abdication
of University control over the governance of its
own affairs.
It should be recognized that these arrange
ments result in a Stanford subsidy to the ROTC
programs. Stanford is obliged to provide facili
ties, services, and financial support to the ROTC
programs on a cost-free basis. For example, the
Air Force contract stipulates that Stanford pro
vide:
(1) "the necessary classrooms, administra
tive offices, storage spaces, government
vehicle parking areas, staff parking
areas and other required facilities in
the same manner and at the same level
as is provided to other Departments of
the Institution."
(2) "adequate secretarial, janitorial, and
telephone services ... on the same
basis as is provided to other Depart
ments within the Institution."
An increase in course substitution (see below
D.2.) .while desirable in some ways, will increase
the subsidy by relieving the ROTC programs of
that part of their instructional requirements. In
the Majority's view, such subsidies of the armed
forces are inappropriate.
C.2. Contractual Agreements between
Stanford ROTC Students and the Army, Navy
and Air Force. In this section the committee
states its objections to certain terms contained in
the existing contracts between Stanford ROTC
students and the three military services. It is to
be understood that the Committee does not ob
ject to a student entering into a legal and private
contractual agreement as long as the terms of
said agreement are neither contrary to the aca
demic goals and standards of the university nor
encroachments upon the university's integrity as
an institution of higher learning.
The Committee heard substantial testimony
to the effect that there exists a considerable dif
ference between de facto practice and de jure
obligations. Specifically, it has been the practice
of the three services to terminate a four-year fin
ancial-assistance contract in the first two years
without penalty or prejudice. This has a mitiga
ting effect but leaves the legal provisions of the
contracts technically intact.
C.2.a. Academic Prescriptions. All
three services require certain specified courses of
study. By contract, the student must follow this
prescribed course of study. In addition, the
Navy financial assistant program specifically ex
cludes certain courses of study, and the Air
Force contracts for certain courses of study.
These restrictions and requirements conflict with
the Majority view that Stanford undergraduates
should not be found by law to take and complete
a course of study prescribed by some agent or
agency external to the University, when that
agency also determines (directly or indirectly)
the mode and content of instruction of all or
part of the prescribed course.
All three services require that ROTC cadets
meet certain academic standards. The Majority
believes that Stanford undergraduates should not
be bound by law to maintain academic standards
prescribed by an external agency, especially
when that agency also participates in determining
whether or not such standards have been met.

C.2.b. Personal Conduct. All three
services require that the cadet maintain certain
unspecified standards of personal and moral con
duct. The Majority feels that such restrictions
can seriously limit the student's free participa
tion in all facets of intellectual inquiry and legal
political activity. Furthermore, the Navy finan
cial assistance contract stipulates that the candi
date "remain unmarried until commissioned."
These standards too are established by an agency
external to the University, and judgments con
cerning them are made by the same agency.
While the Majority recognizes the special require
ments of the armed forces and could not object
to similar conditions in contracts between indi
vidual students and the military services when
not a part of a university program or activity, it
can and does object to such conditions when
they are a part of a University-subsidized and
sanctioned activity.
C.2.c. Punitive Clauses. All three ser
vices include in their financial assistance con
tracts clauses that bind the student to a period of
enlisted service for "willfully evading" stipulated
terms. Despite the fact that these clauses have
rarely been invoked at Stanford, the Majority
deems them clearly punitive in intent, and feels
that they unduly infringe the student's freedom
within the University community.
C.2.d. Contracts for Service. To our
knowledge, the ROTC contracts are the only
University-sponsored and sanctioned contracts
on the undergraduate level that bind a student to
service. There are various loan programs such as
the NDEA which allow teaching service to act in
lieu of repayments. Still, these loan programs do
not require service, since the loans can be repaid
with appropriate interest over a period of years.
The ROTC financial assistance grants have no
such provision.
The Majority wishes to point out that these
contractual restrictions and/or obligations oper
ate as a whole. The punitive clauses operate in
relation to academic standards requirements,
course of study requirements, conduct require
ments, and service requirements. The service obli
gation is intimately related to the course of study
requirements. It is this interlocking of contrac
tual requirements, restrictions, and obligations
that makes the whole much more objectionable
than each of its parts might suggest. The Univer
sity's rights and obligations to establish, main
tain, and judge its own standards of academics,
course of study, and student conduct is funda
mental to our conception of the university as
defined above.
D. Academic Objections.
In considering the academic aspects of the
problem, the Committee heard public testimony
that ROTC courses were of very high calibre. We
do not wish to contest this, though members of
the Committee have also heard informally and
confidentially that the contrary is also sometimes
the case. Whatever may be the truth of the mat
ter, the Majority's objections do not rest on these
grounds, but on the inherent goals of these
courses.
D.l Course Goals. Although in recent
years the Department of Defense instruction
plans for the ROTC programs have allowed Pro
fessors of Military Science increasing flexibility
in the choice of text materials and in course sub
stitution, the ultimate goals of these programs
are still fixed by the Department of Defense.
These goals are not compatible with the Univer
sity's "primary commitment to the creation and
dissemination of knowledge, in an environment
of free intellectual activity." The primary goal of
the ROTC programs is to educate, train, and eval
uate junior officers for the U.S. Armed Forces.
The Plan for NROTC Instructional Program
(Navpers 93941, May 1968) defines as "major
goals":
(1) To assist in the education of the
midshipman in a major field of study of interest
to the Navy or Marine Corps leading to a bacca
laureate degree.
(2) To provide the midshipman with
the fundamental concepts and principles of Naval
Science and with the professional Naval knowl
edge necessary to establish a sound basis for his
future growth as a Naval or Marine Corps officer.
(3) To prepare the midshipman for
service with the highest sense of honor and integ

essential elements of military leadership; to fos

dedication to his Service and to the Nation.
(4) To prepare the midshipman to

(5) To inject the values of civilian
higher education into the Naval Service by utili

The Army Program of Instruction states that the
objectives of ROTC are "to procure and produce
junior officers who by education, training, atti
tude and inherent qualities are suitable for con
tinued development as officers in the Army."
And the Air Force ROTC mission "is to commis
sion career-oriented second lieutenants in res
ponse to Air Force requirements" by successfully
accomplishing the following four objectives:
(1) Identify, motivate, and select
qualified students to complete the Air Force
ROTC program.
(2) Provide college-level education
that will qualify cadets for commissioning in the
U.S. Air Force.
(3) Heighten each cadet's apprecia
tion of, and dedication to, American principles,
give him an understanding of how the Air Force
serves the national interest, and develop his po
tential as a leader and manager and his under
standing of officer professionalism in the Air
Force.
(4) Commission in the U.S. Air
Force high quality second lieutenants. (Italics
ours)
The goals of these programs are clearly non
academic in nature. Given the goals of these pro
grams as defined above, Military Science instruc
tors are legally and ethically obligated to present
their course material from restricted points of
view, to evaluate the student's fitness for a mili
tary career partly on these grounds, and to report
this evaluation to higher authorities.
Since the goals of the ROTC Programs are to
educate potential officers, much of the current
Military Science course content—weapons sys
tems, small-unit tactics, Army administration, or
ientation, counter-insurgency, etc.—is of such a
narrowly pragmatic, professional nature as to be
incompatible with an undergraduate academic
credit program. Although the Minority Report's
proposed Committee on Military Studies might
deny academic credit to some of these "nuts and
bolts" courses, others might remain in the credit
program. And indeed, one might question
whether any course with the goals outlined above
merits inclusion in Stanford's academic credit
structure. Although knowledge is disseminated in
ROTC courses, it is rarely created in an environ
ment of free intellectual activity; and it is dissem
inated to the end that committed junior officers

to enter the U.S. Armed Forces. The Military
Science Programs' lack of awareness of what we
believe to be the primary commitment of the
University is further evidenced in their equation
of the "values of civilian higher education" with
the "expertise of civilian faculty where applic
able." (NROTC Goals No. 5)
D.2. Course Substitution. The substitu
tion of courses in regular academic departments
for courses presently taught by the ROTC fac
ulty (particularly U.S. military history and U.S.
foreign policy) has been frequently suggested.
This has some attractive features, but these
should not blind one to the problems it also en
tails.
D.2.a. Such courses would have to
meet the goals set forth by the armed forces.
Senior ROTC faculty are being granted wide lati
tude in determining whether or not goals are
being met by a particular course, but it is never
theless true that the scope, coverage, and content
of such courses will be under periodic review by
the military establishment.
D.2.b. If such a course is built into
the ROTC curriculum and required of all cadets,
then the presumption exists that the course will
meet the needs of the ROTC in scope, coverage,
approach, and frequency of offering. TTie faculty
member will have to take these considerations
into account in planning course changes, leave
periods, etc. If such a required course fails for
any reason to meet ROTC needs, the ROTC must
reassume part or all of the instruction in that
area, or drop the requirement. But then course
substitution is either lost or was unnecessary in
the first place.
D.2.C. If such a course is to be op
tional for ROTC cadets, then some other options
must be available. This presumes one of three
things: (a) that other equivalent courses are avail
able in the academic departments, (b) that the
ROTC faculty provide the equivalent, or (c) that
cadets need not receive training in that particular
area. The revised ROTC instructional programs
seem to rule out the last; normal University prac
tice makes the first unlikely. Thus, here too, the
advantages of course substitution may be lost.
Finally, it should be noted that it will be difficult
to ensure that the course is in fact "optional." If
other options are limited, and if cadets are
"strongly urged" to enroll in a particular course,
is that course truly optional?
D.2.d. Course substitution will in
crease both the direct and indirect subsidy of
Stanford to the ROTC by assuming part of the
training of ROTC cadets (see below). It will add
to the work of the academic department and the
individual faculty member by the number of stu
dents who would not otherwise have enrolled in
his course (this could, for example, require addi
tional expenditures for T.A.'s, readers, etc.). The
call upon the resources of the ROTC programs
will be correspondingly lightened.
D.3. Departmental Status. An academic
department shares much the same definition as
the institution of which it is a part, with particu
lar reference to a specific area and/or discipline.
When a student has demonstrated a certain com
petence in this area or discipline, he is recom
mended for a degree, either at the undergraduate
or graduate level. The Departments of Military
Science do not do this at either level; rather, they
offer commissions in the Armed Forces to the
men who successfully complete their programs.
Unlike other departments or schools in the Uni
versity, the ROTC Departments are educating
young men not to academic ends but to work for
a specific employer in a specific area.
The Minority recommends combining the
three ROTC Departments into a single Depart
ment of Military Studies, no longer to be lodged
in the School of Humanities and Sciences but to
be responsible to the Provost via a Committee on
Military Studies. The Majority believes this is a
recognition of the anomalous nature of such a
department, which has neither undergraduate nor
graduate majors and serves non-academic ends.
D.4. Faculty Search and Appointment.
The Military Science Departments' faculty is ap
pointed in an irregular way. The appointment
procedure for Military Science personnel by
passes both department-initiated search and eval
uation, and the normal administrative ratification
process. Whenever a position becomes vacant, the
appropriate branch of the Armed Services pre
sents nominations for the position to the Pro
vost's Office. The administration may veto any
military nominations. (It has done so at least
three times.) The nominee's military record and
college transcripts are examined and, whenever
possible, a personal interview is held. Though
ROTC faculty are presently members of the Aca
demic Council, they are not subject to the usual
University policy on tenure, for the Defense De
partment agrees to recall them immediately at
the request of the administration. (Stanford has
exercised this option once in recent years.) Fur
thermore, the Department of Defense reserves
the right to transfer from Stanford any assigned
military personnel. Thus, under present arrange
ments, an external organization may unilaterally
remove a member of the Stanford faculty.
This irregular appointment and retention pro
cedure violates the principle that the primary re
sponsibility for faculty appointment and status
rests with the Stanford faculty and administra
tion. Secondly, it creates a special class of faculty
members having some characteristics not shared
by the regular faculty and lacking others.
Thirdly, since Stanford cannot initiate the search
nor fully supervise the screening process, the Uni
versity loses some degree of control over the
quality of the ROTC faculty. These irregular fea
tures would continue, even under revised proced
ures.
IV. Objections to ROTC as An Organized, Non
credit, On-Campus Program
The previous section reviews our objections,
both general and specific, to ROTC as an aca
demic program at Stanford. Having come to this
point, the Majority gave serious consideration to
retention of ROTC on campus as an organized,
non-credit program of education and training. We
believe such an arrangement may be an improve
ment over both the present situation and the rec
ommendations of the Minority. But it is the con
viction of the Majority that the logic of the gen
eral objections must apply generally to the rela
tions between ROTC and Stanford. To recom
mend termination of academic credit and reten
tion of non-credit ROTC programs is to accept
the argument with respect to the former but fail
to apply it to the latter. We here recapitulate
those considerations with reference to ROTC as
an on-campus, non-credit program of training
and education.
A. What has been termed "conflict of inter
est" would continue, since ROTC would remain
the corporate representation of the armed forces
within the structure of the University, staffed by
professional military officers. If ROTC is re
tained as a non-credit program, several opera
tional problems will grow directly out of the fact

that ROTC will remain in the University but not
of the University. Any solution of these prob
lems will constitute recognition of the anomalous
nature of the arrangement.
1. Would the ROTC programs, singly or
collectively, continue as "Department(s)?" If
not, what status should they have? On what
grounds would such a decision be made?
2. The same questions apply to the status
of ROTC faculty. Shall formal academic rank be
accorded, as presently required by law? To
whom, at what level, and on what grounds?
3. How shall the University handle search
and appointment procedures for persons offering
no accredited work, but who present courses re
quired of a certain proportion of the student
body?
4. How shall the University oversee the
content and mode of instruction in these non
credit but required courses?
B. The primary goal of the ROTC programs
would remain, as before, the recruitment and
training of junior officers. Thus, specific training
for employment by an outside organization, car
ried on by members of that organization, would
continue.
C. Institutional contracts would remain,
though perhaps in a modified form. Thus, dispro
portionate subsidization of the military at Stan
ford would continue: direct subsidies in the form
of facilities, services, etc.; indirect subsidies in
the form of course substitution, etc.
D. Individual contracts, requiring participa
tion in ROTC training programs on-campus by
signatories, would continue. It is here not the
existence of such contracts that is objected to;
rather it is to the institutional sanction and sup
port given these contracts by Stanford Univer
sity.
V. Recommendations
Thus far the Majority has emphasized those
aspects of the present ROTC which make them
objectionable to the point of incompatibility
with the University. We believe such analysis,
while lengthy and complex, is necessary when
ever a significant change is recommended for an
on-going academic program. Also required is
some projection of the nature and structure of
the revised program. That is, having dealt with
objections in the relationship between Stanford
and the ROTC departments, what is considered
to be the proper relationship?
It should be noted, first, that no accurate pro
jection can be made because it is not known
what limits the Department of Defense has for its
junior officer procurement program. We cannot
predict what will be acceptable to the military
services beyond existing operational and legal
constraints.
Secondly, the Majority believes the issue of
proper relations is confused by excessive reliance
on the term "ROTC." The Majority has empha
sized the distinction between ROTC as a mech
anism and the objectives which ROTC serves.
Our arguments have been directed to the mech
anism, not the objectives or purposes. Misinter
pretation arises if this distinction is obscured. If
the language of the Senate's charge is taken to
mean that "ROTC" denotes an organized on
campus program of eduation and training, then
the Majority is compelled to state there can be
no "proper relations between the ROTC depart
ments and Stanford." This, in turn, can mis
takenly be construed to mean that the Majority
believes no proper relations can be established
between the objectives served by the existing de
partments and Stanford.
It is likely that the program which we recom
mend would not and should not be denoted as
"ROTC." This is accurate insofar as the program
has been substantially altered and does not con
form to present programs of ROTC. But any new
denotation should not be interpreted to mean
that we have sought to abolish all relations be
tween Stanford and the purposes of the existing
ROTC programs or that we have concluded that
no proper relations can be established. Rather we
believe that for proper relations to exist, a new
mechanism must be created —one that differs
from the present program, but can still serve the
same purposes in such a way as to be compatible
with the University.
We envision relations whereby each service of
the armed forces would assign personnel to
manage an administrative apparatus, with space
provided possibly in the Dean of Students' Office
of Special Services, that would concern itself
with recruitment of students into the program,
process the revised student contracts and scholar
ships, offer professional counseling and informa
tion to individuals as well as to the existing stu
dent voluntary groups representative of the three
services on campus. Further, this Armed Forces
Officers Program would arrange with enrolled
students for off-campus training and education.
We believe that all education presently offered
by the ROTC departments could be transferred
to extended summer encampments. The military
personnel on campus would be free to offer vol
untary undergraduate special courses, as are
other members of the Stanford community, fol
lowing the guidelines established by the Commit
tee on Undergraduate Education.
To these ends, we recommend the following:
1. After a transitional period (see recom
mendation 5 below), there should be no aca
demic credit received for participation in pro
grams of military training and education.
2. By the end of this period, non-credit,
required military training and education should
no longer be offered on the Stanford campus.
Consistent with these recommendations, a
scholarship or contract "program" may remain,
comprising normal academic education, supple
mented by on-campus voluntary activities and
off-campus training.
3. By the end of this period, all remaining
military programs or activities should be regu
lated by the University's general policies on Stan
ford Voluntary Organizations. No Stanford fac
ulty member or administrator, acting as a spokes
man for the University, shall encourage students
to participate in military training and education,
except in the manner in which participation in all
voluntary activities is encouraged.
4. Individual contracts between Stanford
students and the armed forces should be revised
to reflect actual practice. We recommend further
that punitive clauses involving enlisted service be
removed.
5. These provisions should be in force by
the fall term 1973. Beginning with the fall term
1970, no entering freshman shall be granted aca
demic credit for ROTC activities. The three
ROTC departments should be replaced by a sin
gle Armed Forces Officers Program no later than
fall term 1973. This program shall be for the
purposes of administration, counseling, and re
cruiting for off-campus reserve officer training
and education. (N.B. Because present institu
tional contracts specify one year's notice prior to
termination, the phase-out process cannot begin
before 1970.)
6. Appropriate University authorities
should promptly initiate action leading to re
vision or termination of the contracts between
Stanford and the armed forces (a) in order to
enable the phase-out to begin in 1970, and (b) in
order to reflect the voluntary, non-credit status
of military training at Stanford. We further rec
ommend that a committee be appointed, com
posed of representatives of faculty, administra
tion, military science department, and students,
to assist in effecting the transition.
7. During the transitional period, we rec
ommend that the status of officers presently at
tached to ROTC units remain unchanged. Until
the fall term 1973, newly assigned officers shall
carry the rank of "Lecturer," except for the
newly assigned senior officers of each branch of
the armed forces, who shall carry the rank of
"Lecturer with rank of Professor." After the be
ginning of the 1973-74 academic year, represen
tatives of the armed forces at Stanford shall carry
no academic rank. Similarly until this time, the
departmental and administrative structure of the
ROTC program shall remain as at present.
8. Students already enrolled in ROTC pro
grams, and those enrolling prior to the fall term
1970, shall continue as at present, except that
present contracts should be revised in accord
with recommendation 4.

because our charge as a committee limits us to
these programs.
The Majority believes that there are both gen
eral and specific objections which will continue
to exist as long as ROTC is a program integral to
the institutional structure of the University.
A. Conflict of Interest. The ROTC faculty,
being detailed to Stanford on a limited tour of
duty, remain professional military officers who
legally and ethically owe primary loyalty to the
branch of the service they represent, to the
armed forces, and to the U.S. government. This
means that, however high their integrity and
quality of mind, they cannot at the same time
have a primary commitment either to Stanford
University or to the academic enterprise. This
dual identity should be recognized as a conflict
of interest. The government itself recognizes very
clearly the potential peril of conflict-of-interest
situations, and rightly expects public servants
scrupulously to avoid them. It should be noted
that neither the government's position nor ours
rests upon the fact or even the presumption of
improper behavior.
Because this consideration applies to all mili
tary members of the ROTC, it therefore applies
by extension to the ROTC programs themselves.
These programs, as corporate entities—present
H&S departments—are themselves in a potential
conflict-of-interest situation with respect to the
University.
We recognize that other instances of conflict
of interest are by no means rare in the university;
these too are unfortunate. But they are individ
ual rather than collective, and they are character
ized, in nearly all cases, by a primary commit
ment to the University (note that the University
limits outside activities to an average of one day
per week).
B. Training for a specific employer, by that
employer. The ROTC programs represent the
corporate, institutional presence of an external
organization, which engages in specific training
of candidates for temporary or permanent em
ploy by that organization. The issue raised here is
not simply that of professional or pre-profes
sional training, but of such training carried on
by the armed forces, in the interests of the armed
forces. The Majority believes that such training
should not be a part of the academic structure of
the University.
C. Contractual Arrangements. The objection
able features of the present contracts can be con
sidered under two headings: contractual arrange
ments between the armed forces and Stanford
University, and between the armed forces and
individual students. While some of these arrange
ments may be subject to change, others would
not. Some are specified by the Vitalization Act
of 1964 and could not be changed except
through action by Congress.
C.l. Institutional Contracts. The contracts
between Stanford and the various military ser
vices provide for government commitment of an
academic and administrative staff, an instruc
tional program, government equipment, staff
salaries, and student financial assistance. In re
turn the University agrees to the establishment of
military science department, provision of class
rooms, offices and drill areas, appropriate aca
demic credit for military science courses, and a
minimum sustaining enrollment and output of
officers. In the case of the Army, representation
on all faculty committees whose recommenda
tions would directly affect the Department of
Military Science is stipulated. These contracts
further provide for prior approval and right of
dismissal by Stanford of all military officers as
signed to the department, assignment of the rank
of professor to the senior commissioned officer
of each service assigned to the institution and
lesser academic rank to other members of the
staffs, and the right of the Secretary of the mili
tary service involved to relieve from duty any
officer or enlisted man assigned to work at Stan
ford. These terms represent a partial abdication
of University control over the governance of its
own affairs.
It should be recognized that these arrange
ments result in a Stanford subsidy to the ROTC
programs. Stanford is obliged to provide facili
ties, services, and financial support to the ROTC
programs on a cost-free basis. For example, the
Air Force contract stipulates that Stanford pro
vide:
(1) "the necessary classrooms, administra
tive offices, storage spaces, government
vehicle parking areas, staff parking
areas and other required facilities in
the same manner and at the same level
as is provided to other Departments of
the Institution."
(2) "adequate secretarial, janitorial, and
telephone services ... on the same
basis as is provided to other Depart
ments within the Institution."
An increase in course substitution (see below
D.2.) .while desirable in some ways, will increase
the subsidy by relieving the ROTC programs of
that part of their instructional requirements. In
the Majority's view, such subsidies of the armed
forces are inappropriate.
C.2. Contractual Agreements between
Stanford ROTC Students and the Army, Navy
and Air Force. In this section the committee
states its objections to certain terms contained in
the existing contracts between Stanford ROTC
students and the three military services. It is to
be understood that the Committee does not ob
ject to a student entering into a legal and private
contractual agreement as long as the terms of
said agreement are neither contrary to the aca
demic goals and standards of the university nor
encroachments upon the university's integrity as
an institution of higher learning.
The Committee heard substantial testimony
to the effect that there exists a considerable dif
ference between de facto practice and de jure
obligations. Specifically, it has been the practice
of the three services to terminate a four-year fin
ancial-assistance contract in the first two years
without penalty or prejudice. This has a mitiga
ting effect but leaves the legal provisions of the
contracts technically intact.
C.2.a. Academic Prescriptions. All
three services require certain specified courses of
study. By contract, the student must follow this
prescribed course of study. In addition, the
Navy financial assistant program specifically ex
cludes certain courses of study, and the Air
Force contracts for certain courses of study.
These restrictions and requirements conflict with
the Majority view that Stanford undergraduates
should not be found by law to take and complete
a course of study prescribed by some agent or
agency external to the University, when that
agency also determines (directly or indirectly)
the mode and content of instruction of all or
part of the prescribed course.
All three services require that ROTC cadets
meet certain academic standards. The Majority
believes that Stanford undergraduates should not
be bound by law to maintain academic standards
prescribed by an external agency, especially
when that agency also participates in determining
whether or not such standards have been met.

C.2.b. Personal Conduct. All three
services require that the cadet maintain certain
unspecified standards of personal and moral con
duct. The Majority feels that such restrictions
can seriously limit the student's free participa
tion in all facets of intellectual inquiry and legal
political activity. Furthermore, the Navy finan
cial assistance contract stipulates that the candi
date "remain unmarried until commissioned."
These standards too are established by an agency
external to the University, and judgments con
cerning them are made by the same agency.
While the Majority recognizes the special require
ments of the armed forces and could not object
to similar conditions in contracts between indi
vidual students and the military services when
not a part of a university program or activity, it
can and does object to such conditions when
they are a part of a University-subsidized and
sanctioned activity.
C.2.c. Punitive Clauses. All three ser
vices include in their financial assistance con
tracts clauses that bind the student to a period of
enlisted service for "willfully evading" stipulated
terms. Despite the fact that these clauses have
rarely been invoked at Stanford, the Majority
deems them clearly punitive in intent, and feels
that they unduly infringe the student's freedom
within the University community.
C.2.d. Contracts for Service. To our
knowledge, the ROTC contracts are the only
University-sponsored and sanctioned contracts
on the undergraduate level that bind a student to
service. There are various loan programs such as
the NDEA which allow teaching service to act in
lieu of repayments. Still, these loan programs do
not require service, since the loans can be repaid
with appropriate interest over a period of years.
The ROTC financial assistance grants have no
such provision.
The Majority wishes to point out that these
contractual restrictions and/or obligations oper
ate as a whole. The punitive clauses operate in
relation to academic standards requirements,
course of study requirements, conduct require
ments, and service requirements. The service obli
gation is intimately related to the course of study
requirements. It is this interlocking of contrac
tual requirements, restrictions, and obligations
that makes the whole much more objectionable
than each of its parts might suggest. The Univer
sity's rights and obligations to establish, main
tain, and judge its own standards of academics,
course of study, and student conduct is funda
mental to our conception of the university as
defined above.
D. Academic Objections.
In considering the academic aspects of the
problem, the Committee heard public testimony
that ROTC courses were of very high calibre. We
do not wish to contest this, though members of
the Committee have also heard informally and
confidentially that the contrary is also sometimes
the case. Whatever may be the truth of the mat
ter, the Majority's objections do not rest on these
grounds, but on the inherent goals of these
courses.
D.l Course Goals. Although in recent
years the Department of Defense instruction
plans for the ROTC programs have allowed Pro
fessors of Military Science increasing flexibility
in the choice of text materials and in course sub
stitution, the ultimate goals of these programs
are still fixed by the Department of Defense.
These goals are not compatible with the Univer
sity's "primary commitment to the creation and
dissemination of knowledge, in an environment
of free intellectual activity." The primary goal of
the ROTC programs is to educate, train, and eval
uate junior officers for the U.S. Armed Forces.
The Plan for NROTC Instructional Program
(Navpers 93941, May 1968) defines as "major
goals":
(1) To assist in the education of the
midshipman in a major field of study of interest
to the Navy or Marine Corps leading to a bacca
laureate degree.
(2) To provide the midshipman with
the fundamental concepts and principles of Naval
Science and with the professional Naval knowl
edge necessary to establish a sound basis for his
future growth as a Naval or Marine Corps officer.
(3) To prepare the midshipman for
service with the highest sense of honor and integ
rity as a commissioned officer; to cultivate the
essential elements of military leadership; to fos
ter the growth of a strong sense of loyalty and
dedication to his Service and to the Nation.
(4) To prepare the midshipman to
undertake successfully in later periods of his
career, advanced/continuing education in a field
of application and interest to the Naval Service.
(5) To inject the values of civilian
higher education into the Naval Service by utili
zing the expertise of civilian faculty instruction
where applicable. (Italics ours)
The Army Program of Instruction states that the
objectives of ROTC are "to procure and produce
junior officers who by education, training, atti
tude and inherent qualities are suitable for con
tinued development as officers in the Army."
And the Air Force ROTC mission "is to commis
sion career-oriented second lieutenants in res
ponse to Air Force requirements" by successfully
accomplishing the following four objectives:
(1) Identify, motivate, and select
qualified students to complete the Air Force
ROTC program.
(2) Provide college-level education
that will qualify cadets for commissioning in the
U.S. Air Force.
(3) Heighten each cadet's apprecia
tion of, and dedication to, American principles,
give him an understanding of how the Air Force
serves the national interest, and develop his po
tential as a leader and manager and his under
standing of officer professionalism in the Air
Force.
(4) Commission in the U.S. Air
Force high quality second lieutenants. (Italics
ours)
The goals of these programs are clearly non
academic in nature. Given the goals of these pro
grams as defined above, Military Science instruc
tors are legally and ethically obligated to present
their course material from restricted points of
view, to evaluate the student's fitness for a mili
tary career partly on these grounds, and to report
this evaluation to higher authorities.
Since the goals of the ROTC Programs are to
educate potential officers, much of the current
Military Science course content—weapons sys
tems, small-unit tactics, Army administration, or
ientation, counter-insurgency, etc.—is of such a
narrowly pragmatic, professional nature as to be
incompatible with an undergraduate academic
credit program. Although the Minority Report's
proposed Committee on Military Studies might
deny academic credit to some of these "nuts and
bolts" courses, others might remain in the credit
program. And indeed, one might question
whether any course with the goals outlined above
merits inclusion in Stanford's academic credit
structure. Although knowledge is disseminated in
ROTC courses, it is rarely created in an environ
ment of free intellectual activity; and it is dissem
inated to the end that committed junior officers

to enter the U.S. Armed Forces. The Military
Science Programs' lack of awareness of what we
believe to be the primary commitment of the
University is further evidenced in their equation
of the "values of civilian higher education" with
the "expertise of civilian faculty where applic
able." (NROTC Goals No. 5)
D.2. Course Substitution. The substitu
tion of courses in regular academic departments
for courses presently taught by the ROTC fac
ulty (particularly U.S. military history and U.S.
foreign policy) has been frequently suggested.
This has some attractive features, but these
should not blind one to the problems it also en
tails.
D.2.a. Such courses would have to
meet the goals set forth by the armed forces.
Senior ROTC faculty are being granted wide lati
tude in determining whether or not goals are
being met by a particular course, but it is never
theless true that the scope, coverage, and content
of such courses will be under periodic review by
the military establishment.
D.2.b. If such a course is built into
the ROTC curriculum and required of all cadets,
then the presumption exists that the course will
meet the needs of the ROTC in scope, coverage,
approach, and frequency of offering. TTie faculty
member will have to take these considerations
into account in planning course changes, leave
periods, etc. If such a required course fails for
any reason to meet ROTC needs, the ROTC must
reassume part or all of the instruction in that
area, or drop the requirement. But then course
substitution is either lost or was unnecessary in
the first place.
D.2.C. If such a course is to be op
tional for ROTC cadets, then some other options
must be available. This presumes one of three
things: (a) that other equivalent courses are avail
able in the academic departments, (b) that the
ROTC faculty provide the equivalent, or (c) that
cadets need not receive training in that particular
area. The revised ROTC instructional programs
seem to rule out the last; normal University prac
tice makes the first unlikely. Thus, here too, the
advantages of course substitution may be lost.
Finally, it should be noted that it will be difficult
to ensure that the course is in fact "optional." If
other options are limited, and if cadets are
"strongly urged" to enroll in a particular course,
is that course truly optional?
D.2.d. Course substitution will in
crease both the direct and indirect subsidy of
Stanford to the ROTC by assuming part of the
training of ROTC cadets (see below). It will add
to the work of the academic department and the
individual faculty member by the number of stu
dents who would not otherwise have enrolled in
his course (this could, for example, require addi
tional expenditures for T.A.'s, readers, etc.). The
call upon the resources of the ROTC programs
will be correspondingly lightened.
D.3. Departmental Status. An academic
department shares much the same definition as
the institution of which it is a part, with particu
lar reference to a specific area and/or discipline.
When a student has demonstrated a certain com
petence in this area or discipline, he is recom
mended for a degree, either at the undergraduate
or graduate level. The Departments of Military
Science do not do this at either level; rather, they
offer commissions in the Armed Forces to the
men who successfully complete their programs.
Unlike other departments or schools in the Uni
versity, the ROTC Departments are educating
young men not to academic ends but to work for
a specific employer in a specific area.
The Minority recommends combining the
three ROTC Departments into a single Depart
ment of Military Studies, no longer to be lodged
in the School of Humanities and Sciences but to
be responsible to the Provost via a Committee on
Military Studies. The Majority believes this is a
recognition of the anomalous nature of such a
department, which has neither undergraduate nor
graduate majors and serves non-academic ends.
D.4. Faculty Search and Appointment.
The Military Science Departments' faculty is ap
pointed in an irregular way. The appointment
procedure for Military Science personnel by
passes both department-initiated search and eval
uation, and the normal administrative ratification
process. Whenever a position becomes vacant, the
appropriate branch of the Armed Services pre
sents nominations for the position to the Pro
vost's Office. The administration may veto any
military nominations. (It has done so at least
three times.) The nominee's military record and
college transcripts are examined and, whenever
possible, a personal interview is held. Though
ROTC faculty are presently members of the Aca
demic Council, they are not subject to the usual
University policy on tenure, for the Defense De
partment agrees to recall them immediately at
the request of the administration. (Stanford has
exercised this option once in recent years.) Fur
thermore, the Department of Defense reserves
the right to transfer from Stanford any assigned
military personnel. Thus, under present arrange
ments, an external organization may unilaterally
remove a member of the Stanford faculty.
This irregular appointment and retention pro
cedure violates the principle that the primary re
sponsibility for faculty appointment and status
rests with the Stanford faculty and administra
tion. Secondly, it creates a special class of faculty
members having some characteristics not shared
by the regular faculty and lacking others.
Thirdly, since Stanford cannot initiate the search
nor fully supervise the screening process, the Uni
versity loses some degree of control over the
quality of the ROTC faculty. These irregular fea
tures would continue, even under revised proced
ures.
IV. Objections to ROTC as An Organized, Non
credit, On-Campus Program
The previous section reviews our objections,
both general and specific, to ROTC as an aca
demic program at Stanford. Having come to this
point, the Majority gave serious consideration to
retention of ROTC on campus as an organized,
non-credit program of education and training. We
believe such an arrangement may be an improve
ment over both the present situation and the rec
ommendations of the Minority. But it is the con
viction of the Majority that the logic of the gen
eral objections must apply generally to the rela
tions between ROTC and Stanford. To recom
mend termination of academic credit and reten
tion of non-credit ROTC programs is to accept
the argument with respect to the former but fail
to apply it to the latter. We here recapitulate
those considerations with reference to ROTC as
an on-campus, non-credit program of training
and education.
A. What has been termed "conflict of inter
est" would continue, since ROTC would remain
the corporate representation of the armed forces
within the structure of the University, staffed by
professional military officers. If ROTC is re
tained as a non-credit program, several opera
tional problems will grow directly out of the fact

that ROTC will remain in the University but not
of the University. Any solution of these prob
lems will constitute recognition of the anomalous
nature of the arrangement.
1. Would the ROTC programs, singly or
collectively, continue as "Department(s)?" If
not, what status should they have? On what
grounds would such a decision be made?
2. The same questions apply to the status
of ROTC faculty. Shall formal academic rank be
accorded, as presently required by law? To
whom, at what level, and on what grounds?
3. How shall the University handle search
and appointment procedures for persons offering
no accredited work, but who present courses re
quired of a certain proportion of the student
body?
4. How shall the University oversee the
content and mode of instruction in these non
credit but required courses?
B. The primary goal of the ROTC programs
would remain, as before, the recruitment and
training of junior officers. Thus, specific training
for employment by an outside organization, car
ried on by members of that organization, would
continue.
C. Institutional contracts would remain,
though perhaps in a modified form. Thus, dispro
portionate subsidization of the military at Stan
ford would continue: direct subsidies in the form
of facilities, services, etc.; indirect subsidies in
the form of course substitution, etc.
D. Individual contracts, requiring participa
tion in ROTC training programs on-campus by
signatories, would continue. It is here not the
existence of such contracts that is objected to;
rather it is to the institutional sanction and sup
port given these contracts by Stanford Univer
sity.
V. Recommendations
Thus far the Majority has emphasized those
aspects of the present ROTC which make them
objectionable to the point of incompatibility
with the University. We believe such analysis,
while lengthy and complex, is necessary when
ever a significant change is recommended for an
on-going academic program. Also required is
some projection of the nature and structure of
the revised program. That is, having dealt with
objections in the relationship between Stanford
and the ROTC departments, what is considered
to be the proper relationship?
It should be noted, first, that no accurate pro
jection can be made because it is not known
what limits the Department of Defense has for its
junior officer procurement program. We cannot
predict what will be acceptable to the military
services beyond existing operational and legal
constraints.
Secondly, the Majority believes the issue of
proper relations is confused by excessive reliance
on the term "ROTC." The Majority has empha
sized the distinction between ROTC as a mech
anism and the objectives which ROTC serves.
Our arguments have been directed to the mech
anism, not the objectives or purposes. Misinter
pretation arises if this distinction is obscured. If
the language of the Senate's charge is taken to
mean that "ROTC" denotes an organized on
campus program of eduation and training, then
the Majority is compelled to state there can be
no "proper relations between the ROTC depart
ments and Stanford." This, in turn, can mis
takenly be construed to mean that the Majority
believes no proper relations can be established
between the objectives served by the existing de
partments and Stanford.
It is likely that the program which we recom
mend would not and should not be denoted as
"ROTC." This is accurate insofar as the program
has been substantially altered and does not con
form to present programs of ROTC. But any new
denotation should not be interpreted to mean
that we have sought to abolish all relations be
tween Stanford and the purposes of the existing
ROTC programs or that we have concluded that
no proper relations can be established. Rather we
believe that for proper relations to exist, a new
mechanism must be created —one that differs
from the present program, but can still serve the
same purposes in such a way as to be compatible
with the University.
We envision relations whereby each service of
the armed forces would assign personnel to
manage an administrative apparatus, with space
provided possibly in the Dean of Students' Office
of Special Services, that would concern itself
with recruitment of students into the program,
process the revised student contracts and scholar
ships, offer professional counseling and informa
tion to individuals as well as to the existing stu
dent voluntary groups representative of the three
services on campus. Further, this Armed Forces
Officers Program would arrange with enrolled
students for off-campus training and education.
We believe that all education presently offered
by the ROTC departments could be transferred
to extended summer encampments. The military
personnel on campus would be free to offer vol
untary undergraduate special courses, as are
other members of the Stanford community, fol
lowing the guidelines established by the Commit
tee on Undergraduate Education.
To these ends, we recommend the following:
1. After a transitional period (see recom
mendation 5 below), there should be no aca
demic credit received for participation in pro
grams of military training and education.
2. By the end of this period, non-credit,
required military training and education should
no longer be offered on the Stanford campus.
Consistent with these recommendations, a
scholarship or contract "program" may remain,
comprising normal academic education, supple
mented by on-campus voluntary activities and
off-campus training.
3. By the end of this period, all remaining
military programs or activities should be regu
lated by the University's general policies on Stan
ford Voluntary Organizations. No Stanford fac
ulty member or administrator, acting as a spokes
man for the University, shall encourage students
to participate in military training and education,
except in the manner in which participation in all
voluntary activities is encouraged.
4. Individual contracts between Stanford
students and the armed forces should be revised
to reflect actual practice. We recommend further
that punitive clauses involving enlisted service be
removed.
5. These provisions should be in force by
the fall term 1973. Beginning with the fall term
1970, no entering freshman shall be granted aca
demic credit for ROTC activities. The three
ROTC departments should be replaced by a sin
gle Armed Forces Officers Program no later than
fall term 1973. This program shall be for the
purposes of administration, counseling, and re
cruiting for off-campus reserve officer training
and education. (N.B. Because present institu
tional contracts specify one year's notice prior to
termination, the phase-out process cannot begin
before 1970.)
6. Appropriate University authorities
should promptly initiate action leading to re
vision or termination of the contracts between
Stanford and the armed forces (a) in order to
enable the phase-out to begin in 1970, and (b) in
order to reflect the voluntary, non-credit status
of military training at Stanford. We further rec
ommend that a committee be appointed, com
posed of representatives of faculty, administra
tion, military science department, and students,
to assist in effecting the transition.
7. During the transitional period, we rec
ommend that the status of officers presently at
tached to ROTC units remain unchanged. Until
the fall term 1973, newly assigned officers shall
carry the rank of "Lecturer," except for the
newly assigned senior officers of each branch of
the armed forces, who shall carry the rank of
"Lecturer with rank of Professor." After the be
ginning of the 1973-74 academic year, represen
tatives of the armed forces at Stanford shall carry
no academic rank. Similarly until this time, the
departmental and administrative structure of the
ROTC program shall remain as at present.
8. Students already enrolled in ROTC pro
grams, and those enrolling prior to the fall term
1970, shall continue as at present, except that
present contracts should be revised in accord
with recommendation 4.

because our charge as a committee limits us to
these programs.
The Majority believes that there are both gen
eral and specific objections which will continue
to exist as long as ROTC is a program integral to
the institutional structure of the University.
A. Conflict of Interest. The ROTC faculty,
being detailed to Stanford on a limited tour of
duty, remain professional military officers who
legally and ethically owe primary loyalty to the
branch of the service they represent, to the
armed forces, and to the U.S. government. This
means that, however high their integrity and
quality of mind, they cannot at the same time
have a primary commitment either to Stanford
University or to the academic enterprise. This
dual identity should be recognized as a conflict
of interest. The government itself recognizes very
clearly the potential peril of conflict-of-interest
situations, and rightly expects public servants
scrupulously to avoid them. It should be noted
that neither the government's position nor ours
rests upon the fact or even the presumption of
improper behavior.
Because this consideration applies to all mili
tary members of the ROTC, it therefore applies
by extension to the ROTC programs themselves.
These programs, as corporate entities—present
H&S departments—are themselves in a potential
conflict-of-interest situation with respect to the
University.
We recognize that other instances of conflict
of interest are by no means rare in the university;
these too are unfortunate. But they are individ
ual rather than collective, and they are character
ized, in nearly all cases, by a primary commit
ment to the University (note that the University
limits outside activities to an average of one day
per week).
B. Training for a specific employer, by that
employer. The ROTC programs represent the
corporate, institutional presence of an external
organization, which engages in specific training
of candidates for temporary or permanent em
ploy by that organization. The issue raised here is
not simply that of professional or pre-profes
sional training, but of such training carried on
by the armed forces, in the interests of the armed
forces. The Majority believes that such training
should not be a part of the academic structure of
the University.
C. Contractual Arrangements. The objection
able features of the present contracts can be con
sidered under two headings: contractual arrange
ments between the armed forces and Stanford
University, and between the armed forces and
individual students. While some of these arrange
ments may be subject to change, others would
not. Some are specified by the Vitalization Act
of 1964 and could not be changed except
through action by Congress.
C.l. Institutional Contracts. The contracts
between Stanford and the various military ser
vices provide for government commitment of an
academic and administrative staff, an instruc
tional program, government equipment, staff
salaries, and student financial assistance. In re
turn the University agrees to the establishment of
military science department, provision of class
rooms, offices and drill areas, appropriate aca
demic credit for military science courses, and a
minimum sustaining enrollment and output of
officers. In the case of the Army, representation
on all faculty committees whose recommenda
tions would directly affect the Department of
Military Science is stipulated. These contracts
further provide for prior approval and right of
dismissal by Stanford of all military officers as
signed to the department, assignment of the rank
of professor to the senior commissioned officer
of each service assigned to the institution and
lesser academic rank to other members of the
staffs, and the right of the Secretary of the mili
tary service involved to relieve from duty any
officer or enlisted man assigned to work at Stan
ford. These terms represent a partial abdication
of University control over the governance of its
own affairs.
It should be recognized that these arrange
ments result in a Stanford subsidy to the ROTC
programs. Stanford is obliged to provide facili
ties, services, and financial support to the ROTC
programs on a cost-free basis. For example, the
Air Force contract stipulates that Stanford pro
vide:
(1) "the necessary classrooms, administra
tive offices, storage spaces, government
vehicle parking areas, staff parking
areas and other required facilities in
the same manner and at the same level
as is provided to other Departments of
the Institution."
(2) "adequate secretarial, janitorial, and
telephone services ... on the same
basis as is provided to other Depart
ments within the Institution."
An increase in course substitution (see below
D.2.) .while desirable in some ways, will increase
the subsidy by relieving the ROTC programs of
that part of their instructional requirements. In
the Majority's view, such subsidies of the armed
forces are inappropriate.
C.2. Contractual Agreements between
Stanford ROTC Students and the Army, Navy
and Air Force. In this section the committee
states its objections to certain terms contained in
the existing contracts between Stanford ROTC
students and the three military services. It is to
be understood that the Committee does not ob
ject to a student entering into a legal and private
contractual agreement as long as the terms of
said agreement are neither contrary to the aca
demic goals and standards of the university nor
encroachments upon the university's integrity as
an institution of higher learning.
The Committee heard substantial testimony
to the effect that there exists a considerable dif
ference between de facto practice and de jure
obligations. Specifically, it has been the practice
of the three services to terminate a four-year fin
ancial-assistance contract in the first two years
without penalty or prejudice. This has a mitiga
ting effect but leaves the legal provisions of the
contracts technically intact.
C.2.a. Academic Prescriptions. All
three services require certain specified courses of
study. By contract, the student must follow this
prescribed course of study. In addition, the
Navy financial assistant program specifically ex
cludes certain courses of study, and the Air
Force contracts for certain courses of study.
These restrictions and requirements conflict with
the Majority view that Stanford undergraduates
should not be found by law to take and complete
a course of study prescribed by some agent or
agency external to the University, when that
agency also determines (directly or indirectly)
the mode and content of instruction of all or
part of the prescribed course.
All three services require that ROTC cadets
meet certain academic standards. The Majority
believes that Stanford undergraduates should not
be bound by law to maintain academic standards
prescribed by an external agency, especially
when that agency also participates in determining
whether or not such standards have been met.

C.2.b. Personal Conduct. All three
services require that the cadet maintain certain
unspecified standards of personal and moral con
duct. The Majority feels that such restrictions
can seriously limit the student's free participa
tion in all facets of intellectual inquiry and legal
political activity. Furthermore, the Navy finan
cial assistance contract stipulates that the candi
date "remain unmarried until commissioned."
These standards too are established by an agency
external to the University, and judgments con
cerning them are made by the same agency.
While the Majority recognizes the special require
ments of the armed forces and could not object
to similar conditions in contracts between indi
vidual students and the military services when
not a part of a university program or activity, it
can and does object to such conditions when
they are a part of a University-subsidized and
sanctioned activity.
C.2.c. Punitive Clauses. All three ser
vices include in their financial assistance con
tracts clauses that bind the student to a period of
enlisted service for "willfully evading" stipulated
terms. Despite the fact that these clauses have
rarely been invoked at Stanford, the Majority
deems them clearly punitive in intent, and feels
that they unduly infringe the student's freedom
within the University community.
C.2.d. Contracts for Service. To our
knowledge, the ROTC contracts are the only
University-sponsored and sanctioned contracts
on the undergraduate level that bind a student to
service. There are various loan programs such as
the NDEA which allow teaching service to act in
lieu of repayments. Still, these loan programs do
not require service, since the loans can be repaid
with appropriate interest over a period of years.
The ROTC financial assistance grants have no
such provision.
The Majority wishes to point out that these
contractual restrictions and/or obligations oper
ate as a whole. The punitive clauses operate in
relation to academic standards requirements,
course of study requirements, conduct require
ments, and service requirements. The service obli
gation is intimately related to the course of study
requirements. It is this interlocking of contrac
tual requirements, restrictions, and obligations
that makes the whole much more objectionable
than each of its parts might suggest. The Univer
sity's rights and obligations to establish, main
tain, and judge its own standards of academics,
course of study, and student conduct is funda
mental to our conception of the university as
defined above.
D. Academic Objections.
In considering the academic aspects of the
problem, the Committee heard public testimony
that ROTC courses were of very high calibre. We
do not wish to contest this, though members of
the Committee have also heard informally and
confidentially that the contrary is also sometimes
the case. Whatever may be the truth of the mat
ter, the Majority's objections do not rest on these
grounds, but on the inherent goals of these
courses.
D.l Course Goals. Although in recent
years the Department of Defense instruction
plans for the ROTC programs have allowed Pro
fessors of Military Science increasing flexibility
in the choice of text materials and in course sub
stitution, the ultimate goals of these programs
are still fixed by the Department of Defense.
These goals are not compatible with the Univer
sity's "primary commitment to the creation and
dissemination of knowledge, in an environment
of free intellectual activity." The primary goal of
the ROTC programs is to educate, train, and eval
uate junior officers for the U.S. Armed Forces.
The Plan for NROTC Instructional Program
(Navpers 93941, May 1968) defines as "major
goals":
(1) To assist in the education of the
midshipman in a major field of study of interest
to the Navy or Marine Corps leading to a bacca
laureate degree.
(2) To provide the midshipman with
the fundamental concepts and principles of Naval
Science and with the professional Naval knowl
edge necessary to establish a sound basis for his
future growth as a Naval or Marine Corps officer.
(3) To prepare the midshipman for
service with the highest sense of honor and integ
rity as a commissioned officer; to cultivate the
essential elements of military leadership; to fos
ter the growth of a strong sense of loyalty and
dedication to his Service and to the Nation.
(4) To prepare the midshipman to
undertake successfully in later periods of his
career, advanced/continuing education in a field
of application and interest to the Naval Service.
(5) To inject the values of civilian
higher education into the Naval Service by utili
zing the expertise of civilian faculty instruction
where applicable. (Italics ours)
The Army Program of Instruction states that the
objectives of ROTC are "to procure and produce
junior officers who by education, training, atti
tude and inherent qualities are suitable for con
tinued development as officers in the Army."
And the Air Force ROTC mission "is to commis
sion career-oriented second lieutenants in res
ponse to Air Force requirements" by successfully
accomplishing the following four objectives:
(1) Identify, motivate, and select
qualified students to complete the Air Force
ROTC program.
(2) Provide college-level education
that will qualify cadets for commissioning in the
U.S. Air Force.
(3) Heighten each cadet's apprecia
tion of, and dedication to, American principles,
give him an understanding of how the Air Force
serves the national interest, and develop his po
tential as a leader and manager and his under
standing of officer professionalism in the Air
Force.
(4) Commission in the U.S. Air
Force high quality second lieutenants. (Italics
ours)
The goals of these programs are clearly non
academic in nature. Given the goals of these pro
grams as defined above, Military Science instruc
tors are legally and ethically obligated to present
their course material from restricted points of
view, to evaluate the student's fitness for a mili
tary career partly on these grounds, and to report
this evaluation to higher authorities.
Since the goals of the ROTC Programs are to
educate potential officers, much of the current
Military Science course content—weapons sys
tems, small-unit tactics, Army administration, or
ientation, counter-insurgency, etc.—is of such a
narrowly pragmatic, professional nature as to be
incompatible with an undergraduate academic
credit program. Although the Minority Report's
proposed Committee on Military Studies might
deny academic credit to some of these "nuts and
bolts" courses, others might remain in the credit
program. And indeed, one might question
whether any course with the goals outlined above
merits inclusion in Stanford's academic credit
structure. Although knowledge is disseminated in
ROTC courses, it is rarely created in an environ
ment of free intellectual activity; and it is dissem
inated to the end that committed junior officers

to enter the U.S. Armed Forces. The Military
Science Programs' lack of awareness of what we
believe to be the primary commitment of the
University is further evidenced in their equation
of the "values of civilian higher education" with
the "expertise of civilian faculty where applic
able." (NROTC Goals No. 5)
D.2. Course Substitution. The substitu
tion of courses in regular academic departments
for courses presently taught by the ROTC fac
ulty (particularly U.S. military history and U.S.
foreign policy) has been frequently suggested.
This has some attractive features, but these
should not blind one to the problems it also en
tails.
D.2.a. Such courses would have to
meet the goals set forth by the armed forces.
Senior ROTC faculty are being granted wide lati
tude in determining whether or not goals are
being met by a particular course, but it is never
theless true that the scope, coverage, and content
of such courses will be under periodic review by
the military establishment.
D.2.b. If such a course is built into
the ROTC curriculum and required of all cadets,
then the presumption exists that the course will
meet the needs of the ROTC in scope, coverage,
approach, and frequency of offering. TTie faculty
member will have to take these considerations
into account in planning course changes, leave
periods, etc. If such a required course fails for
any reason to meet ROTC needs, the ROTC must
reassume part or all of the instruction in that
area, or drop the requirement. But then course
substitution is either lost or was unnecessary in
the first place.
D.2.C. If such a course is to be op
tional for ROTC cadets, then some other options
must be available. This presumes one of three
things: (a) that other equivalent courses are avail
able in the academic departments, (b) that the
ROTC faculty provide the equivalent, or (c) that
cadets need not receive training in that particular
area. The revised ROTC instructional programs
seem to rule out the last; normal University prac
tice makes the first unlikely. Thus, here too, the
advantages of course substitution may be lost.
Finally, it should be noted that it will be difficult
to ensure that the course is in fact "optional." If
other options are limited, and if cadets are
"strongly urged" to enroll in a particular course,
is that course truly optional?
D.2.d. Course substitution will in
crease both the direct and indirect subsidy of
Stanford to the ROTC by assuming part of the
training of ROTC cadets (see below). It will add
to the work of the academic department and the
individual faculty member by the number of stu
dents who would not otherwise have enrolled in
his course (this could, for example, require addi
tional expenditures for T.A.'s, readers, etc.). The
call upon the resources of the ROTC programs
will be correspondingly lightened.
D.3. Departmental Status. An academic
department shares much the same definition as
the institution of which it is a part, with particu
lar reference to a specific area and/or discipline.
When a student has demonstrated a certain com
petence in this area or discipline, he is recom
mended for a degree, either at the undergraduate
or graduate level. The Departments of Military
Science do not do this at either level; rather, they
offer commissions in the Armed Forces to the
men who successfully complete their programs.
Unlike other departments or schools in the Uni
versity, the ROTC Departments are educating
young men not to academic ends but to work for
a specific employer in a specific area.
The Minority recommends combining the
three ROTC Departments into a single Depart
ment of Military Studies, no longer to be lodged
in the School of Humanities and Sciences but to
be responsible to the Provost via a Committee on
Military Studies. The Majority believes this is a
recognition of the anomalous nature of such a
department, which has neither undergraduate nor
graduate majors and serves non-academic ends.
D.4. Faculty Search and Appointment.
The Military Science Departments' faculty is ap
pointed in an irregular way. The appointment
procedure for Military Science personnel by
passes both department-initiated search and eval
uation, and the normal administrative ratification
process. Whenever a position becomes vacant, the
appropriate branch of the Armed Services pre
sents nominations for the position to the Pro
vost's Office. The administration may veto any
military nominations. (It has done so at least
three times.) The nominee's military record and
college transcripts are examined and, whenever
possible, a personal interview is held. Though
ROTC faculty are presently members of the Aca
demic Council, they are not subject to the usual
University policy on tenure, for the Defense De
partment agrees to recall them immediately at
the request of the administration. (Stanford has
exercised this option once in recent years.) Fur
thermore, the Department of Defense reserves
the right to transfer from Stanford any assigned
military personnel. Thus, under present arrange
ments, an external organization may unilaterally
remove a member of the Stanford faculty.
This irregular appointment and retention pro
cedure violates the principle that the primary re
sponsibility for faculty appointment and status
rests with the Stanford faculty and administra
tion. Secondly, it creates a special class of faculty
members having some characteristics not shared
by the regular faculty and lacking others.
Thirdly, since Stanford cannot initiate the search
nor fully supervise the screening process, the Uni
versity loses some degree of control over the
quality of the ROTC faculty. These irregular fea
tures would continue, even under revised proced
ures.
IV. Objections to ROTC as An Organized, Non
credit, On-Campus Program
The previous section reviews our objections,
both general and specific, to ROTC as an aca
demic program at Stanford. Having come to this
point, the Majority gave serious consideration to
retention of ROTC on campus as an organized,
non-credit program of education and training. We
believe such an arrangement may be an improve
ment over both the present situation and the rec
ommendations of the Minority. But it is the con
viction of the Majority that the logic of the gen
eral objections must apply generally to the rela
tions between ROTC and Stanford. To recom
mend termination of academic credit and reten
tion of non-credit ROTC programs is to accept
the argument with respect to the former but fail
to apply it to the latter. We here recapitulate
those considerations with reference to ROTC as
an on-campus, non-credit program of training
and education.
A. What has been termed "conflict of inter
est" would continue, since ROTC would remain
the corporate representation of the armed forces
within the structure of the University, staffed by
professional military officers. If ROTC is re
tained as a non-credit program, several opera
tional problems will grow directly out of the fact

that ROTC will remain in the University but not
of the University. Any solution of these prob
lems will constitute recognition of the anomalous
nature of the arrangement.
1. Would the ROTC programs, singly or
collectively, continue as "Department(s)?" If
not, what status should they have? On what
grounds would such a decision be made?
2. The same questions apply to the status
of ROTC faculty. Shall formal academic rank be
accorded, as presently required by law? To
whom, at what level, and on what grounds?
3. How shall the University handle search
and appointment procedures for persons offering
no accredited work, but who present courses re
quired of a certain proportion of the student
body?
4. How shall the University oversee the
content and mode of instruction in these non
credit but required courses?
B. The primary goal of the ROTC programs
would remain, as before, the recruitment and
training of junior officers. Thus, specific training
for employment by an outside organization, car
ried on by members of that organization, would
continue.
C. Institutional contracts would remain,
though perhaps in a modified form. Thus, dispro
portionate subsidization of the military at Stan
ford would continue: direct subsidies in the form
of facilities, services, etc.; indirect subsidies in
the form of course substitution, etc.
D. Individual contracts, requiring participa
tion in ROTC training programs on-campus by
signatories, would continue. It is here not the
existence of such contracts that is objected to;
rather it is to the institutional sanction and sup
port given these contracts by Stanford Univer
sity.
V. Recommendations
Thus far the Majority has emphasized those
aspects of the present ROTC which make them
objectionable to the point of incompatibility
with the University. We believe such analysis,
while lengthy and complex, is necessary when
ever a significant change is recommended for an
on-going academic program. Also required is
some projection of the nature and structure of
the revised program. That is, having dealt with
objections in the relationship between Stanford
and the ROTC departments, what is considered
to be the proper relationship?
It should be noted, first, that no accurate pro
jection can be made because it is not known
what limits the Department of Defense has for its
junior officer procurement program. We cannot
predict what will be acceptable to the military
services beyond existing operational and legal
constraints.
Secondly, the Majority believes the issue of
proper relations is confused by excessive reliance
on the term "ROTC." The Majority has empha
sized the distinction between ROTC as a mech
anism and the objectives which ROTC serves.
Our arguments have been directed to the mech
anism, not the objectives or purposes. Misinter
pretation arises if this distinction is obscured. If
the language of the Senate's charge is taken to
mean that "ROTC" denotes an organized on
campus program of eduation and training, then
the Majority is compelled to state there can be
no "proper relations between the ROTC depart
ments and Stanford." This, in turn, can mis
takenly be construed to mean that the Majority
believes no proper relations can be established
between the objectives served by the existing de
partments and Stanford.
It is likely that the program which we recom
mend would not and should not be denoted as
"ROTC." This is accurate insofar as the program
has been substantially altered and does not con
form to present programs of ROTC. But any new
denotation should not be interpreted to mean
that we have sought to abolish all relations be
tween Stanford and the purposes of the existing
ROTC programs or that we have concluded that
no proper relations can be established. Rather we
believe that for proper relations to exist, a new
mechanism must be created —one that differs
from the present program, but can still serve the
same purposes in such a way as to be compatible
with the University.
We envision relations whereby each service of
the armed forces would assign personnel to
manage an administrative apparatus, with space
provided possibly in the Dean of Students' Office
of Special Services, that would concern itself
with recruitment of students into the program,
process the revised student contracts and scholar
ships, offer professional counseling and informa
tion to individuals as well as to the existing stu
dent voluntary groups representative of the three
services on campus. Further, this Armed Forces
Officers Program would arrange with enrolled
students for off-campus training and education.
We believe that all education presently offered
by the ROTC departments could be transferred
to extended summer encampments. The military
personnel on campus would be free to offer vol
untary undergraduate special courses, as are
other members of the Stanford community, fol
lowing the guidelines established by the Commit
tee on Undergraduate Education.
To these ends, we recommend the following:
1. After a transitional period (see recom
mendation 5 below), there should be no aca
demic credit received for participation in pro
grams of military training and education.
2. By the end of this period, non-credit,
required military training and education should
no longer be offered on the Stanford campus.
Consistent with these recommendations, a
scholarship or contract "program" may remain,
comprising normal academic education, supple
mented by on-campus voluntary activities and
off-campus training.
3. By the end of this period, all remaining
military programs or activities should be regu
lated by the University's general policies on Stan
ford Voluntary Organizations. No Stanford fac
ulty member or administrator, acting as a spokes
man for the University, shall encourage students
to participate in military training and education,
except in the manner in which participation in all
voluntary activities is encouraged.
4. Individual contracts between Stanford
students and the armed forces should be revised
to reflect actual practice. We recommend further
that punitive clauses involving enlisted service be
removed.
5. These provisions should be in force by
the fall term 1973. Beginning with the fall term
1970, no entering freshman shall be granted aca
demic credit for ROTC activities. The three
ROTC departments should be replaced by a sin
gle Armed Forces Officers Program no later than
fall term 1973. This program shall be for the
purposes of administration, counseling, and re
cruiting for off-campus reserve officer training
and education. (N.B. Because present institu
tional contracts specify one year's notice prior to
termination, the phase-out process cannot begin
before 1970.)
6. Appropriate University authorities
should promptly initiate action leading to re
vision or termination of the contracts between
Stanford and the armed forces (a) in order to
enable the phase-out to begin in 1970, and (b) in
order to reflect the voluntary, non-credit status
of military training at Stanford. We further rec
ommend that a committee be appointed, com
posed of representatives of faculty, administra
tion, military science department, and students,
to assist in effecting the transition.
7. During the transitional period, we rec
ommend that the status of officers presently at
tached to ROTC units remain unchanged. Until
the fall term 1973, newly assigned officers shall
carry the rank of "Lecturer," except for the
newly assigned senior officers of each branch of
the armed forces, who shall carry the rank of
"Lecturer with rank of Professor." After the be
ginning of the 1973-74 academic year, represen
tatives of the armed forces at Stanford shall carry
no academic rank. Similarly until this time, the
departmental and administrative structure of the
ROTC program shall remain as at present.
8. Students already enrolled in ROTC pro
grams, and those enrolling prior to the fall term
1970, shall continue as at present, except that
present contracts should be revised in accord
with recommendation 4.

because our charge as a committee limits us to
these programs.
The Majority believes that there are both gen
eral and specific objections which will continue
to exist as long as ROTC is a program integral to
the institutional structure of the University.
A. Conflict of Interest. The ROTC faculty,
being detailed to Stanford on a limited tour of
duty, remain professional military officers who
legally and ethically owe primary loyalty to the
branch of the service they represent, to the
armed forces, and to the U.S. government. This
means that, however high their integrity and
quality of mind, they cannot at the same time
have a primary commitment either to Stanford
University or to the academic enterprise. This
dual identity should be recognized as a conflict
of interest. The government itself recognizes very
clearly the potential peril of conflict-of-interest
situations, and rightly expects public servants
scrupulously to avoid them. It should be noted
that neither the government's position nor ours
rests upon the fact or even the presumption of
improper behavior.
Because this consideration applies to all mili
tary members of the ROTC, it therefore applies
by extension to the ROTC programs themselves.
These programs, as corporate entities—present
H&S departments—are themselves in a potential
conflict-of-interest situation with respect to the
University.
We recognize that other instances of conflict
of interest are by no means rare in the university;
these too are unfortunate. But they are individ
ual rather than collective, and they are character
ized, in nearly all cases, by a primary commit
ment to the University (note that the University
limits outside activities to an average of one day
per week).
B. Training for a specific employer, by that
employer. The ROTC programs represent the
corporate, institutional presence of an external
organization, which engages in specific training
of candidates for temporary or permanent em
ploy by that organization. The issue raised here is
not simply that of professional or pre-profes
sional training, but of such training carried on
by the armed forces, in the interests of the armed
forces. The Majority believes that such training
should not be a part of the academic structure of
the University.
C. Contractual Arrangements. The objection
able features of the present contracts can be con
sidered under two headings: contractual arrange
ments between the armed forces and Stanford
University, and between the armed forces and
individual students. While some of these arrange
ments may be subject to change, others would
not. Some are specified by the Vitalization Act
of 1964 and could not be changed except
through action by Congress.
C.l. Institutional Contracts. The contracts
between Stanford and the various military ser
vices provide for government commitment of an
academic and administrative staff, an instruc
tional program, government equipment, staff
salaries, and student financial assistance. In re
turn the University agrees to the establishment of
military science department, provision of class
rooms, offices and drill areas, appropriate aca
demic credit for military science courses, and a
minimum sustaining enrollment and output of
officers. In the case of the Army, representation
on all faculty committees whose recommenda
tions would directly affect the Department of
Military Science is stipulated. These contracts
further provide for prior approval and right of
dismissal by Stanford of all military officers as
signed to the department, assignment of the rank
of professor to the senior commissioned officer
of each service assigned to the institution and
lesser academic rank to other members of the
staffs, and the right of the Secretary of the mili
tary service involved to relieve from duty any
officer or enlisted man assigned to work at Stan
ford. These terms represent a partial abdication
of University control over the governance of its
own affairs.
It should be recognized that these arrange
ments result in a Stanford subsidy to the ROTC
programs. Stanford is obliged to provide facili
ties, services, and financial support to the ROTC
programs on a cost-free basis. For example, the
Air Force contract stipulates that Stanford pro
vide:
(1) "the necessary classrooms, administra
tive offices, storage spaces, government
vehicle parking areas, staff parking
areas and other required facilities in
the same manner and at the same level
as is provided to other Departments of
the Institution."
(2) "adequate secretarial, janitorial, and
telephone services ... on the same
basis as is provided to other Depart
ments within the Institution."
An increase in course substitution (see below
D.2.) .while desirable in some ways, will increase
the subsidy by relieving the ROTC programs of
that part of their instructional requirements. In
the Majority's view, such subsidies of the armed
forces are inappropriate.
C.2. Contractual Agreements between
Stanford ROTC Students and the Army, Navy
and Air Force. In this section the committee
states its objections to certain terms contained in
the existing contracts between Stanford ROTC
students and the three military services. It is to
be understood that the Committee does not ob
ject to a student entering into a legal and private
contractual agreement as long as the terms of
said agreement are neither contrary to the aca
demic goals and standards of the university nor
encroachments upon the university's integrity as
an institution of higher learning.
The Committee heard substantial testimony
to the effect that there exists a considerable dif
ference between de facto practice and de jure
obligations. Specifically, it has been the practice
of the three services to terminate a four-year fin
ancial-assistance contract in the first two years
without penalty or prejudice. This has a mitiga
ting effect but leaves the legal provisions of the
contracts technically intact.
C.2.a. Academic Prescriptions. All
three services require certain specified courses of
study. By contract, the student must follow this
prescribed course of study. In addition, the
Navy financial assistant program specifically ex
cludes certain courses of study, and the Air
Force contracts for certain courses of study.
These restrictions and requirements conflict with
the Majority view that Stanford undergraduates
should not be found by law to take and complete
a course of study prescribed by some agent or
agency external to the University, when that
agency also determines (directly or indirectly)
the mode and content of instruction of all or
part of the prescribed course.
All three services require that ROTC cadets
meet certain academic standards. The Majority
believes that Stanford undergraduates should not
be bound by law to maintain academic standards
prescribed by an external agency, especially
when that agency also participates in determining
whether or not such standards have been met.

C.2.b. Personal Conduct. All three
services require that the cadet maintain certain
unspecified standards of personal and moral con
duct. The Majority feels that such restrictions
can seriously limit the student's free participa
tion in all facets of intellectual inquiry and legal
political activity. Furthermore, the Navy finan
cial assistance contract stipulates that the candi
date "remain unmarried until commissioned."
These standards too are established by an agency
external to the University, and judgments con
cerning them are made by the same agency.
While the Majority recognizes the special require
ments of the armed forces and could not object
to similar conditions in contracts between indi
vidual students and the military services when
not a part of a university program or activity, it
can and does object to such conditions when
they are a part of a University-subsidized and
sanctioned activity.
C.2.c. Punitive Clauses. All three ser
vices include in their financial assistance con
tracts clauses that bind the student to a period of
enlisted service for "willfully evading" stipulated
terms. Despite the fact that these clauses have
rarely been invoked at Stanford, the Majority
deems them clearly punitive in intent, and feels
that they unduly infringe the student's freedom
within the University community.
C.2.d. Contracts for Service. To our
knowledge, the ROTC contracts are the only
University-sponsored and sanctioned contracts
on the undergraduate level that bind a student to
service. There are various loan programs such as
the NDEA which allow teaching service to act in
lieu of repayments. Still, these loan programs do
not require service, since the loans can be repaid
with appropriate interest over a period of years.
The ROTC financial assistance grants have no
such provision.
The Majority wishes to point out that these
contractual restrictions and/or obligations oper
ate as a whole. The punitive clauses operate in
relation to academic standards requirements,
course of study requirements, conduct require
ments, and service requirements. The service obli
gation is intimately related to the course of study
requirements. It is this interlocking of contrac
tual requirements, restrictions, and obligations
that makes the whole much more objectionable
than each of its parts might suggest. The Univer
sity's rights and obligations to establish, main
tain, and judge its own standards of academics,
course of study, and student conduct is funda
mental to our conception of the university as
defined above.
D. Academic Objections.
In considering the academic aspects of the
problem, the Committee heard public testimony
that ROTC courses were of very high calibre. We
do not wish to contest this, though members of
the Committee have also heard informally and
confidentially that the contrary is also sometimes
the case. Whatever may be the truth of the mat
ter, the Majority's objections do not rest on these
grounds, but on the inherent goals of these
courses.
D.l Course Goals. Although in recent
years the Department of Defense instruction
plans for the ROTC programs have allowed Pro
fessors of Military Science increasing flexibility
in the choice of text materials and in course sub
stitution, the ultimate goals of these programs
are still fixed by the Department of Defense.
These goals are not compatible with the Univer
sity's "primary commitment to the creation and
dissemination of knowledge, in an environment
of free intellectual activity." The primary goal of
the ROTC programs is to educate, train, and eval
uate junior officers for the U.S. Armed Forces.
The Plan for NROTC Instructional Program
(Navpers 93941, May 1968) defines as "major
goals":
(1) To assist in the education of the
midshipman in a major field of study of interest
to the Navy or Marine Corps leading to a bacca
laureate degree.
(2) To provide the midshipman with
the fundamental concepts and principles of Naval
Science and with the professional Naval knowl
edge necessary to establish a sound basis for his
future growth as a Naval or Marine Corps officer.
(3) To prepare the midshipman for
service with the highest sense of honor and integ
rity as a commissioned officer; to cultivate the
essential elements of military leadership; to fos
ter the growth of a strong sense of loyalty and
dedication to his Service and to the Nation.
(4) To prepare the midshipman to
undertake successfully in later periods of his
career, advanced/continuing education in a field
of application and interest to the Naval Service.
(5) To inject the values of civilian
higher education into the Naval Service by utili
zing the expertise of civilian faculty instruction
where applicable. (Italics ours)
The Army Program of Instruction states that the
objectives of ROTC are "to procure and produce
junior officers who by education, training, atti
tude and inherent qualities are suitable for con
tinued development as officers in the Army."
And the Air Force ROTC mission "is to commis
sion career-oriented second lieutenants in res
ponse to Air Force requirements" by successfully
accomplishing the following four objectives:
(1) Identify, motivate, and select
qualified students to complete the Air Force
ROTC program.
(2) Provide college-level education
that will qualify cadets for commissioning in the
U.S. Air Force.
(3) Heighten each cadet's apprecia
tion of, and dedication to, American principles,
give him an understanding of how the Air Force
serves the national interest, and develop his po
tential as a leader and manager and his under
standing of officer professionalism in the Air
Force.
(4) Commission in the U.S. Air
Force high quality second lieutenants. (Italics
ours)
The goals of these programs are clearly non
academic in nature. Given the goals of these pro
grams as defined above, Military Science instruc
tors are legally and ethically obligated to present
their course material from restricted points of
view, to evaluate the student's fitness for a mili
tary career partly on these grounds, and to report
this evaluation to higher authorities.
Since the goals of the ROTC Programs are to
educate potential officers, much of the current
Military Science course content—weapons sys
tems, small-unit tactics, Army administration, or
ientation, counter-insurgency, etc.—is of such a
narrowly pragmatic, professional nature as to be
incompatible with an undergraduate academic
credit program. Although the Minority Report's
proposed Committee on Military Studies might
deny academic credit to some of these "nuts and
bolts" courses, others might remain in the credit
program. And indeed, one might question
whether any course with the goals outlined above
merits inclusion in Stanford's academic credit
structure. Although knowledge is disseminated in
ROTC courses, it is rarely created in an environ
ment of free intellectual activity; and it is dissem
inated to the end that committed junior officers

to enter the U.S. Armed Forces. The Military
Science Programs' lack of awareness of what we
believe to be the primary commitment of the
University is further evidenced in their equation
of the "values of civilian higher education" with
the "expertise of civilian faculty where applic
able." (NROTC Goals No. 5)
D.2. Course Substitution. The substitu
tion of courses in regular academic departments
for courses presently taught by the ROTC fac
ulty (particularly U.S. military history and U.S.
foreign policy) has been frequently suggested.
This has some attractive features, but these
should not blind one to the problems it also en
tails.
D.2.a. Such courses would have to
meet the goals set forth by the armed forces.
Senior ROTC faculty are being granted wide lati
tude in determining whether or not goals are
being met by a particular course, but it is never
theless true that the scope, coverage, and content
of such courses will be under periodic review by
the military establishment.
D.2.b. If such a course is built into
the ROTC curriculum and required of all cadets,
then the presumption exists that the course will
meet the needs of the ROTC in scope, coverage,
approach, and frequency of offering. TTie faculty
member will have to take these considerations
into account in planning course changes, leave
periods, etc. If such a required course fails for
any reason to meet ROTC needs, the ROTC must
reassume part or all of the instruction in that
area, or drop the requirement. But then course
substitution is either lost or was unnecessary in
the first place.
D.2.C. If such a course is to be op
tional for ROTC cadets, then some other options
must be available. This presumes one of three
things: (a) that other equivalent courses are avail
able in the academic departments, (b) that the
ROTC faculty provide the equivalent, or (c) that
cadets need not receive training in that particular
area. The revised ROTC instructional programs
seem to rule out the last; normal University prac
tice makes the first unlikely. Thus, here too, the
advantages of course substitution may be lost.
Finally, it should be noted that it will be difficult
to ensure that the course is in fact "optional." If
other options are limited, and if cadets are
"strongly urged" to enroll in a particular course,
is that course truly optional?
D.2.d. Course substitution will in
crease both the direct and indirect subsidy of
Stanford to the ROTC by assuming part of the
training of ROTC cadets (see below). It will add
to the work of the academic department and the
individual faculty member by the number of stu
dents who would not otherwise have enrolled in
his course (this could, for example, require addi
tional expenditures for T.A.'s, readers, etc.). The
call upon the resources of the ROTC programs
will be correspondingly lightened.
D.3. Departmental Status. An academic
department shares much the same definition as
the institution of which it is a part, with particu
lar reference to a specific area and/or discipline.
When a student has demonstrated a certain com
petence in this area or discipline, he is recom
mended for a degree, either at the undergraduate
or graduate level. The Departments of Military
Science do not do this at either level; rather, they
offer commissions in the Armed Forces to the
men who successfully complete their programs.
Unlike other departments or schools in the Uni
versity, the ROTC Departments are educating
young men not to academic ends but to work for
a specific employer in a specific area.
The Minority recommends combining the
three ROTC Departments into a single Depart
ment of Military Studies, no longer to be lodged
in the School of Humanities and Sciences but to
be responsible to the Provost via a Committee on
Military Studies. The Majority believes this is a
recognition of the anomalous nature of such a
department, which has neither undergraduate nor
graduate majors and serves non-academic ends.
D.4. Faculty Search and Appointment.
The Military Science Departments' faculty is ap
pointed in an irregular way. The appointment
procedure for Military Science personnel by
passes both department-initiated search and eval
uation, and the normal administrative ratification
process. Whenever a position becomes vacant, the
appropriate branch of the Armed Services pre
sents nominations for the position to the Pro
vost's Office. The administration may veto any
military nominations. (It has done so at least
three times.) The nominee's military record and
college transcripts are examined and, whenever
possible, a personal interview is held. Though
ROTC faculty are presently members of the Aca
demic Council, they are not subject to the usual
University policy on tenure, for the Defense De
partment agrees to recall them immediately at
the request of the administration. (Stanford has
exercised this option once in recent years.) Fur
thermore, the Department of Defense reserves
the right to transfer from Stanford any assigned
military personnel. Thus, under present arrange
ments, an external organization may unilaterally
remove a member of the Stanford faculty.
This irregular appointment and retention pro
cedure violates the principle that the primary re
sponsibility for faculty appointment and status
rests with the Stanford faculty and administra
tion. Secondly, it creates a special class of faculty
members having some characteristics not shared
by the regular faculty and lacking others.
Thirdly, since Stanford cannot initiate the search
nor fully supervise the screening process, the Uni
versity loses some degree of control over the
quality of the ROTC faculty. These irregular fea
tures would continue, even under revised proced
ures.
IV. Objections to ROTC as An Organized, Non
credit, On-Campus Program
The previous section reviews our objections,
both general and specific, to ROTC as an aca
demic program at Stanford. Having come to this
point, the Majority gave serious consideration to
retention of ROTC on campus as an organized,
non-credit program of education and training. We
believe such an arrangement may be an improve
ment over both the present situation and the rec
ommendations of the Minority. But it is the con
viction of the Majority that the logic of the gen
eral objections must apply generally to the rela
tions between ROTC and Stanford. To recom
mend termination of academic credit and reten
tion of non-credit ROTC programs is to accept
the argument with respect to the former but fail
to apply it to the latter. We here recapitulate
those considerations with reference to ROTC as
an on-campus, non-credit program of training
and education.
A. What has been termed "conflict of inter
est" would continue, since ROTC would remain
the corporate representation of the armed forces
within the structure of the University, staffed by
professional military officers. If ROTC is re
tained as a non-credit program, several opera
tional problems will grow directly out of the fact

that ROTC will remain in the University but not
of the University. Any solution of these prob
lems will constitute recognition of the anomalous
nature of the arrangement.
1. Would the ROTC programs, singly or
collectively, continue as "Department(s)?" If
not, what status should they have? On what
grounds would such a decision be made?
2. The same questions apply to the status
of ROTC faculty. Shall formal academic rank be
accorded, as presently required by law? To
whom, at what level, and on what grounds?
3. How shall the University handle search
and appointment procedures for persons offering
no accredited work, but who present courses re
quired of a certain proportion of the student
body?
4. How shall the University oversee the
content and mode of instruction in these non
credit but required courses?
B. The primary goal of the ROTC programs
would remain, as before, the recruitment and
training of junior officers. Thus, specific training
for employment by an outside organization, car
ried on by members of that organization, would
continue.
C. Institutional contracts would remain,
though perhaps in a modified form. Thus, dispro
portionate subsidization of the military at Stan
ford would continue: direct subsidies in the form
of facilities, services, etc.; indirect subsidies in
the form of course substitution, etc.
D. Individual contracts, requiring participa
tion in ROTC training programs on-campus by
signatories, would continue. It is here not the
existence of such contracts that is objected to;
rather it is to the institutional sanction and sup
port given these contracts by Stanford Univer
sity.
V. Recommendations
Thus far the Majority has emphasized those
aspects of the present ROTC which make them
objectionable to the point of incompatibility
with the University. We believe such analysis,
while lengthy and complex, is necessary when
ever a significant change is recommended for an
on-going academic program. Also required is
some projection of the nature and structure of
the revised program. That is, having dealt with
objections in the relationship between Stanford
and the ROTC departments, what is considered
to be the proper relationship?
It should be noted, first, that no accurate pro
jection can be made because it is not known
what limits the Department of Defense has for its
junior officer procurement program. We cannot
predict what will be acceptable to the military
services beyond existing operational and legal
constraints.
Secondly, the Majority believes the issue of
proper relations is confused by excessive reliance
on the term "ROTC." The Majority has empha
sized the distinction between ROTC as a mech
anism and the objectives which ROTC serves.
Our arguments have been directed to the mech
anism, not the objectives or purposes. Misinter
pretation arises if this distinction is obscured. If
the language of the Senate's charge is taken to
mean that "ROTC" denotes an organized on
campus program of eduation and training, then
the Majority is compelled to state there can be
no "proper relations between the ROTC depart
ments and Stanford." This, in turn, can mis
takenly be construed to mean that the Majority
believes no proper relations can be established
between the objectives served by the existing de
partments and Stanford.
It is likely that the program which we recom
mend would not and should not be denoted as
"ROTC." This is accurate insofar as the program
has been substantially altered and does not con
form to present programs of ROTC. But any new
denotation should not be interpreted to mean
that we have sought to abolish all relations be
tween Stanford and the purposes of the existing
ROTC programs or that we have concluded that
no proper relations can be established. Rather we
believe that for proper relations to exist, a new
mechanism must be created —one that differs
from the present program, but can still serve the
same purposes in such a way as to be compatible
with the University.
We envision relations whereby each service of
the armed forces would assign personnel to
manage an administrative apparatus, with space
provided possibly in the Dean of Students' Office
of Special Services, that would concern itself
with recruitment of students into the program,
process the revised student contracts and scholar
ships, offer professional counseling and informa
tion to individuals as well as to the existing stu
dent voluntary groups representative of the three
services on campus. Further, this Armed Forces
Officers Program would arrange with enrolled
students for off-campus training and education.
We believe that all education presently offered
by the ROTC departments could be transferred
to extended summer encampments. The military
personnel on campus would be free to offer vol
untary undergraduate special courses, as are
other members of the Stanford community, fol
lowing the guidelines established by the Commit
tee on Undergraduate Education.
To these ends, we recommend the following:
1. After a transitional period (see recom
mendation 5 below), there should be no aca
demic credit received for participation in pro
grams of military training and education.
2. By the end of this period, non-credit,
required military training and education should
no longer be offered on the Stanford campus.
Consistent with these recommendations, a
scholarship or contract "program" may remain,
comprising normal academic education, supple
mented by on-campus voluntary activities and
off-campus training.
3. By the end of this period, all remaining
military programs or activities should be regu
lated by the University's general policies on Stan
ford Voluntary Organizations. No Stanford fac
ulty member or administrator, acting as a spokes
man for the University, shall encourage students
to participate in military training and education,
except in the manner in which participation in all
voluntary activities is encouraged.
4. Individual contracts between Stanford
students and the armed forces should be revised
to reflect actual practice. We recommend further
that punitive clauses involving enlisted service be
removed.
5. These provisions should be in force by
the fall term 1973. Beginning with the fall term
1970, no entering freshman shall be granted aca
demic credit for ROTC activities. The three
ROTC departments should be replaced by a sin
gle Armed Forces Officers Program no later than
fall term 1973. This program shall be for the
purposes of administration, counseling, and re
cruiting for off-campus reserve officer training
and education. (N.B. Because present institu
tional contracts specify one year's notice prior to
termination, the phase-out process cannot begin
before 1970.)
6. Appropriate University authorities
should promptly initiate action leading to re
vision or termination of the contracts between
Stanford and the armed forces (a) in order to
enable the phase-out to begin in 1970, and (b) in
order to reflect the voluntary, non-credit status
of military training at Stanford. We further rec
ommend that a committee be appointed, com
posed of representatives of faculty, administra
tion, military science department, and students,
to assist in effecting the transition.
7. During the transitional period, we rec
ommend that the status of officers presently at
tached to ROTC units remain unchanged. Until
the fall term 1973, newly assigned officers shall
carry the rank of "Lecturer," except for the
newly assigned senior officers of each branch of
the armed forces, who shall carry the rank of
"Lecturer with rank of Professor." After the be
ginning of the 1973-74 academic year, represen
tatives of the armed forces at Stanford shall carry
no academic rank. Similarly until this time, the
departmental and administrative structure of the
ROTC program shall remain as at present.
8. Students already enrolled in ROTC pro
grams, and those enrolling prior to the fall term
1970, shall continue as at present, except that
present contracts should be revised in accord
with recommendation 4.

because our charge as a committee limits us to
these programs.
The Majority believes that there are both gen
eral and specific objections which will continue
to exist as long as ROTC is a program integral to
the institutional structure of the University.
A. Conflict of Interest. The ROTC faculty,
being detailed to Stanford on a limited tour of
duty, remain professional military officers who
legally and ethically owe primary loyalty to the
branch of the service they represent, to the
armed forces, and to the U.S. government. This
means that, however high their integrity and
quality of mind, they cannot at the same time
have a primary commitment either to Stanford
University or to the academic enterprise. This
dual identity should be recognized as a conflict
of interest. The government itself recognizes very
clearly the potential peril of conflict-of-interest
situations, and rightly expects public servants
scrupulously to avoid them. It should be noted
that neither the government's position nor ours
rests upon the fact or even the presumption of
improper behavior.
Because this consideration applies to all mili
tary members of the ROTC, it therefore applies
by extension to the ROTC programs themselves.
These programs, as corporate entities—present
H&S departments—are themselves in a potential
conflict-of-interest situation with respect to the
University.
We recognize that other instances of conflict
of interest are by no means rare in the university;
these too are unfortunate. But they are individ
ual rather than collective, and they are character
ized, in nearly all cases, by a primary commit
ment to the University (note that the University
limits outside activities to an average of one day
per week).
B. Training for a specific employer, by that
employer. The ROTC programs represent the
corporate, institutional presence of an external
organization, which engages in specific training
of candidates for temporary or permanent em
ploy by that organization. The issue raised here is
not simply that of professional or pre-profes
sional training, but of such training carried on
by the armed forces, in the interests of the armed
forces. The Majority believes that such training
should not be a part of the academic structure of
the University.
C. Contractual Arrangements. The objection
able features of the present contracts can be con
sidered under two headings: contractual arrange
ments between the armed forces and Stanford
University, and between the armed forces and
individual students. While some of these arrange
ments may be subject to change, others would
not. Some are specified by the Vitalization Act
of 1964 and could not be changed except
through action by Congress.
C.l. Institutional Contracts. The contracts
between Stanford and the various military ser
vices provide for government commitment of an
academic and administrative staff, an instruc
tional program, government equipment, staff
salaries, and student financial assistance. In re
turn the University agrees to the establishment of
military science department, provision of class
rooms, offices and drill areas, appropriate aca
demic credit for military science courses, and a
minimum sustaining enrollment and output of
officers. In the case of the Army, representation
on all faculty committees whose recommenda
tions would directly affect the Department of
Military Science is stipulated. These contracts
further provide for prior approval and right of
dismissal by Stanford of all military officers as
signed to the department, assignment of the rank
of professor to the senior commissioned officer
of each service assigned to the institution and
lesser academic rank to other members of the
staffs, and the right of the Secretary of the mili
tary service involved to relieve from duty any
officer or enlisted man assigned to work at Stan
ford. These terms represent a partial abdication
of University control over the governance of its
own affairs.
It should be recognized that these arrange
ments result in a Stanford subsidy to the ROTC
programs. Stanford is obliged to provide facili
ties, services, and financial support to the ROTC
programs on a cost-free basis. For example, the
Air Force contract stipulates that Stanford pro
vide:
(1) "the necessary classrooms, administra
tive offices, storage spaces, government
vehicle parking areas, staff parking
areas and other required facilities in
the same manner and at the same level
as is provided to other Departments of
the Institution."
(2) "adequate secretarial, janitorial, and
telephone services ... on the same
basis as is provided to other Depart
ments within the Institution."
An increase in course substitution (see below
D.2.) .while desirable in some ways, will increase
the subsidy by relieving the ROTC programs of
that part of their instructional requirements. In
the Majority's view, such subsidies of the armed
forces are inappropriate.
C.2. Contractual Agreements between
Stanford ROTC Students and the Army, Navy
and Air Force. In this section the committee
states its objections to certain terms contained in
the existing contracts between Stanford ROTC
students and the three military services. It is to
be understood that the Committee does not ob
ject to a student entering into a legal and private
contractual agreement as long as the terms of
said agreement are neither contrary to the aca
demic goals and standards of the university nor
encroachments upon the university's integrity as
an institution of higher learning.
The Committee heard substantial testimony
to the effect that there exists a considerable dif
ference between de facto practice and de jure
obligations. Specifically, it has been the practice
of the three services to terminate a four-year fin
ancial-assistance contract in the first two years
without penalty or prejudice. This has a mitiga
ting effect but leaves the legal provisions of the
contracts technically intact.
C.2.a. Academic Prescriptions. All
three services require certain specified courses of
study. By contract, the student must follow this
prescribed course of study. In addition, the
Navy financial assistant program specifically ex
cludes certain courses of study, and the Air
Force contracts for certain courses of study.
These restrictions and requirements conflict with
the Majority view that Stanford undergraduates
should not be found by law to take and complete
a course of study prescribed by some agent or
agency external to the University, when that
agency also determines (directly or indirectly)
the mode and content of instruction of all or
part of the prescribed course.
All three services require that ROTC cadets
meet certain academic standards. The Majority
believes that Stanford undergraduates should not
be bound by law to maintain academic standards
prescribed by an external agency, especially
when that agency also participates in determining
whether or not such standards have been met.

C.2.b. Personal Conduct. All three
services require that the cadet maintain certain
unspecified standards of personal and moral con
duct. The Majority feels that such restrictions
can seriously limit the student's free participa
tion in all facets of intellectual inquiry and legal
political activity. Furthermore, the Navy finan
cial assistance contract stipulates that the candi
date "remain unmarried until commissioned."
These standards too are established by an agency
external to the University, and judgments con
cerning them are made by the same agency.
While the Majority recognizes the special require
ments of the armed forces and could not object
to similar conditions in contracts between indi
vidual students and the military services when
not a part of a university program or activity, it
can and does object to such conditions when
they are a part of a University-subsidized and
sanctioned activity.
C.2.c. Punitive Clauses. All three ser
vices include in their financial assistance con
tracts clauses that bind the student to a period of
enlisted service for "willfully evading" stipulated
terms. Despite the fact that these clauses have
rarely been invoked at Stanford, the Majority
deems them clearly punitive in intent, and feels
that they unduly infringe the student's freedom
within the University community.
C.2.d. Contracts for Service. To our
knowledge, the ROTC contracts are the only
University-sponsored and sanctioned contracts
on the undergraduate level that bind a student to
service. There are various loan programs such as
the NDEA which allow teaching service to act in
lieu of repayments. Still, these loan programs do
not require service, since the loans can be repaid
with appropriate interest over a period of years.
The ROTC financial assistance grants have no
such provision.
The Majority wishes to point out that these
contractual restrictions and/or obligations oper
ate as a whole. The punitive clauses operate in
relation to academic standards requirements,
course of study requirements, conduct require
ments, and service requirements. The service obli
gation is intimately related to the course of study
requirements. It is this interlocking of contrac
tual requirements, restrictions, and obligations
that makes the whole much more objectionable
than each of its parts might suggest. The Univer
sity's rights and obligations to establish, main
tain, and judge its own standards of academics,
course of study, and student conduct is funda
mental to our conception of the university as
defined above.
D. Academic Objections.
In considering the academic aspects of the
problem, the Committee heard public testimony
that ROTC courses were of very high calibre. We
do not wish to contest this, though members of
the Committee have also heard informally and
confidentially that the contrary is also sometimes
the case. Whatever may be the truth of the mat
ter, the Majority's objections do not rest on these
grounds, but on the inherent goals of these
courses.
D.l Course Goals. Although in recent
years the Department of Defense instruction
plans for the ROTC programs have allowed Pro
fessors of Military Science increasing flexibility
in the choice of text materials and in course sub
stitution, the ultimate goals of these programs
are still fixed by the Department of Defense.
These goals are not compatible with the Univer
sity's "primary commitment to the creation and
dissemination of knowledge, in an environment
of free intellectual activity." The primary goal of
the ROTC programs is to educate, train, and eval
uate junior officers for the U.S. Armed Forces.
The Plan for NROTC Instructional Program
(Navpers 93941, May 1968) defines as "major
goals":
(1) To assist in the education of the
midshipman in a major field of study of interest
to the Navy or Marine Corps leading to a bacca
laureate degree.
(2) To provide the midshipman with
the fundamental concepts and principles of Naval
Science and with the professional Naval knowl
edge necessary to establish a sound basis for his
future growth as a Naval or Marine Corps officer.
(3) To prepare the midshipman for
service with the highest sense of honor and integ
rity as a commissioned officer; to cultivate the
essential elements of military leadership; to fos
ter the growth of a strong sense of loyalty and
dedication to his Service and to the Nation.
(4) To prepare the midshipman to
undertake successfully in later periods of his
career, advanced/continuing education in a field
of application and interest to the Naval Service.
(5) To inject the values of civilian
higher education into the Naval Service by utili
zing the expertise of civilian faculty instruction
where applicable. (Italics ours)
The Army Program of Instruction states that the
objectives of ROTC are "to procure and produce
junior officers who by education, training, atti
tude and inherent qualities are suitable for con
tinued development as officers in the Army."
And the Air Force ROTC mission "is to commis
sion career-oriented second lieutenants in res
ponse to Air Force requirements" by successfully
accomplishing the following four objectives:
(1) Identify, motivate, and select
qualified students to complete the Air Force
ROTC program.
(2) Provide college-level education
that will qualify cadets for commissioning in the
U.S. Air Force.
(3) Heighten each cadet's apprecia
tion of, and dedication to, American principles,
give him an understanding of how the Air Force
serves the national interest, and develop his po
tential as a leader and manager and his under
standing of officer professionalism in the Air
Force.
(4) Commission in the U.S. Air
Force high quality second lieutenants. (Italics
ours)
The goals of these programs are clearly non
academic in nature. Given the goals of these pro
grams as defined above, Military Science instruc
tors are legally and ethically obligated to present
their course material from restricted points of
view, to evaluate the student's fitness for a mili
tary career partly on these grounds, and to report
this evaluation to higher authorities.
Since the goals of the ROTC Programs are to
educate potential officers, much of the current
Military Science course content—weapons sys
tems, small-unit tactics, Army administration, or
ientation, counter-insurgency, etc.—is of such a
narrowly pragmatic, professional nature as to be
incompatible with an undergraduate academic
credit program. Although the Minority Report's
proposed Committee on Military Studies might
deny academic credit to some of these "nuts and
bolts" courses, others might remain in the credit
program. And indeed, one might question
whether any course with the goals outlined above
merits inclusion in Stanford's academic credit
structure. Although knowledge is disseminated in
ROTC courses, it is rarely created in an environ
ment of free intellectual activity; and it is dissem
inated to the end that committed junior officers

to enter the U.S. Armed Forces. The Military
Science Programs' lack of awareness of what we
believe to be the primary commitment of the
University is further evidenced in their equation
of the "values of civilian higher education" with
the "expertise of civilian faculty where applic
able." (NROTC Goals No. 5)
D.2. Course Substitution. The substitu
tion of courses in regular academic departments
for courses presently taught by the ROTC fac
ulty (particularly U.S. military history and U.S.
foreign policy) has been frequently suggested.
This has some attractive features, but these
should not blind one to the problems it also en
tails.
D.2.a. Such courses would have to
meet the goals set forth by the armed forces.
Senior ROTC faculty are being granted wide lati
tude in determining whether or not goals are
being met by a particular course, but it is never
theless true that the scope, coverage, and content
of such courses will be under periodic review by
the military establishment.
D.2.b. If such a course is built into
the ROTC curriculum and required of all cadets,
then the presumption exists that the course will
meet the needs of the ROTC in scope, coverage,
approach, and frequency of offering. TTie faculty
member will have to take these considerations
into account in planning course changes, leave
periods, etc. If such a required course fails for
any reason to meet ROTC needs, the ROTC must
reassume part or all of the instruction in that
area, or drop the requirement. But then course
substitution is either lost or was unnecessary in
the first place.
D.2.C. If such a course is to be op
tional for ROTC cadets, then some other options
must be available. This presumes one of three
things: (a) that other equivalent courses are avail
able in the academic departments, (b) that the
ROTC faculty provide the equivalent, or (c) that
cadets need not receive training in that particular
area. The revised ROTC instructional programs
seem to rule out the last; normal University prac
tice makes the first unlikely. Thus, here too, the
advantages of course substitution may be lost.
Finally, it should be noted that it will be difficult
to ensure that the course is in fact "optional." If
other options are limited, and if cadets are
"strongly urged" to enroll in a particular course,
is that course truly optional?
D.2.d. Course substitution will in
crease both the direct and indirect subsidy of
Stanford to the ROTC by assuming part of the
training of ROTC cadets (see below). It will add
to the work of the academic department and the
individual faculty member by the number of stu
dents who would not otherwise have enrolled in
his course (this could, for example, require addi
tional expenditures for T.A.'s, readers, etc.). The
call upon the resources of the ROTC programs
will be correspondingly lightened.
D.3. Departmental Status. An academic
department shares much the same definition as
the institution of which it is a part, with particu
lar reference to a specific area and/or discipline.
When a student has demonstrated a certain com
petence in this area or discipline, he is recom
mended for a degree, either at the undergraduate
or graduate level. The Departments of Military
Science do not do this at either level; rather, they
offer commissions in the Armed Forces to the
men who successfully complete their programs.
Unlike other departments or schools in the Uni
versity, the ROTC Departments are educating
young men not to academic ends but to work for
a specific employer in a specific area.
The Minority recommends combining the
three ROTC Departments into a single Depart
ment of Military Studies, no longer to be lodged
in the School of Humanities and Sciences but to
be responsible to the Provost via a Committee on
Military Studies. The Majority believes this is a
recognition of the anomalous nature of such a
department, which has neither undergraduate nor
graduate majors and serves non-academic ends.
D.4. Faculty Search and Appointment.
The Military Science Departments' faculty is ap
pointed in an irregular way. The appointment
procedure for Military Science personnel by
passes both department-initiated search and eval
uation, and the normal administrative ratification
process. Whenever a position becomes vacant, the
appropriate branch of the Armed Services pre
sents nominations for the position to the Pro
vost's Office. The administration may veto any
military nominations. (It has done so at least
three times.) The nominee's military record and
college transcripts are examined and, whenever
possible, a personal interview is held. Though
ROTC faculty are presently members of the Aca
demic Council, they are not subject to the usual
University policy on tenure, for the Defense De
partment agrees to recall them immediately at
the request of the administration. (Stanford has
exercised this option once in recent years.) Fur
thermore, the Department of Defense reserves
the right to transfer from Stanford any assigned
military personnel. Thus, under present arrange
ments, an external organization may unilaterally
remove a member of the Stanford faculty.
This irregular appointment and retention pro
cedure violates the principle that the primary re
sponsibility for faculty appointment and status
rests with the Stanford faculty and administra
tion. Secondly, it creates a special class of faculty
members having some characteristics not shared
by the regular faculty and lacking others.
Thirdly, since Stanford cannot initiate the search
nor fully supervise the screening process, the Uni
versity loses some degree of control over the
quality of the ROTC faculty. These irregular fea
tures would continue, even under revised proced
ures.
IV. Objections to ROTC as An Organized, Non
credit, On-Campus Program
The previous section reviews our objections,
both general and specific, to ROTC as an aca
demic program at Stanford. Having come to this
point, the Majority gave serious consideration to
retention of ROTC on campus as an organized,
non-credit program of education and training. We
believe such an arrangement may be an improve
ment over both the present situation and the rec
ommendations of the Minority. But it is the con
viction of the Majority that the logic of the gen
eral objections must apply generally to the rela
tions between ROTC and Stanford. To recom
mend termination of academic credit and reten
tion of non-credit ROTC programs is to accept
the argument with respect to the former but fail
to apply it to the latter. We here recapitulate
those considerations with reference to ROTC as
an on-campus, non-credit program of training
and education.
A. What has been termed "conflict of inter
est" would continue, since ROTC would remain
the corporate representation of the armed forces
within the structure of the University, staffed by
professional military officers. If ROTC is re
tained as a non-credit program, several opera
tional problems will grow directly out of the fact

that ROTC will remain in the University but not
of the University. Any solution of these prob
lems will constitute recognition of the anomalous
nature of the arrangement.
1. Would the ROTC programs, singly or
collectively, continue as "Department(s)?" If
not, what status should they have? On what
grounds would such a decision be made?
2. The same questions apply to the status
of ROTC faculty. Shall formal academic rank be
accorded, as presently required by law? To
whom, at what level, and on what grounds?
3. How shall the University handle search
and appointment procedures for persons offering
no accredited work, but who present courses re
quired of a certain proportion of the student
body?
4. How shall the University oversee the
content and mode of instruction in these non
credit but required courses?
B. The primary goal of the ROTC programs
would remain, as before, the recruitment and
training of junior officers. Thus, specific training
for employment by an outside organization, car
ried on by members of that organization, would
continue.
C. Institutional contracts would remain,
though perhaps in a modified form. Thus, dispro
portionate subsidization of the military at Stan
ford would continue: direct subsidies in the form
of facilities, services, etc.; indirect subsidies in
the form of course substitution, etc.
D. Individual contracts, requiring participa
tion in ROTC training programs on-campus by
signatories, would continue. It is here not the
existence of such contracts that is objected to;
rather it is to the institutional sanction and sup
port given these contracts by Stanford Univer
sity.
V. Recommendations
Thus far the Majority has emphasized those
aspects of the present ROTC which make them
objectionable to the point of incompatibility
with the University. We believe such analysis,
while lengthy and complex, is necessary when
ever a significant change is recommended for an
on-going academic program. Also required is
some projection of the nature and structure of
the revised program. That is, having dealt with
objections in the relationship between Stanford
and the ROTC departments, what is considered
to be the proper relationship?
It should be noted, first, that no accurate pro
jection can be made because it is not known
what limits the Department of Defense has for its
junior officer procurement program. We cannot
predict what will be acceptable to the military
services beyond existing operational and legal
constraints.
Secondly, the Majority believes the issue of
proper relations is confused by excessive reliance
on the term "ROTC." The Majority has empha
sized the distinction between ROTC as a mech
anism and the objectives which ROTC serves.
Our arguments have been directed to the mech
anism, not the objectives or purposes. Misinter
pretation arises if this distinction is obscured. If
the language of the Senate's charge is taken to
mean that "ROTC" denotes an organized on
campus program of eduation and training, then
the Majority is compelled to state there can be
no "proper relations between the ROTC depart
ments and Stanford." This, in turn, can mis
takenly be construed to mean that the Majority
believes no proper relations can be established
between the objectives served by the existing de
partments and Stanford.
It is likely that the program which we recom
mend would not and should not be denoted as
"ROTC." This is accurate insofar as the program
has been substantially altered and does not con
form to present programs of ROTC. But any new
denotation should not be interpreted to mean
that we have sought to abolish all relations be
tween Stanford and the purposes of the existing
ROTC programs or that we have concluded that
no proper relations can be established. Rather we
believe that for proper relations to exist, a new
mechanism must be created —one that differs
from the present program, but can still serve the
same purposes in such a way as to be compatible
with the University.
We envision relations whereby each service of
the armed forces would assign personnel to
manage an administrative apparatus, with space
provided possibly in the Dean of Students' Office
of Special Services, that would concern itself
with recruitment of students into the program,
process the revised student contracts and scholar
ships, offer professional counseling and informa
tion to individuals as well as to the existing stu
dent voluntary groups representative of the three
services on campus. Further, this Armed Forces
Officers Program would arrange with enrolled
students for off-campus training and education.
We believe that all education presently offered
by the ROTC departments could be transferred
to extended summer encampments. The military
personnel on campus would be free to offer vol
untary undergraduate special courses, as are
other members of the Stanford community, fol
lowing the guidelines established by the Commit
tee on Undergraduate Education.
To these ends, we recommend the following:
1. After a transitional period (see recom
mendation 5 below), there should be no aca
demic credit received for participation in pro
grams of military training and education.
2. By the end of this period, non-credit,
required military training and education should
no longer be offered on the Stanford campus.
Consistent with these recommendations, a
scholarship or contract "program" may remain,
comprising normal academic education, supple
mented by on-campus voluntary activities and
off-campus training.
3. By the end of this period, all remaining
military programs or activities should be regu
lated by the University's general policies on Stan
ford Voluntary Organizations. No Stanford fac
ulty member or administrator, acting as a spokes
man for the University, shall encourage students
to participate in military training and education,
except in the manner in which participation in all
voluntary activities is encouraged.
4. Individual contracts between Stanford
students and the armed forces should be revised
to reflect actual practice. We recommend further
that punitive clauses involving enlisted service be
removed.
5. These provisions should be in force by
the fall term 1973. Beginning with the fall term
1970, no entering freshman shall be granted aca
demic credit for ROTC activities. The three
ROTC departments should be replaced by a sin
gle Armed Forces Officers Program no later than
fall term 1973. This program shall be for the
purposes of administration, counseling, and re
cruiting for off-campus reserve officer training
and education. (N.B. Because present institu
tional contracts specify one year's notice prior to
termination, the phase-out process cannot begin
before 1970.)
6. Appropriate University authorities
should promptly initiate action leading to re
vision or termination of the contracts between
Stanford and the armed forces (a) in order to
enable the phase-out to begin in 1970, and (b) in
order to reflect the voluntary, non-credit status
of military training at Stanford. We further rec
ommend that a committee be appointed, com
posed of representatives of faculty, administra
tion, military science department, and students,
to assist in effecting the transition.
7. During the transitional period, we rec
ommend that the status of officers presently at
tached to ROTC units remain unchanged. Until
the fall term 1973, newly assigned officers shall
carry the rank of "Lecturer," except for the
newly assigned senior officers of each branch of
the armed forces, who shall carry the rank of
"Lecturer with rank of Professor." After the be
ginning of the 1973-74 academic year, represen
tatives of the armed forces at Stanford shall carry
no academic rank. Similarly until this time, the
departmental and administrative structure of the
ROTC program shall remain as at present.
8. Students already enrolled in ROTC pro
grams, and those enrolling prior to the fall term
1970, shall continue as at present, except that
present contracts should be revised in accord
with recommendation 4.

because our charge as a committee limits us to
these programs.
The Majority believes that there are both gen
eral and specific objections which will continue
to exist as long as ROTC is a program integral to
the institutional structure of the University.
A. Conflict of Interest. The ROTC faculty,
being detailed to Stanford on a limited tour of
duty, remain professional military officers who
legally and ethically owe primary loyalty to the
branch of the service they represent, to the
armed forces, and to the U.S. government. This
means that, however high their integrity and
quality of mind, they cannot at the same time
have a primary commitment either to Stanford
University or to the academic enterprise. This
dual identity should be recognized as a conflict
of interest. The government itself recognizes very
clearly the potential peril of conflict-of-interest
situations, and rightly expects public servants
scrupulously to avoid them. It should be noted
that neither the government's position nor ours
rests upon the fact or even the presumption of
improper behavior.
Because this consideration applies to all mili
tary members of the ROTC, it therefore applies
by extension to the ROTC programs themselves.
These programs, as corporate entities—present
H&S departments—are themselves in a potential
conflict-of-interest situation with respect to the
University.
We recognize that other instances of conflict
of interest are by no means rare in the university;
these too are unfortunate. But they are individ
ual rather than collective, and they are character
ized, in nearly all cases, by a primary commit
ment to the University (note that the University
limits outside activities to an average of one day
per week).
B. Training for a specific employer, by that
employer. The ROTC programs represent the
corporate, institutional presence of an external
organization, which engages in specific training
of candidates for temporary or permanent em
ploy by that organization. The issue raised here is
not simply that of professional or pre-profes
sional training, but of such training carried on
by the armed forces, in the interests of the armed
forces. The Majority believes that such training
should not be a part of the academic structure of
the University.
C. Contractual Arrangements. The objection
able features of the present contracts can be con
sidered under two headings: contractual arrange
ments between the armed forces and Stanford
University, and between the armed forces and
individual students. While some of these arrange
ments may be subject to change, others would
not. Some are specified by the Vitalization Act
of 1964 and could not be changed except
through action by Congress.
C.l. Institutional Contracts. The contracts
between Stanford and the various military ser
vices provide for government commitment of an
academic and administrative staff, an instruc
tional program, government equipment, staff
salaries, and student financial assistance. In re
turn the University agrees to the establishment of
military science department, provision of class
rooms, offices and drill areas, appropriate aca
demic credit for military science courses, and a
minimum sustaining enrollment and output of
officers. In the case of the Army, representation
on all faculty committees whose recommenda
tions would directly affect the Department of
Military Science is stipulated. These contracts
further provide for prior approval and right of
dismissal by Stanford of all military officers as
signed to the department, assignment of the rank
of professor to the senior commissioned officer
of each service assigned to the institution and
lesser academic rank to other members of the
staffs, and the right of the Secretary of the mili
tary service involved to relieve from duty any
officer or enlisted man assigned to work at Stan
ford. These terms represent a partial abdication
of University control over the governance of its
own affairs.
It should be recognized that these arrange
ments result in a Stanford subsidy to the ROTC
programs. Stanford is obliged to provide facili
ties, services, and financial support to the ROTC
programs on a cost-free basis. For example, the
Air Force contract stipulates that Stanford pro
vide:
(1) "the necessary classrooms, administra
tive offices, storage spaces, government
vehicle parking areas, staff parking
areas and other required facilities in
the same manner and at the same level
as is provided to other Departments of
the Institution."
(2) "adequate secretarial, janitorial, and
telephone services ... on the same
basis as is provided to other Depart
ments within the Institution."
An increase in course substitution (see below
D.2.) .while desirable in some ways, will increase
the subsidy by relieving the ROTC programs of
that part of their instructional requirements. In
the Majority's view, such subsidies of the armed
forces are inappropriate.
C.2. Contractual Agreements between
Stanford ROTC Students and the Army, Navy
and Air Force. In this section the committee
states its objections to certain terms contained in
the existing contracts between Stanford ROTC
students and the three military services. It is to
be understood that the Committee does not ob
ject to a student entering into a legal and private
contractual agreement as long as the terms of
said agreement are neither contrary to the aca
demic goals and standards of the university nor
encroachments upon the university's integrity as
an institution of higher learning.
The Committee heard substantial testimony
to the effect that there exists a considerable dif
ference between de facto practice and de jure
obligations. Specifically, it has been the practice
of the three services to terminate a four-year fin
ancial-assistance contract in the first two years
without penalty or prejudice. This has a mitiga
ting effect but leaves the legal provisions of the
contracts technically intact.
C.2.a. Academic Prescriptions. All
three services require certain specified courses of
study. By contract, the student must follow this
prescribed course of study. In addition, the
Navy financial assistant program specifically ex
cludes certain courses of study, and the Air
Force contracts for certain courses of study.
These restrictions and requirements conflict with
the Majority view that Stanford undergraduates
should not be found by law to take and complete
a course of study prescribed by some agent or
agency external to the University, when that
agency also determines (directly or indirectly)
the mode and content of instruction of all or
part of the prescribed course.
All three services require that ROTC cadets
meet certain academic standards. The Majority
believes that Stanford undergraduates should not
be bound by law to maintain academic standards
prescribed by an external agency, especially
when that agency also participates in determining
whether or not such standards have been met.

C.2.b. Personal Conduct. All three
services require that the cadet maintain certain
unspecified standards of personal and moral con
duct. The Majority feels that such restrictions
can seriously limit the student's free participa
tion in all facets of intellectual inquiry and legal
political activity. Furthermore, the Navy finan
cial assistance contract stipulates that the candi
date "remain unmarried until commissioned."
These standards too are established by an agency
external to the University, and judgments con
cerning them are made by the same agency.
While the Majority recognizes the special require
ments of the armed forces and could not object
to similar conditions in contracts between indi
vidual students and the military services when
not a part of a university program or activity, it
can and does object to such conditions when
they are a part of a University-subsidized and
sanctioned activity.
C.2.c. Punitive Clauses. All three ser
vices include in their financial assistance con
tracts clauses that bind the student to a period of
enlisted service for "willfully evading" stipulated
terms. Despite the fact that these clauses have
rarely been invoked at Stanford, the Majority
deems them clearly punitive in intent, and feels
that they unduly infringe the student's freedom
within the University community.
C.2.d. Contracts for Service. To our
knowledge, the ROTC contracts are the only
University-sponsored and sanctioned contracts
on the undergraduate level that bind a student to
service. There are various loan programs such as
the NDEA which allow teaching service to act in
lieu of repayments. Still, these loan programs do
not require service, since the loans can be repaid
with appropriate interest over a period of years.
The ROTC financial assistance grants have no
such provision.
The Majority wishes to point out that these
contractual restrictions and/or obligations oper
ate as a whole. The punitive clauses operate in
relation to academic standards requirements,
course of study requirements, conduct require
ments, and service requirements. The service obli
gation is intimately related to the course of study
requirements. It is this interlocking of contrac
tual requirements, restrictions, and obligations
that makes the whole much more objectionable
than each of its parts might suggest. The Univer
sity's rights and obligations to establish, main
tain, and judge its own standards of academics,
course of study, and student conduct is funda
mental to our conception of the university as
defined above.
D. Academic Objections.
In considering the academic aspects of the
problem, the Committee heard public testimony
that ROTC courses were of very high calibre. We
do not wish to contest this, though members of
the Committee have also heard informally and
confidentially that the contrary is also sometimes
the case. Whatever may be the truth of the mat
ter, the Majority's objections do not rest on these
grounds, but on the inherent goals of these
courses.
D.l Course Goals. Although in recent
years the Department of Defense instruction
plans for the ROTC programs have allowed Pro
fessors of Military Science increasing flexibility
in the choice of text materials and in course sub
stitution, the ultimate goals of these programs
are still fixed by the Department of Defense.
These goals are not compatible with the Univer
sity's "primary commitment to the creation and
dissemination of knowledge, in an environment
of free intellectual activity." The primary goal of
the ROTC programs is to educate, train, and eval
uate junior officers for the U.S. Armed Forces.
The Plan for NROTC Instructional Program
(Navpers 93941, May 1968) defines as "major
goals":
(1) To assist in the education of the
midshipman in a major field of study of interest
to the Navy or Marine Corps leading to a bacca
laureate degree.
(2) To provide the midshipman with
the fundamental concepts and principles of Naval
Science and with the professional Naval knowl
edge necessary to establish a sound basis for his
future growth as a Naval or Marine Corps officer.
(3) To prepare the midshipman for
service with the highest sense of honor and integ
rity as a commissioned officer; to cultivate the
essential elements of military leadership; to fos
ter the growth of a strong sense of loyalty and
dedication to his Service and to the Nation.
(4) To prepare the midshipman to
undertake successfully in later periods of his
career, advanced/continuing education in a field
of application and interest to the Naval Service.
(5) To inject the values of civilian
higher education into the Naval Service by utili
zing the expertise of civilian faculty instruction
where applicable. (Italics ours)
The Army Program of Instruction states that the
objectives of ROTC are "to procure and produce
junior officers who by education, training, atti
tude and inherent qualities are suitable for con
tinued development as officers in the Army."
And the Air Force ROTC mission "is to commis
sion career-oriented second lieutenants in res
ponse to Air Force requirements" by successfully
accomplishing the following four objectives:
(1) Identify, motivate, and select
qualified students to complete the Air Force
ROTC program.
(2) Provide college-level education
that will qualify cadets for commissioning in the
U.S. Air Force.
(3) Heighten each cadet's apprecia
tion of, and dedication to, American principles,
give him an understanding of how the Air Force
serves the national interest, and develop his po
tential as a leader and manager and his under
standing of officer professionalism in the Air
Force.
(4) Commission in the U.S. Air
Force high quality second lieutenants. (Italics
ours)
The goals of these programs are clearly non
academic in nature. Given the goals of these pro
grams as defined above, Military Science instruc
tors are legally and ethically obligated to present
their course material from restricted points of
view, to evaluate the student's fitness for a mili
tary career partly on these grounds, and to report
this evaluation to higher authorities.
Since the goals of the ROTC Programs are to
educate potential officers, much of the current
Military Science course content—weapons sys
tems, small-unit tactics, Army administration, or
ientation, counter-insurgency, etc.—is of such a
narrowly pragmatic, professional nature as to be
incompatible with an undergraduate academic
credit program. Although the Minority Report's
proposed Committee on Military Studies might
deny academic credit to some of these "nuts and
bolts" courses, others might remain in the credit
program. And indeed, one might question
whether any course with the goals outlined above
merits inclusion in Stanford's academic credit
structure. Although knowledge is disseminated in
ROTC courses, it is rarely created in an environ
ment of free intellectual activity; and it is dissem
inated to the end that committed junior officers

to enter the U.S. Armed Forces. The Military
Science Programs' lack of awareness of what we
believe to be the primary commitment of the
University is further evidenced in their equation
of the "values of civilian higher education" with
the "expertise of civilian faculty where applic
able." (NROTC Goals No. 5)
D.2. Course Substitution. The substitu
tion of courses in regular academic departments
for courses presently taught by the ROTC fac
ulty (particularly U.S. military history and U.S.
foreign policy) has been frequently suggested.
This has some attractive features, but these
should not blind one to the problems it also en
tails.
D.2.a. Such courses would have to
meet the goals set forth by the armed forces.
Senior ROTC faculty are being granted wide lati
tude in determining whether or not goals are
being met by a particular course, but it is never
theless true that the scope, coverage, and content
of such courses will be under periodic review by
the military establishment.
D.2.b. If such a course is built into
the ROTC curriculum and required of all cadets,
then the presumption exists that the course will
meet the needs of the ROTC in scope, coverage,
approach, and frequency of offering. TTie faculty
member will have to take these considerations
into account in planning course changes, leave
periods, etc. If such a required course fails for
any reason to meet ROTC needs, the ROTC must
reassume part or all of the instruction in that
area, or drop the requirement. But then course
substitution is either lost or was unnecessary in
the first place.
D.2.C. If such a course is to be op
tional for ROTC cadets, then some other options
must be available. This presumes one of three
things: (a) that other equivalent courses are avail
able in the academic departments, (b) that the
ROTC faculty provide the equivalent, or (c) that
cadets need not receive training in that particular
area. The revised ROTC instructional programs
seem to rule out the last; normal University prac
tice makes the first unlikely. Thus, here too, the
advantages of course substitution may be lost.
Finally, it should be noted that it will be difficult
to ensure that the course is in fact "optional." If
other options are limited, and if cadets are
"strongly urged" to enroll in a particular course,
is that course truly optional?
D.2.d. Course substitution will in
crease both the direct and indirect subsidy of
Stanford to the ROTC by assuming part of the
training of ROTC cadets (see below). It will add
to the work of the academic department and the
individual faculty member by the number of stu
dents who would not otherwise have enrolled in
his course (this could, for example, require addi
tional expenditures for T.A.'s, readers, etc.). The
call upon the resources of the ROTC programs
will be correspondingly lightened.
D.3. Departmental Status. An academic
department shares much the same definition as
the institution of which it is a part, with particu
lar reference to a specific area and/or discipline.
When a student has demonstrated a certain com
petence in this area or discipline, he is recom
mended for a degree, either at the undergraduate
or graduate level. The Departments of Military
Science do not do this at either level; rather, they
offer commissions in the Armed Forces to the
men who successfully complete their programs.
Unlike other departments or schools in the Uni
versity, the ROTC Departments are educating
young men not to academic ends but to work for
a specific employer in a specific area.
The Minority recommends combining the
three ROTC Departments into a single Depart
ment of Military Studies, no longer to be lodged
in the School of Humanities and Sciences but to
be responsible to the Provost via a Committee on
Military Studies. The Majority believes this is a
recognition of the anomalous nature of such a
department, which has neither undergraduate nor
graduate majors and serves non-academic ends.
D.4. Faculty Search and Appointment.
The Military Science Departments' faculty is ap
pointed in an irregular way. The appointment
procedure for Military Science personnel by
passes both department-initiated search and eval
uation, and the normal administrative ratification
process. Whenever a position becomes vacant, the
appropriate branch of the Armed Services pre
sents nominations for the position to the Pro
vost's Office. The administration may veto any
military nominations. (It has done so at least
three times.) The nominee's military record and
college transcripts are examined and, whenever
possible, a personal interview is held. Though
ROTC faculty are presently members of the Aca
demic Council, they are not subject to the usual
University policy on tenure, for the Defense De
partment agrees to recall them immediately at
the request of the administration. (Stanford has
exercised this option once in recent years.) Fur
thermore, the Department of Defense reserves
the right to transfer from Stanford any assigned
military personnel. Thus, under present arrange
ments, an external organization may unilaterally
remove a member of the Stanford faculty.
This irregular appointment and retention pro
cedure violates the principle that the primary re
sponsibility for faculty appointment and status
rests with the Stanford faculty and administra
tion. Secondly, it creates a special class of faculty
members having some characteristics not shared
by the regular faculty and lacking others.
Thirdly, since Stanford cannot initiate the search
nor fully supervise the screening process, the Uni
versity loses some degree of control over the
quality of the ROTC faculty. These irregular fea
tures would continue, even under revised proced
ures.
IV. Objections to ROTC as An Organized, Non
credit, On-Campus Program
The previous section reviews our objections,
both general and specific, to ROTC as an aca
demic program at Stanford. Having come to this
point, the Majority gave serious consideration to
retention of ROTC on campus as an organized,
non-credit program of education and training. We
believe such an arrangement may be an improve
ment over both the present situation and the rec
ommendations of the Minority. But it is the con
viction of the Majority that the logic of the gen
eral objections must apply generally to the rela
tions between ROTC and Stanford. To recom
mend termination of academic credit and reten
tion of non-credit ROTC programs is to accept
the argument with respect to the former but fail
to apply it to the latter. We here recapitulate
those considerations with reference to ROTC as
an on-campus, non-credit program of training
and education.
A. What has been termed "conflict of inter
est" would continue, since ROTC would remain
the corporate representation of the armed forces
within the structure of the University, staffed by
professional military officers. If ROTC is re
tained as a non-credit program, several opera
tional problems will grow directly out of the fact

that ROTC will remain in the University but not
of the University. Any solution of these prob
lems will constitute recognition of the anomalous
nature of the arrangement.
1. Would the ROTC programs, singly or
collectively, continue as "Department(s)?" If
not, what status should they have? On what
grounds would such a decision be made?
2. The same questions apply to the status
of ROTC faculty. Shall formal academic rank be
accorded, as presently required by law? To
whom, at what level, and on what grounds?
3. How shall the University handle search
and appointment procedures for persons offering
no accredited work, but who present courses re
quired of a certain proportion of the student
body?
4. How shall the University oversee the
content and mode of instruction in these non
credit but required courses?
B. The primary goal of the ROTC programs
would remain, as before, the recruitment and
training of junior officers. Thus, specific training
for employment by an outside organization, car
ried on by members of that organization, would
continue.
C. Institutional contracts would remain,
though perhaps in a modified form. Thus, dispro
portionate subsidization of the military at Stan
ford would continue: direct subsidies in the form
of facilities, services, etc.; indirect subsidies in
the form of course substitution, etc.
D. Individual contracts, requiring participa
tion in ROTC training programs on-campus by
signatories, would continue. It is here not the
existence of such contracts that is objected to;
rather it is to the institutional sanction and sup
port given these contracts by Stanford Univer
sity.
V. Recommendations
Thus far the Majority has emphasized those
aspects of the present ROTC which make them
objectionable to the point of incompatibility
with the University. We believe such analysis,
while lengthy and complex, is necessary when
ever a significant change is recommended for an
on-going academic program. Also required is
some projection of the nature and structure of
the revised program. That is, having dealt with
objections in the relationship between Stanford
and the ROTC departments, what is considered
to be the proper relationship?
It should be noted, first, that no accurate pro
jection can be made because it is not known
what limits the Department of Defense has for its
junior officer procurement program. We cannot
predict what will be acceptable to the military
services beyond existing operational and legal
constraints.
Secondly, the Majority believes the issue of
proper relations is confused by excessive reliance
on the term "ROTC." The Majority has empha
sized the distinction between ROTC as a mech
anism and the objectives which ROTC serves.
Our arguments have been directed to the mech
anism, not the objectives or purposes. Misinter
pretation arises if this distinction is obscured. If
the language of the Senate's charge is taken to
mean that "ROTC" denotes an organized on
campus program of eduation and training, then
the Majority is compelled to state there can be
no "proper relations between the ROTC depart
ments and Stanford." This, in turn, can mis
takenly be construed to mean that the Majority
believes no proper relations can be established
between the objectives served by the existing de
partments and Stanford.
It is likely that the program which we recom
mend would not and should not be denoted as
"ROTC." This is accurate insofar as the program
has been substantially altered and does not con
form to present programs of ROTC. But any new
denotation should not be interpreted to mean
that we have sought to abolish all relations be
tween Stanford and the purposes of the existing
ROTC programs or that we have concluded that
no proper relations can be established. Rather we
believe that for proper relations to exist, a new
mechanism must be created —one that differs
from the present program, but can still serve the
same purposes in such a way as to be compatible
with the University.
We envision relations whereby each service of
the armed forces would assign personnel to
manage an administrative apparatus, with space
provided possibly in the Dean of Students' Office
of Special Services, that would concern itself
with recruitment of students into the program,
process the revised student contracts and scholar
ships, offer professional counseling and informa
tion to individuals as well as to the existing stu
dent voluntary groups representative of the three
services on campus. Further, this Armed Forces
Officers Program would arrange with enrolled
students for off-campus training and education.
We believe that all education presently offered
by the ROTC departments could be transferred
to extended summer encampments. The military
personnel on campus would be free to offer vol
untary undergraduate special courses, as are
other members of the Stanford community, fol
lowing the guidelines established by the Commit
tee on Undergraduate Education.
To these ends, we recommend the following:
1. After a transitional period (see recom
mendation 5 below), there should be no aca
demic credit received for participation in pro
grams of military training and education.
2. By the end of this period, non-credit,
required military training and education should
no longer be offered on the Stanford campus.
Consistent with these recommendations, a
scholarship or contract "program" may remain,
comprising normal academic education, supple
mented by on-campus voluntary activities and
off-campus training.
3. By the end of this period, all remaining
military programs or activities should be regu
lated by the University's general policies on Stan
ford Voluntary Organizations. No Stanford fac
ulty member or administrator, acting as a spokes
man for the University, shall encourage students
to participate in military training and education,
except in the manner in which participation in all
voluntary activities is encouraged.
4. Individual contracts between Stanford
students and the armed forces should be revised
to reflect actual practice. We recommend further
that punitive clauses involving enlisted service be
removed.
5. These provisions should be in force by
the fall term 1973. Beginning with the fall term
1970, no entering freshman shall be granted aca
demic credit for ROTC activities. The three
ROTC departments should be replaced by a sin
gle Armed Forces Officers Program no later than
fall term 1973. This program shall be for the
purposes of administration, counseling, and re
cruiting for off-campus reserve officer training
and education. (N.B. Because present institu
tional contracts specify one year's notice prior to
termination, the phase-out process cannot begin
before 1970.)
6. Appropriate University authorities
should promptly initiate action leading to re
vision or termination of the contracts between
Stanford and the armed forces (a) in order to
enable the phase-out to begin in 1970, and (b) in
order to reflect the voluntary, non-credit status
of military training at Stanford. We further rec
ommend that a committee be appointed, com
posed of representatives of faculty, administra
tion, military science department, and students,
to assist in effecting the transition.
7. During the transitional period, we rec
ommend that the status of officers presently at
tached to ROTC units remain unchanged. Until
the fall term 1973, newly assigned officers shall
carry the rank of "Lecturer," except for the
newly assigned senior officers of each branch of
the armed forces, who shall carry the rank of
"Lecturer with rank of Professor." After the be
ginning of the 1973-74 academic year, represen
tatives of the armed forces at Stanford shall carry
no academic rank. Similarly until this time, the
departmental and administrative structure of the
ROTC program shall remain as at present.
8. Students already enrolled in ROTC pro
grams, and those enrolling prior to the fall term
1970, shall continue as at present, except that
present contracts should be revised in accord
with recommendation 4.

because our charge as a committee limits us to
these programs.
The Majority believes that there are both gen
eral and specific objections which will continue
to exist as long as ROTC is a program integral to
the institutional structure of the University.
A. Conflict of Interest. The ROTC faculty,
being detailed to Stanford on a limited tour of
duty, remain professional military officers who
legally and ethically owe primary loyalty to the
branch of the service they represent, to the
armed forces, and to the U.S. government. This
means that, however high their integrity and
quality of mind, they cannot at the same time
have a primary commitment either to Stanford
University or to the academic enterprise. This
dual identity should be recognized as a conflict
of interest. The government itself recognizes very
clearly the potential peril of conflict-of-interest
situations, and rightly expects public servants
scrupulously to avoid them. It should be noted
that neither the government's position nor ours
rests upon the fact or even the presumption of
improper behavior.
Because this consideration applies to all mili
tary members of the ROTC, it therefore applies
by extension to the ROTC programs themselves.
These programs, as corporate entities—present
H&S departments—are themselves in a potential
conflict-of-interest situation with respect to the
University.
We recognize that other instances of conflict
of interest are by no means rare in the university;
these too are unfortunate. But they are individ
ual rather than collective, and they are character
ized, in nearly all cases, by a primary commit
ment to the University (note that the University
limits outside activities to an average of one day
per week).
B. Training for a specific employer, by that
employer. The ROTC programs represent the
corporate, institutional presence of an external
organization, which engages in specific training
of candidates for temporary or permanent em
ploy by that organization. The issue raised here is
not simply that of professional or pre-profes
sional training, but of such training carried on
by the armed forces, in the interests of the armed
forces. The Majority believes that such training
should not be a part of the academic structure of
the University.
C. Contractual Arrangements. The objection
able features of the present contracts can be con
sidered under two headings: contractual arrange
ments between the armed forces and Stanford
University, and between the armed forces and
individual students. While some of these arrange
ments may be subject to change, others would
not. Some are specified by the Vitalization Act
of 1964 and could not be changed except
through action by Congress.
C.l. Institutional Contracts. The contracts
between Stanford and the various military ser
vices provide for government commitment of an
academic and administrative staff, an instruc
tional program, government equipment, staff
salaries, and student financial assistance. In re
turn the University agrees to the establishment of
military science department, provision of class
rooms, offices and drill areas, appropriate aca
demic credit for military science courses, and a
minimum sustaining enrollment and output of
officers. In the case of the Army, representation
on all faculty committees whose recommenda
tions would directly affect the Department of
Military Science is stipulated. These contracts
further provide for prior approval and right of
dismissal by Stanford of all military officers as
signed to the department, assignment of the rank
of professor to the senior commissioned officer
of each service assigned to the institution and
lesser academic rank to other members of the
staffs, and the right of the Secretary of the mili
tary service involved to relieve from duty any
officer or enlisted man assigned to work at Stan
ford. These terms represent a partial abdication
of University control over the governance of its
own affairs.
It should be recognized that these arrange
ments result in a Stanford subsidy to the ROTC
programs. Stanford is obliged to provide facili
ties, services, and financial support to the ROTC
programs on a cost-free basis. For example, the
Air Force contract stipulates that Stanford pro
vide:
(1) "the necessary classrooms, administra
tive offices, storage spaces, government
vehicle parking areas, staff parking
areas and other required facilities in
the same manner and at the same level
as is provided to other Departments of
the Institution."
(2) "adequate secretarial, janitorial, and
telephone services ... on the same
basis as is provided to other Depart
ments within the Institution."
An increase in course substitution (see below
D.2.) .while desirable in some ways, will increase
the subsidy by relieving the ROTC programs of
that part of their instructional requirements. In
the Majority's view, such subsidies of the armed
forces are inappropriate.
C.2. Contractual Agreements between
Stanford ROTC Students and the Army, Navy
and Air Force. In this section the committee
states its objections to certain terms contained in
the existing contracts between Stanford ROTC
students and the three military services. It is to
be understood that the Committee does not ob
ject to a student entering into a legal and private
contractual agreement as long as the terms of
said agreement are neither contrary to the aca
demic goals and standards of the university nor
encroachments upon the university's integrity as
an institution of higher learning.
The Committee heard substantial testimony
to the effect that there exists a considerable dif
ference between de facto practice and de jure
obligations. Specifically, it has been the practice
of the three services to terminate a four-year fin
ancial-assistance contract in the first two years
without penalty or prejudice. This has a mitiga
ting effect but leaves the legal provisions of the
contracts technically intact.
C.2.a. Academic Prescriptions. All
three services require certain specified courses of
study. By contract, the student must follow this
prescribed course of study. In addition, the
Navy financial assistant program specifically ex
cludes certain courses of study, and the Air
Force contracts for certain courses of study.
These restrictions and requirements conflict with
the Majority view that Stanford undergraduates
should not be found by law to take and complete
a course of study prescribed by some agent or
agency external to the University, when that
agency also determines (directly or indirectly)
the mode and content of instruction of all or
part of the prescribed course.
All three services require that ROTC cadets
meet certain academic standards. The Majority
believes that Stanford undergraduates should not
be bound by law to maintain academic standards
prescribed by an external agency, especially
when that agency also participates in determining
whether or not such standards have been met.

C.2.b. Personal Conduct. All three
services require that the cadet maintain certain
unspecified standards of personal and moral con
duct. The Majority feels that such restrictions
can seriously limit the student's free participa
tion in all facets of intellectual inquiry and legal
political activity. Furthermore, the Navy finan
cial assistance contract stipulates that the candi
date "remain unmarried until commissioned."
These standards too are established by an agency
external to the University, and judgments con
cerning them are made by the same agency.
While the Majority recognizes the special require
ments of the armed forces and could not object
to similar conditions in contracts between indi
vidual students and the military services when
not a part of a university program or activity, it
can and does object to such conditions when
they are a part of a University-subsidized and
sanctioned activity.
C.2.c. Punitive Clauses. All three ser
vices include in their financial assistance con
tracts clauses that bind the student to a period of
enlisted service for "willfully evading" stipulated
terms. Despite the fact that these clauses have
rarely been invoked at Stanford, the Majority
deems them clearly punitive in intent, and feels
that they unduly infringe the student's freedom
within the University community.
C.2.d. Contracts for Service. To our
knowledge, the ROTC contracts are the only
University-sponsored and sanctioned contracts
on the undergraduate level that bind a student to
service. There are various loan programs such as
the NDEA which allow teaching service to act in
lieu of repayments. Still, these loan programs do
not require service, since the loans can be repaid
with appropriate interest over a period of years.
The ROTC financial assistance grants have no
such provision.
The Majority wishes to point out that these
contractual restrictions and/or obligations oper
ate as a whole. The punitive clauses operate in
relation to academic standards requirements,
course of study requirements, conduct require
ments, and service requirements. The service obli
gation is intimately related to the course of study
requirements. It is this interlocking of contrac
tual requirements, restrictions, and obligations
that makes the whole much more objectionable
than each of its parts might suggest. The Univer
sity's rights and obligations to establish, main
tain, and judge its own standards of academics,
course of study, and student conduct is funda
mental to our conception of the university as
defined above.
D. Academic Objections.
In considering the academic aspects of the
problem, the Committee heard public testimony
that ROTC courses were of very high calibre. We
do not wish to contest this, though members of
the Committee have also heard informally and
confidentially that the contrary is also sometimes
the case. Whatever may be the truth of the mat
ter, the Majority's objections do not rest on these
grounds, but on the inherent goals of these
courses.
D.l Course Goals. Although in recent
years the Department of Defense instruction
plans for the ROTC programs have allowed Pro
fessors of Military Science increasing flexibility
in the choice of text materials and in course sub
stitution, the ultimate goals of these programs
are still fixed by the Department of Defense.
These goals are not compatible with the Univer
sity's "primary commitment to the creation and
dissemination of knowledge, in an environment
of free intellectual activity." The primary goal of
the ROTC programs is to educate, train, and eval
uate junior officers for the U.S. Armed Forces.
The Plan for NROTC Instructional Program
(Navpers 93941, May 1968) defines as "major
goals":
(1) To assist in the education of the
midshipman in a major field of study of interest
to the Navy or Marine Corps leading to a bacca
laureate degree.
(2) To provide the midshipman with
the fundamental concepts and principles of Naval
Science and with the professional Naval knowl
edge necessary to establish a sound basis for his
future growth as a Naval or Marine Corps officer.
(3) To prepare the midshipman for
service with the highest sense of honor and integ
rity as a commissioned officer; to cultivate the
essential elements of military leadership; to fos
ter the growth of a strong sense of loyalty and
dedication to his Service and to the Nation.
(4) To prepare the midshipman to
undertake successfully in later periods of his
career, advanced/continuing education in a field
of application and interest to the Naval Service.
(5) To inject the values of civilian
higher education into the Naval Service by utili
zing the expertise of civilian faculty instruction
where applicable. (Italics ours)
The Army Program of Instruction states that the
objectives of ROTC are "to procure and produce
junior officers who by education, training, atti
tude and inherent qualities are suitable for con
tinued development as officers in the Army."
And the Air Force ROTC mission "is to commis
sion career-oriented second lieutenants in res
ponse to Air Force requirements" by successfully
accomplishing the following four objectives:
(1) Identify, motivate, and select
qualified students to complete the Air Force
ROTC program.
(2) Provide college-level education
that will qualify cadets for commissioning in the
U.S. Air Force.
(3) Heighten each cadet's apprecia
tion of, and dedication to, American principles,
give him an understanding of how the Air Force
serves the national interest, and develop his po
tential as a leader and manager and his under
standing of officer professionalism in the Air
Force.
(4) Commission in the U.S. Air
Force high quality second lieutenants. (Italics
ours)
The goals of these programs are clearly non
academic in nature. Given the goals of these pro
grams as defined above, Military Science instruc
tors are legally and ethically obligated to present
their course material from restricted points of
view, to evaluate the student's fitness for a mili
tary career partly on these grounds, and to report
this evaluation to higher authorities.
Since the goals of the ROTC Programs are to
educate potential officers, much of the current
Military Science course content—weapons sys
tems, small-unit tactics, Army administration, or
ientation, counter-insurgency, etc.—is of such a
narrowly pragmatic, professional nature as to be
incompatible with an undergraduate academic
credit program. Although the Minority Report's
proposed Committee on Military Studies might
deny academic credit to some of these "nuts and
bolts" courses, others might remain in the credit
program. And indeed, one might question
whether any course with the goals outlined above
merits inclusion in Stanford's academic credit
structure. Although knowledge is disseminated in
ROTC courses, it is rarely created in an environ
ment of free intellectual activity; and it is dissem
inated to the end that committed junior officers

to enter the U.S. Armed Forces. The Military
Science Programs' lack of awareness of what we
believe to be the primary commitment of the
University is further evidenced in their equation
of the "values of civilian higher education" with
the "expertise of civilian faculty where applic
able." (NROTC Goals No. 5)
D.2. Course Substitution. The substitu
tion of courses in regular academic departments
for courses presently taught by the ROTC fac
ulty (particularly U.S. military history and U.S.
foreign policy) has been frequently suggested.
This has some attractive features, but these
should not blind one to the problems it also en
tails.
D.2.a. Such courses would have to
meet the goals set forth by the armed forces.
Senior ROTC faculty are being granted wide lati
tude in determining whether or not goals are
being met by a particular course, but it is never
theless true that the scope, coverage, and content
of such courses will be under periodic review by
the military establishment.
D.2.b. If such a course is built into
the ROTC curriculum and required of all cadets,
then the presumption exists that the course will
meet the needs of the ROTC in scope, coverage,
approach, and frequency of offering. TTie faculty
member will have to take these considerations
into account in planning course changes, leave
periods, etc. If such a required course fails for
any reason to meet ROTC needs, the ROTC must
reassume part or all of the instruction in that
area, or drop the requirement. But then course
substitution is either lost or was unnecessary in
the first place.
D.2.C. If such a course is to be op
tional for ROTC cadets, then some other options
must be available. This presumes one of three
things: (a) that other equivalent courses are avail
able in the academic departments, (b) that the
ROTC faculty provide the equivalent, or (c) that
cadets need not receive training in that particular
area. The revised ROTC instructional programs
seem to rule out the last; normal University prac
tice makes the first unlikely. Thus, here too, the
advantages of course substitution may be lost.
Finally, it should be noted that it will be difficult
to ensure that the course is in fact "optional." If
other options are limited, and if cadets are
"strongly urged" to enroll in a particular course,
is that course truly optional?
D.2.d. Course substitution will in
crease both the direct and indirect subsidy of
Stanford to the ROTC by assuming part of the
training of ROTC cadets (see below). It will add
to the work of the academic department and the
individual faculty member by the number of stu
dents who would not otherwise have enrolled in
his course (this could, for example, require addi
tional expenditures for T.A.'s, readers, etc.). The
call upon the resources of the ROTC programs
will be correspondingly lightened.
D.3. Departmental Status. An academic
department shares much the same definition as
the institution of which it is a part, with particu
lar reference to a specific area and/or discipline.
When a student has demonstrated a certain com
petence in this area or discipline, he is recom
mended for a degree, either at the undergraduate
or graduate level. The Departments of Military
Science do not do this at either level; rather, they
offer commissions in the Armed Forces to the
men who successfully complete their programs.
Unlike other departments or schools in the Uni
versity, the ROTC Departments are educating
young men not to academic ends but to work for
a specific employer in a specific area.
The Minority recommends combining the
three ROTC Departments into a single Depart
ment of Military Studies, no longer to be lodged
in the School of Humanities and Sciences but to
be responsible to the Provost via a Committee on
Military Studies. The Majority believes this is a
recognition of the anomalous nature of such a
department, which has neither undergraduate nor
graduate majors and serves non-academic ends.
D.4. Faculty Search and Appointment.
The Military Science Departments' faculty is ap
pointed in an irregular way. The appointment
procedure for Military Science personnel by
passes both department-initiated search and eval
uation, and the normal administrative ratification
process. Whenever a position becomes vacant, the
appropriate branch of the Armed Services pre
sents nominations for the position to the Pro
vost's Office. The administration may veto any
military nominations. (It has done so at least
three times.) The nominee's military record and
college transcripts are examined and, whenever
possible, a personal interview is held. Though
ROTC faculty are presently members of the Aca
demic Council, they are not subject to the usual
University policy on tenure, for the Defense De
partment agrees to recall them immediately at
the request of the administration. (Stanford has
exercised this option once in recent years.) Fur
thermore, the Department of Defense reserves
the right to transfer from Stanford any assigned
military personnel. Thus, under present arrange
ments, an external organization may unilaterally
remove a member of the Stanford faculty.
This irregular appointment and retention pro
cedure violates the principle that the primary re
sponsibility for faculty appointment and status
rests with the Stanford faculty and administra
tion. Secondly, it creates a special class of faculty
members having some characteristics not shared
by the regular faculty and lacking others.
Thirdly, since Stanford cannot initiate the search
nor fully supervise the screening process, the Uni
versity loses some degree of control over the
quality of the ROTC faculty. These irregular fea
tures would continue, even under revised proced
ures.
IV. Objections to ROTC as An Organized, Non
credit, On-Campus Program
The previous section reviews our objections,
both general and specific, to ROTC as an aca
demic program at Stanford. Having come to this
point, the Majority gave serious consideration to
retention of ROTC on campus as an organized,
non-credit program of education and training. We
believe such an arrangement may be an improve
ment over both the present situation and the rec
ommendations of the Minority. But it is the con
viction of the Majority that the logic of the gen
eral objections must apply generally to the rela
tions between ROTC and Stanford. To recom
mend termination of academic credit and reten
tion of non-credit ROTC programs is to accept
the argument with respect to the former but fail
to apply it to the latter. We here recapitulate
those considerations with reference to ROTC as
an on-campus, non-credit program of training
and education.
A. What has been termed "conflict of inter
est" would continue, since ROTC would remain
the corporate representation of the armed forces
within the structure of the University, staffed by
professional military officers. If ROTC is re
tained as a non-credit program, several opera
tional problems will grow directly out of the fact

that ROTC will remain in the University but not
of the University. Any solution of these prob
lems will constitute recognition of the anomalous
nature of the arrangement.
1. Would the ROTC programs, singly or
collectively, continue as "Department(s)?" If
not, what status should they have? On what
grounds would such a decision be made?
2. The same questions apply to the status
of ROTC faculty. Shall formal academic rank be
accorded, as presently required by law? To
whom, at what level, and on what grounds?
3. How shall the University handle search
and appointment procedures for persons offering
no accredited work, but who present courses re
quired of a certain proportion of the student
body?
4. How shall the University oversee the
content and mode of instruction in these non
credit but required courses?
B. The primary goal of the ROTC programs
would remain, as before, the recruitment and
training of junior officers. Thus, specific training
for employment by an outside organization, car
ried on by members of that organization, would
continue.
C. Institutional contracts would remain,
though perhaps in a modified form. Thus, dispro
portionate subsidization of the military at Stan
ford would continue: direct subsidies in the form
of facilities, services, etc.; indirect subsidies in
the form of course substitution, etc.
D. Individual contracts, requiring participa
tion in ROTC training programs on-campus by
signatories, would continue. It is here not the
existence of such contracts that is objected to;
rather it is to the institutional sanction and sup
port given these contracts by Stanford Univer
sity.
V. Recommendations
Thus far the Majority has emphasized those
aspects of the present ROTC which make them
objectionable to the point of incompatibility
with the University. We believe such analysis,
while lengthy and complex, is necessary when
ever a significant change is recommended for an
on-going academic program. Also required is
some projection of the nature and structure of
the revised program. That is, having dealt with
objections in the relationship between Stanford
and the ROTC departments, what is considered
to be the proper relationship?
It should be noted, first, that no accurate pro
jection can be made because it is not known
what limits the Department of Defense has for its
junior officer procurement program. We cannot
predict what will be acceptable to the military
services beyond existing operational and legal
constraints.
Secondly, the Majority believes the issue of
proper relations is confused by excessive reliance
on the term "ROTC." The Majority has empha
sized the distinction between ROTC as a mech
anism and the objectives which ROTC serves.
Our arguments have been directed to the mech
anism, not the objectives or purposes. Misinter
pretation arises if this distinction is obscured. If
the language of the Senate's charge is taken to
mean that "ROTC" denotes an organized on
campus program of eduation and training, then
the Majority is compelled to state there can be
no "proper relations between the ROTC depart
ments and Stanford." This, in turn, can mis
takenly be construed to mean that the Majority
believes no proper relations can be established
between the objectives served by the existing de
partments and Stanford.
It is likely that the program which we recom
mend would not and should not be denoted as
"ROTC." This is accurate insofar as the program
has been substantially altered and does not con
form to present programs of ROTC. But any new
denotation should not be interpreted to mean
that we have sought to abolish all relations be
tween Stanford and the purposes of the existing
ROTC programs or that we have concluded that
no proper relations can be established. Rather we
believe that for proper relations to exist, a new
mechanism must be created —one that differs
from the present program, but can still serve the
same purposes in such a way as to be compatible
with the University.
We envision relations whereby each service of
the armed forces would assign personnel to
manage an administrative apparatus, with space
provided possibly in the Dean of Students' Office
of Special Services, that would concern itself
with recruitment of students into the program,
process the revised student contracts and scholar
ships, offer professional counseling and informa
tion to individuals as well as to the existing stu
dent voluntary groups representative of the three
services on campus. Further, this Armed Forces
Officers Program would arrange with enrolled
students for off-campus training and education.
We believe that all education presently offered
by the ROTC departments could be transferred
to extended summer encampments. The military
personnel on campus would be free to offer vol
untary undergraduate special courses, as are
other members of the Stanford community, fol
lowing the guidelines established by the Commit
tee on Undergraduate Education.
To these ends, we recommend the following:
1. After a transitional period (see recom
mendation 5 below), there should be no aca
demic credit received for participation in pro
grams of military training and education.
2. By the end of this period, non-credit,
required military training and education should
no longer be offered on the Stanford campus.
Consistent with these recommendations, a
scholarship or contract "program" may remain,
comprising normal academic education, supple
mented by on-campus voluntary activities and
off-campus training.
3. By the end of this period, all remaining
military programs or activities should be regu
lated by the University's general policies on Stan
ford Voluntary Organizations. No Stanford fac
ulty member or administrator, acting as a spokes
man for the University, shall encourage students
to participate in military training and education,
except in the manner in which participation in all
voluntary activities is encouraged.
4. Individual contracts between Stanford
students and the armed forces should be revised
to reflect actual practice. We recommend further
that punitive clauses involving enlisted service be
removed.
5. These provisions should be in force by
the fall term 1973. Beginning with the fall term
1970, no entering freshman shall be granted aca
demic credit for ROTC activities. The three
ROTC departments should be replaced by a sin
gle Armed Forces Officers Program no later than
fall term 1973. This program shall be for the
purposes of administration, counseling, and re
cruiting for off-campus reserve officer training
and education. (N.B. Because present institu
tional contracts specify one year's notice prior to
termination, the phase-out process cannot begin
before 1970.)
6. Appropriate University authorities
should promptly initiate action leading to re
vision or termination of the contracts between
Stanford and the armed forces (a) in order to
enable the phase-out to begin in 1970, and (b) in
order to reflect the voluntary, non-credit status
of military training at Stanford. We further rec
ommend that a committee be appointed, com
posed of representatives of faculty, administra
tion, military science department, and students,
to assist in effecting the transition.
7. During the transitional period, we rec
ommend that the status of officers presently at
tached to ROTC units remain unchanged. Until
the fall term 1973, newly assigned officers shall
carry the rank of "Lecturer," except for the
newly assigned senior officers of each branch of
the armed forces, who shall carry the rank of
"Lecturer with rank of Professor." After the be
ginning of the 1973-74 academic year, represen
tatives of the armed forces at Stanford shall carry
no academic rank. Similarly until this time, the
departmental and administrative structure of the
ROTC program shall remain as at present.
8. Students already enrolled in ROTC pro
grams, and those enrolling prior to the fall term
1970, shall continue as at present, except that
present contracts should be revised in accord
with recommendation 4.

because our charge as a committee limits us to
these programs.
The Majority believes that there are both gen
eral and specific objections which will continue
to exist as long as ROTC is a program integral to
the institutional structure of the University.
A. Conflict of Interest. The ROTC faculty,
being detailed to Stanford on a limited tour of
duty, remain professional military officers who
legally and ethically owe primary loyalty to the
branch of the service they represent, to the
armed forces, and to the U.S. government. This
means that, however high their integrity and
quality of mind, they cannot at the same time
have a primary commitment either to Stanford
University or to the academic enterprise. This
dual identity should be recognized as a conflict
of interest. The government itself recognizes very
clearly the potential peril of conflict-of-interest
situations, and rightly expects public servants
scrupulously to avoid them. It should be noted
that neither the government's position nor ours
rests upon the fact or even the presumption of
improper behavior.
Because this consideration applies to all mili
tary members of the ROTC, it therefore applies
by extension to the ROTC programs themselves.
These programs, as corporate entities—present
H&S departments—are themselves in a potential
conflict-of-interest situation with respect to the
University.
We recognize that other instances of conflict
of interest are by no means rare in the university;
these too are unfortunate. But they are individ
ual rather than collective, and they are character
ized, in nearly all cases, by a primary commit
ment to the University (note that the University
limits outside activities to an average of one day
per week).
B. Training for a specific employer, by that
employer. The ROTC programs represent the
corporate, institutional presence of an external
organization, which engages in specific training
of candidates for temporary or permanent em
ploy by that organization. The issue raised here is
not simply that of professional or pre-profes
sional training, but of such training carried on
by the armed forces, in the interests of the armed
forces. The Majority believes that such training
should not be a part of the academic structure of
the University.
C. Contractual Arrangements. The objection
able features of the present contracts can be con
sidered under two headings: contractual arrange
ments between the armed forces and Stanford
University, and between the armed forces and
individual students. While some of these arrange
ments may be subject to change, others would
not. Some are specified by the Vitalization Act
of 1964 and could not be changed except
through action by Congress.
C.l. Institutional Contracts. The contracts
between Stanford and the various military ser
vices provide for government commitment of an
academic and administrative staff, an instruc
tional program, government equipment, staff
salaries, and student financial assistance. In re
turn the University agrees to the establishment of
military science department, provision of class
rooms, offices and drill areas, appropriate aca
demic credit for military science courses, and a
minimum sustaining enrollment and output of
officers. In the case of the Army, representation
on all faculty committees whose recommenda
tions would directly affect the Department of
Military Science is stipulated. These contracts
further provide for prior approval and right of
dismissal by Stanford of all military officers as
signed to the department, assignment of the rank
of professor to the senior commissioned officer
of each service assigned to the institution and
lesser academic rank to other members of the
staffs, and the right of the Secretary of the mili
tary service involved to relieve from duty any
officer or enlisted man assigned to work at Stan
ford. These terms represent a partial abdication
of University control over the governance of its
own affairs.
It should be recognized that these arrange
ments result in a Stanford subsidy to the ROTC
programs. Stanford is obliged to provide facili
ties, services, and financial support to the ROTC
programs on a cost-free basis. For example, the
Air Force contract stipulates that Stanford pro
vide:
(1) "the necessary classrooms, administra
tive offices, storage spaces, government
vehicle parking areas, staff parking
areas and other required facilities in
the same manner and at the same level
as is provided to other Departments of
the Institution."
(2) "adequate secretarial, janitorial, and
telephone services ... on the same
basis as is provided to other Depart
ments within the Institution."
An increase in course substitution (see below
D.2.) .while desirable in some ways, will increase
the subsidy by relieving the ROTC programs of
that part of their instructional requirements. In
the Majority's view, such subsidies of the armed
forces are inappropriate.
C.2. Contractual Agreements between
Stanford ROTC Students and the Army, Navy
and Air Force. In this section the committee
states its objections to certain terms contained in
the existing contracts between Stanford ROTC
students and the three military services. It is to
be understood that the Committee does not ob
ject to a student entering into a legal and private
contractual agreement as long as the terms of
said agreement are neither contrary to the aca
demic goals and standards of the university nor
encroachments upon the university's integrity as
an institution of higher learning.
The Committee heard substantial testimony
to the effect that there exists a considerable dif
ference between de facto practice and de jure
obligations. Specifically, it has been the practice
of the three services to terminate a four-year fin
ancial-assistance contract in the first two years
without penalty or prejudice. This has a mitiga
ting effect but leaves the legal provisions of the
contracts technically intact.
C.2.a. Academic Prescriptions. All
three services require certain specified courses of
study. By contract, the student must follow this
prescribed course of study. In addition, the
Navy financial assistant program specifically ex
cludes certain courses of study, and the Air
Force contracts for certain courses of study.
These restrictions and requirements conflict with
the Majority view that Stanford undergraduates
should not be found by law to take and complete
a course of study prescribed by some agent or
agency external to the University, when that
agency also determines (directly or indirectly)
the mode and content of instruction of all or
part of the prescribed course.
All three services require that ROTC cadets
meet certain academic standards. The Majority
believes that Stanford undergraduates should not
be bound by law to maintain academic standards
prescribed by an external agency, especially
when that agency also participates in determining
whether or not such standards have been met.

C.2.b. Personal Conduct. All three
services require that the cadet maintain certain
unspecified standards of personal and moral con
duct. The Majority feels that such restrictions
can seriously limit the student's free participa
tion in all facets of intellectual inquiry and legal
political activity. Furthermore, the Navy finan
cial assistance contract stipulates that the candi
date "remain unmarried until commissioned."
These standards too are established by an agency
external to the University, and judgments con
cerning them are made by the same agency.
While the Majority recognizes the special require
ments of the armed forces and could not object
to similar conditions in contracts between indi
vidual students and the military services when
not a part of a university program or activity, it
can and does object to such conditions when
they are a part of a University-subsidized and
sanctioned activity.
C.2.c. Punitive Clauses. All three ser
vices include in their financial assistance con
tracts clauses that bind the student to a period of
enlisted service for "willfully evading" stipulated
terms. Despite the fact that these clauses have
rarely been invoked at Stanford, the Majority
deems them clearly punitive in intent, and feels
that they unduly infringe the student's freedom
within the University community.
C.2.d. Contracts for Service. To our
knowledge, the ROTC contracts are the only
University-sponsored and sanctioned contracts
on the undergraduate level that bind a student to
service. There are various loan programs such as
the NDEA which allow teaching service to act in
lieu of repayments. Still, these loan programs do
not require service, since the loans can be repaid
with appropriate interest over a period of years.
The ROTC financial assistance grants have no
such provision.
The Majority wishes to point out that these
contractual restrictions and/or obligations oper
ate as a whole. The punitive clauses operate in
relation to academic standards requirements,
course of study requirements, conduct require
ments, and service requirements. The service obli
gation is intimately related to the course of study
requirements. It is this interlocking of contrac
tual requirements, restrictions, and obligations
that makes the whole much more objectionable
than each of its parts might suggest. The Univer
sity's rights and obligations to establish, main
tain, and judge its own standards of academics,
course of study, and student conduct is funda
mental to our conception of the university as
defined above.
D. Academic Objections.
In considering the academic aspects of the
problem, the Committee heard public testimony
that ROTC courses were of very high calibre. We
do not wish to contest this, though members of
the Committee have also heard informally and
confidentially that the contrary is also sometimes
the case. Whatever may be the truth of the mat
ter, the Majority's objections do not rest on these
grounds, but on the inherent goals of these
courses.
D.l Course Goals. Although in recent
years the Department of Defense instruction
plans for the ROTC programs have allowed Pro
fessors of Military Science increasing flexibility
in the choice of text materials and in course sub
stitution, the ultimate goals of these programs
are still fixed by the Department of Defense.
These goals are not compatible with the Univer
sity's "primary commitment to the creation and
dissemination of knowledge, in an environment
of free intellectual activity." The primary goal of
the ROTC programs is to educate, train, and eval
uate junior officers for the U.S. Armed Forces.
The Plan for NROTC Instructional Program
(Navpers 93941, May 1968) defines as "major
goals":
(1) To assist in the education of the
midshipman in a major field of study of interest
to the Navy or Marine Corps leading to a bacca
laureate degree.
(2) To provide the midshipman with
the fundamental concepts and principles of Naval
Science and with the professional Naval knowl
edge necessary to establish a sound basis for his
future growth as a Naval or Marine Corps officer.
(3) To prepare the midshipman for
service with the highest sense of honor and integ
rity as a commissioned officer; to cultivate the
essential elements of military leadership; to fos
ter the growth of a strong sense of loyalty and
dedication to his Service and to the Nation.
(4) To prepare the midshipman to
undertake successfully in later periods of his
career, advanced/continuing education in a field
of application and interest to the Naval Service.
(5) To inject the values of civilian
higher education into the Naval Service by utili
zing the expertise of civilian faculty instruction
where applicable. (Italics ours)
The Army Program of Instruction states that the
objectives of ROTC are "to procure and produce
junior officers who by education, training, atti
tude and inherent qualities are suitable for con
tinued development as officers in the Army."
And the Air Force ROTC mission "is to commis
sion career-oriented second lieutenants in res
ponse to Air Force requirements" by successfully
accomplishing the following four objectives:
(1) Identify, motivate, and select
qualified students to complete the Air Force
ROTC program.
(2) Provide college-level education
that will qualify cadets for commissioning in the
U.S. Air Force.
(3) Heighten each cadet's apprecia
tion of, and dedication to, American principles,
give him an understanding of how the Air Force
serves the national interest, and develop his po
tential as a leader and manager and his under
standing of officer professionalism in the Air
Force.
(4) Commission in the U.S. Air
Force high quality second lieutenants. (Italics
ours)
The goals of these programs are clearly non
academic in nature. Given the goals of these pro
grams as defined above, Military Science instruc
tors are legally and ethically obligated to present
their course material from restricted points of
view, to evaluate the student's fitness for a mili
tary career partly on these grounds, and to report
this evaluation to higher authorities.
Since the goals of the ROTC Programs are to
educate potential officers, much of the current
Military Science course content—weapons sys
tems, small-unit tactics, Army administration, or
ientation, counter-insurgency, etc.—is of such a
narrowly pragmatic, professional nature as to be
incompatible with an undergraduate academic
credit program. Although the Minority Report's
proposed Committee on Military Studies might
deny academic credit to some of these "nuts and
bolts" courses, others might remain in the credit
program. And indeed, one might question
whether any course with the goals outlined above
merits inclusion in Stanford's academic credit
structure. Although knowledge is disseminated in
ROTC courses, it is rarely created in an environ
ment of free intellectual activity; and it is dissem
inated to the end that committed junior officers

to enter the U.S. Armed Forces. The Military
Science Programs' lack of awareness of what we
believe to be the primary commitment of the
University is further evidenced in their equation
of the "values of civilian higher education" with
the "expertise of civilian faculty where applic
able." (NROTC Goals No. 5)
D.2. Course Substitution. The substitu
tion of courses in regular academic departments
for courses presently taught by the ROTC fac
ulty (particularly U.S. military history and U.S.
foreign policy) has been frequently suggested.
This has some attractive features, but these
should not blind one to the problems it also en
tails.
D.2.a. Such courses would have to
meet the goals set forth by the armed forces.
Senior ROTC faculty are being granted wide lati
tude in determining whether or not goals are
being met by a particular course, but it is never
theless true that the scope, coverage, and content
of such courses will be under periodic review by
the military establishment.
D.2.b. If such a course is built into
the ROTC curriculum and required of all cadets,
then the presumption exists that the course will
meet the needs of the ROTC in scope, coverage,
approach, and frequency of offering. TTie faculty
member will have to take these considerations
into account in planning course changes, leave
periods, etc. If such a required course fails for
any reason to meet ROTC needs, the ROTC must
reassume part or all of the instruction in that
area, or drop the requirement. But then course
substitution is either lost or was unnecessary in
the first place.
D.2.C. If such a course is to be op
tional for ROTC cadets, then some other options
must be available. This presumes one of three
things: (a) that other equivalent courses are avail
able in the academic departments, (b) that the
ROTC faculty provide the equivalent, or (c) that
cadets need not receive training in that particular
area. The revised ROTC instructional programs
seem to rule out the last; normal University prac
tice makes the first unlikely. Thus, here too, the
advantages of course substitution may be lost.
Finally, it should be noted that it will be difficult
to ensure that the course is in fact "optional." If
other options are limited, and if cadets are
"strongly urged" to enroll in a particular course,
is that course truly optional?
D.2.d. Course substitution will in
crease both the direct and indirect subsidy of
Stanford to the ROTC by assuming part of the
training of ROTC cadets (see below). It will add
to the work of the academic department and the
individual faculty member by the number of stu
dents who would not otherwise have enrolled in
his course (this could, for example, require addi
tional expenditures for T.A.'s, readers, etc.). The
call upon the resources of the ROTC programs
will be correspondingly lightened.
D.3. Departmental Status. An academic
department shares much the same definition as
the institution of which it is a part, with particu
lar reference to a specific area and/or discipline.
When a student has demonstrated a certain com
petence in this area or discipline, he is recom
mended for a degree, either at the undergraduate
or graduate level. The Departments of Military
Science do not do this at either level; rather, they
offer commissions in the Armed Forces to the
men who successfully complete their programs.
Unlike other departments or schools in the Uni
versity, the ROTC Departments are educating
young men not to academic ends but to work for
a specific employer in a specific area.
The Minority recommends combining the
three ROTC Departments into a single Depart
ment of Military Studies, no longer to be lodged
in the School of Humanities and Sciences but to
be responsible to the Provost via a Committee on
Military Studies. The Majority believes this is a
recognition of the anomalous nature of such a
department, which has neither undergraduate nor
graduate majors and serves non-academic ends.
D.4. Faculty Search and Appointment.
The Military Science Departments' faculty is ap
pointed in an irregular way. The appointment
procedure for Military Science personnel by
passes both department-initiated search and eval
uation, and the normal administrative ratification
process. Whenever a position becomes vacant, the
appropriate branch of the Armed Services pre
sents nominations for the position to the Pro
vost's Office. The administration may veto any
military nominations. (It has done so at least
three times.) The nominee's military record and
college transcripts are examined and, whenever
possible, a personal interview is held. Though
ROTC faculty are presently members of the Aca
demic Council, they are not subject to the usual
University policy on tenure, for the Defense De
partment agrees to recall them immediately at
the request of the administration. (Stanford has
exercised this option once in recent years.) Fur
thermore, the Department of Defense reserves
the right to transfer from Stanford any assigned
military personnel. Thus, under present arrange
ments, an external organization may unilaterally
remove a member of the Stanford faculty.
This irregular appointment and retention pro
cedure violates the principle that the primary re
sponsibility for faculty appointment and status
rests with the Stanford faculty and administra
tion. Secondly, it creates a special class of faculty
members having some characteristics not shared
by the regular faculty and lacking others.
Thirdly, since Stanford cannot initiate the search
nor fully supervise the screening process, the Uni
versity loses some degree of control over the
quality of the ROTC faculty. These irregular fea
tures would continue, even under revised proced
ures.
IV. Objections to ROTC as An Organized, Non
credit, On-Campus Program
The previous section reviews our objections,
both general and specific, to ROTC as an aca
demic program at Stanford. Having come to this
point, the Majority gave serious consideration to
retention of ROTC on campus as an organized,
non-credit program of education and training. We
believe such an arrangement may be an improve
ment over both the present situation and the rec
ommendations of the Minority. But it is the con
viction of the Majority that the logic of the gen
eral objections must apply generally to the rela
tions between ROTC and Stanford. To recom
mend termination of academic credit and reten
tion of non-credit ROTC programs is to accept
the argument with respect to the former but fail
to apply it to the latter. We here recapitulate
those considerations with reference to ROTC as
an on-campus, non-credit program of training
and education.
A. What has been termed "conflict of inter
est" would continue, since ROTC would remain
the corporate representation of the armed forces
within the structure of the University, staffed by
professional military officers. If ROTC is re
tained as a non-credit program, several opera
tional problems will grow directly out of the fact

that ROTC will remain in the University but not
of the University. Any solution of these prob
lems will constitute recognition of the anomalous
nature of the arrangement.
1. Would the ROTC programs, singly or
collectively, continue as "Department(s)?" If
not, what status should they have? On what
grounds would such a decision be made?
2. The same questions apply to the status
of ROTC faculty. Shall formal academic rank be
accorded, as presently required by law? To
whom, at what level, and on what grounds?
3. How shall the University handle search
and appointment procedures for persons offering
no accredited work, but who present courses re
quired of a certain proportion of the student
body?
4. How shall the University oversee the
content and mode of instruction in these non
credit but required courses?
B. The primary goal of the ROTC programs
would remain, as before, the recruitment and
training of junior officers. Thus, specific training
for employment by an outside organization, car
ried on by members of that organization, would
continue.
C. Institutional contracts would remain,
though perhaps in a modified form. Thus, dispro
portionate subsidization of the military at Stan
ford would continue: direct subsidies in the form
of facilities, services, etc.; indirect subsidies in
the form of course substitution, etc.
D. Individual contracts, requiring participa
tion in ROTC training programs on-campus by
signatories, would continue. It is here not the
existence of such contracts that is objected to;
rather it is to the institutional sanction and sup
port given these contracts by Stanford Univer
sity.
V. Recommendations
Thus far the Majority has emphasized those
aspects of the present ROTC which make them
objectionable to the point of incompatibility
with the University. We believe such analysis,
while lengthy and complex, is necessary when
ever a significant change is recommended for an
on-going academic program. Also required is
some projection of the nature and structure of
the revised program. That is, having dealt with
objections in the relationship between Stanford
and the ROTC departments, what is considered
to be the proper relationship?
It should be noted, first, that no accurate pro
jection can be made because it is not known
what limits the Department of Defense has for its
junior officer procurement program. We cannot
predict what will be acceptable to the military
services beyond existing operational and legal
constraints.
Secondly, the Majority believes the issue of
proper relations is confused by excessive reliance
on the term "ROTC." The Majority has empha
sized the distinction between ROTC as a mech
anism and the objectives which ROTC serves.
Our arguments have been directed to the mech
anism, not the objectives or purposes. Misinter
pretation arises if this distinction is obscured. If
the language of the Senate's charge is taken to
mean that "ROTC" denotes an organized on
campus program of eduation and training, then
the Majority is compelled to state there can be
no "proper relations between the ROTC depart
ments and Stanford." This, in turn, can mis
takenly be construed to mean that the Majority
believes no proper relations can be established
between the objectives served by the existing de
partments and Stanford.
It is likely that the program which we recom
mend would not and should not be denoted as
"ROTC." This is accurate insofar as the program
has been substantially altered and does not con
form to present programs of ROTC. But any new
denotation should not be interpreted to mean
that we have sought to abolish all relations be
tween Stanford and the purposes of the existing
ROTC programs or that we have concluded that
no proper relations can be established. Rather we
believe that for proper relations to exist, a new
mechanism must be created —one that differs
from the present program, but can still serve the
same purposes in such a way as to be compatible
with the University.
We envision relations whereby each service of
the armed forces would assign personnel to
manage an administrative apparatus, with space
provided possibly in the Dean of Students' Office
of Special Services, that would concern itself
with recruitment of students into the program,
process the revised student contracts and scholar
ships, offer professional counseling and informa
tion to individuals as well as to the existing stu
dent voluntary groups representative of the three
services on campus. Further, this Armed Forces
Officers Program would arrange with enrolled
students for off-campus training and education.
We believe that all education presently offered
by the ROTC departments could be transferred
to extended summer encampments. The military
personnel on campus would be free to offer vol
untary undergraduate special courses, as are
other members of the Stanford community, fol
lowing the guidelines established by the Commit
tee on Undergraduate Education.
To these ends, we recommend the following:
1. After a transitional period (see recom
mendation 5 below), there should be no aca
demic credit received for participation in pro
grams of military training and education.
2. By the end of this period, non-credit,
required military training and education should
no longer be offered on the Stanford campus.
Consistent with these recommendations, a
scholarship or contract "program" may remain,
comprising normal academic education, supple
mented by on-campus voluntary activities and
off-campus training.
3. By the end of this period, all remaining
military programs or activities should be regu
lated by the University's general policies on Stan
ford Voluntary Organizations. No Stanford fac
ulty member or administrator, acting as a spokes
man for the University, shall encourage students
to participate in military training and education,
except in the manner in which participation in all
voluntary activities is encouraged.
4. Individual contracts between Stanford
students and the armed forces should be revised
to reflect actual practice. We recommend further
that punitive clauses involving enlisted service be
removed.
5. These provisions should be in force by
the fall term 1973. Beginning with the fall term
1970, no entering freshman shall be granted aca
demic credit for ROTC activities. The three
ROTC departments should be replaced by a sin
gle Armed Forces Officers Program no later than
fall term 1973. This program shall be for the
purposes of administration, counseling, and re
cruiting for off-campus reserve officer training
and education. (N.B. Because present institu
tional contracts specify one year's notice prior to
termination, the phase-out process cannot begin
before 1970.)
6. Appropriate University authorities
should promptly initiate action leading to re
vision or termination of the contracts between
Stanford and the armed forces (a) in order to
enable the phase-out to begin in 1970, and (b) in
order to reflect the voluntary, non-credit status
of military training at Stanford. We further rec
ommend that a committee be appointed, com
posed of representatives of faculty, administra
tion, military science department, and students,
to assist in effecting the transition.
7. During the transitional period, we rec
ommend that the status of officers presently at
tached to ROTC units remain unchanged. Until
the fall term 1973, newly assigned officers shall
carry the rank of "Lecturer," except for the
newly assigned senior officers of each branch of
the armed forces, who shall carry the rank of
"Lecturer with rank of Professor." After the be
ginning of the 1973-74 academic year, represen
tatives of the armed forces at Stanford shall carry
no academic rank. Similarly until this time, the
departmental and administrative structure of the
ROTC program shall remain as at present.
8. Students already enrolled in ROTC pro
grams, and those enrolling prior to the fall term
1970, shall continue as at present, except that
present contracts should be revised in accord
with recommendation 4.

because our charge as a committee limits us to
these programs.
The Majority believes that there are both gen
eral and specific objections which will continue
to exist as long as ROTC is a program integral to
the institutional structure of the University.
A. Conflict of Interest. The ROTC faculty,
being detailed to Stanford on a limited tour of
duty, remain professional military officers who
legally and ethically owe primary loyalty to the
branch of the service they represent, to the
armed forces, and to the U.S. government. This
means that, however high their integrity and
quality of mind, they cannot at the same time
have a primary commitment either to Stanford
University or to the academic enterprise. This
dual identity should be recognized as a conflict
of interest. The government itself recognizes very
clearly the potential peril of conflict-of-interest
situations, and rightly expects public servants
scrupulously to avoid them. It should be noted
that neither the government's position nor ours
rests upon the fact or even the presumption of
improper behavior.
Because this consideration applies to all mili
tary members of the ROTC, it therefore applies
by extension to the ROTC programs themselves.
These programs, as corporate entities—present
H&S departments—are themselves in a potential
conflict-of-interest situation with respect to the
University.
We recognize that other instances of conflict
of interest are by no means rare in the university;
these too are unfortunate. But they are individ
ual rather than collective, and they are character
ized, in nearly all cases, by a primary commit
ment to the University (note that the University
limits outside activities to an average of one day
per week).
B. Training for a specific employer, by that
employer. The ROTC programs represent the
corporate, institutional presence of an external
organization, which engages in specific training
of candidates for temporary or permanent em
ploy by that organization. The issue raised here is
not simply that of professional or pre-profes
sional training, but of such training carried on
by the armed forces, in the interests of the armed
forces. The Majority believes that such training
should not be a part of the academic structure of
the University.
C. Contractual Arrangements. The objection
able features of the present contracts can be con
sidered under two headings: contractual arrange
ments between the armed forces and Stanford
University, and between the armed forces and
individual students. While some of these arrange
ments may be subject to change, others would
not. Some are specified by the Vitalization Act
of 1964 and could not be changed except
through action by Congress.
C.l. Institutional Contracts. The contracts
between Stanford and the various military ser
vices provide for government commitment of an
academic and administrative staff, an instruc
tional program, government equipment, staff
salaries, and student financial assistance. In re
turn the University agrees to the establishment of
military science department, provision of class
rooms, offices and drill areas, appropriate aca
demic credit for military science courses, and a
minimum sustaining enrollment and output of
officers. In the case of the Army, representation
on all faculty committees whose recommenda
tions would directly affect the Department of
Military Science is stipulated. These contracts
further provide for prior approval and right of
dismissal by Stanford of all military officers as
signed to the department, assignment of the rank
of professor to the senior commissioned officer
of each service assigned to the institution and
lesser academic rank to other members of the
staffs, and the right of the Secretary of the mili
tary service involved to relieve from duty any
officer or enlisted man assigned to work at Stan
ford. These terms represent a partial abdication
of University control over the governance of its
own affairs.
It should be recognized that these arrange
ments result in a Stanford subsidy to the ROTC
programs. Stanford is obliged to provide facili
ties, services, and financial support to the ROTC
programs on a cost-free basis. For example, the
Air Force contract stipulates that Stanford pro
vide:
(1) "the necessary classrooms, administra
tive offices, storage spaces, government
vehicle parking areas, staff parking
areas and other required facilities in
the same manner and at the same level
as is provided to other Departments of
the Institution."
(2) "adequate secretarial, janitorial, and
telephone services ... on the same
basis as is provided to other Depart
ments within the Institution."
An increase in course substitution (see below
D.2.) .while desirable in some ways, will increase
the subsidy by relieving the ROTC programs of
that part of their instructional requirements. In
the Majority's view, such subsidies of the armed
forces are inappropriate.
C.2. Contractual Agreements between
Stanford ROTC Students and the Army, Navy
and Air Force. In this section the committee
states its objections to certain terms contained in
the existing contracts between Stanford ROTC
students and the three military services. It is to
be understood that the Committee does not ob
ject to a student entering into a legal and private
contractual agreement as long as the terms of
said agreement are neither contrary to the aca
demic goals and standards of the university nor
encroachments upon the university's integrity as
an institution of higher learning.
The Committee heard substantial testimony
to the effect that there exists a considerable dif
ference between de facto practice and de jure
obligations. Specifically, it has been the practice
of the three services to terminate a four-year fin
ancial-assistance contract in the first two years
without penalty or prejudice. This has a mitiga
ting effect but leaves the legal provisions of the
contracts technically intact.
C.2.a. Academic Prescriptions. All
three services require certain specified courses of
study. By contract, the student must follow this
prescribed course of study. In addition, the
Navy financial assistant program specifically ex
cludes certain courses of study, and the Air
Force contracts for certain courses of study.
These restrictions and requirements conflict with
the Majority view that Stanford undergraduates
should not be found by law to take and complete
a course of study prescribed by some agent or
agency external to the University, when that
agency also determines (directly or indirectly)
the mode and content of instruction of all or
part of the prescribed course.
All three services require that ROTC cadets
meet certain academic standards. The Majority
believes that Stanford undergraduates should not
be bound by law to maintain academic standards
prescribed by an external agency, especially
when that agency also participates in determining
whether or not such standards have been met.

C.2.b. Personal Conduct. All three
services require that the cadet maintain certain
unspecified standards of personal and moral con
duct. The Majority feels that such restrictions
can seriously limit the student's free participa
tion in all facets of intellectual inquiry and legal
political activity. Furthermore, the Navy finan
cial assistance contract stipulates that the candi
date "remain unmarried until commissioned."
These standards too are established by an agency
external to the University, and judgments con
cerning them are made by the same agency.
While the Majority recognizes the special require
ments of the armed forces and could not object
to similar conditions in contracts between indi
vidual students and the military services when
not a part of a university program or activity, it
can and does object to such conditions when
they are a part of a University-subsidized and
sanctioned activity.
C.2.c. Punitive Clauses. All three ser
vices include in their financial assistance con
tracts clauses that bind the student to a period of
enlisted service for "willfully evading" stipulated
terms. Despite the fact that these clauses have
rarely been invoked at Stanford, the Majority
deems them clearly punitive in intent, and feels
that they unduly infringe the student's freedom
within the University community.
C.2.d. Contracts for Service. To our
knowledge, the ROTC contracts are the only
University-sponsored and sanctioned contracts
on the undergraduate level that bind a student to
service. There are various loan programs such as
the NDEA which allow teaching service to act in
lieu of repayments. Still, these loan programs do
not require service, since the loans can be repaid
with appropriate interest over a period of years.
The ROTC financial assistance grants have no
such provision.
The Majority wishes to point out that these
contractual restrictions and/or obligations oper
ate as a whole. The punitive clauses operate in
relation to academic standards requirements,
course of study requirements, conduct require
ments, and service requirements. The service obli
gation is intimately related to the course of study
requirements. It is this interlocking of contrac
tual requirements, restrictions, and obligations
that makes the whole much more objectionable
than each of its parts might suggest. The Univer
sity's rights and obligations to establish, main
tain, and judge its own standards of academics,
course of study, and student conduct is funda
mental to our conception of the university as
defined above.
D. Academic Objections.
In considering the academic aspects of the
problem, the Committee heard public testimony
that ROTC courses were of very high calibre. We
do not wish to contest this, though members of
the Committee have also heard informally and
confidentially that the contrary is also sometimes
the case. Whatever may be the truth of the mat
ter, the Majority's objections do not rest on these
grounds, but on the inherent goals of these
courses.
D.l Course Goals. Although in recent
years the Department of Defense instruction
plans for the ROTC programs have allowed Pro
fessors of Military Science increasing flexibility
in the choice of text materials and in course sub
stitution, the ultimate goals of these programs
are still fixed by the Department of Defense.
These goals are not compatible with the Univer
sity's "primary commitment to the creation and
dissemination of knowledge, in an environment
of free intellectual activity." The primary goal of
the ROTC programs is to educate, train, and eval
uate junior officers for the U.S. Armed Forces.
The Plan for NROTC Instructional Program
(Navpers 93941, May 1968) defines as "major
goals":
(1) To assist in the education of the
midshipman in a major field of study of interest
to the Navy or Marine Corps leading to a bacca
laureate degree.
(2) To provide the midshipman with
the fundamental concepts and principles of Naval
Science and with the professional Naval knowl
edge necessary to establish a sound basis for his
future growth as a Naval or Marine Corps officer.
(3) To prepare the midshipman for
service with the highest sense of honor and integ
rity as a commissioned officer; to cultivate the
essential elements of military leadership; to fos
ter the growth of a strong sense of loyalty and
dedication to his Service and to the Nation.
(4) To prepare the midshipman to
undertake successfully in later periods of his
career, advanced/continuing education in a field
of application and interest to the Naval Service.
(5) To inject the values of civilian
higher education into the Naval Service by utili
zing the expertise of civilian faculty instruction
where applicable. (Italics ours)
The Army Program of Instruction states that the
objectives of ROTC are "to procure and produce
junior officers who by education, training, atti
tude and inherent qualities are suitable for con
tinued development as officers in the Army."
And the Air Force ROTC mission "is to commis
sion career-oriented second lieutenants in res
ponse to Air Force requirements" by successfully
accomplishing the following four objectives:
(1) Identify, motivate, and select
qualified students to complete the Air Force
ROTC program.
(2) Provide college-level education
that will qualify cadets for commissioning in the
U.S. Air Force.
(3) Heighten each cadet's apprecia
tion of, and dedication to, American principles,
give him an understanding of how the Air Force
serves the national interest, and develop his po
tential as a leader and manager and his under
standing of officer professionalism in the Air
Force.
(4) Commission in the U.S. Air
Force high quality second lieutenants. (Italics
ours)
The goals of these programs are clearly non
academic in nature. Given the goals of these pro
grams as defined above, Military Science instruc
tors are legally and ethically obligated to present
their course material from restricted points of
view, to evaluate the student's fitness for a mili
tary career partly on these grounds, and to report
this evaluation to higher authorities.
Since the goals of the ROTC Programs are to
educate potential officers, much of the current
Military Science course content—weapons sys
tems, small-unit tactics, Army administration, or
ientation, counter-insurgency, etc.—is of such a
narrowly pragmatic, professional nature as to be
incompatible with an undergraduate academic
credit program. Although the Minority Report's
proposed Committee on Military Studies might
deny academic credit to some of these "nuts and
bolts" courses, others might remain in the credit
program. And indeed, one might question
whether any course with the goals outlined above
merits inclusion in Stanford's academic credit
structure. Although knowledge is disseminated in
ROTC courses, it is rarely created in an environ
ment of free intellectual activity; and it is dissem
inated to the end that committed junior officers

to enter the U.S. Armed Forces. The Military
Science Programs' lack of awareness of what we
believe to be the primary commitment of the
University is further evidenced in their equation
of the "values of civilian higher education" with
the "expertise of civilian faculty where applic
able." (NROTC Goals No. 5)
D.2. Course Substitution. The substitu
tion of courses in regular academic departments
for courses presently taught by the ROTC fac
ulty (particularly U.S. military history and U.S.
foreign policy) has been frequently suggested.
This has some attractive features, but these
should not blind one to the problems it also en
tails.
D.2.a. Such courses would have to
meet the goals set forth by the armed forces.
Senior ROTC faculty are being granted wide lati
tude in determining whether or not goals are
being met by a particular course, but it is never
theless true that the scope, coverage, and content
of such courses will be under periodic review by
the military establishment.
D.2.b. If such a course is built into
the ROTC curriculum and required of all cadets,
then the presumption exists that the course will
meet the needs of the ROTC in scope, coverage,
approach, and frequency of offering. TTie faculty
member will have to take these considerations
into account in planning course changes, leave
periods, etc. If such a required course fails for
any reason to meet ROTC needs, the ROTC must
reassume part or all of the instruction in that
area, or drop the requirement. But then course
substitution is either lost or was unnecessary in
the first place.
D.2.C. If such a course is to be op
tional for ROTC cadets, then some other options
must be available. This presumes one of three
things: (a) that other equivalent courses are avail
able in the academic departments, (b) that the
ROTC faculty provide the equivalent, or (c) that
cadets need not receive training in that particular
area. The revised ROTC instructional programs
seem to rule out the last; normal University prac
tice makes the first unlikely. Thus, here too, the
advantages of course substitution may be lost.
Finally, it should be noted that it will be difficult
to ensure that the course is in fact "optional." If
other options are limited, and if cadets are
"strongly urged" to enroll in a particular course,
is that course truly optional?
D.2.d. Course substitution will in
crease both the direct and indirect subsidy of
Stanford to the ROTC by assuming part of the
training of ROTC cadets (see below). It will add
to the work of the academic department and the
individual faculty member by the number of stu
dents who would not otherwise have enrolled in
his course (this could, for example, require addi
tional expenditures for T.A.'s, readers, etc.). The
call upon the resources of the ROTC programs
will be correspondingly lightened.
D.3. Departmental Status. An academic
department shares much the same definition as
the institution of which it is a part, with particu
lar reference to a specific area and/or discipline.
When a student has demonstrated a certain com
petence in this area or discipline, he is recom
mended for a degree, either at the undergraduate
or graduate level. The Departments of Military
Science do not do this at either level; rather, they
offer commissions in the Armed Forces to the
men who successfully complete their programs.
Unlike other departments or schools in the Uni
versity, the ROTC Departments are educating
young men not to academic ends but to work for
a specific employer in a specific area.
The Minority recommends combining the
three ROTC Departments into a single Depart
ment of Military Studies, no longer to be lodged
in the School of Humanities and Sciences but to
be responsible to the Provost via a Committee on
Military Studies. The Majority believes this is a
recognition of the anomalous nature of such a
department, which has neither undergraduate nor
graduate majors and serves non-academic ends.
D.4. Faculty Search and Appointment.
The Military Science Departments' faculty is ap
pointed in an irregular way. The appointment
procedure for Military Science personnel by
passes both department-initiated search and eval
uation, and the normal administrative ratification
process. Whenever a position becomes vacant, the
appropriate branch of the Armed Services pre
sents nominations for the position to the Pro
vost's Office. The administration may veto any
military nominations. (It has done so at least
three times.) The nominee's military record and
college transcripts are examined and, whenever
possible, a personal interview is held. Though
ROTC faculty are presently members of the Aca
demic Council, they are not subject to the usual
University policy on tenure, for the Defense De
partment agrees to recall them immediately at
the request of the administration. (Stanford has
exercised this option once in recent years.) Fur
thermore, the Department of Defense reserves
the right to transfer from Stanford any assigned
military personnel. Thus, under present arrange
ments, an external organization may unilaterally
remove a member of the Stanford faculty.
This irregular appointment and retention pro
cedure violates the principle that the primary re
sponsibility for faculty appointment and status
rests with the Stanford faculty and administra
tion. Secondly, it creates a special class of faculty
members having some characteristics not shared
by the regular faculty and lacking others.
Thirdly, since Stanford cannot initiate the search
nor fully supervise the screening process, the Uni
versity loses some degree of control over the
quality of the ROTC faculty. These irregular fea
tures would continue, even under revised proced
ures.
IV. Objections to ROTC as An Organized, Non
credit, On-Campus Program
The previous section reviews our objections,
both general and specific, to ROTC as an aca
demic program at Stanford. Having come to this
point, the Majority gave serious consideration to
retention of ROTC on campus as an organized,
non-credit program of education and training. We
believe such an arrangement may be an improve
ment over both the present situation and the rec
ommendations of the Minority. But it is the con
viction of the Majority that the logic of the gen
eral objections must apply generally to the rela
tions between ROTC and Stanford. To recom
mend termination of academic credit and reten
tion of non-credit ROTC programs is to accept
the argument with respect to the former but fail
to apply it to the latter. We here recapitulate
those considerations with reference to ROTC as
an on-campus, non-credit program of training
and education.
A. What has been termed "conflict of inter
est" would continue, since ROTC would remain
the corporate representation of the armed forces
within the structure of the University, staffed by
professional military officers. If ROTC is re
tained as a non-credit program, several opera
tional problems will grow directly out of the fact

that ROTC will remain in the University but not
of the University. Any solution of these prob
lems will constitute recognition of the anomalous
nature of the arrangement.
1. Would the ROTC programs, singly or
collectively, continue as "Department(s)?" If
not, what status should they have? On what
grounds would such a decision be made?
2. The same questions apply to the status
of ROTC faculty. Shall formal academic rank be
accorded, as presently required by law? To
whom, at what level, and on what grounds?
3. How shall the University handle search
and appointment procedures for persons offering
no accredited work, but who present courses re
quired of a certain proportion of the student
body?
4. How shall the University oversee the
content and mode of instruction in these non
credit but required courses?
B. The primary goal of the ROTC programs
would remain, as before, the recruitment and
training of junior officers. Thus, specific training
for employment by an outside organization, car
ried on by members of that organization, would
continue.
C. Institutional contracts would remain,
though perhaps in a modified form. Thus, dispro
portionate subsidization of the military at Stan
ford would continue: direct subsidies in the form
of facilities, services, etc.; indirect subsidies in
the form of course substitution, etc.
D. Individual contracts, requiring participa
tion in ROTC training programs on-campus by
signatories, would continue. It is here not the
existence of such contracts that is objected to;
rather it is to the institutional sanction and sup
port given these contracts by Stanford Univer
sity.
V. Recommendations
Thus far the Majority has emphasized those
aspects of the present ROTC which make them
objectionable to the point of incompatibility
with the University. We believe such analysis,
while lengthy and complex, is necessary when
ever a significant change is recommended for an
on-going academic program. Also required is
some projection of the nature and structure of
the revised program. That is, having dealt with
objections in the relationship between Stanford
and the ROTC departments, what is considered
to be the proper relationship?
It should be noted, first, that no accurate pro
jection can be made because it is not known
what limits the Department of Defense has for its
junior officer procurement program. We cannot
predict what will be acceptable to the military
services beyond existing operational and legal
constraints.
Secondly, the Majority believes the issue of
proper relations is confused by excessive reliance
on the term "ROTC." The Majority has empha
sized the distinction between ROTC as a mech
anism and the objectives which ROTC serves.
Our arguments have been directed to the mech
anism, not the objectives or purposes. Misinter
pretation arises if this distinction is obscured. If
the language of the Senate's charge is taken to
mean that "ROTC" denotes an organized on
campus program of eduation and training, then
the Majority is compelled to state there can be
no "proper relations between the ROTC depart
ments and Stanford." This, in turn, can mis
takenly be construed to mean that the Majority
believes no proper relations can be established
between the objectives served by the existing de
partments and Stanford.
It is likely that the program which we recom
mend would not and should not be denoted as
"ROTC." This is accurate insofar as the program
has been substantially altered and does not con
form to present programs of ROTC. But any new
denotation should not be interpreted to mean
that we have sought to abolish all relations be
tween Stanford and the purposes of the existing
ROTC programs or that we have concluded that
no proper relations can be established. Rather we
believe that for proper relations to exist, a new
mechanism must be created —one that differs
from the present program, but can still serve the
same purposes in such a way as to be compatible
with the University.
We envision relations whereby each service of
the armed forces would assign personnel to
manage an administrative apparatus, with space
provided possibly in the Dean of Students' Office
of Special Services, that would concern itself
with recruitment of students into the program,
process the revised student contracts and scholar
ships, offer professional counseling and informa
tion to individuals as well as to the existing stu
dent voluntary groups representative of the three
services on campus. Further, this Armed Forces
Officers Program would arrange with enrolled
students for off-campus training and education.
We believe that all education presently offered
by the ROTC departments could be transferred
to extended summer encampments. The military
personnel on campus would be free to offer vol
untary undergraduate special courses, as are
other members of the Stanford community, fol
lowing the guidelines established by the Commit
tee on Undergraduate Education.
To these ends, we recommend the following:
1. After a transitional period (see recom
mendation 5 below), there should be no aca
demic credit received for participation in pro
grams of military training and education.
2. By the end of this period, non-credit,
required military training and education should
no longer be offered on the Stanford campus.
Consistent with these recommendations, a
scholarship or contract "program" may remain,
comprising normal academic education, supple
mented by on-campus voluntary activities and
off-campus training.
3. By the end of this period, all remaining
military programs or activities should be regu
lated by the University's general policies on Stan
ford Voluntary Organizations. No Stanford fac
ulty member or administrator, acting as a spokes
man for the University, shall encourage students
to participate in military training and education,
except in the manner in which participation in all
voluntary activities is encouraged.
4. Individual contracts between Stanford
students and the armed forces should be revised
to reflect actual practice. We recommend further
that punitive clauses involving enlisted service be
removed.
5. These provisions should be in force by
the fall term 1973. Beginning with the fall term
1970, no entering freshman shall be granted aca
demic credit for ROTC activities. The three
ROTC departments should be replaced by a sin
gle Armed Forces Officers Program no later than
fall term 1973. This program shall be for the
purposes of administration, counseling, and re
cruiting for off-campus reserve officer training
and education. (N.B. Because present institu
tional contracts specify one year's notice prior to
termination, the phase-out process cannot begin
before 1970.)
6. Appropriate University authorities
should promptly initiate action leading to re
vision or termination of the contracts between
Stanford and the armed forces (a) in order to
enable the phase-out to begin in 1970, and (b) in
order to reflect the voluntary, non-credit status
of military training at Stanford. We further rec
ommend that a committee be appointed, com
posed of representatives of faculty, administra
tion, military science department, and students,
to assist in effecting the transition.
7. During the transitional period, we rec
ommend that the status of officers presently at
tached to ROTC units remain unchanged. Until
the fall term 1973, newly assigned officers shall
carry the rank of "Lecturer," except for the
newly assigned senior officers of each branch of
the armed forces, who shall carry the rank of
"Lecturer with rank of Professor." After the be
ginning of the 1973-74 academic year, represen
tatives of the armed forces at Stanford shall carry
no academic rank. Similarly until this time, the
departmental and administrative structure of the
ROTC program shall remain as at present.
8. Students already enrolled in ROTC pro
grams, and those enrolling prior to the fall term
1970, shall continue as at present, except that
present contracts should be revised in accord
with recommendation 4.

because our charge as a committee limits us to
these programs.
The Majority believes that there are both gen
eral and specific objections which will continue
to exist as long as ROTC is a program integral to
the institutional structure of the University.
A. Conflict of Interest. The ROTC faculty,
being detailed to Stanford on a limited tour of
duty, remain professional military officers who
legally and ethically owe primary loyalty to the
branch of the service they represent, to the
armed forces, and to the U.S. government. This
means that, however high their integrity and
quality of mind, they cannot at the same time
have a primary commitment either to Stanford
University or to the academic enterprise. This
dual identity should be recognized as a conflict
of interest. The government itself recognizes very
clearly the potential peril of conflict-of-interest
situations, and rightly expects public servants
scrupulously to avoid them. It should be noted
that neither the government's position nor ours
rests upon the fact or even the presumption of
improper behavior.
Because this consideration applies to all mili
tary members of the ROTC, it therefore applies
by extension to the ROTC programs themselves.
These programs, as corporate entities—present
H&S departments—are themselves in a potential
conflict-of-interest situation with respect to the
University.
We recognize that other instances of conflict
of interest are by no means rare in the university;
these too are unfortunate. But they are individ
ual rather than collective, and they are character
ized, in nearly all cases, by a primary commit
ment to the University (note that the University
limits outside activities to an average of one day
per week).
B. Training for a specific employer, by that
employer. The ROTC programs represent the
corporate, institutional presence of an external
organization, which engages in specific training
of candidates for temporary or permanent em
ploy by that organization. The issue raised here is
not simply that of professional or pre-profes
sional training, but of such training carried on
by the armed forces, in the interests of the armed
forces. The Majority believes that such training
should not be a part of the academic structure of
the University.
C. Contractual Arrangements. The objection
able features of the present contracts can be con
sidered under two headings: contractual arrange
ments between the armed forces and Stanford
University, and between the armed forces and
individual students. While some of these arrange
ments may be subject to change, others would
not. Some are specified by the Vitalization Act
of 1964 and could not be changed except
through action by Congress.
C.l. Institutional Contracts. The contracts
between Stanford and the various military ser
vices provide for government commitment of an
academic and administrative staff, an instruc
tional program, government equipment, staff
salaries, and student financial assistance. In re
turn the University agrees to the establishment of
military science department, provision of class
rooms, offices and drill areas, appropriate aca
demic credit for military science courses, and a
minimum sustaining enrollment and output of
officers. In the case of the Army, representation
on all faculty committees whose recommenda
tions would directly affect the Department of
Military Science is stipulated. These contracts
further provide for prior approval and right of
dismissal by Stanford of all military officers as
signed to the department, assignment of the rank
of professor to the senior commissioned officer
of each service assigned to the institution and
lesser academic rank to other members of the
staffs, and the right of the Secretary of the mili
tary service involved to relieve from duty any
officer or enlisted man assigned to work at Stan
ford. These terms represent a partial abdication
of University control over the governance of its
own affairs.
It should be recognized that these arrange
ments result in a Stanford subsidy to the ROTC
programs. Stanford is obliged to provide facili
ties, services, and financial support to the ROTC
programs on a cost-free basis. For example, the
Air Force contract stipulates that Stanford pro
vide:
(1) "the necessary classrooms, administra
tive offices, storage spaces, government
vehicle parking areas, staff parking
areas and other required facilities in
the same manner and at the same level
as is provided to other Departments of
the Institution."
(2) "adequate secretarial, janitorial, and
telephone services ... on the same
basis as is provided to other Depart
ments within the Institution."
An increase in course substitution (see below
D.2.) .while desirable in some ways, will increase
the subsidy by relieving the ROTC programs of
that part of their instructional requirements. In
the Majority's view, such subsidies of the armed
forces are inappropriate.
C.2. Contractual Agreements between
Stanford ROTC Students and the Army, Navy
and Air Force. In this section the committee
states its objections to certain terms contained in
the existing contracts between Stanford ROTC
students and the three military services. It is to
be understood that the Committee does not ob
ject to a student entering into a legal and private
contractual agreement as long as the terms of
said agreement are neither contrary to the aca
demic goals and standards of the university nor
encroachments upon the university's integrity as
an institution of higher learning.
The Committee heard substantial testimony
to the effect that there exists a considerable dif
ference between de facto practice and de jure
obligations. Specifically, it has been the practice
of the three services to terminate a four-year fin
ancial-assistance contract in the first two years
without penalty or prejudice. This has a mitiga
ting effect but leaves the legal provisions of the
contracts technically intact.
C.2.a. Academic Prescriptions. All
three services require certain specified courses of
study. By contract, the student must follow this
prescribed course of study. In addition, the
Navy financial assistant program specifically ex
cludes certain courses of study, and the Air
Force contracts for certain courses of study.
These restrictions and requirements conflict with
the Majority view that Stanford undergraduates
should not be found by law to take and complete
a course of study prescribed by some agent or
agency external to the University, when that
agency also determines (directly or indirectly)
the mode and content of instruction of all or
part of the prescribed course.
All three services require that ROTC cadets
meet certain academic standards. The Majority
believes that Stanford undergraduates should not
be bound by law to maintain academic standards
prescribed by an external agency, especially
when that agency also participates in determining
whether or not such standards have been met.

C.2.b. Personal Conduct. All three
services require that the cadet maintain certain
unspecified standards of personal and moral con
duct. The Majority feels that such restrictions
can seriously limit the student's free participa
tion in all facets of intellectual inquiry and legal
political activity. Furthermore, the Navy finan
cial assistance contract stipulates that the candi
date "remain unmarried until commissioned."
These standards too are established by an agency
external to the University, and judgments con
cerning them are made by the same agency.
While the Majority recognizes the special require
ments of the armed forces and could not object
to similar conditions in contracts between indi
vidual students and the military services when
not a part of a university program or activity, it
can and does object to such conditions when
they are a part of a University-subsidized and
sanctioned activity.
C.2.c. Punitive Clauses. All three ser
vices include in their financial assistance con
tracts clauses that bind the student to a period of
enlisted service for "willfully evading" stipulated
terms. Despite the fact that these clauses have
rarely been invoked at Stanford, the Majority
deems them clearly punitive in intent, and feels
that they unduly infringe the student's freedom
within the University community.
C.2.d. Contracts for Service. To our
knowledge, the ROTC contracts are the only
University-sponsored and sanctioned contracts
on the undergraduate level that bind a student to
service. There are various loan programs such as
the NDEA which allow teaching service to act in
lieu of repayments. Still, these loan programs do
not require service, since the loans can be repaid
with appropriate interest over a period of years.
The ROTC financial assistance grants have no
such provision.
The Majority wishes to point out that these
contractual restrictions and/or obligations oper
ate as a whole. The punitive clauses operate in
relation to academic standards requirements,
course of study requirements, conduct require
ments, and service requirements. The service obli
gation is intimately related to the course of study
requirements. It is this interlocking of contrac
tual requirements, restrictions, and obligations
that makes the whole much more objectionable
than each of its parts might suggest. The Univer
sity's rights and obligations to establish, main
tain, and judge its own standards of academics,
course of study, and student conduct is funda
mental to our conception of the university as
defined above.
D. Academic Objections.
In considering the academic aspects of the
problem, the Committee heard public testimony
that ROTC courses were of very high calibre. We
do not wish to contest this, though members of
the Committee have also heard informally and
confidentially that the contrary is also sometimes
the case. Whatever may be the truth of the mat
ter, the Majority's objections do not rest on these
grounds, but on the inherent goals of these
courses.
D.l Course Goals. Although in recent
years the Department of Defense instruction
plans for the ROTC programs have allowed Pro
fessors of Military Science increasing flexibility
in the choice of text materials and in course sub
stitution, the ultimate goals of these programs
are still fixed by the Department of Defense.
These goals are not compatible with the Univer
sity's "primary commitment to the creation and
dissemination of knowledge, in an environment
of free intellectual activity." The primary goal of
the ROTC programs is to educate, train, and eval
uate junior officers for the U.S. Armed Forces.
The Plan for NROTC Instructional Program
(Navpers 93941, May 1968) defines as "major
goals":
(1) To assist in the education of the
midshipman in a major field of study of interest
to the Navy or Marine Corps leading to a bacca
laureate degree.
(2) To provide the midshipman with
the fundamental concepts and principles of Naval
Science and with the professional Naval knowl
edge necessary to establish a sound basis for his
future growth as a Naval or Marine Corps officer.
(3) To prepare the midshipman for
service with the highest sense of honor and integ
rity as a commissioned officer; to cultivate the
essential elements of military leadership; to fos
ter the growth of a strong sense of loyalty and
dedication to his Service and to the Nation.
(4) To prepare the midshipman to
undertake successfully in later periods of his
career, advanced/continuing education in a field
of application and interest to the Naval Service.
(5) To inject the values of civilian
higher education into the Naval Service by utili
zing the expertise of civilian faculty instruction
where applicable. (Italics ours)
The Army Program of Instruction states that the
objectives of ROTC are "to procure and produce
junior officers who by education, training, atti
tude and inherent qualities are suitable for con
tinued development as officers in the Army."
And the Air Force ROTC mission "is to commis
sion career-oriented second lieutenants in res
ponse to Air Force requirements" by successfully
accomplishing the following four objectives:
(1) Identify, motivate, and select
qualified students to complete the Air Force
ROTC program.
(2) Provide college-level education
that will qualify cadets for commissioning in the
U.S. Air Force.
(3) Heighten each cadet's apprecia
tion of, and dedication to, American principles,
give him an understanding of how the Air Force
serves the national interest, and develop his po
tential as a leader and manager and his under
standing of officer professionalism in the Air
Force.
(4) Commission in the U.S. Air
Force high quality second lieutenants. (Italics
ours)
The goals of these programs are clearly non
academic in nature. Given the goals of these pro
grams as defined above, Military Science instruc
tors are legally and ethically obligated to present
their course material from restricted points of
view, to evaluate the student's fitness for a mili
tary career partly on these grounds, and to report
this evaluation to higher authorities.
Since the goals of the ROTC Programs are to
educate potential officers, much of the current
Military Science course content—weapons sys
tems, small-unit tactics, Army administration, or
ientation, counter-insurgency, etc.—is of such a
narrowly pragmatic, professional nature as to be
incompatible with an undergraduate academic
credit program. Although the Minority Report's
proposed Committee on Military Studies might
deny academic credit to some of these "nuts and
bolts" courses, others might remain in the credit
program. And indeed, one might question
whether any course with the goals outlined above
merits inclusion in Stanford's academic credit
structure. Although knowledge is disseminated in
ROTC courses, it is rarely created in an environ
ment of free intellectual activity; and it is dissem
inated to the end that committed junior officers

to enter the U.S. Armed Forces. The Military
Science Programs' lack of awareness of what we
believe to be the primary commitment of the
University is further evidenced in their equation
of the "values of civilian higher education" with
the "expertise of civilian faculty where applic
able." (NROTC Goals No. 5)
D.2. Course Substitution. The substitu
tion of courses in regular academic departments
for courses presently taught by the ROTC fac
ulty (particularly U.S. military history and U.S.
foreign policy) has been frequently suggested.
This has some attractive features, but these
should not blind one to the problems it also en
tails.
D.2.a. Such courses would have to
meet the goals set forth by the armed forces.
Senior ROTC faculty are being granted wide lati
tude in determining whether or not goals are
being met by a particular course, but it is never
theless true that the scope, coverage, and content
of such courses will be under periodic review by
the military establishment.
D.2.b. If such a course is built into
the ROTC curriculum and required of all cadets,
then the presumption exists that the course will
meet the needs of the ROTC in scope, coverage,
approach, and frequency of offering. TTie faculty
member will have to take these considerations
into account in planning course changes, leave
periods, etc. If such a required course fails for
any reason to meet ROTC needs, the ROTC must
reassume part or all of the instruction in that
area, or drop the requirement. But then course
substitution is either lost or was unnecessary in
the first place.
D.2.C. If such a course is to be op
tional for ROTC cadets, then some other options
must be available. This presumes one of three
things: (a) that other equivalent courses are avail
able in the academic departments, (b) that the
ROTC faculty provide the equivalent, or (c) that
cadets need not receive training in that particular
area. The revised ROTC instructional programs
seem to rule out the last; normal University prac
tice makes the first unlikely. Thus, here too, the
advantages of course substitution may be lost.
Finally, it should be noted that it will be difficult
to ensure that the course is in fact "optional." If
other options are limited, and if cadets are
"strongly urged" to enroll in a particular course,
is that course truly optional?
D.2.d. Course substitution will in
crease both the direct and indirect subsidy of
Stanford to the ROTC by assuming part of the
training of ROTC cadets (see below). It will add
to the work of the academic department and the
individual faculty member by the number of stu
dents who would not otherwise have enrolled in
his course (this could, for example, require addi
tional expenditures for T.A.'s, readers, etc.). The
call upon the resources of the ROTC programs
will be correspondingly lightened.
D.3. Departmental Status. An academic
department shares much the same definition as
the institution of which it is a part, with particu
lar reference to a specific area and/or discipline.
When a student has demonstrated a certain com
petence in this area or discipline, he is recom
mended for a degree, either at the undergraduate
or graduate level. The Departments of Military
Science do not do this at either level; rather, they
offer commissions in the Armed Forces to the
men who successfully complete their programs.
Unlike other departments or schools in the Uni
versity, the ROTC Departments are educating
young men not to academic ends but to work for
a specific employer in a specific area.
The Minority recommends combining the
three ROTC Departments into a single Depart
ment of Military Studies, no longer to be lodged
in the School of Humanities and Sciences but to
be responsible to the Provost via a Committee on
Military Studies. The Majority believes this is a
recognition of the anomalous nature of such a
department, which has neither undergraduate nor
graduate majors and serves non-academic ends.
D.4. Faculty Search and Appointment.
The Military Science Departments' faculty is ap
pointed in an irregular way. The appointment
procedure for Military Science personnel by
passes both department-initiated search and eval
uation, and the normal administrative ratification
process. Whenever a position becomes vacant, the
appropriate branch of the Armed Services pre
sents nominations for the position to the Pro
vost's Office. The administration may veto any
military nominations. (It has done so at least
three times.) The nominee's military record and
college transcripts are examined and, whenever
possible, a personal interview is held. Though
ROTC faculty are presently members of the Aca
demic Council, they are not subject to the usual
University policy on tenure, for the Defense De
partment agrees to recall them immediately at
the request of the administration. (Stanford has
exercised this option once in recent years.) Fur
thermore, the Department of Defense reserves
the right to transfer from Stanford any assigned
military personnel. Thus, under present arrange
ments, an external organization may unilaterally
remove a member of the Stanford faculty.
This irregular appointment and retention pro
cedure violates the principle that the primary re
sponsibility for faculty appointment and status
rests with the Stanford faculty and administra
tion. Secondly, it creates a special class of faculty
members having some characteristics not shared
by the regular faculty and lacking others.
Thirdly, since Stanford cannot initiate the search
nor fully supervise the screening process, the Uni
versity loses some degree of control over the
quality of the ROTC faculty. These irregular fea
tures would continue, even under revised proced
ures.
IV. Objections to ROTC as An Organized, Non
credit, On-Campus Program
The previous section reviews our objections,
both general and specific, to ROTC as an aca
demic program at Stanford. Having come to this
point, the Majority gave serious consideration to
retention of ROTC on campus as an organized,
non-credit program of education and training. We
believe such an arrangement may be an improve
ment over both the present situation and the rec
ommendations of the Minority. But it is the con
viction of the Majority that the logic of the gen
eral objections must apply generally to the rela
tions between ROTC and Stanford. To recom
mend termination of academic credit and reten
tion of non-credit ROTC programs is to accept
the argument with respect to the former but fail
to apply it to the latter. We here recapitulate
those considerations with reference to ROTC as
an on-campus, non-credit program of training
and education.
A. What has been termed "conflict of inter
est" would continue, since ROTC would remain
the corporate representation of the armed forces
within the structure of the University, staffed by
professional military officers. If ROTC is re
tained as a non-credit program, several opera
tional problems will grow directly out of the fact

that ROTC will remain in the University but not
of the University. Any solution of these prob
lems will constitute recognition of the anomalous
nature of the arrangement.
1. Would the ROTC programs, singly or
collectively, continue as "Department(s)?" If
not, what status should they have? On what
grounds would such a decision be made?
2. The same questions apply to the status
of ROTC faculty. Shall formal academic rank be
accorded, as presently required by law? To
whom, at what level, and on what grounds?
3. How shall the University handle search
and appointment procedures for persons offering
no accredited work, but who present courses re
quired of a certain proportion of the student
body?
4. How shall the University oversee the
content and mode of instruction in these non
credit but required courses?
B. The primary goal of the ROTC programs
would remain, as before, the recruitment and
training of junior officers. Thus, specific training
for employment by an outside organization, car
ried on by members of that organization, would
continue.
C. Institutional contracts would remain,
though perhaps in a modified form. Thus, dispro
portionate subsidization of the military at Stan
ford would continue: direct subsidies in the form
of facilities, services, etc.; indirect subsidies in
the form of course substitution, etc.
D. Individual contracts, requiring participa
tion in ROTC training programs on-campus by
signatories, would continue. It is here not the
existence of such contracts that is objected to;
rather it is to the institutional sanction and sup
port given these contracts by Stanford Univer
sity.
V. Recommendations
Thus far the Majority has emphasized those
aspects of the present ROTC which make them
objectionable to the point of incompatibility
with the University. We believe such analysis,
while lengthy and complex, is necessary when
ever a significant change is recommended for an
on-going academic program. Also required is
some projection of the nature and structure of
the revised program. That is, having dealt with
objections in the relationship between Stanford
and the ROTC departments, what is considered
to be the proper relationship?
It should be noted, first, that no accurate pro
jection can be made because it is not known
what limits the Department of Defense has for its
junior officer procurement program. We cannot
predict what will be acceptable to the military
services beyond existing operational and legal
constraints.
Secondly, the Majority believes the issue of
proper relations is confused by excessive reliance
on the term "ROTC." The Majority has empha
sized the distinction between ROTC as a mech
anism and the objectives which ROTC serves.
Our arguments have been directed to the mech
anism, not the objectives or purposes. Misinter
pretation arises if this distinction is obscured. If
the language of the Senate's charge is taken to
mean that "ROTC" denotes an organized on
campus program of eduation and training, then
the Majority is compelled to state there can be
no "proper relations between the ROTC depart
ments and Stanford." This, in turn, can mis
takenly be construed to mean that the Majority
believes no proper relations can be established
between the objectives served by the existing de
partments and Stanford.
It is likely that the program which we recom
mend would not and should not be denoted as
"ROTC." This is accurate insofar as the program
has been substantially altered and does not con
form to present programs of ROTC. But any new
denotation should not be interpreted to mean
that we have sought to abolish all relations be
tween Stanford and the purposes of the existing
ROTC programs or that we have concluded that
no proper relations can be established. Rather we
believe that for proper relations to exist, a new
mechanism must be created —one that differs
from the present program, but can still serve the
same purposes in such a way as to be compatible
with the University.
We envision relations whereby each service of
the armed forces would assign personnel to
manage an administrative apparatus, with space
provided possibly in the Dean of Students' Office
of Special Services, that would concern itself
with recruitment of students into the program,
process the revised student contracts and scholar
ships, offer professional counseling and informa
tion to individuals as well as to the existing stu
dent voluntary groups representative of the three
services on campus. Further, this Armed Forces
Officers Program would arrange with enrolled
students for off-campus training and education.
We believe that all education presently offered
by the ROTC departments could be transferred
to extended summer encampments. The military
personnel on campus would be free to offer vol
untary undergraduate special courses, as are
other members of the Stanford community, fol
lowing the guidelines established by the Commit
tee on Undergraduate Education.
To these ends, we recommend the following:
1. After a transitional period (see recom
mendation 5 below), there should be no aca
demic credit received for participation in pro
grams of military training and education.
2. By the end of this period, non-credit,
required military training and education should
no longer be offered on the Stanford campus.
Consistent with these recommendations, a
scholarship or contract "program" may remain,
comprising normal academic education, supple
mented by on-campus voluntary activities and
off-campus training.
3. By the end of this period, all remaining
military programs or activities should be regu
lated by the University's general policies on Stan
ford Voluntary Organizations. No Stanford fac
ulty member or administrator, acting as a spokes
man for the University, shall encourage students
to participate in military training and education,
except in the manner in which participation in all
voluntary activities is encouraged.
4. Individual contracts between Stanford
students and the armed forces should be revised
to reflect actual practice. We recommend further
that punitive clauses involving enlisted service be
removed.
5. These provisions should be in force by
the fall term 1973. Beginning with the fall term
1970, no entering freshman shall be granted aca
demic credit for ROTC activities. The three
ROTC departments should be replaced by a sin
gle Armed Forces Officers Program no later than
fall term 1973. This program shall be for the
purposes of administration, counseling, and re
cruiting for off-campus reserve officer training
and education. (N.B. Because present institu
tional contracts specify one year's notice prior to
termination, the phase-out process cannot begin
before 1970.)
6. Appropriate University authorities
should promptly initiate action leading to re
vision or termination of the contracts between
Stanford and the armed forces (a) in order to
enable the phase-out to begin in 1970, and (b) in
order to reflect the voluntary, non-credit status
of military training at Stanford. We further rec
ommend that a committee be appointed, com
posed of representatives of faculty, administra
tion, military science department, and students,
to assist in effecting the transition.
7. During the transitional period, we rec
ommend that the status of officers presently at
tached to ROTC units remain unchanged. Until
the fall term 1973, newly assigned officers shall
carry the rank of "Lecturer," except for the
newly assigned senior officers of each branch of
the armed forces, who shall carry the rank of
"Lecturer with rank of Professor." After the be
ginning of the 1973-74 academic year, represen
tatives of the armed forces at Stanford shall carry
no academic rank. Similarly until this time, the
departmental and administrative structure of the
ROTC program shall remain as at present.
8. Students already enrolled in ROTC pro
grams, and those enrolling prior to the fall term
1970, shall continue as at present, except that
present contracts should be revised in accord
with recommendation 4.

because our charge as a committee limits us to
these programs.
The Majority believes that there are both gen
eral and specific objections which will continue
to exist as long as ROTC is a program integral to
the institutional structure of the University.
A. Conflict of Interest. The ROTC faculty,
being detailed to Stanford on a limited tour of
duty, remain professional military officers who
legally and ethically owe primary loyalty to the
branch of the service they represent, to the
armed forces, and to the U.S. government. This
means that, however high their integrity and
quality of mind, they cannot at the same time
have a primary commitment either to Stanford
University or to the academic enterprise. This
dual identity should be recognized as a conflict
of interest. The government itself recognizes very
clearly the potential peril of conflict-of-interest
situations, and rightly expects public servants
scrupulously to avoid them. It should be noted
that neither the government's position nor ours
rests upon the fact or even the presumption of
improper behavior.
Because this consideration applies to all mili
tary members of the ROTC, it therefore applies
by extension to the ROTC programs themselves.
These programs, as corporate entities—present
H&S departments—are themselves in a potential
conflict-of-interest situation with respect to the
University.
We recognize that other instances of conflict
of interest are by no means rare in the university;
these too are unfortunate. But they are individ
ual rather than collective, and they are character
ized, in nearly all cases, by a primary commit
ment to the University (note that the University
limits outside activities to an average of one day
per week).
B. Training for a specific employer, by that
employer. The ROTC programs represent the
corporate, institutional presence of an external
organization, which engages in specific training
of candidates for temporary or permanent em
ploy by that organization. The issue raised here is
not simply that of professional or pre-profes
sional training, but of such training carried on
by the armed forces, in the interests of the armed
forces. The Majority believes that such training
should not be a part of the academic structure of
the University.
C. Contractual Arrangements. The objection
able features of the present contracts can be con
sidered under two headings: contractual arrange
ments between the armed forces and Stanford
University, and between the armed forces and
individual students. While some of these arrange
ments may be subject to change, others would
not. Some are specified by the Vitalization Act
of 1964 and could not be changed except
through action by Congress.
C.l. Institutional Contracts. The contracts
between Stanford and the various military ser
vices provide for government commitment of an
academic and administrative staff, an instruc
tional program, government equipment, staff
salaries, and student financial assistance. In re
turn the University agrees to the establishment of
military science department, provision of class
rooms, offices and drill areas, appropriate aca
demic credit for military science courses, and a
minimum sustaining enrollment and output of
officers. In the case of the Army, representation
on all faculty committees whose recommenda
tions would directly affect the Department of
Military Science is stipulated. These contracts
further provide for prior approval and right of
dismissal by Stanford of all military officers as
signed to the department, assignment of the rank
of professor to the senior commissioned officer
of each service assigned to the institution and
lesser academic rank to other members of the
staffs, and the right of the Secretary of the mili
tary service involved to relieve from duty any
officer or enlisted man assigned to work at Stan
ford. These terms represent a partial abdication
of University control over the governance of its
own affairs.
It should be recognized that these arrange
ments result in a Stanford subsidy to the ROTC
programs. Stanford is obliged to provide facili
ties, services, and financial support to the ROTC
programs on a cost-free basis. For example, the
Air Force contract stipulates that Stanford pro
vide:
(1) "the necessary classrooms, administra
tive offices, storage spaces, government
vehicle parking areas, staff parking
areas and other required facilities in
the same manner and at the same level
as is provided to other Departments of
the Institution."
(2) "adequate secretarial, janitorial, and
telephone services ... on the same
basis as is provided to other Depart
ments within the Institution."
An increase in course substitution (see below
D.2.) .while desirable in some ways, will increase
the subsidy by relieving the ROTC programs of
that part of their instructional requirements. In
the Majority's view, such subsidies of the armed
forces are inappropriate.
C.2. Contractual Agreements between
Stanford ROTC Students and the Army, Navy
and Air Force. In this section the committee
states its objections to certain terms contained in
the existing contracts between Stanford ROTC
students and the three military services. It is to
be understood that the Committee does not ob
ject to a student entering into a legal and private
contractual agreement as long as the terms of
said agreement are neither contrary to the aca
demic goals and standards of the university nor
encroachments upon the university's integrity as
an institution of higher learning.
The Committee heard substantial testimony
to the effect that there exists a considerable dif
ference between de facto practice and de jure
obligations. Specifically, it has been the practice
of the three services to terminate a four-year fin
ancial-assistance contract in the first two years
without penalty or prejudice. This has a mitiga
ting effect but leaves the legal provisions of the
contracts technically intact.
C.2.a. Academic Prescriptions. All
three services require certain specified courses of
study. By contract, the student must follow this
prescribed course of study. In addition, the
Navy financial assistant program specifically ex
cludes certain courses of study, and the Air
Force contracts for certain courses of study.
These restrictions and requirements conflict with
the Majority view that Stanford undergraduates
should not be found by law to take and complete
a course of study prescribed by some agent or
agency external to the University, when that
agency also determines (directly or indirectly)
the mode and content of instruction of all or
part of the prescribed course.
All three services require that ROTC cadets
meet certain academic standards. The Majority
believes that Stanford undergraduates should not
be bound by law to maintain academic standards
prescribed by an external agency, especially
when that agency also participates in determining
whether or not such standards have been met.

C.2.b. Personal Conduct. All three
services require that the cadet maintain certain
unspecified standards of personal and moral con
duct. The Majority feels that such restrictions
can seriously limit the student's free participa
tion in all facets of intellectual inquiry and legal
political activity. Furthermore, the Navy finan
cial assistance contract stipulates that the candi
date "remain unmarried until commissioned."
These standards too are established by an agency
external to the University, and judgments con
cerning them are made by the same agency.
While the Majority recognizes the special require
ments of the armed forces and could not object
to similar conditions in contracts between indi
vidual students and the military services when
not a part of a university program or activity, it
can and does object to such conditions when
they are a part of a University-subsidized and
sanctioned activity.
C.2.c. Punitive Clauses. All three ser
vices include in their financial assistance con
tracts clauses that bind the student to a period of
enlisted service for "willfully evading" stipulated
terms. Despite the fact that these clauses have
rarely been invoked at Stanford, the Majority
deems them clearly punitive in intent, and feels
that they unduly infringe the student's freedom
within the University community.
C.2.d. Contracts for Service. To our
knowledge, the ROTC contracts are the only
University-sponsored and sanctioned contracts
on the undergraduate level that bind a student to
service. There are various loan programs such as
the NDEA which allow teaching service to act in
lieu of repayments. Still, these loan programs do
not require service, since the loans can be repaid
with appropriate interest over a period of years.
The ROTC financial assistance grants have no
such provision.
The Majority wishes to point out that these
contractual restrictions and/or obligations oper
ate as a whole. The punitive clauses operate in
relation to academic standards requirements,
course of study requirements, conduct require
ments, and service requirements. The service obli
gation is intimately related to the course of study
requirements. It is this interlocking of contrac
tual requirements, restrictions, and obligations
that makes the whole much more objectionable
than each of its parts might suggest. The Univer
sity's rights and obligations to establish, main
tain, and judge its own standards of academics,
course of study, and student conduct is funda
mental to our conception of the university as
defined above.
D. Academic Objections.
In considering the academic aspects of the
problem, the Committee heard public testimony
that ROTC courses were of very high calibre. We
do not wish to contest this, though members of
the Committee have also heard informally and
confidentially that the contrary is also sometimes
the case. Whatever may be the truth of the mat
ter, the Majority's objections do not rest on these
grounds, but on the inherent goals of these
courses.
D.l Course Goals. Although in recent
years the Department of Defense instruction
plans for the ROTC programs have allowed Pro
fessors of Military Science increasing flexibility
in the choice of text materials and in course sub
stitution, the ultimate goals of these programs
are still fixed by the Department of Defense.
These goals are not compatible with the Univer
sity's "primary commitment to the creation and
dissemination of knowledge, in an environment
of free intellectual activity." The primary goal of
the ROTC programs is to educate, train, and eval
uate junior officers for the U.S. Armed Forces.
The Plan for NROTC Instructional Program
(Navpers 93941, May 1968) defines as "major
goals":
(1) To assist in the education of the
midshipman in a major field of study of interest
to the Navy or Marine Corps leading to a bacca
laureate degree.
(2) To provide the midshipman with
the fundamental concepts and principles of Naval
Science and with the professional Naval knowl
edge necessary to establish a sound basis for his
future growth as a Naval or Marine Corps officer.
(3) To prepare the midshipman for
service with the highest sense of honor and integ
rity as a commissioned officer; to cultivate the
essential elements of military leadership; to fos
ter the growth of a strong sense of loyalty and
dedication to his Service and to the Nation.
(4) To prepare the midshipman to
undertake successfully in later periods of his
career, advanced/continuing education in a field
of application and interest to the Naval Service.
(5) To inject the values of civilian
higher education into the Naval Service by utili
zing the expertise of civilian faculty instruction
where applicable. (Italics ours)
The Army Program of Instruction states that the
objectives of ROTC are "to procure and produce
junior officers who by education, training, atti
tude and inherent qualities are suitable for con
tinued development as officers in the Army."
And the Air Force ROTC mission "is to commis
sion career-oriented second lieutenants in res
ponse to Air Force requirements" by successfully
accomplishing the following four objectives:
(1) Identify, motivate, and select
qualified students to complete the Air Force
ROTC program.
(2) Provide college-level education
that will qualify cadets for commissioning in the
U.S. Air Force.
(3) Heighten each cadet's apprecia
tion of, and dedication to, American principles,
give him an understanding of how the Air Force
serves the national interest, and develop his po
tential as a leader and manager and his under
standing of officer professionalism in the Air
Force.
(4) Commission in the U.S. Air
Force high quality second lieutenants. (Italics
ours)
The goals of these programs are clearly non
academic in nature. Given the goals of these pro
grams as defined above, Military Science instruc
tors are legally and ethically obligated to present
their course material from restricted points of
view, to evaluate the student's fitness for a mili
tary career partly on these grounds, and to report
this evaluation to higher authorities.
Since the goals of the ROTC Programs are to
educate potential officers, much of the current
Military Science course content—weapons sys
tems, small-unit tactics, Army administration, or
ientation, counter-insurgency, etc.—is of such a
narrowly pragmatic, professional nature as to be
incompatible with an undergraduate academic
credit program. Although the Minority Report's
proposed Committee on Military Studies might
deny academic credit to some of these "nuts and
bolts" courses, others might remain in the credit
program. And indeed, one might question
whether any course with the goals outlined above
merits inclusion in Stanford's academic credit
structure. Although knowledge is disseminated in
ROTC courses, it is rarely created in an environ
ment of free intellectual activity; and it is dissem
inated to the end that committed junior officers

to enter the U.S. Armed Forces. The Military
Science Programs' lack of awareness of what we
believe to be the primary commitment of the
University is further evidenced in their equation
of the "values of civilian higher education" with
the "expertise of civilian faculty where applic
able." (NROTC Goals No. 5)
D.2. Course Substitution. The substitu
tion of courses in regular academic departments
for courses presently taught by the ROTC fac
ulty (particularly U.S. military history and U.S.
foreign policy) has been frequently suggested.
This has some attractive features, but these
should not blind one to the problems it also en
tails.
D.2.a. Such courses would have to
meet the goals set forth by the armed forces.
Senior ROTC faculty are being granted wide lati
tude in determining whether or not goals are
being met by a particular course, but it is never
theless true that the scope, coverage, and content
of such courses will be under periodic review by
the military establishment.
D.2.b. If such a course is built into
the ROTC curriculum and required of all cadets,
then the presumption exists that the course will
meet the needs of the ROTC in scope, coverage,
approach, and frequency of offering. TTie faculty
member will have to take these considerations
into account in planning course changes, leave
periods, etc. If such a required course fails for
any reason to meet ROTC needs, the ROTC must
reassume part or all of the instruction in that
area, or drop the requirement. But then course
substitution is either lost or was unnecessary in
the first place.
D.2.C. If such a course is to be op
tional for ROTC cadets, then some other options
must be available. This presumes one of three
things: (a) that other equivalent courses are avail
able in the academic departments, (b) that the
ROTC faculty provide the equivalent, or (c) that
cadets need not receive training in that particular
area. The revised ROTC instructional programs
seem to rule out the last; normal University prac
tice makes the first unlikely. Thus, here too, the
advantages of course substitution may be lost.
Finally, it should be noted that it will be difficult
to ensure that the course is in fact "optional." If
other options are limited, and if cadets are
"strongly urged" to enroll in a particular course,
is that course truly optional?
D.2.d. Course substitution will in
crease both the direct and indirect subsidy of
Stanford to the ROTC by assuming part of the
training of ROTC cadets (see below). It will add
to the work of the academic department and the
individual faculty member by the number of stu
dents who would not otherwise have enrolled in
his course (this could, for example, require addi
tional expenditures for T.A.'s, readers, etc.). The
call upon the resources of the ROTC programs
will be correspondingly lightened.
D.3. Departmental Status. An academic
department shares much the same definition as
the institution of which it is a part, with particu
lar reference to a specific area and/or discipline.
When a student has demonstrated a certain com
petence in this area or discipline, he is recom
mended for a degree, either at the undergraduate
or graduate level. The Departments of Military
Science do not do this at either level; rather, they
offer commissions in the Armed Forces to the
men who successfully complete their programs.
Unlike other departments or schools in the Uni
versity, the ROTC Departments are educating
young men not to academic ends but to work for
a specific employer in a specific area.
The Minority recommends combining the
three ROTC Departments into a single Depart
ment of Military Studies, no longer to be lodged
in the School of Humanities and Sciences but to
be responsible to the Provost via a Committee on
Military Studies. The Majority believes this is a
recognition of the anomalous nature of such a
department, which has neither undergraduate nor
graduate majors and serves non-academic ends.
D.4. Faculty Search and Appointment.
The Military Science Departments' faculty is ap
pointed in an irregular way. The appointment
procedure for Military Science personnel by
passes both department-initiated search and eval
uation, and the normal administrative ratification
process. Whenever a position becomes vacant, the
appropriate branch of the Armed Services pre
sents nominations for the position to the Pro
vost's Office. The administration may veto any
military nominations. (It has done so at least
three times.) The nominee's military record and
college transcripts are examined and, whenever
possible, a personal interview is held. Though
ROTC faculty are presently members of the Aca
demic Council, they are not subject to the usual
University policy on tenure, for the Defense De
partment agrees to recall them immediately at
the request of the administration. (Stanford has
exercised this option once in recent years.) Fur
thermore, the Department of Defense reserves
the right to transfer from Stanford any assigned
military personnel. Thus, under present arrange
ments, an external organization may unilaterally
remove a member of the Stanford faculty.
This irregular appointment and retention pro
cedure violates the principle that the primary re
sponsibility for faculty appointment and status
rests with the Stanford faculty and administra
tion. Secondly, it creates a special class of faculty
members having some characteristics not shared
by the regular faculty and lacking others.
Thirdly, since Stanford cannot initiate the search
nor fully supervise the screening process, the Uni
versity loses some degree of control over the
quality of the ROTC faculty. These irregular fea
tures would continue, even under revised proced
ures.
IV. Objections to ROTC as An Organized, Non
credit, On-Campus Program
The previous section reviews our objections,
both general and specific, to ROTC as an aca
demic program at Stanford. Having come to this
point, the Majority gave serious consideration to
retention of ROTC on campus as an organized,
non-credit program of education and training. We
believe such an arrangement may be an improve
ment over both the present situation and the rec
ommendations of the Minority. But it is the con
viction of the Majority that the logic of the gen
eral objections must apply generally to the rela
tions between ROTC and Stanford. To recom
mend termination of academic credit and reten
tion of non-credit ROTC programs is to accept
the argument with respect to the former but fail
to apply it to the latter. We here recapitulate
those considerations with reference to ROTC as
an on-campus, non-credit program of training
and education.
A. What has been termed "conflict of inter
est" would continue, since ROTC would remain
the corporate representation of the armed forces
within the structure of the University, staffed by
professional military officers. If ROTC is re
tained as a non-credit program, several opera
tional problems will grow directly out of the fact

that ROTC will remain in the University but not
of the University. Any solution of these prob
lems will constitute recognition of the anomalous
nature of the arrangement.
1. Would the ROTC programs, singly or
collectively, continue as "Department(s)?" If
not, what status should they have? On what
grounds would such a decision be made?
2. The same questions apply to the status
of ROTC faculty. Shall formal academic rank be
accorded, as presently required by law? To
whom, at what level, and on what grounds?
3. How shall the University handle search
and appointment procedures for persons offering
no accredited work, but who present courses re
quired of a certain proportion of the student
body?
4. How shall the University oversee the
content and mode of instruction in these non
credit but required courses?
B. The primary goal of the ROTC programs
would remain, as before, the recruitment and
training of junior officers. Thus, specific training
for employment by an outside organization, car
ried on by members of that organization, would
continue.
C. Institutional contracts would remain,
though perhaps in a modified form. Thus, dispro
portionate subsidization of the military at Stan
ford would continue: direct subsidies in the form
of facilities, services, etc.; indirect subsidies in
the form of course substitution, etc.
D. Individual contracts, requiring participa
tion in ROTC training programs on-campus by
signatories, would continue. It is here not the
existence of such contracts that is objected to;
rather it is to the institutional sanction and sup
port given these contracts by Stanford Univer
sity.
V. Recommendations
Thus far the Majority has emphasized those
aspects of the present ROTC which make them
objectionable to the point of incompatibility
with the University. We believe such analysis,
while lengthy and complex, is necessary when
ever a significant change is recommended for an
on-going academic program. Also required is
some projection of the nature and structure of
the revised program. That is, having dealt with
objections in the relationship between Stanford
and the ROTC departments, what is considered
to be the proper relationship?
It should be noted, first, that no accurate pro
jection can be made because it is not known
what limits the Department of Defense has for its
junior officer procurement program. We cannot
predict what will be acceptable to the military
services beyond existing operational and legal
constraints.
Secondly, the Majority believes the issue of
proper relations is confused by excessive reliance
on the term "ROTC." The Majority has empha
sized the distinction between ROTC as a mech
anism and the objectives which ROTC serves.
Our arguments have been directed to the mech
anism, not the objectives or purposes. Misinter
pretation arises if this distinction is obscured. If
the language of the Senate's charge is taken to
mean that "ROTC" denotes an organized on
campus program of eduation and training, then
the Majority is compelled to state there can be
no "proper relations between the ROTC depart
ments and Stanford." This, in turn, can mis
takenly be construed to mean that the Majority
believes no proper relations can be established
between the objectives served by the existing de
partments and Stanford.
It is likely that the program which we recom
mend would not and should not be denoted as
"ROTC." This is accurate insofar as the program
has been substantially altered and does not con
form to present programs of ROTC. But any new
denotation should not be interpreted to mean
that we have sought to abolish all relations be
tween Stanford and the purposes of the existing
ROTC programs or that we have concluded that
no proper relations can be established. Rather we
believe that for proper relations to exist, a new
mechanism must be created —one that differs
from the present program, but can still serve the
same purposes in such a way as to be compatible
with the University.
We envision relations whereby each service of
the armed forces would assign personnel to
manage an administrative apparatus, with space
provided possibly in the Dean of Students' Office
of Special Services, that would concern itself
with recruitment of students into the program,
process the revised student contracts and scholar
ships, offer professional counseling and informa
tion to individuals as well as to the existing stu
dent voluntary groups representative of the three
services on campus. Further, this Armed Forces
Officers Program would arrange with enrolled
students for off-campus training and education.
We believe that all education presently offered
by the ROTC departments could be transferred
to extended summer encampments. The military
personnel on campus would be free to offer vol
untary undergraduate special courses, as are
other members of the Stanford community, fol
lowing the guidelines established by the Commit
tee on Undergraduate Education.
To these ends, we recommend the following:
1. After a transitional period (see recom
mendation 5 below), there should be no aca
demic credit received for participation in pro
grams of military training and education.
2. By the end of this period, non-credit,
required military training and education should
no longer be offered on the Stanford campus.
Consistent with these recommendations, a
scholarship or contract "program" may remain,
comprising normal academic education, supple
mented by on-campus voluntary activities and
off-campus training.
3. By the end of this period, all remaining
military programs or activities should be regu
lated by the University's general policies on Stan
ford Voluntary Organizations. No Stanford fac
ulty member or administrator, acting as a spokes
man for the University, shall encourage students
to participate in military training and education,
except in the manner in which participation in all
voluntary activities is encouraged.
4. Individual contracts between Stanford
students and the armed forces should be revised
to reflect actual practice. We recommend further
that punitive clauses involving enlisted service be
removed.
5. These provisions should be in force by
the fall term 1973. Beginning with the fall term
1970, no entering freshman shall be granted aca
demic credit for ROTC activities. The three
ROTC departments should be replaced by a sin
gle Armed Forces Officers Program no later than
fall term 1973. This program shall be for the
purposes of administration, counseling, and re
cruiting for off-campus reserve officer training
and education. (N.B. Because present institu
tional contracts specify one year's notice prior to
termination, the phase-out process cannot begin
before 1970.)
6. Appropriate University authorities
should promptly initiate action leading to re
vision or termination of the contracts between
Stanford and the armed forces (a) in order to
enable the phase-out to begin in 1970, and (b) in
order to reflect the voluntary, non-credit status
of military training at Stanford. We further rec
ommend that a committee be appointed, com
posed of representatives of faculty, administra
tion, military science department, and students,
to assist in effecting the transition.
7. During the transitional period, we rec
ommend that the status of officers presently at
tached to ROTC units remain unchanged. Until
the fall term 1973, newly assigned officers shall
carry the rank of "Lecturer," except for the
newly assigned senior officers of each branch of
the armed forces, who shall carry the rank of
"Lecturer with rank of Professor." After the be
ginning of the 1973-74 academic year, represen
tatives of the armed forces at Stanford shall carry
no academic rank. Similarly until this time, the
departmental and administrative structure of the
ROTC program shall remain as at present.
8. Students already enrolled in ROTC pro
grams, and those enrolling prior to the fall term
1970, shall continue as at present, except that
present contracts should be revised in accord
with recommendation 4.

because our charge as a committee limits us to
these programs.
The Majority believes that there are both gen
eral and specific objections which will continue
to exist as long as ROTC is a program integral to
the institutional structure of the University.
A. Conflict of Interest. The ROTC faculty,
being detailed to Stanford on a limited tour of
duty, remain professional military officers who
legally and ethically owe primary loyalty to the
branch of the service they represent, to the
armed forces, and to the U.S. government. This
means that, however high their integrity and
quality of mind, they cannot at the same time
have a primary commitment either to Stanford
University or to the academic enterprise. This
dual identity should be recognized as a conflict
of interest. The government itself recognizes very
clearly the potential peril of conflict-of-interest
situations, and rightly expects public servants
scrupulously to avoid them. It should be noted
that neither the government's position nor ours
rests upon the fact or even the presumption of
improper behavior.
Because this consideration applies to all mili
tary members of the ROTC, it therefore applies
by extension to the ROTC programs themselves.
These programs, as corporate entities—present
H&S departments—are themselves in a potential
conflict-of-interest situation with respect to the
University.
We recognize that other instances of conflict
of interest are by no means rare in the university;
these too are unfortunate. But they are individ
ual rather than collective, and they are character
ized, in nearly all cases, by a primary commit
ment to the University (note that the University
limits outside activities to an average of one day
per week).
B. Training for a specific employer, by that
employer. The ROTC programs represent the
corporate, institutional presence of an external
organization, which engages in specific training
of candidates for temporary or permanent em
ploy by that organization. The issue raised here is
not simply that of professional or pre-profes
sional training, but of such training carried on
by the armed forces, in the interests of the armed
forces. The Majority believes that such training
should not be a part of the academic structure of
the University.
C. Contractual Arrangements. The objection
able features of the present contracts can be con
sidered under two headings: contractual arrange
ments between the armed forces and Stanford
University, and between the armed forces and
individual students. While some of these arrange
ments may be subject to change, others would
not. Some are specified by the Vitalization Act
of 1964 and could not be changed except
through action by Congress.
C.l. Institutional Contracts. The contracts
between Stanford and the various military ser
vices provide for government commitment of an
academic and administrative staff, an instruc
tional program, government equipment, staff
salaries, and student financial assistance. In re
turn the University agrees to the establishment of
military science department, provision of class
rooms, offices and drill areas, appropriate aca
demic credit for military science courses, and a
minimum sustaining enrollment and output of
officers. In the case of the Army, representation
on all faculty committees whose recommenda
tions would directly affect the Department of
Military Science is stipulated. These contracts
further provide for prior approval and right of
dismissal by Stanford of all military officers as
signed to the department, assignment of the rank
of professor to the senior commissioned officer
of each service assigned to the institution and
lesser academic rank to other members of the
staffs, and the right of the Secretary of the mili
tary service involved to relieve from duty any
officer or enlisted man assigned to work at Stan
ford. These terms represent a partial abdication
of University control over the governance of its
own affairs.
It should be recognized that these arrange
ments result in a Stanford subsidy to the ROTC
programs. Stanford is obliged to provide facili
ties, services, and financial support to the ROTC
programs on a cost-free basis. For example, the
Air Force contract stipulates that Stanford pro
vide:
(1) "the necessary classrooms, administra
tive offices, storage spaces, government
vehicle parking areas, staff parking
areas and other required facilities in
the same manner and at the same level
as is provided to other Departments of
the Institution."
(2) "adequate secretarial, janitorial, and
telephone services ... on the same
basis as is provided to other Depart
ments within the Institution."
An increase in course substitution (see below
D.2.) .while desirable in some ways, will increase
the subsidy by relieving the ROTC programs of
that part of their instructional requirements. In
the Majority's view, such subsidies of the armed
forces are inappropriate.
C.2. Contractual Agreements between
Stanford ROTC Students and the Army, Navy
and Air Force. In this section the committee
states its objections to certain terms contained in
the existing contracts between Stanford ROTC
students and the three military services. It is to
be understood that the Committee does not ob
ject to a student entering into a legal and private
contractual agreement as long as the terms of
said agreement are neither contrary to the aca
demic goals and standards of the university nor
encroachments upon the university's integrity as
an institution of higher learning.
The Committee heard substantial testimony
to the effect that there exists a considerable dif
ference between de facto practice and de jure
obligations. Specifically, it has been the practice
of the three services to terminate a four-year fin
ancial-assistance contract in the first two years
without penalty or prejudice. This has a mitiga
ting effect but leaves the legal provisions of the
contracts technically intact.
C.2.a. Academic Prescriptions. All
three services require certain specified courses of
study. By contract, the student must follow this
prescribed course of study. In addition, the
Navy financial assistant program specifically ex
cludes certain courses of study, and the Air
Force contracts for certain courses of study.
These restrictions and requirements conflict with
the Majority view that Stanford undergraduates
should not be found by law to take and complete
a course of study prescribed by some agent or
agency external to the University, when that
agency also determines (directly or indirectly)
the mode and content of instruction of all or
part of the prescribed course.
All three services require that ROTC cadets
meet certain academic standards. The Majority
believes that Stanford undergraduates should not
be bound by law to maintain academic standards
prescribed by an external agency, especially
when that agency also participates in determining
whether or not such standards have been met.

C.2.b. Personal Conduct. All three
services require that the cadet maintain certain
unspecified standards of personal and moral con
duct. The Majority feels that such restrictions
can seriously limit the student's free participa
tion in all facets of intellectual inquiry and legal
political activity. Furthermore, the Navy finan
cial assistance contract stipulates that the candi
date "remain unmarried until commissioned."
These standards too are established by an agency
external to the University, and judgments con
cerning them are made by the same agency.
While the Majority recognizes the special require
ments of the armed forces and could not object
to similar conditions in contracts between indi
vidual students and the military services when
not a part of a university program or activity, it
can and does object to such conditions when
they are a part of a University-subsidized and
sanctioned activity.
C.2.c. Punitive Clauses. All three ser
vices include in their financial assistance con
tracts clauses that bind the student to a period of
enlisted service for "willfully evading" stipulated
terms. Despite the fact that these clauses have
rarely been invoked at Stanford, the Majority
deems them clearly punitive in intent, and feels
that they unduly infringe the student's freedom
within the University community.
C.2.d. Contracts for Service. To our
knowledge, the ROTC contracts are the only
University-sponsored and sanctioned contracts
on the undergraduate level that bind a student to
service. There are various loan programs such as
the NDEA which allow teaching service to act in
lieu of repayments. Still, these loan programs do
not require service, since the loans can be repaid
with appropriate interest over a period of years.
The ROTC financial assistance grants have no
such provision.
The Majority wishes to point out that these
contractual restrictions and/or obligations oper
ate as a whole. The punitive clauses operate in
relation to academic standards requirements,
course of study requirements, conduct require
ments, and service requirements. The service obli
gation is intimately related to the course of study
requirements. It is this interlocking of contrac
tual requirements, restrictions, and obligations
that makes the whole much more objectionable
than each of its parts might suggest. The Univer
sity's rights and obligations to establish, main
tain, and judge its own standards of academics,
course of study, and student conduct is funda
mental to our conception of the university as
defined above.
D. Academic Objections.
In considering the academic aspects of the
problem, the Committee heard public testimony
that ROTC courses were of very high calibre. We
do not wish to contest this, though members of
the Committee have also heard informally and
confidentially that the contrary is also sometimes
the case. Whatever may be the truth of the mat
ter, the Majority's objections do not rest on these
grounds, but on the inherent goals of these
courses.
D.l Course Goals. Although in recent
years the Department of Defense instruction
plans for the ROTC programs have allowed Pro
fessors of Military Science increasing flexibility
in the choice of text materials and in course sub
stitution, the ultimate goals of these programs
are still fixed by the Department of Defense.
These goals are not compatible with the Univer
sity's "primary commitment to the creation and
dissemination of knowledge, in an environment
of free intellectual activity." The primary goal of
the ROTC programs is to educate, train, and eval
uate junior officers for the U.S. Armed Forces.
The Plan for NROTC Instructional Program
(Navpers 93941, May 1968) defines as "major
goals":
(1) To assist in the education of the
midshipman in a major field of study of interest
to the Navy or Marine Corps leading to a bacca
laureate degree.
(2) To provide the midshipman with
the fundamental concepts and principles of Naval
Science and with the professional Naval knowl
edge necessary to establish a sound basis for his
future growth as a Naval or Marine Corps officer.
(3) To prepare the midshipman for
service with the highest sense of honor and integ
rity as a commissioned officer; to cultivate the
essential elements of military leadership; to fos
ter the growth of a strong sense of loyalty and
dedication to his Service and to the Nation.
(4) To prepare the midshipman to
undertake successfully in later periods of his
career, advanced/continuing education in a field
of application and interest to the Naval Service.
(5) To inject the values of civilian
higher education into the Naval Service by utili
zing the expertise of civilian faculty instruction
where applicable. (Italics ours)
The Army Program of Instruction states that the
objectives of ROTC are "to procure and produce
junior officers who by education, training, atti
tude and inherent qualities are suitable for con
tinued development as officers in the Army."
And the Air Force ROTC mission "is to commis
sion career-oriented second lieutenants in res
ponse to Air Force requirements" by successfully
accomplishing the following four objectives:
(1) Identify, motivate, and select
qualified students to complete the Air Force
ROTC program.
(2) Provide college-level education
that will qualify cadets for commissioning in the
U.S. Air Force.
(3) Heighten each cadet's apprecia
tion of, and dedication to, American principles,
give him an understanding of how the Air Force
serves the national interest, and develop his po
tential as a leader and manager and his under
standing of officer professionalism in the Air
Force.
(4) Commission in the U.S. Air
Force high quality second lieutenants. (Italics
ours)
The goals of these programs are clearly non
academic in nature. Given the goals of these pro
grams as defined above, Military Science instruc
tors are legally and ethically obligated to present
their course material from restricted points of
view, to evaluate the student's fitness for a mili
tary career partly on these grounds, and to report
this evaluation to higher authorities.
Since the goals of the ROTC Programs are to
educate potential officers, much of the current
Military Science course content—weapons sys
tems, small-unit tactics, Army administration, or
ientation, counter-insurgency, etc.—is of such a
narrowly pragmatic, professional nature as to be
incompatible with an undergraduate academic
credit program. Although the Minority Report's
proposed Committee on Military Studies might
deny academic credit to some of these "nuts and
bolts" courses, others might remain in the credit
program. And indeed, one might question
whether any course with the goals outlined above
merits inclusion in Stanford's academic credit
structure. Although knowledge is disseminated in
ROTC courses, it is rarely created in an environ
ment of free intellectual activity; and it is dissem
inated to the end that committed junior officers

to enter the U.S. Armed Forces. The Military
Science Programs' lack of awareness of what we
believe to be the primary commitment of the
University is further evidenced in their equation
of the "values of civilian higher education" with
the "expertise of civilian faculty where applic
able." (NROTC Goals No. 5)
D.2. Course Substitution. The substitu
tion of courses in regular academic departments
for courses presently taught by the ROTC fac
ulty (particularly U.S. military history and U.S.
foreign policy) has been frequently suggested.
This has some attractive features, but these
should not blind one to the problems it also en
tails.
D.2.a. Such courses would have to
meet the goals set forth by the armed forces.
Senior ROTC faculty are being granted wide lati
tude in determining whether or not goals are
being met by a particular course, but it is never
theless true that the scope, coverage, and content
of such courses will be under periodic review by
the military establishment.
D.2.b. If such a course is built into
the ROTC curriculum and required of all cadets,
then the presumption exists that the course will
meet the needs of the ROTC in scope, coverage,
approach, and frequency of offering. TTie faculty
member will have to take these considerations
into account in planning course changes, leave
periods, etc. If such a required course fails for
any reason to meet ROTC needs, the ROTC must
reassume part or all of the instruction in that
area, or drop the requirement. But then course
substitution is either lost or was unnecessary in
the first place.
D.2.C. If such a course is to be op
tional for ROTC cadets, then some other options
must be available. This presumes one of three
things: (a) that other equivalent courses are avail
able in the academic departments, (b) that the
ROTC faculty provide the equivalent, or (c) that
cadets need not receive training in that particular
area. The revised ROTC instructional programs
seem to rule out the last; normal University prac
tice makes the first unlikely. Thus, here too, the
advantages of course substitution may be lost.
Finally, it should be noted that it will be difficult
to ensure that the course is in fact "optional." If
other options are limited, and if cadets are
"strongly urged" to enroll in a particular course,
is that course truly optional?
D.2.d. Course substitution will in
crease both the direct and indirect subsidy of
Stanford to the ROTC by assuming part of the
training of ROTC cadets (see below). It will add
to the work of the academic department and the
individual faculty member by the number of stu
dents who would not otherwise have enrolled in
his course (this could, for example, require addi
tional expenditures for T.A.'s, readers, etc.). The
call upon the resources of the ROTC programs
will be correspondingly lightened.
D.3. Departmental Status. An academic
department shares much the same definition as
the institution of which it is a part, with particu
lar reference to a specific area and/or discipline.
When a student has demonstrated a certain com
petence in this area or discipline, he is recom
mended for a degree, either at the undergraduate
or graduate level. The Departments of Military
Science do not do this at either level; rather, they
offer commissions in the Armed Forces to the
men who successfully complete their programs.
Unlike other departments or schools in the Uni
versity, the ROTC Departments are educating
young men not to academic ends but to work for
a specific employer in a specific area.
The Minority recommends combining the
three ROTC Departments into a single Depart
ment of Military Studies, no longer to be lodged
in the School of Humanities and Sciences but to
be responsible to the Provost via a Committee on
Military Studies. The Majority believes this is a
recognition of the anomalous nature of such a
department, which has neither undergraduate nor
graduate majors and serves non-academic ends.
D.4. Faculty Search and Appointment.
The Military Science Departments' faculty is ap
pointed in an irregular way. The appointment
procedure for Military Science personnel by
passes both department-initiated search and eval
uation, and the normal administrative ratification
process. Whenever a position becomes vacant, the
appropriate branch of the Armed Services pre
sents nominations for the position to the Pro
vost's Office. The administration may veto any
military nominations. (It has done so at least
three times.) The nominee's military record and
college transcripts are examined and, whenever
possible, a personal interview is held. Though
ROTC faculty are presently members of the Aca
demic Council, they are not subject to the usual
University policy on tenure, for the Defense De
partment agrees to recall them immediately at
the request of the administration. (Stanford has
exercised this option once in recent years.) Fur
thermore, the Department of Defense reserves
the right to transfer from Stanford any assigned
military personnel. Thus, under present arrange
ments, an external organization may unilaterally
remove a member of the Stanford faculty.
This irregular appointment and retention pro
cedure violates the principle that the primary re
sponsibility for faculty appointment and status
rests with the Stanford faculty and administra
tion. Secondly, it creates a special class of faculty
members having some characteristics not shared
by the regular faculty and lacking others.
Thirdly, since Stanford cannot initiate the search
nor fully supervise the screening process, the Uni
versity loses some degree of control over the
quality of the ROTC faculty. These irregular fea
tures would continue, even under revised proced
ures.
IV. Objections to ROTC as An Organized, Non
credit, On-Campus Program
The previous section reviews our objections,
both general and specific, to ROTC as an aca
demic program at Stanford. Having come to this
point, the Majority gave serious consideration to
retention of ROTC on campus as an organized,
non-credit program of education and training. We
believe such an arrangement may be an improve
ment over both the present situation and the rec
ommendations of the Minority. But it is the con
viction of the Majority that the logic of the gen
eral objections must apply generally to the rela
tions between ROTC and Stanford. To recom
mend termination of academic credit and reten
tion of non-credit ROTC programs is to accept
the argument with respect to the former but fail
to apply it to the latter. We here recapitulate
those considerations with reference to ROTC as
an on-campus, non-credit program of training
and education.
A. What has been termed "conflict of inter
est" would continue, since ROTC would remain
the corporate representation of the armed forces
within the structure of the University, staffed by
professional military officers. If ROTC is re
tained as a non-credit program, several opera
tional problems will grow directly out of the fact

that ROTC will remain in the University but not
of the University. Any solution of these prob
lems will constitute recognition of the anomalous
nature of the arrangement.
1. Would the ROTC programs, singly or
collectively, continue as "Department(s)?" If
not, what status should they have? On what
grounds would such a decision be made?
2. The same questions apply to the status
of ROTC faculty. Shall formal academic rank be
accorded, as presently required by law? To
whom, at what level, and on what grounds?
3. How shall the University handle search
and appointment procedures for persons offering
no accredited work, but who present courses re
quired of a certain proportion of the student
body?
4. How shall the University oversee the
content and mode of instruction in these non
credit but required courses?
B. The primary goal of the ROTC programs
would remain, as before, the recruitment and
training of junior officers. Thus, specific training
for employment by an outside organization, car
ried on by members of that organization, would
continue.
C. Institutional contracts would remain,
though perhaps in a modified form. Thus, dispro
portionate subsidization of the military at Stan
ford would continue: direct subsidies in the form
of facilities, services, etc.; indirect subsidies in
the form of course substitution, etc.
D. Individual contracts, requiring participa
tion in ROTC training programs on-campus by
signatories, would continue. It is here not the
existence of such contracts that is objected to;
rather it is to the institutional sanction and sup
port given these contracts by Stanford Univer
sity.
V. Recommendations
Thus far the Majority has emphasized those
aspects of the present ROTC which make them
objectionable to the point of incompatibility
with the University. We believe such analysis,
while lengthy and complex, is necessary when
ever a significant change is recommended for an
on-going academic program. Also required is
some projection of the nature and structure of
the revised program. That is, having dealt with
objections in the relationship between Stanford
and the ROTC departments, what is considered
to be the proper relationship?
It should be noted, first, that no accurate pro
jection can be made because it is not known
what limits the Department of Defense has for its
junior officer procurement program. We cannot
predict what will be acceptable to the military
services beyond existing operational and legal
constraints.
Secondly, the Majority believes the issue of
proper relations is confused by excessive reliance
on the term "ROTC." The Majority has empha
sized the distinction between ROTC as a mech
anism and the objectives which ROTC serves.
Our arguments have been directed to the mech
anism, not the objectives or purposes. Misinter
pretation arises if this distinction is obscured. If
the language of the Senate's charge is taken to
mean that "ROTC" denotes an organized on
campus program of eduation and training, then
the Majority is compelled to state there can be
no "proper relations between the ROTC depart
ments and Stanford." This, in turn, can mis
takenly be construed to mean that the Majority
believes no proper relations can be established
between the objectives served by the existing de
partments and Stanford.
It is likely that the program which we recom
mend would not and should not be denoted as
"ROTC." This is accurate insofar as the program
has been substantially altered and does not con
form to present programs of ROTC. But any new
denotation should not be interpreted to mean
that we have sought to abolish all relations be
tween Stanford and the purposes of the existing
ROTC programs or that we have concluded that
no proper relations can be established. Rather we
believe that for proper relations to exist, a new
mechanism must be created —one that differs
from the present program, but can still serve the
same purposes in such a way as to be compatible
with the University.
We envision relations whereby each service of
the armed forces would assign personnel to
manage an administrative apparatus, with space
provided possibly in the Dean of Students' Office
of Special Services, that would concern itself
with recruitment of students into the program,
process the revised student contracts and scholar
ships, offer professional counseling and informa
tion to individuals as well as to the existing stu
dent voluntary groups representative of the three
services on campus. Further, this Armed Forces
Officers Program would arrange with enrolled
students for off-campus training and education.
We believe that all education presently offered
by the ROTC departments could be transferred
to extended summer encampments. The military
personnel on campus would be free to offer vol
untary undergraduate special courses, as are
other members of the Stanford community, fol
lowing the guidelines established by the Commit
tee on Undergraduate Education.
To these ends, we recommend the following:
1. After a transitional period (see recom
mendation 5 below), there should be no aca
demic credit received for participation in pro
grams of military training and education.
2. By the end of this period, non-credit,
required military training and education should
no longer be offered on the Stanford campus.
Consistent with these recommendations, a
scholarship or contract "program" may remain,
comprising normal academic education, supple
mented by on-campus voluntary activities and
off-campus training.
3. By the end of this period, all remaining
military programs or activities should be regu
lated by the University's general policies on Stan
ford Voluntary Organizations. No Stanford fac
ulty member or administrator, acting as a spokes
man for the University, shall encourage students
to participate in military training and education,
except in the manner in which participation in all
voluntary activities is encouraged.
4. Individual contracts between Stanford
students and the armed forces should be revised
to reflect actual practice. We recommend further
that punitive clauses involving enlisted service be
removed.
5. These provisions should be in force by
the fall term 1973. Beginning with the fall term
1970, no entering freshman shall be granted aca
demic credit for ROTC activities. The three
ROTC departments should be replaced by a sin
gle Armed Forces Officers Program no later than
fall term 1973. This program shall be for the
purposes of administration, counseling, and re
cruiting for off-campus reserve officer training
and education. (N.B. Because present institu
tional contracts specify one year's notice prior to
termination, the phase-out process cannot begin
before 1970.)
6. Appropriate University authorities
should promptly initiate action leading to re
vision or termination of the contracts between
Stanford and the armed forces (a) in order to
enable the phase-out to begin in 1970, and (b) in
order to reflect the voluntary, non-credit status
of military training at Stanford. We further rec
ommend that a committee be appointed, com
posed of representatives of faculty, administra
tion, military science department, and students,
to assist in effecting the transition.
7. During the transitional period, we rec
ommend that the status of officers presently at
tached to ROTC units remain unchanged. Until
the fall term 1973, newly assigned officers shall
carry the rank of "Lecturer," except for the
newly assigned senior officers of each branch of
the armed forces, who shall carry the rank of
"Lecturer with rank of Professor." After the be
ginning of the 1973-74 academic year, represen
tatives of the armed forces at Stanford shall carry
no academic rank. Similarly until this time, the
departmental and administrative structure of the
ROTC program shall remain as at present.
8. Students already enrolled in ROTC pro
grams, and those enrolling prior to the fall term
1970, shall continue as at present, except that
present contracts should be revised in accord
with recommendation 4.
