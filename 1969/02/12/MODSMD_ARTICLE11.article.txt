FINAL REPORT OF THE MINORITY
AD HOC SENATE COMMITTEE ON ROTC
FOREWORD
The undersigned members of the Senate ad
hoc Committee on ROTC submit the following
Minority Report with recommendations for the
improvement of ROTC at Stanford University.
This Minority Report is based upon the following
fundamental position.
For the foreseeable future, this nation will re
quire armed forces of considerable size, and will
require substantial numbers of well-educated and
well-trained officers to lead them. The ROTC
programs have been for many years the principal
means for providing such officers for the perman
ent forces or for reserve components. Participa
tion by such installations as Stanford University
in the ROTC programs, voluntary on the part of
the University and voluntary on the part of its
students, is therefore of considerable importance
to the nation. Moreover, maintenance of ROTC
programs on the campus provides a desirable op
portunity for those students who wish to earn a
military commission and thus meet their military
service obligations as commissioned officers.
In the proceedings of the Senate ad hoc Com
mittee on ROTC there has been no evidence pre
sented to show that ROTC programs are inimical
to the fundamental interests of Stanford Univer
sity or its students. On balance, it has been
shown that the availability of ROTC programs is
beneficial to the University, particularly in its
financial aid programs for students. If for these
reasons, the University concludes that it should
participate in ROTC, the University is obligated
to support ROTC in conditions that offer reason
able assurances of vitality and worth to its stu
dents, as well as to the military services.
It is the judgment of the minority members of
the Committee that ROTC cannot survive as an
extra-curricular activity separated from the aca
demic structure of the University. Indeed, we
consider that such separation is inconsistent with
a decision to continue ROTC at Stanford and
would be tantamount to abolition.
On the other hand, the minority members are
firmly convinced that a number of important im
provements should and can be made in ROTC to
meet the legitimate criticisms of its present form
and to place ROTC in an appropriate relationship
to the academic structure of the University.
The improvements we propose retain military
studies of worthy academic quality and proven
interest to substantial numbers of Stanford stu
dents as academic programs. Removal of these
studies from the curriculum would deprive Stan
ford students of existing opportunities for rele
vant academic inquiry without accompanying
benefit to any other constituency of the Univer
sity.
RECOMMENDA TIONS
The minority members of the Senate ad hoc
Committee on ROTC recommend:
1. That ROTC continue at Stanford Univer
sity;
2. That ROTC continue to be part of the aca
demic program of the University with specific
provision for a closer integration of ROTC into
its academic structure;
3. That ROTC programs be modified with re
spect to the organization and administration of
ROTC, the status of and appointment procedures
for its instructional staff, the curriculum, and the
contractual relationships between the military
services and the University and between the ser
vices and Stanford students.
4. That, to accomplish the above recommend
ations, the following program for ROTC be insti
tuted at Stanford.
AN IMPROVED ROTC PROGRAM FOR
STANFORD
The minority members reject the premise that
a substantive case for or against ROTC at Stan
ford has been established upon purely institu
tional considerations. Many subjective judgments
about the proper educational role of the Univer
sity are involved in such a premise. Many differ
ent opinions exist within the University about
what constitutes valid service to external con
cerns and interests. While it is possible to con
ceive that under certain circumstances the pres
ence of ROTC could be inimical to Stanford, we
do not find that presence, in actuality, to be a
threat to the integrity of the University. We do
find that over the years institutional relationships
for ROTC established by contract and law have
become archaic and in need of reform. Therefore
we have mainly responded to the charge of the
Senate of the Academic Council by proposing
reforms that will establish suitable relationships
for ROTC. We believe the program which we rec
ommend for ROTC at Stanford will, upon criti
cal evaluation, be found to amend those features
which the majority members considered most ob
jectionable in the present program.
Our position rests upon the belief that a point
by point comparison of the following program
and the objections raised to ROTC by the major
ity report will affirm that ROTC can be contin
ued at Stanford as a compatible and worthwhile
academic endeavor.

Departmental Structure
The Departments of Military Science, Naval
Science, and Aerospace Studies shall be com
bined into a Department of Military Studies. The
Chairmanship of this single department shall be
rotated among the heads of ROTC Units. A dis
tinction shall be made between the Department
of Military Studies and the ROTC Units. The De
partment of Military Studies shall be a part of
the academic structure of the University. The
ROTC Units shall be administrative agencies with
the function of serving students preparing for a
commission in the Armed Forces. The Units shall
administer scholarships and contracts, conduct
extra-curricular sessions, and advise students on
preparation for commissioning. The three units
of the Department of Military Studies shall re
ceive University administrative support as the
Provost may designate.
Rationale: The present arrangement of
three separate military science departments
results in an excessive administrative over
head and overrepresentation at councils of
departmental chairmen not warranted by
the size of these departments' instructional
staff or the variety of their course offer
ings. Different budgeting, personnel admin
istration, and reporting in the three mili
tary services, however, do require that each
ROTC Unit be administratively separate.
The ROTC Units will appropriately operate
at Stanford as administrative agencies of
the military services, and not as direct
sponsors for academic programs.
Organization of Military Studies Programs
A program of Military Science, of Naval Sci
ence, and of Aerospace Studies shall be offered
in the Stanford curriculum under the aegis of a
Military Studies Committee. The Committee
shall be appointed by the Senate and be com
posed of four Professors from the University at
large, the senior military officer from each ROTC
unit of the Department of Military Studies, and
four undergraduate students (two of whom will
be enrolled in ROTC and two from the univer
sity-at-large).
The Military Studies Committee shall deter
mine credit for courses offered by the Depart
ment of Military Studies, shall determine the cur
riculum for the Military Studies Programs, and
shall review the qualifications of military officers
recommended for appointment to instructional
positions. The military Studies Committee shall
be responsible to the Committee on Undergrad
uate Education. Proposed military science
courses which appropriately fall into the cate
gory of Undergraduate Specials shall be sub
mitted to the Committee on Undergraduate Edu
cation for approval. The Military Studies Pro
grams shall include these courses which are neces
sary to qualify students for a commission
through the ROTC programs, and are available
for students who wish to attain a background
knowledge of military art and science. The Pro
grams shall include accredited courses offered by
the Department of Military Studies, courses of
fered in other departments of the University, and
any approved military science Undergraduate
Specials.
Rationale: The determination of programs
of military study, review and of appoint
ments of military teachers and adjudication
of course credit by a Military Studies Com
mittee will fix responsibility for military
studies at the University in a manner more
consistent with institutional practices. The
military services, under this arrangement,
will assume more a role of an accrediting
body with respect to curriculum.
Other features of this proposal which seem
beneficial are: (1) the provision for contin
ual review and upgrading of military stud
ies programs, (2) the attractiveness to able
military officers, providing for appoint
ment of those officers who can make the
most substantial academic contributions to
the University, (3) the involvement of stu
dents and non-military faculty along with
military officers in determining the mili
tary studies to be undertaken, and (4) a
reduction of the sense of isolation of mili
tary teachers within the academic com
munity.
The extent of the nation's gross national
product that is allocated for defense and
the fact that warfare unhappily continues
adds relevancy to this field of academic
study. A fear that a militaristic view will
prevail is unfounded from the evidence this
committee has received, and in any event,
the military point of view can be leavened
by a standing committee which is plural
istic in perspective and reflects the values
of the University.
Academic Rank
The senior military officer of each unit of the
Department of Military Studies shall have the
rank and title of Professor of Military Science,
Naval Science, and Aerospace Studies, respec
tively, with the same perquisites which now per
tain to those positions.
All other military officers of the instructional
staff shall have the rank and title of Lecturer,
with the privileges and perquisites which now
pertain to that position.
In the event that officers who ordinarily
would be appointed Lecturer have unusual quali
fications, the Military Studies Committee may
recommend appointment as Assistant or Associ
ate Professor for the term of their anticipated
presence at Stanford.
Rationale: The rank of Professor for the
senior military officer appointed to each
ROTC unit is considered appropriate to his
experience, knowledge and responsibilities,
and is stipulated in present law.
This academic rank also attracts to ROTC
assignments better senior officers with
about twenty-four years of broad military
experience and education. Membership in
the Academic Council provides a means for
desirable involvement by the senior mili
tary officer in university affairs.
Since no direct correlation between mili
tary education and experience and regular
academic credentials exists it seems ap
propriate to make "Lecturer" the normal
appointment for more junior military of
ficers. This rank is consistent with that ac
corded well-qualified individuals from the
professions and the community who teach
courses at Stanford. However, when special
competence is available or found, a provis
ion for professorial appointment of these
officers is warranted.
Appointment Procedures
Those to be considered for appointment to
the rank of Professor shall go through the normal
review and appointment procedure, or as close to
that procedure as is possible. The following pro
cedure is proposed.
a. The Service concerned will submit a panel
of nominations, together with their creden
tials, to the President of the University.
The credentials will include:
(1) Personal resume.
(2) Educational record, including trans
cripts of academic work, service school
attendance, etc.
(3) Evidence of instructional and other
faculty-type experience.
b. The President will submit the nominations
to the Military Studies Committee for re

view and recommendation. It is intended
that the Committee for this purpose,
would function as a school or department
faculty "search committee." Regular Ad
visory Board recommendation forms will
be prepared as completely as possible.
c. The service concerned shall be prepared to
present at least the Committee's preferred
candidate for interview by the Committee
and the President (or his designated repre
sentative).
d. The Committee will then submit its recom
mended and preferred candidate to the
Provost for review at that level.
e. The Provost will submit the recommenda
tion to the Advisory Board for consider
ation. It is assumed that the Advisory
Board will review the cases in the light of
the special considerations in the same way
that it takes into account other appoint
ments in other professional fields.
112. Following Advisory Board action, the rec
ommendation will follow the usual course
to the Board of Trustees for final action.
For those to be considered for appointment as
Lecturers, the procedure shall be the same as for
professors, except that the recommendation need
not be submitted to the Advisory Board.
In the event that a junior officer is proposed
for an assistant or associate professor, the candi
date would be processed through the same chan
nel as are professors of military programs.
Rationale: The foregoing proposals provide
a procedure closely akin to the normal pro
cedure for faculty appointments. The ma
jor difference is of course the initial search
mechanism which is conducted through the
heads of ROTC units and their respective
military services. The minority members
considered the title of Visiting Professor
but rejected it on the basis that deviations
from the norm would be greater with this
title than under the procedures outlined.
Visiting professors are typically appointed
for one year, and have no administrative
responsibility. Senior military officer ap
pointments are usually for a period of
three years. Senior military officers are res
ponsible for direction of their programs as
well as representation to other elements of
the University.
Academic Credit
The courses of the Department of Military
Studies which are approved by the Military Stud
ies Committee shall be offered for degree credit.
Instruction desirable for potential military of
ficers but considered by the Military Studies
Committee to be of a narrow training scope shall
be conducted as extra-curricular sessions. Assum
ing that studies in military history and national
security affairs will, in the future, be available in
other departments, degree credit for courses of
fered by the Department of Military Studies shall
not exceed 18 quarter units or 12 semester units
or their equivalent in a four-year curriculum.
Rationale: The military science and studies
courses which meet University standards
should not be excluded arbitrarily from the
curriculum or credit. The evidence before
this committee has indicated that most of
the courses offered in the military sciences
are equivalent in quality to those of other
departments. A few, such as Naval Orienta
tion, have been generally acknowledged to
be of a narrow training nature and credit
will not be sought for these and similar
courses. The proposed limitation on total
degree credit is not the result of a bargain
ing process resulting in a compromise limit.
Eighteen quarter units or 12 semester units
over a four-year period represents our judg
ment on courses existing and planned for
the military studies cirricula which are
likely to be deemed worthy of academic
credit and at the same time meet the needs
of the services. Additionally it is believed
that this proposed limitation on academic
credit for military studies will insure ROTC
students the flexibility to undertake their
other academic responsibilities without in
curring an undue overload.
Wherever possible, courses offered by other
departments of the University should be
substituted for military-taught courses,
thus further reducing the amount of degree
credit and student overload.
Student Contracts
Individual contracts between students and the
military departments shall be changed to clearly
reflect actual practices. Specifically any ROTC
student—either those on financial assistance or
associated on another contractual basis—must be
assured in writing that he may disenroll from
ROTC within the first two years of a four-year
program without prejudice or obligation.
Rationale: The practice has always been to
disenroll any ROTC student without pre
judice for future military service and with
out obligation during his first two years. In
no case has a student not receiving finan
cial assistance been denied disenrollment
without obligation at any time over four
years. The real nature of the agreement be
tween students in ROTC and the services is
a compact which the student may break
without obligation assuming he is acting in
good faith.
Changes in individual contracts will require
negotiations with the military services.
Such negotiations should be undertaken
immediately.
It should be noted that students may enroll
or audit military science courses without
joining ROTC. Those who are not certain
of their interest or choice may use this
means of securing increased information on
which to base their decision about ROTC.
University Contracts
Contractual agreements between Stanford
University and the military services should be al
tered to reflect the provisions of this proposed
program.
Rationale: Contracts are subject to renego
tiation on a yearly basis and either party
may terminate on a year's notice. If altered
relationships are agreed upon, the changes
in contracts and agreements must follow
immediately.
Retroactive Application
Loss of academic credit by students enrolled
in ROTC or change in faculty status of military
officers already appointed to the Stanford fac
ulty shall not be incurred as a result of the pro
visions of this recommendation. All other
changes shall be implemented as expeditiously as
possible.
Trial Period
The proposed program shall be undertaken for
a five-year trial period upon mutual agreement
between the military services and Stanford Uni
versity. At the end of the five-year trial period
there shall be a searching review of the success of
the proposed program.
Rationale: A five-year trial period was se
lected to permit evaluation of two com
plete cycles of the four-year program with
particular regard to the evaluation of stu
dents completing the program.
CONCLUSION
The foregoing recommendations are based up
on a particular view of the University and of the
appropriate relations between the military ser

vices and this University. We believe Stanford to
be, among other things, a pluralistic community
serving a number of important and worthwhile
functions, including liberal arts and preprofes
sional undergraduate education as well as grad
uate training in the arts and sciences and in the
professional fields. No one college or university
can or should attempt to serve every possible in
terest in all of these areas, but we hold that
ROTC has a long and honorable history as part
of the Stanford scene and that it fits within the
framework of what Stanford does well.
In our consideration of the place of ROTC at
Stanford, we accepted the premise that, given the
evident state of the world and this nation's re
sponsibilities in it, there will be for some time to
come a substantial need for military forces of
considerable size. Such a force will require the
very best leadership at all levels that the country
can provide. ROTC is a major source of that
leadership and will continue to be so for the fore
seeable future. The service academies and other
means of officer training, as presently consti
tuted, cannot possibly supply the need of over
30,000 new officers each year. The colleges and
universities are reasonable sources of young of
ficers, and ROTC has been for many years the
means of the cooperative effort between the mili
tary services and universities to provide these of
ficers.
We accept the view that the University has a
responsibility to serve the nation and society, for
the University benefits directly from its privi
leged place in that society. No single institution
can render every service, and each must, of its
own free choice, select those areas in which it
can serve effectively. The University cannot be
isolated from the pressing problems of our
society, nor should it be. One important set of
problems facing the country is that of foreign
and military policy. This has been so since the
establishment of the United States and it can be
assumed that it will continue to be so for some
time to come. Stanford and many other colleges
and universities have, over the years, cooperated
with the Federal Government and the military
services in the training of young officers; this is
one of the relevant major problem areas in which
this University has served.
We believe that much of the current anxiety
about and opposition to ROTC is rooted in the
profound disagreements with the conduct of our
policy in Southeast Asia and our involvement in
the Vietnam War. We urge, however, that ROTC
be judged in the context of the nation's history
and in the context of a reasonable estimate of
the future. The termination of the present war
will not end the need for adequate national se
curity forces and for the need to provide the
leadership for them. We believe that the nation's
colleges and universities, including Stanford Uni
versity, should participate in training the leader
ship for these security forces.
There is no doubt that accommodation of
ROTC on a university campus requires arrange
ments at variance with accepted and standard
academic policy and practice. As we have shown,
we do not argue for the status quo with respect
to the way in which ROTC is organized and ad
ministered and in the way in which it relates to
the academic structure of the University.
The presence of ROTC as an academic pro
gram offends some members of the faculty and
of the student body who hold that there should
be no pre-professional educational programs, at
least at the undergraduate level. Some faculty
members and students are concerned with the
presence of a program that has certain marked
external controls in contrast to the more typical
internally-regulated activities. Some conclude
that instruction by the military is inevitably anti
thetical to free intellectual inquiry. But in our
investigations and inquiries, we have found that
there are several other pre-professional academic
programs with an accepted place in the Stanford
scene. We have found that there are other activi
ties subject to various forms and degrees of exter
nal constraint. We have found no evidence that
military instruction inhibits the development of
the freely inquiring minds of those enrolled in
ROTC; indeed there is no evidence that the pres
ent system, with its admitted variations from
standard academic practice, is the least harmful
to the academic community or to anyone in it.
We do not hold that ROTC is essential to
Stanford University nor do we hold that Stan
ford University is essential to the military ser
vices. We do not claim that in the long run ROTC
is necessarily the ultimate means of preparing
college-educated officers for military service. But
for the present, it is the best means available to
the country and is likely to be so for the foresee
able future. In the meantime, ROTC provides im
portant advantages to the University and to its
students. The presence of ROTC provides our
students with the means of earning a commission
so that they may meet their military service obli
gations as officers. The ROTC programs provide
approximately $250,000 per year in student fin
ancial aid, bringing to the University a very able
student element including a number who other
wise might not be able to come to Stanford.
ROTC provides an opportunity to study in a
field that is certainly relevant to modern day
concerns and which would not otherwise be
available to the Stanford students.
Moreover, we have found the military services
to be not unmindful of trends in educational
thought and have undertaken serious steps to im
prove the quality and acceptability of ROTC pro
grams on college and university campuses. While
each service has varied in its approach to the sti
uation, they all have important elements in com
mon. Each has given its department chairmen
considerable flexibility to substitute courses in
other departments for military courses, to ar
range schedules to suit individual students, and
to negotiate with their institutions other aspects
of the ROTC programs. The Professor of Naval
Science is told, for example, that he "will func
tion as an academic department head in fact as
well as name . . . (and) is expected to structure a
program of studies for each Naval Science stu
dent that will satisfy the University's overall de
gree requirements."
In considering the manner in which ROTC
should be related to the academic structure of
the University, we took cognizance of these pres
ent and continuing efforts of the military services
to make ROTC more compatible with the desires
and procedures of the academic community.
What the minority members of the Committee
have recommended is fully compatible with the
trends in the services.
Since we hold that ROTC should continue at
Stanford University, we consider it essential that
it be integrated as closely as possible into the
regular academic structure. We believe that it
should be an academic program subject to nor
mal University controls and supervision. We con
sider this to be essential to the survival of ROTC
at Stanford.
We do not believe that ROTC could survive
with vitality and challenge, be useful to the ser
vices and worthy of the University's support, as a
non-credit "voluntary activity" program outside
the academic structure. We doubt that it would
be attractive to any significant number of high
quality students and we doubt that it would be
subject to adequate control by the University. As
we have said earlier in this paper, we reject this
proposal for we consider it tantamount to aboli
tion.

We have proposed a different solution, one
designed to bring an improved ROTC program
more into line with accepted standards of the
University. Separation from the academic struc
ture would, in our judgment, •ender ROTC inef
fective and unmanageable and eventually unac
ceptable to the military services. We take the
position that ROTC can and must be improved in
the interests of the nation, of Stanford Univer
sity and of Stanford students.

FINAL REPORT OF THE MINORITY
AD HOC SENATE COMMITTEE ON ROTC
FOREWORD
The undersigned members of the Senate ad

The senior military officer of each unit of the
Department of Military Studies shall have the
rank and title of Professor of Military Science,
Naval Science, and Aerospace Studies, respec
tively, with the same perquisites which now per
tain to those positions.
All other military officers of the instructional
staff shall have the rank and title of Lecturer,
with the privileges and perquisites which now
pertain to that position.
In the event that officers who ordinarily
would be appointed Lecturer have unusual quali
fications, the Military Studies Committee may
recommend appointment as Assistant or Associ
ate Professor for the term of their anticipated
presence at Stanford.
Rationale: The rank of Professor for the
senior military officer appointed to each
ROTC unit is considered appropriate to his
experience, knowledge and responsibilities,
and is stipulated in present law.
This academic rank also attracts to ROTC
assignments better senior officers with
about twenty-four years of broad military
experience and education. Membership in
the Academic Council provides a means for
desirable involvement by the senior mili
tary officer in university affairs.
Since no direct correlation between mili
tary education and experience and regular
academic credentials exists it seems ap
propriate to make "Lecturer" the normal
appointment for more junior military of
ficers. This rank is consistent with that ac
corded well-qualified individuals from the
professions and the community who teach
courses at Stanford. However, when special
competence is available or found, a provis
ion for professorial appointment of these
officers is warranted.
Appointment Procedures
Those to be considered for appointment to
the rank of Professor shall go through the normal
review and appointment procedure, or as close to
that procedure as is possible. The following pro
cedure is proposed.
a. The Service concerned will submit a panel
of nominations, together with their creden
tials, to the President of the University.
The credentials will include:
(1) Personal resume.
(2) Educational record, including trans
cripts of academic work, service school
attendance, etc.
(3) Evidence of instructional and other
faculty-type experience.
b. The President will submit the nominations
to the Military Studies Committee for re

view and recommendation. It is intended
that the Committee for this purpose,
would function as a school or department
faculty "search committee." Regular Ad
visory Board recommendation forms will
be prepared as completely as possible.
c. The service concerned shall be prepared to
present at least the Committee's preferred
candidate for interview by the Committee
and the President (or his designated repre
sentative).
d. The Committee will then submit its recom
mended and preferred candidate to the
Provost for review at that level.
e. The Provost will submit the recommenda
tion to the Advisory Board for consider
ation. It is assumed that the Advisory
Board will review the cases in the light of
the special considerations in the same way
that it takes into account other appoint
ments in other professional fields.
112. Following Advisory Board action, the rec
ommendation will follow the usual course
to the Board of Trustees for final action.
For those to be considered for appointment as
Lecturers, the procedure shall be the same as for
professors, except that the recommendation need
not be submitted to the Advisory Board.
In the event that a junior officer is proposed
for an assistant or associate professor, the candi
date would be processed through the same chan
nel as are professors of military programs.
Rationale: The foregoing proposals provide
a procedure closely akin to the normal pro
cedure for faculty appointments. The ma
jor difference is of course the initial search
mechanism which is conducted through the
heads of ROTC units and their respective
military services. The minority members
considered the title of Visiting Professor
but rejected it on the basis that deviations
from the norm would be greater with this
title than under the procedures outlined.
Visiting professors are typically appointed
for one year, and have no administrative
responsibility. Senior military officer ap
pointments are usually for a period of
three years. Senior military officers are res
ponsible for direction of their programs as
well as representation to other elements of
the University.
Academic Credit
The courses of the Department of Military
Studies which are approved by the Military Stud
ies Committee shall be offered for degree credit.
Instruction desirable for potential military of
ficers but considered by the Military Studies
Committee to be of a narrow training scope shall
be conducted as extra-curricular sessions. Assum
ing that studies in military history and national
security affairs will, in the future, be available in
other departments, degree credit for courses of
fered by the Department of Military Studies shall
not exceed 18 quarter units or 12 semester units
or their equivalent in a four-year curriculum.
Rationale: The military science and studies
courses which meet University standards
should not be excluded arbitrarily from the
curriculum or credit. The evidence before
this committee has indicated that most of
the courses offered in the military sciences
are equivalent in quality to those of other
departments. A few, such as Naval Orienta
tion, have been generally acknowledged to
be of a narrow training nature and credit
will not be sought for these and similar
courses. The proposed limitation on total
degree credit is not the result of a bargain
ing process resulting in a compromise limit.
Eighteen quarter units or 12 semester units
over a four-year period represents our judg
ment on courses existing and planned for
the military studies cirricula which are
likely to be deemed worthy of academic
credit and at the same time meet the needs
of the services. Additionally it is believed
that this proposed limitation on academic
credit for military studies will insure ROTC
students the flexibility to undertake their
other academic responsibilities without in
curring an undue overload.
Wherever possible, courses offered by other
departments of the University should be
substituted for military-taught courses,
thus further reducing the amount of degree
credit and student overload.
Student Contracts
Individual contracts between students and the
military departments shall be changed to clearly
reflect actual practices. Specifically any ROTC
student—either those on financial assistance or
associated on another contractual basis—must be
assured in writing that he may disenroll from
ROTC within the first two years of a four-year
program without prejudice or obligation.
Rationale: The practice has always been to
disenroll any ROTC student without pre
judice for future military service and with
out obligation during his first two years. In
no case has a student not receiving finan
cial assistance been denied disenrollment
without obligation at any time over four
years. The real nature of the agreement be
tween students in ROTC and the services is
a compact which the student may break
without obligation assuming he is acting in
good faith.
Changes in individual contracts will require
negotiations with the military services.
Such negotiations should be undertaken
immediately.
It should be noted that students may enroll
or audit military science courses without
joining ROTC. Those who are not certain
of their interest or choice may use this
means of securing increased information on
which to base their decision about ROTC.
University Contracts
Contractual agreements between Stanford
University and the military services should be al
tered to reflect the provisions of this proposed
program.
Rationale: Contracts are subject to renego
tiation on a yearly basis and either party
may terminate on a year's notice. If altered
relationships are agreed upon, the changes
in contracts and agreements must follow
immediately.
Retroactive Application
Loss of academic credit by students enrolled
in ROTC or change in faculty status of military
officers already appointed to the Stanford fac
ulty shall not be incurred as a result of the pro
visions of this recommendation. All other
changes shall be implemented as expeditiously as
possible.
Trial Period
The proposed program shall be undertaken for
a five-year trial period upon mutual agreement
between the military services and Stanford Uni
versity. At the end of the five-year trial period
there shall be a searching review of the success of
the proposed program.
Rationale: A five-year trial period was se
lected to permit evaluation of two com
plete cycles of the four-year program with
particular regard to the evaluation of stu
dents completing the program.
CONCLUSION
The foregoing recommendations are based up
on a particular view of the University and of the
appropriate relations between the military ser

vices and this University. We believe Stanford to
be, among other things, a pluralistic community
serving a number of important and worthwhile
functions, including liberal arts and preprofes
sional undergraduate education as well as grad
uate training in the arts and sciences and in the
professional fields. No one college or university
can or should attempt to serve every possible in
terest in all of these areas, but we hold that
ROTC has a long and honorable history as part
of the Stanford scene and that it fits within the
framework of what Stanford does well.
In our consideration of the place of ROTC at
Stanford, we accepted the premise that, given the
evident state of the world and this nation's re
sponsibilities in it, there will be for some time to
come a substantial need for military forces of
considerable size. Such a force will require the
very best leadership at all levels that the country
can provide. ROTC is a major source of that
leadership and will continue to be so for the fore
seeable future. The service academies and other
means of officer training, as presently consti
tuted, cannot possibly supply the need of over
30,000 new officers each year. The colleges and
universities are reasonable sources of young of
ficers, and ROTC has been for many years the
means of the cooperative effort between the mili
tary services and universities to provide these of
ficers.
We accept the view that the University has a
responsibility to serve the nation and society, for
the University benefits directly from its privi
leged place in that society. No single institution
can render every service, and each must, of its
own free choice, select those areas in which it
can serve effectively. The University cannot be
isolated from the pressing problems of our
society, nor should it be. One important set of
problems facing the country is that of foreign
and military policy. This has been so since the
establishment of the United States and it can be
assumed that it will continue to be so for some
time to come. Stanford and many other colleges
and universities have, over the years, cooperated
with the Federal Government and the military
services in the training of young officers; this is
one of the relevant major problem areas in which
this University has served.
We believe that much of the current anxiety
about and opposition to ROTC is rooted in the
profound disagreements with the conduct of our
policy in Southeast Asia and our involvement in
the Vietnam War. We urge, however, that ROTC
be judged in the context of the nation's history
and in the context of a reasonable estimate of
the future. The termination of the present war
will not end the need for adequate national se
curity forces and for the need to provide the
leadership for them. We believe that the nation's
colleges and universities, including Stanford Uni
versity, should participate in training the leader
ship for these security forces.
There is no doubt that accommodation of
ROTC on a university campus requires arrange
ments at variance with accepted and standard
academic policy and practice. As we have shown,
we do not argue for the status quo with respect
to the way in which ROTC is organized and ad
ministered and in the way in which it relates to
the academic structure of the University.
The presence of ROTC as an academic pro
gram offends some members of the faculty and
of the student body who hold that there should
be no pre-professional educational programs, at
least at the undergraduate level. Some faculty
members and students are concerned with the
presence of a program that has certain marked
external controls in contrast to the more typical
internally-regulated activities. Some conclude
that instruction by the military is inevitably anti
thetical to free intellectual inquiry. But in our
investigations and inquiries, we have found that
there are several other pre-professional academic
programs with an accepted place in the Stanford
scene. We have found that there are other activi
ties subject to various forms and degrees of exter
nal constraint. We have found no evidence that
military instruction inhibits the development of
the freely inquiring minds of those enrolled in
ROTC; indeed there is no evidence that the pres
ent system, with its admitted variations from
standard academic practice, is the least harmful
to the academic community or to anyone in it.
We do not hold that ROTC is essential to
Stanford University nor do we hold that Stan
ford University is essential to the military ser
vices. We do not claim that in the long run ROTC
is necessarily the ultimate means of preparing
college-educated officers for military service. But
for the present, it is the best means available to
the country and is likely to be so for the foresee
able future. In the meantime, ROTC provides im
portant advantages to the University and to its
students. The presence of ROTC provides our
students with the means of earning a commission
so that they may meet their military service obli
gations as officers. The ROTC programs provide
approximately $250,000 per year in student fin
ancial aid, bringing to the University a very able
student element including a number who other
wise might not be able to come to Stanford.
ROTC provides an opportunity to study in a
field that is certainly relevant to modern day
concerns and which would not otherwise be
available to the Stanford students.
Moreover, we have found the military services
to be not unmindful of trends in educational
thought and have undertaken serious steps to im
prove the quality and acceptability of ROTC pro
grams on college and university campuses. While
each service has varied in its approach to the sti
uation, they all have important elements in com
mon. Each has given its department chairmen
considerable flexibility to substitute courses in
other departments for military courses, to ar
range schedules to suit individual students, and
to negotiate with their institutions other aspects
of the ROTC programs. The Professor of Naval
Science is told, for example, that he "will func
tion as an academic department head in fact as
well as name . . . (and) is expected to structure a
program of studies for each Naval Science stu
dent that will satisfy the University's overall de
gree requirements."
In considering the manner in which ROTC
should be related to the academic structure of
the University, we took cognizance of these pres
ent and continuing efforts of the military services
to make ROTC more compatible with the desires
and procedures of the academic community.
What the minority members of the Committee
have recommended is fully compatible with the
trends in the services.
Since we hold that ROTC should continue at
Stanford University, we consider it essential that
it be integrated as closely as possible into the
regular academic structure. We believe that it
should be an academic program subject to nor
mal University controls and supervision. We con
sider this to be essential to the survival of ROTC
at Stanford.
We do not believe that ROTC could survive
with vitality and challenge, be useful to the ser
vices and worthy of the University's support, as a
non-credit "voluntary activity" program outside
the academic structure. We doubt that it would
be attractive to any significant number of high
quality students and we doubt that it would be
subject to adequate control by the University. As
we have said earlier in this paper, we reject this
proposal for we consider it tantamount to aboli
tion.

We have proposed a different solution, one
designed to bring an improved ROTC program
more into line with accepted standards of the
University. Separation from the academic struc
ture would, in our judgment, •ender ROTC inef
fective and unmanageable and eventually unac
ceptable to the military services. We take the
position that ROTC can and must be improved in
the interests of the nation, of Stanford Univer
sity and of Stanford students.

FINAL REPORT OF THE MINORITY
AD HOC SENATE COMMITTEE ON ROTC
FOREWORD
The undersigned members of the Senate ad
hoc Committee on ROTC submit the following
Minority Report with recommendations for the
improvement of ROTC at Stanford University.
This Minority Report is based upon the following
fundamental position.
For the foreseeable future, this nation will re
quire armed forces of considerable size, and will
require substantial numbers of well-educated and
well-trained officers to lead them. The ROTC
programs have been for many years the principal
means for providing such officers for the perman
ent forces or for reserve components. Participa
tion by such installations as Stanford University
in the ROTC programs, voluntary on the part of
the University and voluntary on the part of its
students, is therefore of considerable importance
to the nation. Moreover, maintenance of ROTC
programs on the campus provides a desirable op
portunity for those students who wish to earn a
military commission and thus meet their military
service obligations as commissioned officers.
In the proceedings of the Senate ad hoc Com
mittee on ROTC there has been no evidence pre
sented to show that ROTC programs are inimical
to the fundamental interests of Stanford Univer
sity or its students. On balance, it has been
shown that the availability of ROTC programs is
beneficial to the University, particularly in its
financial aid programs for students. If for these
reasons, the University concludes that it should
participate in ROTC, the University is obligated
to support ROTC in conditions that offer reason
able assurances of vitality and worth to its stu
dents, as well as to the military services.
It is the judgment of the minority members of
the Committee that ROTC cannot survive as an
extra-curricular activity separated from the aca
demic structure of the University. Indeed, we
consider that such separation is inconsistent with
a decision to continue ROTC at Stanford and
would be tantamount to abolition.
On the other hand, the minority members are
firmly convinced that a number of important im
provements should and can be made in ROTC to
meet the legitimate criticisms of its present form
and to place ROTC in an appropriate relationship
to the academic structure of the University.
The improvements we propose retain military
studies of worthy academic quality and proven
interest to substantial numbers of Stanford stu
dents as academic programs. Removal of these
studies from the curriculum would deprive Stan
ford students of existing opportunities for rele
vant academic inquiry without accompanying
benefit to any other constituency of the Univer
sity.
RECOMMENDA TIONS
The minority members of the Senate ad hoc
Committee on ROTC recommend:
1. That ROTC continue at Stanford Univer
sity;
2. That ROTC continue to be part of the aca
demic program of the University with specific
provision for a closer integration of ROTC into
its academic structure;
3. That ROTC programs be modified with re
spect to the organization and administration of
ROTC, the status of and appointment procedures
for its instructional staff, the curriculum, and the
contractual relationships between the military
services and the University and between the ser
vices and Stanford students.
4. That, to accomplish the above recommend
ations, the following program for ROTC be insti
tuted at Stanford.
AN IMPROVED ROTC PROGRAM FOR
STANFORD
The minority members reject the premise that
a substantive case for or against ROTC at Stan
ford has been established upon purely institu
tional considerations. Many subjective judgments
about the proper educational role of the Univer
sity are involved in such a premise. Many differ
ent opinions exist within the University about
what constitutes valid service to external con
cerns and interests. While it is possible to con
ceive that under certain circumstances the pres
ence of ROTC could be inimical to Stanford, we
do not find that presence, in actuality, to be a
threat to the integrity of the University. We do
find that over the years institutional relationships
for ROTC established by contract and law have
become archaic and in need of reform. Therefore
we have mainly responded to the charge of the
Senate of the Academic Council by proposing
reforms that will establish suitable relationships
for ROTC. We believe the program which we rec
ommend for ROTC at Stanford will, upon criti
cal evaluation, be found to amend those features
which the majority members considered most ob
jectionable in the present program.
Our position rests upon the belief that a point
by point comparison of the following program
and the objections raised to ROTC by the major
ity report will affirm that ROTC can be contin
ued at Stanford as a compatible and worthwhile
academic endeavor.

Departmental Structure
The Departments of Military Science, Naval
Science, and Aerospace Studies shall be com
bined into a Department of Military Studies. The
Chairmanship of this single department shall be
rotated among the heads of ROTC Units. A dis
tinction shall be made between the Department
of Military Studies and the ROTC Units. The De
partment of Military Studies shall be a part of
the academic structure of the University. The
ROTC Units shall be administrative agencies with
the function of serving students preparing for a
commission in the Armed Forces. The Units shall
administer scholarships and contracts, conduct
extra-curricular sessions, and advise students on
preparation for commissioning. The three units
of the Department of Military Studies shall re
ceive University administrative support as the
Provost may designate.
Rationale: The present arrangement of
three separate military science departments
results in an excessive administrative over
head and overrepresentation at councils of
departmental chairmen not warranted by
the size of these departments' instructional
staff or the variety of their course offer
ings. Different budgeting, personnel admin
istration, and reporting in the three mili
tary services, however, do require that each
ROTC Unit be administratively separate.
The ROTC Units will appropriately operate
at Stanford as administrative agencies of
the military services, and not as direct
sponsors for academic programs.
Organization of Military Studies Programs
A program of Military Science, of Naval Sci
ence, and of Aerospace Studies shall be offered
in the Stanford curriculum under the aegis of a
Military Studies Committee. The Committee
shall be appointed by the Senate and be com
posed of four Professors from the University at
large, the senior military officer from each ROTC
unit of the Department of Military Studies, and
four undergraduate students (two of whom will
be enrolled in ROTC and two from the univer
sity-at-large).
The Military Studies Committee shall deter
mine credit for courses offered by the Depart
ment of Military Studies, shall determine the cur
riculum for the Military Studies Programs, and
shall review the qualifications of military officers
recommended for appointment to instructional
positions. The military Studies Committee shall
be responsible to the Committee on Undergrad
uate Education. Proposed military science
courses which appropriately fall into the cate
gory of Undergraduate Specials shall be sub
mitted to the Committee on Undergraduate Edu
cation for approval. The Military Studies Pro
grams shall include these courses which are neces
sary to qualify students for a commission
through the ROTC programs, and are available
for students who wish to attain a background
knowledge of military art and science. The Pro
grams shall include accredited courses offered by
the Department of Military Studies, courses of
fered in other departments of the University, and
any approved military science Undergraduate
Specials.
Rationale: The determination of programs
of military study, review and of appoint
ments of military teachers and adjudication
of course credit by a Military Studies Com
mittee will fix responsibility for military
studies at the University in a manner more
consistent with institutional practices. The
military services, under this arrangement,
will assume more a role of an accrediting
body with respect to curriculum.
Other features of this proposal which seem
beneficial are: (1) the provision for contin
ual review and upgrading of military stud
ies programs, (2) the attractiveness to able
military officers, providing for appoint
ment of those officers who can make the
most substantial academic contributions to
the University, (3) the involvement of stu
dents and non-military faculty along with
military officers in determining the mili
tary studies to be undertaken, and (4) a
reduction of the sense of isolation of mili
tary teachers within the academic com
munity.
The extent of the nation's gross national
product that is allocated for defense and
the fact that warfare unhappily continues
adds relevancy to this field of academic
study. A fear that a militaristic view will
prevail is unfounded from the evidence this
committee has received, and in any event,
the military point of view can be leavened
by a standing committee which is plural
istic in perspective and reflects the values
of the University.
Academic Rank
The senior military officer of each unit of the
Department of Military Studies shall have the
rank and title of Professor of Military Science,
Naval Science, and Aerospace Studies, respec
tively, with the same perquisites which now per
tain to those positions.
All other military officers of the instructional
staff shall have the rank and title of Lecturer,
with the privileges and perquisites which now
pertain to that position.
In the event that officers who ordinarily
would be appointed Lecturer have unusual quali
fications, the Military Studies Committee may
recommend appointment as Assistant or Associ
ate Professor for the term of their anticipated
presence at Stanford.
Rationale: The rank of Professor for the
senior military officer appointed to each
ROTC unit is considered appropriate to his
experience, knowledge and responsibilities,
and is stipulated in present law.
This academic rank also attracts to ROTC
assignments better senior officers with
about twenty-four years of broad military
experience and education. Membership in
the Academic Council provides a means for
desirable involvement by the senior mili
tary officer in university affairs.
Since no direct correlation between mili
tary education and experience and regular
academic credentials exists it seems ap

terest in all of these areas, but we hold that
ROTC has a long and honorable history as part
of the Stanford scene and that it fits within the
framework of what Stanford does well.
In our consideration of the place of ROTC at
Stanford, we accepted the premise that, given the
evident state of the world and this nation's re
sponsibilities in it, there will be for some time to
come a substantial need for military forces of
considerable size. Such a force will require the
very best leadership at all levels that the country
can provide. ROTC is a major source of that
leadership and will continue to be so for the fore
seeable future. The service academies and other
means of officer training, as presently consti
tuted, cannot possibly supply the need of over
30,000 new officers each year. The colleges and
universities are reasonable sources of young of
ficers, and ROTC has been for many years the
means of the cooperative effort between the mili
tary services and universities to provide these of
ficers.
We accept the view that the University has a
responsibility to serve the nation and society, for
the University benefits directly from its privi
leged place in that society. No single institution
can render every service, and each must, of its
own free choice, select those areas in which it
can serve effectively. The University cannot be
isolated from the pressing problems of our
society, nor should it be. One important set of
problems facing the country is that of foreign
and military policy. This has been so since the
establishment of the United States and it can be
assumed that it will continue to be so for some
time to come. Stanford and many other colleges
and universities have, over the years, cooperated
with the Federal Government and the military
services in the training of young officers; this is
one of the relevant major problem areas in which
this University has served.
We believe that much of the current anxiety
about and opposition to ROTC is rooted in the
profound disagreements with the conduct of our
policy in Southeast Asia and our involvement in
the Vietnam War. We urge, however, that ROTC
be judged in the context of the nation's history
and in the context of a reasonable estimate of
the future. The termination of the present war
will not end the need for adequate national se
curity forces and for the need to provide the
leadership for them. We believe that the nation's
colleges and universities, including Stanford Uni
versity, should participate in training the leader
ship for these security forces.
There is no doubt that accommodation of
ROTC on a university campus requires arrange
ments at variance with accepted and standard
academic policy and practice. As we have shown,
we do not argue for the status quo with respect
to the way in which ROTC is organized and ad
ministered and in the way in which it relates to
the academic structure of the University.
The presence of ROTC as an academic pro
gram offends some members of the faculty and
of the student body who hold that there should
be no pre-professional educational programs, at
least at the undergraduate level. Some faculty
members and students are concerned with the
presence of a program that has certain marked
external controls in contrast to the more typical
internally-regulated activities. Some conclude
that instruction by the military is inevitably anti
thetical to free intellectual inquiry. But in our
investigations and inquiries, we have found that
there are several other pre-professional academic
programs with an accepted place in the Stanford
scene. We have found that there are other activi
ties subject to various forms and degrees of exter
nal constraint. We have found no evidence that
military instruction inhibits the development of
the freely inquiring minds of those enrolled in
ROTC; indeed there is no evidence that the pres
ent system, with its admitted variations from
standard academic practice, is the least harmful
to the academic community or to anyone in it.
We do not hold that ROTC is essential to
Stanford University nor do we hold that Stan
ford University is essential to the military ser
vices. We do not claim that in the long run ROTC
is necessarily the ultimate means of preparing
college-educated officers for military service. But
for the present, it is the best means available to
the country and is likely to be so for the foresee
able future. In the meantime, ROTC provides im
portant advantages to the University and to its
students. The presence of ROTC provides our
students with the means of earning a commission
so that they may meet their military service obli
gations as officers. The ROTC programs provide
approximately $250,000 per year in student fin
ancial aid, bringing to the University a very able
student element including a number who other
wise might not be able to come to Stanford.
ROTC provides an opportunity to study in a
field that is certainly relevant to modern day
concerns and which would not otherwise be
available to the Stanford students.
Moreover, we have found the military services
to be not unmindful of trends in educational
thought and have undertaken serious steps to im
prove the quality and acceptability of ROTC pro
grams on college and university campuses. While
each service has varied in its approach to the sti
uation, they all have important elements in com
mon. Each has given its department chairmen
considerable flexibility to substitute courses in
other departments for military courses, to ar
range schedules to suit individual students, and
to negotiate with their institutions other aspects
of the ROTC programs. The Professor of Naval
Science is told, for example, that he "will func
tion as an academic department head in fact as
well as name . . . (and) is expected to structure a
program of studies for each Naval Science stu
dent that will satisfy the University's overall de
gree requirements."
In considering the manner in which ROTC
should be related to the academic structure of
the University, we took cognizance of these pres
ent and continuing efforts of the military services
to make ROTC more compatible with the desires
and procedures of the academic community.
What the minority members of the Committee
have recommended is fully compatible with the
trends in the services.
Since we hold that ROTC should continue at
Stanford University, we consider it essential that
it be integrated as closely as possible into the
regular academic structure. We believe that it
should be an academic program subject to nor
mal University controls and supervision. We con
sider this to be essential to the survival of ROTC
at Stanford.
We do not believe that ROTC could survive
with vitality and challenge, be useful to the ser
vices and worthy of the University's support, as a
non-credit "voluntary activity" program outside
the academic structure. We doubt that it would
be attractive to any significant number of high
quality students and we doubt that it would be
subject to adequate control by the University. As
we have said earlier in this paper, we reject this
proposal for we consider it tantamount to aboli
tion.

We have proposed a different solution, one
designed to bring an improved ROTC program
more into line with accepted standards of the
University. Separation from the academic struc
ture would, in our judgment, •ender ROTC inef
fective and unmanageable and eventually unac
ceptable to the military services. We take the
position that ROTC can and must be improved in
the interests of the nation, of Stanford Univer
sity and of Stanford students.

FINAL REPORT OF THE MINORITY
AD HOC SENATE COMMITTEE ON ROTC
FOREWORD
The undersigned members of the Senate ad
hoc Committee on ROTC submit the following
Minority Report with recommendations for the
improvement of ROTC at Stanford University.
This Minority Report is based upon the following
fundamental position.
For the foreseeable future, this nation will re
quire armed forces of considerable size, and will
require substantial numbers of well-educated and
well-trained officers to lead them. The ROTC
programs have been for many years the principal
means for providing such officers for the perman
ent forces or for reserve components. Participa
tion by such installations as Stanford University
in the ROTC programs, voluntary on the part of
the University and voluntary on the part of its
students, is therefore of considerable importance
to the nation. Moreover, maintenance of ROTC
programs on the campus provides a desirable op
portunity for those students who wish to earn a
military commission and thus meet their military
service obligations as commissioned officers.
In the proceedings of the Senate ad hoc Com
mittee on ROTC there has been no evidence pre
sented to show that ROTC programs are inimical
to the fundamental interests of Stanford Univer
sity or its students. On balance, it has been
shown that the availability of ROTC programs is
beneficial to the University, particularly in its
financial aid programs for students. If for these
reasons, the University concludes that it should
participate in ROTC, the University is obligated
to support ROTC in conditions that offer reason
able assurances of vitality and worth to its stu
dents, as well as to the military services.
It is the judgment of the minority members of
the Committee that ROTC cannot survive as an
extra-curricular activity separated from the aca
demic structure of the University. Indeed, we
consider that such separation is inconsistent with
a decision to continue ROTC at Stanford and
would be tantamount to abolition.
On the other hand, the minority members are
firmly convinced that a number of important im
provements should and can be made in ROTC to
meet the legitimate criticisms of its present form
and to place ROTC in an appropriate relationship
to the academic structure of the University.
The improvements we propose retain military
studies of worthy academic quality and proven
interest to substantial numbers of Stanford stu
dents as academic programs. Removal of these
studies from the curriculum would deprive Stan
ford students of existing opportunities for rele
vant academic inquiry without accompanying
benefit to any other constituency of the Univer
sity.
RECOMMENDA TIONS
The minority members of the Senate ad hoc
Committee on ROTC recommend:
1. That ROTC continue at Stanford Univer
sity;
2. That ROTC continue to be part of the aca
demic program of the University with specific
provision for a closer integration of ROTC into
its academic structure;
3. That ROTC programs be modified with re
spect to the organization and administration of
ROTC, the status of and appointment procedures
for its instructional staff, the curriculum, and the
contractual relationships between the military
services and the University and between the ser
vices and Stanford students.
4. That, to accomplish the above recommend
ations, the following program for ROTC be insti
tuted at Stanford.
AN IMPROVED ROTC PROGRAM FOR
STANFORD
The minority members reject the premise that
a substantive case for or against ROTC at Stan
ford has been established upon purely institu
tional considerations. Many subjective judgments
about the proper educational role of the Univer
sity are involved in such a premise. Many differ
ent opinions exist within the University about
what constitutes valid service to external con
cerns and interests. While it is possible to con
ceive that under certain circumstances the pres
ence of ROTC could be inimical to Stanford, we
do not find that presence, in actuality, to be a
threat to the integrity of the University. We do
find that over the years institutional relationships
for ROTC established by contract and law have
become archaic and in need of reform. Therefore
we have mainly responded to the charge of the
Senate of the Academic Council by proposing
reforms that will establish suitable relationships
for ROTC. We believe the program which we rec
ommend for ROTC at Stanford will, upon criti
cal evaluation, be found to amend those features
which the majority members considered most ob
jectionable in the present program.
Our position rests upon the belief that a point
by point comparison of the following program
and the objections raised to ROTC by the major
ity report will affirm that ROTC can be contin
ued at Stanford as a compatible and worthwhile
academic endeavor.

Departmental Structure
The Departments of Military Science, Naval
Science, and Aerospace Studies shall be com
bined into a Department of Military Studies. The
Chairmanship of this single department shall be
rotated among the heads of ROTC Units. A dis
tinction shall be made between the Department
of Military Studies and the ROTC Units. The De
partment of Military Studies shall be a part of
the academic structure of the University. The
ROTC Units shall be administrative agencies with
the function of serving students preparing for a
commission in the Armed Forces. The Units shall
administer scholarships and contracts, conduct
extra-curricular sessions, and advise students on
preparation for commissioning. The three units
of the Department of Military Studies shall re
ceive University administrative support as the
Provost may designate.
Rationale: The present arrangement of
three separate military science departments
results in an excessive administrative over
head and overrepresentation at councils of
departmental chairmen not warranted by
the size of these departments' instructional
staff or the variety of their course offer
ings. Different budgeting, personnel admin
istration, and reporting in the three mili
tary services, however, do require that each
ROTC Unit be administratively separate.
The ROTC Units will appropriately operate
at Stanford as administrative agencies of
the military services, and not as direct
sponsors for academic programs.
Organization of Military Studies Programs
A program of Military Science, of Naval Sci
ence, and of Aerospace Studies shall be offered
in the Stanford curriculum under the aegis of a
Military Studies Committee. The Committee
shall be appointed by the Senate and be com
posed of four Professors from the University at
large, the senior military officer from each ROTC
unit of the Department of Military Studies, and
four undergraduate students (two of whom will
be enrolled in ROTC and two from the univer
sity-at-large).
The Military Studies Committee shall deter
mine credit for courses offered by the Depart
ment of Military Studies, shall determine the cur
riculum for the Military Studies Programs, and
shall review the qualifications of military officers
recommended for appointment to instructional
positions. The military Studies Committee shall
be responsible to the Committee on Undergrad
uate Education. Proposed military science
courses which appropriately fall into the cate
gory of Undergraduate Specials shall be sub
mitted to the Committee on Undergraduate Edu
cation for approval. The Military Studies Pro
grams shall include these courses which are neces
sary to qualify students for a commission
through the ROTC programs, and are available
for students who wish to attain a background
knowledge of military art and science. The Pro
grams shall include accredited courses offered by
the Department of Military Studies, courses of
fered in other departments of the University, and
any approved military science Undergraduate
Specials.
Rationale: The determination of programs
of military study, review and of appoint
ments of military teachers and adjudication
of course credit by a Military Studies Com
mittee will fix responsibility for military
studies at the University in a manner more
consistent with institutional practices. The
military services, under this arrangement,
will assume more a role of an accrediting
body with respect to curriculum.
Other features of this proposal which seem
beneficial are: (1) the provision for contin
ual review and upgrading of military stud
ies programs, (2) the attractiveness to able
military officers, providing for appoint
ment of those officers who can make the
most substantial academic contributions to
the University, (3) the involvement of stu
dents and non-military faculty along with
military officers in determining the mili
tary studies to be undertaken, and (4) a
reduction of the sense of isolation of mili
tary teachers within the academic com
munity.
The extent of the nation's gross national
product that is allocated for defense and
the fact that warfare unhappily continues
adds relevancy to this field of academic
study. A fear that a militaristic view will
prevail is unfounded from the evidence this
committee has received, and in any event,
the military point of view can be leavened
by a standing committee which is plural
istic in perspective and reflects the values
of the University.
Academic Rank
The senior military officer of each unit of the
Department of Military Studies shall have the
rank and title of Professor of Military Science,
Naval Science, and Aerospace Studies, respec
tively, with the same perquisites which now per
tain to those positions.
All other military officers of the instructional
staff shall have the rank and title of Lecturer,
with the privileges and perquisites which now
pertain to that position.
In the event that officers who ordinarily
would be appointed Lecturer have unusual quali
fications, the Military Studies Committee may
recommend appointment as Assistant or Associ
ate Professor for the term of their anticipated
presence at Stanford.
Rationale: The rank of Professor for the
senior military officer appointed to each
ROTC unit is considered appropriate to his
experience, knowledge and responsibilities,
and is stipulated in present law.
This academic rank also attracts to ROTC
assignments better senior officers with
about twenty-four years of broad military
experience and education. Membership in
the Academic Council provides a means for
desirable involvement by the senior mili
tary officer in university affairs.
Since no direct correlation between mili
tary education and experience and regular
academic credentials exists it seems ap
propriate to make "Lecturer" the normal
appointment for more junior military of
ficers. This rank is consistent with that ac
corded well-qualified individuals from the
professions and the community who teach
courses at Stanford. However, when special
competence is available or found, a provis
ion for professorial appointment of these
officers is warranted.
Appointment Procedures
Those to be considered for appointment to
the rank of Professor shall go through the normal
review and appointment procedure, or as close to
that procedure as is possible. The following pro
cedure is proposed.
a. The Service concerned will submit a panel
of nominations, together with their creden
tials, to the President of the University.
The credentials will include:
(1) Personal resume.
(2) Educational record, including trans
cripts of academic work, service school
attendance, etc.
(3) Evidence of instructional and other
faculty-type experience.
b. The President will submit the nominations
to the Military Studies Committee for re

view and recommendation. It is intended
that the Committee for this purpose,
would function as a school or department
faculty "search committee." Regular Ad
visory Board recommendation forms will
be prepared as completely as possible.
c. The service concerned shall be prepared to
present at least the Committee's preferred
candidate for interview by the Committee
and the President (or his designated repre
sentative).
d. The Committee will then submit its recom
mended and preferred candidate to the
Provost for review at that level.
e. The Provost will submit the recommenda
tion to the Advisory Board for consider
ation. It is assumed that the Advisory
Board will review the cases in the light of
the special considerations in the same way
that it takes into account other appoint
ments in other professional fields.
112. Following Advisory Board action, the rec
ommendation will follow the usual course
to the Board of Trustees for final action.
For those to be considered for appointment as
Lecturers, the procedure shall be the same as for
professors, except that the recommendation need
not be submitted to the Advisory Board.
In the event that a junior officer is proposed
for an assistant or associate professor, the candi
date would be processed through the same chan
nel as are professors of military programs.
Rationale: The foregoing proposals provide
a procedure closely akin to the normal pro
cedure for faculty appointments. The ma
jor difference is of course the initial search
mechanism which is conducted through the
heads of ROTC units and their respective
military services. The minority members
considered the title of Visiting Professor
but rejected it on the basis that deviations
from the norm would be greater with this
title than under the procedures outlined.
Visiting professors are typically appointed
for one year, and have no administrative
responsibility. Senior military officer ap
pointments are usually for a period of
three years. Senior military officers are res
ponsible for direction of their programs as
well as representation to other elements of
the University.
Academic Credit
The courses of the Department of Military
Studies which are approved by the Military Stud
ies Committee shall be offered for degree credit.
Instruction desirable for potential military of
ficers but considered by the Military Studies
Committee to be of a narrow training scope shall
be conducted as extra-curricular sessions. Assum
ing that studies in military history and national
security affairs will, in the future, be available in
other departments, degree credit for courses of
fered by the Department of Military Studies shall
not exceed 18 quarter units or 12 semester units
or their equivalent in a four-year curriculum.
Rationale: The military science and studies
courses which meet University standards
should not be excluded arbitrarily from the
curriculum or credit. The evidence before
this committee has indicated that most of
the courses offered in the military sciences
are equivalent in quality to those of other
departments. A few, such as Naval Orienta
tion, have been generally acknowledged to
be of a narrow training nature and credit
will not be sought for these and similar
courses. The proposed limitation on total
degree credit is not the result of a bargain
ing process resulting in a compromise limit.
Eighteen quarter units or 12 semester units
over a four-year period represents our judg
ment on courses existing and planned for
the military studies cirricula which are
likely to be deemed worthy of academic
credit and at the same time meet the needs
of the services. Additionally it is believed
that this proposed limitation on academic
credit for military studies will insure ROTC
students the flexibility to undertake their
other academic responsibilities without in
curring an undue overload.
Wherever possible, courses offered by other
departments of the University should be
substituted for military-taught courses,
thus further reducing the amount of degree
credit and student overload.
Student Contracts
Individual contracts between students and the
military departments shall be changed to clearly
reflect actual practices. Specifically any ROTC
student—either those on financial assistance or
associated on another contractual basis—must be
assured in writing that he may disenroll from
ROTC within the first two years of a four-year
program without prejudice or obligation.
Rationale: The practice has always been to
disenroll any ROTC student without pre
judice for future military service and with
out obligation during his first two years. In
no case has a student not receiving finan
cial assistance been denied disenrollment
without obligation at any time over four
years. The real nature of the agreement be
tween students in ROTC and the services is
a compact which the student may break
without obligation assuming he is acting in
good faith.
Changes in individual contracts will require
negotiations with the military services.
Such negotiations should be undertaken
immediately.
It should be noted that students may enroll
or audit military science courses without
joining ROTC. Those who are not certain
of their interest or choice may use this
means of securing increased information on
which to base their decision about ROTC.
University Contracts
Contractual agreements between Stanford
University and the military services should be al
tered to reflect the provisions of this proposed
program.
Rationale: Contracts are subject to renego
tiation on a yearly basis and either party
may terminate on a year's notice. If altered
relationships are agreed upon, the changes
in contracts and agreements must follow
immediately.
Retroactive Application
Loss of academic credit by students enrolled
in ROTC or change in faculty status of military
officers already appointed to the Stanford fac
ulty shall not be incurred as a result of the pro
visions of this recommendation. All other
changes shall be implemented as expeditiously as
possible.
Trial Period
The proposed program shall be undertaken for
a five-year trial period upon mutual agreement
between the military services and Stanford Uni
versity. At the end of the five-year trial period
there shall be a searching review of the success of
the proposed program.
Rationale: A five-year trial period was se
lected to permit evaluation of two com
plete cycles of the four-year program with
particular regard to the evaluation of stu
dents completing the program.
CONCLUSION
The foregoing recommendations are based up
on a particular view of the University and of the
appropriate relations between the military ser

vices and this University. We believe Stanford to
be, among other things, a pluralistic community
serving a number of important and worthwhile
functions, including liberal arts and preprofes
sional undergraduate education as well as grad
uate training in the arts and sciences and in the
professional fields. No one college or university
can or should attempt to serve every possible in
terest in all of these areas, but we hold that
ROTC has a long and honorable history as part
of the Stanford scene and that it fits within the
framework of what Stanford does well.
In our consideration of the place of ROTC at
Stanford, we accepted the premise that, given the
evident state of the world and this nation's re

sity or its students. On balance, it has been
shown that the availability of ROTC programs is
beneficial to the University, particularly in its
financial aid programs for students. If for these
reasons, the University concludes that it should
participate in ROTC, the University is obligated
to support ROTC in conditions that offer reason
able assurances of vitality and worth to its stu
dents, as well as to the military services.
It is the judgment of the minority members of
the Committee that ROTC cannot survive as an
extra-curricular activity separated from the aca
demic structure of the University. Indeed, we
consider that such separation is inconsistent with
a decision to continue ROTC at Stanford and
would be tantamount to abolition.
On the other hand, the minority members are
firmly convinced that a number of important im
provements should and can be made in ROTC to
meet the legitimate criticisms of its present form
and to place ROTC in an appropriate relationship
to the academic structure of the University.
The improvements we propose retain military
studies of worthy academic quality and proven
interest to substantial numbers of Stanford stu
dents as academic programs. Removal of these
studies from the curriculum would deprive Stan
ford students of existing opportunities for rele
vant academic inquiry without accompanying
benefit to any other constituency of the Univer
sity.
RECOMMENDA TIONS
The minority members of the Senate ad hoc
Committee on ROTC recommend:
1. That ROTC continue at Stanford Univer
sity;
2. That ROTC continue to be part of the aca
demic program of the University with specific
provision for a closer integration of ROTC into
its academic structure;
3. That ROTC programs be modified with re
spect to the organization and administration of
ROTC, the status of and appointment procedures
for its instructional staff, the curriculum, and the
contractual relationships between the military
services and the University and between the ser
vices and Stanford students.
4. That, to accomplish the above recommend
ations, the following program for ROTC be insti
tuted at Stanford.
AN IMPROVED ROTC PROGRAM FOR
STANFORD
The minority members reject the premise that
a substantive case for or against ROTC at Stan
ford has been established upon purely institu
tional considerations. Many subjective judgments
about the proper educational role of the Univer
sity are involved in such a premise. Many differ
ent opinions exist within the University about
what constitutes valid service to external con
cerns and interests. While it is possible to con
ceive that under certain circumstances the pres
ence of ROTC could be inimical to Stanford, we
do not find that presence, in actuality, to be a
threat to the integrity of the University. We do
find that over the years institutional relationships
for ROTC established by contract and law have
become archaic and in need of reform. Therefore
we have mainly responded to the charge of the
Senate of the Academic Council by proposing
reforms that will establish suitable relationships
for ROTC. We believe the program which we rec
ommend for ROTC at Stanford will, upon criti
cal evaluation, be found to amend those features
which the majority members considered most ob
jectionable in the present program.
Our position rests upon the belief that a point
by point comparison of the following program
and the objections raised to ROTC by the major
ity report will affirm that ROTC can be contin
ued at Stanford as a compatible and worthwhile
academic endeavor.

Departmental Structure
The Departments of Military Science, Naval
Science, and Aerospace Studies shall be com
bined into a Department of Military Studies. The
Chairmanship of this single department shall be
rotated among the heads of ROTC Units. A dis
tinction shall be made between the Department
of Military Studies and the ROTC Units. The De
partment of Military Studies shall be a part of
the academic structure of the University. The
ROTC Units shall be administrative agencies with
the function of serving students preparing for a
commission in the Armed Forces. The Units shall
administer scholarships and contracts, conduct
extra-curricular sessions, and advise students on
preparation for commissioning. The three units
of the Department of Military Studies shall re
ceive University administrative support as the
Provost may designate.
Rationale: The present arrangement of
three separate military science departments
results in an excessive administrative over
head and overrepresentation at councils of
departmental chairmen not warranted by
the size of these departments' instructional
staff or the variety of their course offer
ings. Different budgeting, personnel admin
istration, and reporting in the three mili
tary services, however, do require that each
ROTC Unit be administratively separate.
The ROTC Units will appropriately operate
at Stanford as administrative agencies of
the military services, and not as direct
sponsors for academic programs.
Organization of Military Studies Programs
A program of Military Science, of Naval Sci
ence, and of Aerospace Studies shall be offered
in the Stanford curriculum under the aegis of a
Military Studies Committee. The Committee
shall be appointed by the Senate and be com
posed of four Professors from the University at
large, the senior military officer from each ROTC
unit of the Department of Military Studies, and
four undergraduate students (two of whom will
be enrolled in ROTC and two from the univer
sity-at-large).
The Military Studies Committee shall deter
mine credit for courses offered by the Depart
ment of Military Studies, shall determine the cur
riculum for the Military Studies Programs, and
shall review the qualifications of military officers
recommended for appointment to instructional
positions. The military Studies Committee shall
be responsible to the Committee on Undergrad
uate Education. Proposed military science
courses which appropriately fall into the cate
gory of Undergraduate Specials shall be sub
mitted to the Committee on Undergraduate Edu
cation for approval. The Military Studies Pro
grams shall include these courses which are neces
sary to qualify students for a commission
through the ROTC programs, and are available
for students who wish to attain a background
knowledge of military art and science. The Pro
grams shall include accredited courses offered by
the Department of Military Studies, courses of
fered in other departments of the University, and
any approved military science Undergraduate
Specials.
Rationale: The determination of programs
of military study, review and of appoint
ments of military teachers and adjudication
of course credit by a Military Studies Com
mittee will fix responsibility for military
studies at the University in a manner more
consistent with institutional practices. The
military services, under this arrangement,
will assume more a role of an accrediting
body with respect to curriculum.
Other features of this proposal which seem
beneficial are: (1) the provision for contin
ual review and upgrading of military stud
ies programs, (2) the attractiveness to able
military officers, providing for appoint
ment of those officers who can make the
most substantial academic contributions to
the University, (3) the involvement of stu
dents and non-military faculty along with
military officers in determining the mili
tary studies to be undertaken, and (4) a
reduction of the sense of isolation of mili
tary teachers within the academic com
munity.
The extent of the nation's gross national
product that is allocated for defense and
the fact that warfare unhappily continues
adds relevancy to this field of academic
study. A fear that a militaristic view will
prevail is unfounded from the evidence this
committee has received, and in any event,
the military point of view can be leavened
by a standing committee which is plural
istic in perspective and reflects the values
of the University.
Academic Rank
The senior military officer of each unit of the
Department of Military Studies shall have the
rank and title of Professor of Military Science,
Naval Science, and Aerospace Studies, respec
tively, with the same perquisites which now per
tain to those positions.
All other military officers of the instructional
staff shall have the rank and title of Lecturer,
with the privileges and perquisites which now
pertain to that position.
In the event that officers who ordinarily
would be appointed Lecturer have unusual quali
fications, the Military Studies Committee may
recommend appointment as Assistant or Associ
ate Professor for the term of their anticipated
presence at Stanford.
Rationale: The rank of Professor for the
senior military officer appointed to each
ROTC unit is considered appropriate to his
experience, knowledge and responsibilities,
and is stipulated in present law.
This academic rank also attracts to ROTC
assignments better senior officers with
about twenty-four years of broad military
experience and education. Membership in
the Academic Council provides a means for
desirable involvement by the senior mili
tary officer in university affairs.
Since no direct correlation between mili
tary education and experience and regular
academic credentials exists it seems ap
propriate to make "Lecturer" the normal
appointment for more junior military of
ficers. This rank is consistent with that ac
corded well-qualified individuals from the
professions and the community who teach
courses at Stanford. However, when special
competence is available or found, a provis
ion for professorial appointment of these
officers is warranted.
Appointment Procedures
Those to be considered for appointment to
the rank of Professor shall go through the normal
review and appointment procedure, or as close to
that procedure as is possible. The following pro
cedure is proposed.
a. The Service concerned will submit a panel
of nominations, together with their creden
tials, to the President of the University.
The credentials will include:
(1) Personal resume.
(2) Educational record, including trans
cripts of academic work, service school
attendance, etc.
(3) Evidence of instructional and other
faculty-type experience.
b. The President will submit the nominations
to the Military Studies Committee for re

view and recommendation. It is intended
that the Committee for this purpose,
would function as a school or department
faculty "search committee." Regular Ad
visory Board recommendation forms will
be prepared as completely as possible.
c. The service concerned shall be prepared to
present at least the Committee's preferred
candidate for interview by the Committee
and the President (or his designated repre
sentative).
d. The Committee will then submit its recom
mended and preferred candidate to the
Provost for review at that level.
e. The Provost will submit the recommenda
tion to the Advisory Board for consider
ation. It is assumed that the Advisory
Board will review the cases in the light of
the special considerations in the same way
that it takes into account other appoint
ments in other professional fields.
112. Following Advisory Board action, the rec
ommendation will follow the usual course
to the Board of Trustees for final action.
For those to be considered for appointment as
Lecturers, the procedure shall be the same as for
professors, except that the recommendation need
not be submitted to the Advisory Board.
In the event that a junior officer is proposed
for an assistant or associate professor, the candi
date would be processed through the same chan
nel as are professors of military programs.
Rationale: The foregoing proposals provide
a procedure closely akin to the normal pro
cedure for faculty appointments. The ma
jor difference is of course the initial search
mechanism which is conducted through the
heads of ROTC units and their respective
military services. The minority members
considered the title of Visiting Professor
but rejected it on the basis that deviations
from the norm would be greater with this
title than under the procedures outlined.
Visiting professors are typically appointed
for one year, and have no administrative
responsibility. Senior military officer ap
pointments are usually for a period of
three years. Senior military officers are res
ponsible for direction of their programs as
well as representation to other elements of
the University.
Academic Credit
The courses of the Department of Military
Studies which are approved by the Military Stud
ies Committee shall be offered for degree credit.
Instruction desirable for potential military of
ficers but considered by the Military Studies
Committee to be of a narrow training scope shall
be conducted as extra-curricular sessions. Assum
ing that studies in military history and national
security affairs will, in the future, be available in
other departments, degree credit for courses of
fered by the Department of Military Studies shall
not exceed 18 quarter units or 12 semester units
or their equivalent in a four-year curriculum.
Rationale: The military science and studies
courses which meet University standards
should not be excluded arbitrarily from the
curriculum or credit. The evidence before
this committee has indicated that most of
the courses offered in the military sciences
are equivalent in quality to those of other
departments. A few, such as Naval Orienta
tion, have been generally acknowledged to
be of a narrow training nature and credit
will not be sought for these and similar
courses. The proposed limitation on total
degree credit is not the result of a bargain
ing process resulting in a compromise limit.
Eighteen quarter units or 12 semester units
over a four-year period represents our judg
ment on courses existing and planned for
the military studies cirricula which are
likely to be deemed worthy of academic
credit and at the same time meet the needs
of the services. Additionally it is believed
that this proposed limitation on academic
credit for military studies will insure ROTC
students the flexibility to undertake their
other academic responsibilities without in
curring an undue overload.
Wherever possible, courses offered by other
departments of the University should be
substituted for military-taught courses,
thus further reducing the amount of degree
credit and student overload.
Student Contracts
Individual contracts between students and the
military departments shall be changed to clearly
reflect actual practices. Specifically any ROTC
student—either those on financial assistance or
associated on another contractual basis—must be
assured in writing that he may disenroll from
ROTC within the first two years of a four-year
program without prejudice or obligation.
Rationale: The practice has always been to
disenroll any ROTC student without pre
judice for future military service and with
out obligation during his first two years. In
no case has a student not receiving finan
cial assistance been denied disenrollment
without obligation at any time over four
years. The real nature of the agreement be
tween students in ROTC and the services is
a compact which the student may break
without obligation assuming he is acting in
good faith.
Changes in individual contracts will require
negotiations with the military services.
Such negotiations should be undertaken
immediately.
It should be noted that students may enroll
or audit military science courses without
joining ROTC. Those who are not certain
of their interest or choice may use this
means of securing increased information on
which to base their decision about ROTC.
University Contracts
Contractual agreements between Stanford
University and the military services should be al
tered to reflect the provisions of this proposed
program.
Rationale: Contracts are subject to renego
tiation on a yearly basis and either party
may terminate on a year's notice. If altered
relationships are agreed upon, the changes
in contracts and agreements must follow
immediately.
Retroactive Application
Loss of academic credit by students enrolled
in ROTC or change in faculty status of military
officers already appointed to the Stanford fac
ulty shall not be incurred as a result of the pro
visions of this recommendation. All other
changes shall be implemented as expeditiously as
possible.
Trial Period
The proposed program shall be undertaken for
a five-year trial period upon mutual agreement
between the military services and Stanford Uni
versity. At the end of the five-year trial period
there shall be a searching review of the success of
the proposed program.
Rationale: A five-year trial period was se
lected to permit evaluation of two com
plete cycles of the four-year program with
particular regard to the evaluation of stu
dents completing the program.
CONCLUSION
The foregoing recommendations are based up
on a particular view of the University and of the
appropriate relations between the military ser

vices and this University. We believe Stanford to
be, among other things, a pluralistic community
serving a number of important and worthwhile
functions, including liberal arts and preprofes
sional undergraduate education as well as grad
uate training in the arts and sciences and in the
professional fields. No one college or university
can or should attempt to serve every possible in
terest in all of these areas, but we hold that
ROTC has a long and honorable history as part
of the Stanford scene and that it fits within the
framework of what Stanford does well.
In our consideration of the place of ROTC at
Stanford, we accepted the premise that, given the
evident state of the world and this nation's re
sponsibilities in it, there will be for some time to
come a substantial need for military forces of
considerable size. Such a force will require the
very best leadership at all levels that the country
can provide. ROTC is a major source of that
leadership and will continue to be so for the fore
seeable future. The service academies and other
means of officer training, as presently consti
tuted, cannot possibly supply the need of over
30,000 new officers each year. The colleges and
universities are reasonable sources of young of
ficers, and ROTC has been for many years the
means of the cooperative effort between the mili
tary services and universities to provide these of
ficers.
We accept the view that the University has a
responsibility to serve the nation and society, for
the University benefits directly from its privi
leged place in that society. No single institution
can render every service, and each must, of its
own free choice, select those areas in which it
can serve effectively. The University cannot be
isolated from the pressing problems of our
society, nor should it be. One important set of
problems facing the country is that of foreign
and military policy. This has been so since the
establishment of the United States and it can be
assumed that it will continue to be so for some
time to come. Stanford and many other colleges
and universities have, over the years, cooperated
with the Federal Government and the military
services in the training of young officers; this is
one of the relevant major problem areas in which
this University has served.
We believe that much of the current anxiety
about and opposition to ROTC is rooted in the
profound disagreements with the conduct of our
policy in Southeast Asia and our involvement in
the Vietnam War. We urge, however, that ROTC
be judged in the context of the nation's history
and in the context of a reasonable estimate of
the future. The termination of the present war
will not end the need for adequate national se
curity forces and for the need to provide the
leadership for them. We believe that the nation's
colleges and universities, including Stanford Uni
versity, should participate in training the leader
ship for these security forces.
There is no doubt that accommodation of
ROTC on a university campus requires arrange
ments at variance with accepted and standard
academic policy and practice. As we have shown,
we do not argue for the status quo with respect
to the way in which ROTC is organized and ad
ministered and in the way in which it relates to
the academic structure of the University.
The presence of ROTC as an academic pro
gram offends some members of the faculty and
of the student body who hold that there should
be no pre-professional educational programs, at
least at the undergraduate level. Some faculty
members and students are concerned with the
presence of a program that has certain marked
external controls in contrast to the more typical
internally-regulated activities. Some conclude
that instruction by the military is inevitably anti
thetical to free intellectual inquiry. But in our
investigations and inquiries, we have found that
there are several other pre-professional academic
programs with an accepted place in the Stanford
scene. We have found that there are other activi
ties subject to various forms and degrees of exter
nal constraint. We have found no evidence that
military instruction inhibits the development of
the freely inquiring minds of those enrolled in
ROTC; indeed there is no evidence that the pres
ent system, with its admitted variations from
standard academic practice, is the least harmful
to the academic community or to anyone in it.
We do not hold that ROTC is essential to
Stanford University nor do we hold that Stan
ford University is essential to the military ser
vices. We do not claim that in the long run ROTC
is necessarily the ultimate means of preparing
college-educated officers for military service. But
for the present, it is the best means available to
the country and is likely to be so for the foresee
able future. In the meantime, ROTC provides im
portant advantages to the University and to its
students. The presence of ROTC provides our
students with the means of earning a commission
so that they may meet their military service obli
gations as officers. The ROTC programs provide
approximately $250,000 per year in student fin
ancial aid, bringing to the University a very able
student element including a number who other
wise might not be able to come to Stanford.
ROTC provides an opportunity to study in a
field that is certainly relevant to modern day
concerns and which would not otherwise be
available to the Stanford students.
Moreover, we have found the military services
to be not unmindful of trends in educational
thought and have undertaken serious steps to im
prove the quality and acceptability of ROTC pro
grams on college and university campuses. While
each service has varied in its approach to the sti
uation, they all have important elements in com
mon. Each has given its department chairmen
considerable flexibility to substitute courses in
other departments for military courses, to ar
range schedules to suit individual students, and
to negotiate with their institutions other aspects
of the ROTC programs. The Professor of Naval
Science is told, for example, that he "will func
tion as an academic department head in fact as
well as name . . . (and) is expected to structure a
program of studies for each Naval Science stu
dent that will satisfy the University's overall de
gree requirements."
In considering the manner in which ROTC
should be related to the academic structure of
the University, we took cognizance of these pres
ent and continuing efforts of the military services
to make ROTC more compatible with the desires
and procedures of the academic community.
What the minority members of the Committee
have recommended is fully compatible with the
trends in the services.
Since we hold that ROTC should continue at
Stanford University, we consider it essential that
it be integrated as closely as possible into the
regular academic structure. We believe that it
should be an academic program subject to nor
mal University controls and supervision. We con
sider this to be essential to the survival of ROTC
at Stanford.
We do not believe that ROTC could survive
with vitality and challenge, be useful to the ser
vices and worthy of the University's support, as a
non-credit "voluntary activity" program outside
the academic structure. We doubt that it would
be attractive to any significant number of high
quality students and we doubt that it would be
subject to adequate control by the University. As
we have said earlier in this paper, we reject this
proposal for we consider it tantamount to aboli
tion.

We have proposed a different solution, one
designed to bring an improved ROTC program
more into line with accepted standards of the
University. Separation from the academic struc
ture would, in our judgment, •ender ROTC inef
fective and unmanageable and eventually unac
ceptable to the military services. We take the
position that ROTC can and must be improved in
the interests of the nation, of Stanford Univer
sity and of Stanford students.

FINAL REPORT OF THE MINORITY
AD HOC SENATE COMMITTEE ON ROTC
FOREWORD
The undersigned members of the Senate ad
hoc Committee on ROTC submit the following
Minority Report with recommendations for the
improvement of ROTC at Stanford University.
This Minority Report is based upon the following
fundamental position.
For the foreseeable future, this nation will re
quire armed forces of considerable size, and will
require substantial numbers of well-educated and
well-trained officers to lead them. The ROTC
programs have been for many years the principal
means for providing such officers for the perman
ent forces or for reserve components. Participa
tion by such installations as Stanford University
in the ROTC programs, voluntary on the part of
the University and voluntary on the part of its
students, is therefore of considerable importance
to the nation. Moreover, maintenance of ROTC
programs on the campus provides a desirable op
portunity for those students who wish to earn a
military commission and thus meet their military
service obligations as commissioned officers.
In the proceedings of the Senate ad hoc Com
mittee on ROTC there has been no evidence pre
sented to show that ROTC programs are inimical
to the fundamental interests of Stanford Univer
sity or its students. On balance, it has been
shown that the availability of ROTC programs is
beneficial to the University, particularly in its
financial aid programs for students. If for these
reasons, the University concludes that it should
participate in ROTC, the University is obligated
to support ROTC in conditions that offer reason
able assurances of vitality and worth to its stu
dents, as well as to the military services.
It is the judgment of the minority members of
the Committee that ROTC cannot survive as an
extra-curricular activity separated from the aca
demic structure of the University. Indeed, we
consider that such separation is inconsistent with
a decision to continue ROTC at Stanford and
would be tantamount to abolition.
On the other hand, the minority members are
firmly convinced that a number of important im
provements should and can be made in ROTC to
meet the legitimate criticisms of its present form
and to place ROTC in an appropriate relationship
to the academic structure of the University.
The improvements we propose retain military
studies of worthy academic quality and proven
interest to substantial numbers of Stanford stu
dents as academic programs. Removal of these
studies from the curriculum would deprive Stan
ford students of existing opportunities for rele
vant academic inquiry without accompanying
benefit to any other constituency of the Univer
sity.
RECOMMENDA TIONS
The minority members of the Senate ad hoc
Committee on ROTC recommend:
1. That ROTC continue at Stanford Univer
sity;
2. That ROTC continue to be part of the aca
demic program of the University with specific
provision for a closer integration of ROTC into
its academic structure;
3. That ROTC programs be modified with re
spect to the organization and administration of
ROTC, the status of and appointment procedures
for its instructional staff, the curriculum, and the
contractual relationships between the military
services and the University and between the ser
vices and Stanford students.
4. That, to accomplish the above recommend
ations, the following program for ROTC be insti
tuted at Stanford.
AN IMPROVED ROTC PROGRAM FOR
STANFORD
The minority members reject the premise that
a substantive case for or against ROTC at Stan
ford has been established upon purely institu
tional considerations. Many subjective judgments
about the proper educational role of the Univer
sity are involved in such a premise. Many differ

what constitutes valid service to external con

propriate to make "Lecturer" the normal
appointment for more junior military of
ficers. This rank is consistent with that ac
corded well-qualified individuals from the
professions and the community who teach
courses at Stanford. However, when special
competence is available or found, a provis
ion for professorial appointment of these
officers is warranted.
Appointment Procedures
Those to be considered for appointment to
the rank of Professor shall go through the normal
review and appointment procedure, or as close to
that procedure as is possible. The following pro
cedure is proposed.
a. The Service concerned will submit a panel
of nominations, together with their creden
tials, to the President of the University.
The credentials will include:
(1) Personal resume.
(2) Educational record, including trans
cripts of academic work, service school
attendance, etc.
(3) Evidence of instructional and other
faculty-type experience.
b. The President will submit the nominations
to the Military Studies Committee for re

view and recommendation. It is intended
that the Committee for this purpose,
would function as a school or department
faculty "search committee." Regular Ad
visory Board recommendation forms will
be prepared as completely as possible.
c. The service concerned shall be prepared to
present at least the Committee's preferred
candidate for interview by the Committee
and the President (or his designated repre
sentative).
d. The Committee will then submit its recom
mended and preferred candidate to the
Provost for review at that level.
e. The Provost will submit the recommenda
tion to the Advisory Board for consider
ation. It is assumed that the Advisory
Board will review the cases in the light of
the special considerations in the same way
that it takes into account other appoint
ments in other professional fields.
112. Following Advisory Board action, the rec
ommendation will follow the usual course
to the Board of Trustees for final action.
For those to be considered for appointment as
Lecturers, the procedure shall be the same as for
professors, except that the recommendation need
not be submitted to the Advisory Board.
In the event that a junior officer is proposed
for an assistant or associate professor, the candi
date would be processed through the same chan
nel as are professors of military programs.
Rationale: The foregoing proposals provide
a procedure closely akin to the normal pro
cedure for faculty appointments. The ma
jor difference is of course the initial search
mechanism which is conducted through the
heads of ROTC units and their respective
military services. The minority members
considered the title of Visiting Professor
but rejected it on the basis that deviations
from the norm would be greater with this
title than under the procedures outlined.
Visiting professors are typically appointed
for one year, and have no administrative
responsibility. Senior military officer ap
pointments are usually for a period of
three years. Senior military officers are res
ponsible for direction of their programs as
well as representation to other elements of
the University.
Academic Credit
The courses of the Department of Military
Studies which are approved by the Military Stud
ies Committee shall be offered for degree credit.
Instruction desirable for potential military of
ficers but considered by the Military Studies
Committee to be of a narrow training scope shall
be conducted as extra-curricular sessions. Assum
ing that studies in military history and national
security affairs will, in the future, be available in
other departments, degree credit for courses of
fered by the Department of Military Studies shall
not exceed 18 quarter units or 12 semester units
or their equivalent in a four-year curriculum.
Rationale: The military science and studies
courses which meet University standards
should not be excluded arbitrarily from the
curriculum or credit. The evidence before
this committee has indicated that most of
the courses offered in the military sciences
are equivalent in quality to those of other
departments. A few, such as Naval Orienta
tion, have been generally acknowledged to
be of a narrow training nature and credit
will not be sought for these and similar
courses. The proposed limitation on total
degree credit is not the result of a bargain
ing process resulting in a compromise limit.
Eighteen quarter units or 12 semester units
over a four-year period represents our judg
ment on courses existing and planned for
the military studies cirricula which are
likely to be deemed worthy of academic
credit and at the same time meet the needs
of the services. Additionally it is believed
that this proposed limitation on academic
credit for military studies will insure ROTC
students the flexibility to undertake their
other academic responsibilities without in
curring an undue overload.
Wherever possible, courses offered by other
departments of the University should be
substituted for military-taught courses,
thus further reducing the amount of degree
credit and student overload.
Student Contracts
Individual contracts between students and the
military departments shall be changed to clearly
reflect actual practices. Specifically any ROTC
student—either those on financial assistance or
associated on another contractual basis—must be
assured in writing that he may disenroll from
ROTC within the first two years of a four-year
program without prejudice or obligation.
Rationale: The practice has always been to
disenroll any ROTC student without pre
judice for future military service and with
out obligation during his first two years. In
no case has a student not receiving finan
cial assistance been denied disenrollment
without obligation at any time over four
years. The real nature of the agreement be
tween students in ROTC and the services is
a compact which the student may break
without obligation assuming he is acting in
good faith.
Changes in individual contracts will require
negotiations with the military services.
Such negotiations should be undertaken
immediately.
It should be noted that students may enroll
or audit military science courses without
joining ROTC. Those who are not certain
of their interest or choice may use this
means of securing increased information on
which to base their decision about ROTC.
University Contracts
Contractual agreements between Stanford
University and the military services should be al
tered to reflect the provisions of this proposed
program.
Rationale: Contracts are subject to renego
tiation on a yearly basis and either party
may terminate on a year's notice. If altered
relationships are agreed upon, the changes
in contracts and agreements must follow
immediately.
Retroactive Application
Loss of academic credit by students enrolled
in ROTC or change in faculty status of military
officers already appointed to the Stanford fac
ulty shall not be incurred as a result of the pro
visions of this recommendation. All other
changes shall be implemented as expeditiously as
possible.
Trial Period
The proposed program shall be undertaken for
a five-year trial period upon mutual agreement
between the military services and Stanford Uni
versity. At the end of the five-year trial period
there shall be a searching review of the success of
the proposed program.
Rationale: A five-year trial period was se
lected to permit evaluation of two com
plete cycles of the four-year program with
particular regard to the evaluation of stu
dents completing the program.
CONCLUSION
The foregoing recommendations are based up
on a particular view of the University and of the
appropriate relations between the military ser

vices and this University. We believe Stanford to
be, among other things, a pluralistic community
serving a number of important and worthwhile
functions, including liberal arts and preprofes
sional undergraduate education as well as grad
uate training in the arts and sciences and in the
professional fields. No one college or university
can or should attempt to serve every possible in
terest in all of these areas, but we hold that
ROTC has a long and honorable history as part
of the Stanford scene and that it fits within the
framework of what Stanford does well.
In our consideration of the place of ROTC at
Stanford, we accepted the premise that, given the
evident state of the world and this nation's re
sponsibilities in it, there will be for some time to
come a substantial need for military forces of
considerable size. Such a force will require the
very best leadership at all levels that the country
can provide. ROTC is a major source of that
leadership and will continue to be so for the fore
seeable future. The service academies and other
means of officer training, as presently consti
tuted, cannot possibly supply the need of over
30,000 new officers each year. The colleges and
universities are reasonable sources of young of
ficers, and ROTC has been for many years the
means of the cooperative effort between the mili
tary services and universities to provide these of
ficers.
We accept the view that the University has a
responsibility to serve the nation and society, for
the University benefits directly from its privi
leged place in that society. No single institution
can render every service, and each must, of its
own free choice, select those areas in which it
can serve effectively. The University cannot be
isolated from the pressing problems of our
society, nor should it be. One important set of
problems facing the country is that of foreign
and military policy. This has been so since the
establishment of the United States and it can be
assumed that it will continue to be so for some
time to come. Stanford and many other colleges
and universities have, over the years, cooperated
with the Federal Government and the military
services in the training of young officers; this is
one of the relevant major problem areas in which
this University has served.
We believe that much of the current anxiety
about and opposition to ROTC is rooted in the
profound disagreements with the conduct of our
policy in Southeast Asia and our involvement in
the Vietnam War. We urge, however, that ROTC
be judged in the context of the nation's history
and in the context of a reasonable estimate of
the future. The termination of the present war
will not end the need for adequate national se
curity forces and for the need to provide the
leadership for them. We believe that the nation's
colleges and universities, including Stanford Uni
versity, should participate in training the leader
ship for these security forces.
There is no doubt that accommodation of
ROTC on a university campus requires arrange
ments at variance with accepted and standard
academic policy and practice. As we have shown,
we do not argue for the status quo with respect
to the way in which ROTC is organized and ad
ministered and in the way in which it relates to
the academic structure of the University.
The presence of ROTC as an academic pro
gram offends some members of the faculty and
of the student body who hold that there should
be no pre-professional educational programs, at
least at the undergraduate level. Some faculty
members and students are concerned with the
presence of a program that has certain marked
external controls in contrast to the more typical
internally-regulated activities. Some conclude
that instruction by the military is inevitably anti
thetical to free intellectual inquiry. But in our
investigations and inquiries, we have found that
there are several other pre-professional academic
programs with an accepted place in the Stanford
scene. We have found that there are other activi
ties subject to various forms and degrees of exter
nal constraint. We have found no evidence that
military instruction inhibits the development of
the freely inquiring minds of those enrolled in
ROTC; indeed there is no evidence that the pres
ent system, with its admitted variations from
standard academic practice, is the least harmful
to the academic community or to anyone in it.
We do not hold that ROTC is essential to
Stanford University nor do we hold that Stan
ford University is essential to the military ser
vices. We do not claim that in the long run ROTC
is necessarily the ultimate means of preparing
college-educated officers for military service. But
for the present, it is the best means available to
the country and is likely to be so for the foresee
able future. In the meantime, ROTC provides im
portant advantages to the University and to its
students. The presence of ROTC provides our
students with the means of earning a commission
so that they may meet their military service obli
gations as officers. The ROTC programs provide
approximately $250,000 per year in student fin
ancial aid, bringing to the University a very able
student element including a number who other
wise might not be able to come to Stanford.
ROTC provides an opportunity to study in a
field that is certainly relevant to modern day
concerns and which would not otherwise be
available to the Stanford students.
Moreover, we have found the military services
to be not unmindful of trends in educational
thought and have undertaken serious steps to im
prove the quality and acceptability of ROTC pro
grams on college and university campuses. While
each service has varied in its approach to the sti
uation, they all have important elements in com
mon. Each has given its department chairmen
considerable flexibility to substitute courses in
other departments for military courses, to ar
range schedules to suit individual students, and
to negotiate with their institutions other aspects
of the ROTC programs. The Professor of Naval
Science is told, for example, that he "will func
tion as an academic department head in fact as
well as name . . . (and) is expected to structure a
program of studies for each Naval Science stu
dent that will satisfy the University's overall de
gree requirements."
In considering the manner in which ROTC
should be related to the academic structure of
the University, we took cognizance of these pres
ent and continuing efforts of the military services
to make ROTC more compatible with the desires
and procedures of the academic community.
What the minority members of the Committee
have recommended is fully compatible with the
trends in the services.
Since we hold that ROTC should continue at
Stanford University, we consider it essential that
it be integrated as closely as possible into the
regular academic structure. We believe that it
should be an academic program subject to nor
mal University controls and supervision. We con
sider this to be essential to the survival of ROTC
at Stanford.
We do not believe that ROTC could survive
with vitality and challenge, be useful to the ser
vices and worthy of the University's support, as a
non-credit "voluntary activity" program outside
the academic structure. We doubt that it would
be attractive to any significant number of high
quality students and we doubt that it would be
subject to adequate control by the University. As
we have said earlier in this paper, we reject this
proposal for we consider it tantamount to aboli
tion.

We have proposed a different solution, one
designed to bring an improved ROTC program
more into line with accepted standards of the
University. Separation from the academic struc
ture would, in our judgment, •ender ROTC inef
fective and unmanageable and eventually unac
ceptable to the military services. We take the
position that ROTC can and must be improved in
the interests of the nation, of Stanford Univer
sity and of Stanford students.

FINAL REPORT OF THE MINORITY
AD HOC SENATE COMMITTEE ON ROTC
FOREWORD
The undersigned members of the Senate ad
hoc Committee on ROTC submit the following
Minority Report with recommendations for the
improvement of ROTC at Stanford University.
This Minority Report is based upon the following
fundamental position.
For the foreseeable future, this nation will re
quire armed forces of considerable size, and will
require substantial numbers of well-educated and
well-trained officers to lead them. The ROTC
programs have been for many years the principal
means for providing such officers for the perman
ent forces or for reserve components. Participa
tion by such installations as Stanford University
in the ROTC programs, voluntary on the part of
the University and voluntary on the part of its
students, is therefore of considerable importance
to the nation. Moreover, maintenance of ROTC
programs on the campus provides a desirable op
portunity for those students who wish to earn a
military commission and thus meet their military
service obligations as commissioned officers.
In the proceedings of the Senate ad hoc Com
mittee on ROTC there has been no evidence pre
sented to show that ROTC programs are inimical
to the fundamental interests of Stanford Univer
sity or its students. On balance, it has been
shown that the availability of ROTC programs is
beneficial to the University, particularly in its
financial aid programs for students. If for these
reasons, the University concludes that it should
participate in ROTC, the University is obligated
to support ROTC in conditions that offer reason
able assurances of vitality and worth to its stu
dents, as well as to the military services.
It is the judgment of the minority members of
the Committee that ROTC cannot survive as an
extra-curricular activity separated from the aca
demic structure of the University. Indeed, we
consider that such separation is inconsistent with
a decision to continue ROTC at Stanford and
would be tantamount to abolition.
On the other hand, the minority members are
firmly convinced that a number of important im
provements should and can be made in ROTC to
meet the legitimate criticisms of its present form
and to place ROTC in an appropriate relationship
to the academic structure of the University.
The improvements we propose retain military
studies of worthy academic quality and proven
interest to substantial numbers of Stanford stu
dents as academic programs. Removal of these
studies from the curriculum would deprive Stan
ford students of existing opportunities for rele
vant academic inquiry without accompanying
benefit to any other constituency of the Univer
sity.
RECOMMENDA TIONS
The minority members of the Senate ad hoc
Committee on ROTC recommend:
1. That ROTC continue at Stanford Univer
sity;
2. That ROTC continue to be part of the aca
demic program of the University with specific
provision for a closer integration of ROTC into
its academic structure;
3. That ROTC programs be modified with re
spect to the organization and administration of
ROTC, the status of and appointment procedures
for its instructional staff, the curriculum, and the
contractual relationships between the military
services and the University and between the ser
vices and Stanford students.
4. That, to accomplish the above recommend
ations, the following program for ROTC be insti
tuted at Stanford.
AN IMPROVED ROTC PROGRAM FOR
STANFORD
The minority members reject the premise that
a substantive case for or against ROTC at Stan
ford has been established upon purely institu
tional considerations. Many subjective judgments
about the proper educational role of the Univer
sity are involved in such a premise. Many differ
ent opinions exist within the University about
what constitutes valid service to external con
cerns and interests. While it is possible to con
ceive that under certain circumstances the pres
ence of ROTC could be inimical to Stanford, we
do not find that presence, in actuality, to be a
threat to the integrity of the University. We do
find that over the years institutional relationships
for ROTC established by contract and law have
become archaic and in need of reform. Therefore
we have mainly responded to the charge of the
Senate of the Academic Council by proposing
reforms that will establish suitable relationships
for ROTC. We believe the program which we rec
ommend for ROTC at Stanford will, upon criti
cal evaluation, be found to amend those features
which the majority members considered most ob
jectionable in the present program.
Our position rests upon the belief that a point
by point comparison of the following program
and the objections raised to ROTC by the major
ity report will affirm that ROTC can be contin
ued at Stanford as a compatible and worthwhile
academic endeavor.

Departmental Structure
The Departments of Military Science, Naval
Science, and Aerospace Studies shall be com
bined into a Department of Military Studies. The
Chairmanship of this single department shall be
rotated among the heads of ROTC Units. A dis
tinction shall be made between the Department
of Military Studies and the ROTC Units. The De
partment of Military Studies shall be a part of
the academic structure of the University. The
ROTC Units shall be administrative agencies with
the function of serving students preparing for a
commission in the Armed Forces. The Units shall
administer scholarships and contracts, conduct
extra-curricular sessions, and advise students on
preparation for commissioning. The three units
of the Department of Military Studies shall re
ceive University administrative support as the
Provost may designate.
Rationale: The present arrangement of
three separate military science departments
results in an excessive administrative over
head and overrepresentation at councils of
departmental chairmen not warranted by
the size of these departments' instructional
staff or the variety of their course offer
ings. Different budgeting, personnel admin
istration, and reporting in the three mili
tary services, however, do require that each
ROTC Unit be administratively separate.
The ROTC Units will appropriately operate
at Stanford as administrative agencies of
the military services, and not as direct
sponsors for academic programs.
Organization of Military Studies Programs
A program of Military Science, of Naval Sci
ence, and of Aerospace Studies shall be offered
in the Stanford curriculum under the aegis of a
Military Studies Committee. The Committee
shall be appointed by the Senate and be com
posed of four Professors from the University at
large, the senior military officer from each ROTC
unit of the Department of Military Studies, and
four undergraduate students (two of whom will
be enrolled in ROTC and two from the univer
sity-at-large).
The Military Studies Committee shall deter
mine credit for courses offered by the Depart
ment of Military Studies, shall determine the cur
riculum for the Military Studies Programs, and
shall review the qualifications of military officers
recommended for appointment to instructional
positions. The military Studies Committee shall
be responsible to the Committee on Undergrad
uate Education. Proposed military science
courses which appropriately fall into the cate
gory of Undergraduate Specials shall be sub
mitted to the Committee on Undergraduate Edu
cation for approval. The Military Studies Pro
grams shall include these courses which are neces
sary to qualify students for a commission
through the ROTC programs, and are available
for students who wish to attain a background
knowledge of military art and science. The Pro
grams shall include accredited courses offered by
the Department of Military Studies, courses of
fered in other departments of the University, and
any approved military science Undergraduate
Specials.
Rationale: The determination of programs
of military study, review and of appoint
ments of military teachers and adjudication
of course credit by a Military Studies Com
mittee will fix responsibility for military
studies at the University in a manner more
consistent with institutional practices. The
military services, under this arrangement,
will assume more a role of an accrediting
body with respect to curriculum.
Other features of this proposal which seem
beneficial are: (1) the provision for contin
ual review and upgrading of military stud
ies programs, (2) the attractiveness to able
military officers, providing for appoint
ment of those officers who can make the
most substantial academic contributions to
the University, (3) the involvement of stu
dents and non-military faculty along with
military officers in determining the mili
tary studies to be undertaken, and (4) a
reduction of the sense of isolation of mili
tary teachers within the academic com
munity.
The extent of the nation's gross national
product that is allocated for defense and
the fact that warfare unhappily continues
adds relevancy to this field of academic
study. A fear that a militaristic view will
prevail is unfounded from the evidence this
committee has received, and in any event,
the military point of view can be leavened
by a standing committee which is plural
istic in perspective and reflects the values
of the University.
Academic Rank
The senior military officer of each unit of the
Department of Military Studies shall have the
rank and title of Professor of Military Science,
Naval Science, and Aerospace Studies, respec
tively, with the same perquisites which now per
tain to those positions.
All other military officers of the instructional
staff shall have the rank and title of Lecturer,
with the privileges and perquisites which now
pertain to that position.
In the event that officers who ordinarily
would be appointed Lecturer have unusual quali
fications, the Military Studies Committee may
recommend appointment as Assistant or Associ
ate Professor for the term of their anticipated
presence at Stanford.
Rationale: The rank of Professor for the
senior military officer appointed to each
ROTC unit is considered appropriate to his
experience, knowledge and responsibilities,
and is stipulated in present law.
This academic rank also attracts to ROTC
assignments better senior officers with
about twenty-four years of broad military
experience and education. Membership in
the Academic Council provides a means for
desirable involvement by the senior mili
tary officer in university affairs.
Since no direct correlation between mili
tary education and experience and regular
academic credentials exists it seems ap
propriate to make "Lecturer" the normal
appointment for more junior military of
ficers. This rank is consistent with that ac
corded well-qualified individuals from the
professions and the community who teach
courses at Stanford. However, when special
competence is available or found, a provis

officers is warranted.

the special considerations in the same way
that it takes into account other appoint

112. Following Advisory Board action, the rec
ommendation will follow the usual course

For those to be considered for appointment as

may terminate on a year's notice. If altered

in contracts and agreements must follow

the University benefits directly from its privi
leged place in that society. No single institution
can render every service, and each must, of its
own free choice, select those areas in which it
can serve effectively. The University cannot be
isolated from the pressing problems of our
society, nor should it be. One important set of
problems facing the country is that of foreign
and military policy. This has been so since the
establishment of the United States and it can be
assumed that it will continue to be so for some
time to come. Stanford and many other colleges
and universities have, over the years, cooperated
with the Federal Government and the military
services in the training of young officers; this is
one of the relevant major problem areas in which
this University has served.
We believe that much of the current anxiety
about and opposition to ROTC is rooted in the
profound disagreements with the conduct of our
policy in Southeast Asia and our involvement in
the Vietnam War. We urge, however, that ROTC
be judged in the context of the nation's history
and in the context of a reasonable estimate of
the future. The termination of the present war
will not end the need for adequate national se
curity forces and for the need to provide the
leadership for them. We believe that the nation's
colleges and universities, including Stanford Uni
versity, should participate in training the leader
ship for these security forces.
There is no doubt that accommodation of
ROTC on a university campus requires arrange
ments at variance with accepted and standard
academic policy and practice. As we have shown,
we do not argue for the status quo with respect
to the way in which ROTC is organized and ad
ministered and in the way in which it relates to
the academic structure of the University.
The presence of ROTC as an academic pro
gram offends some members of the faculty and
of the student body who hold that there should
be no pre-professional educational programs, at
least at the undergraduate level. Some faculty
members and students are concerned with the
presence of a program that has certain marked
external controls in contrast to the more typical
internally-regulated activities. Some conclude
that instruction by the military is inevitably anti
thetical to free intellectual inquiry. But in our
investigations and inquiries, we have found that
there are several other pre-professional academic
programs with an accepted place in the Stanford
scene. We have found that there are other activi
ties subject to various forms and degrees of exter
nal constraint. We have found no evidence that
military instruction inhibits the development of
the freely inquiring minds of those enrolled in
ROTC; indeed there is no evidence that the pres
ent system, with its admitted variations from
standard academic practice, is the least harmful
to the academic community or to anyone in it.
We do not hold that ROTC is essential to
Stanford University nor do we hold that Stan
ford University is essential to the military ser
vices. We do not claim that in the long run ROTC
is necessarily the ultimate means of preparing
college-educated officers for military service. But
for the present, it is the best means available to
the country and is likely to be so for the foresee
able future. In the meantime, ROTC provides im
portant advantages to the University and to its
students. The presence of ROTC provides our
students with the means of earning a commission
so that they may meet their military service obli
gations as officers. The ROTC programs provide
approximately $250,000 per year in student fin
ancial aid, bringing to the University a very able
student element including a number who other
wise might not be able to come to Stanford.
ROTC provides an opportunity to study in a
field that is certainly relevant to modern day
concerns and which would not otherwise be
available to the Stanford students.
Moreover, we have found the military services
to be not unmindful of trends in educational
thought and have undertaken serious steps to im
prove the quality and acceptability of ROTC pro
grams on college and university campuses. While
each service has varied in its approach to the sti
uation, they all have important elements in com
mon. Each has given its department chairmen
considerable flexibility to substitute courses in
other departments for military courses, to ar
range schedules to suit individual students, and
to negotiate with their institutions other aspects
of the ROTC programs. The Professor of Naval
Science is told, for example, that he "will func
tion as an academic department head in fact as
well as name . . . (and) is expected to structure a
program of studies for each Naval Science stu
dent that will satisfy the University's overall de
gree requirements."
In considering the manner in which ROTC
should be related to the academic structure of
the University, we took cognizance of these pres
ent and continuing efforts of the military services
to make ROTC more compatible with the desires
and procedures of the academic community.
What the minority members of the Committee
have recommended is fully compatible with the
trends in the services.
Since we hold that ROTC should continue at
Stanford University, we consider it essential that
it be integrated as closely as possible into the
regular academic structure. We believe that it
should be an academic program subject to nor
mal University controls and supervision. We con
sider this to be essential to the survival of ROTC
at Stanford.
We do not believe that ROTC could survive
with vitality and challenge, be useful to the ser
vices and worthy of the University's support, as a
non-credit "voluntary activity" program outside
the academic structure. We doubt that it would
be attractive to any significant number of high
quality students and we doubt that it would be
subject to adequate control by the University. As
we have said earlier in this paper, we reject this
proposal for we consider it tantamount to aboli
tion.

We have proposed a different solution, one
designed to bring an improved ROTC program
more into line with accepted standards of the
University. Separation from the academic struc
ture would, in our judgment, •ender ROTC inef
fective and unmanageable and eventually unac
ceptable to the military services. We take the
position that ROTC can and must be improved in
the interests of the nation, of Stanford Univer
sity and of Stanford students.

FINAL REPORT OF THE MINORITY
AD HOC SENATE COMMITTEE ON ROTC
FOREWORD
The undersigned members of the Senate ad
hoc Committee on ROTC submit the following
Minority Report with recommendations for the
improvement of ROTC at Stanford University.
This Minority Report is based upon the following
fundamental position.
For the foreseeable future, this nation will re
quire armed forces of considerable size, and will
require substantial numbers of well-educated and
well-trained officers to lead them. The ROTC
programs have been for many years the principal
means for providing such officers for the perman
ent forces or for reserve components. Participa
tion by such installations as Stanford University
in the ROTC programs, voluntary on the part of
the University and voluntary on the part of its
students, is therefore of considerable importance
to the nation. Moreover, maintenance of ROTC
programs on the campus provides a desirable op
portunity for those students who wish to earn a
military commission and thus meet their military
service obligations as commissioned officers.
In the proceedings of the Senate ad hoc Com
mittee on ROTC there has been no evidence pre
sented to show that ROTC programs are inimical
to the fundamental interests of Stanford Univer
sity or its students. On balance, it has been
shown that the availability of ROTC programs is
beneficial to the University, particularly in its
financial aid programs for students. If for these
reasons, the University concludes that it should
participate in ROTC, the University is obligated
to support ROTC in conditions that offer reason
able assurances of vitality and worth to its stu
dents, as well as to the military services.
It is the judgment of the minority members of
the Committee that ROTC cannot survive as an
extra-curricular activity separated from the aca
demic structure of the University. Indeed, we
consider that such separation is inconsistent with
a decision to continue ROTC at Stanford and
would be tantamount to abolition.
On the other hand, the minority members are
firmly convinced that a number of important im
provements should and can be made in ROTC to
meet the legitimate criticisms of its present form
and to place ROTC in an appropriate relationship
to the academic structure of the University.
The improvements we propose retain military
studies of worthy academic quality and proven
interest to substantial numbers of Stanford stu
dents as academic programs. Removal of these
studies from the curriculum would deprive Stan
ford students of existing opportunities for rele
vant academic inquiry without accompanying
benefit to any other constituency of the Univer
sity.
RECOMMENDA TIONS
The minority members of the Senate ad hoc
Committee on ROTC recommend:
1. That ROTC continue at Stanford Univer
sity;
2. That ROTC continue to be part of the aca
demic program of the University with specific
provision for a closer integration of ROTC into
its academic structure;
3. That ROTC programs be modified with re
spect to the organization and administration of
ROTC, the status of and appointment procedures
for its instructional staff, the curriculum, and the
contractual relationships between the military
services and the University and between the ser
vices and Stanford students.
4. That, to accomplish the above recommend
ations, the following program for ROTC be insti
tuted at Stanford.
AN IMPROVED ROTC PROGRAM FOR
STANFORD
The minority members reject the premise that
a substantive case for or against ROTC at Stan
ford has been established upon purely institu
tional considerations. Many subjective judgments
about the proper educational role of the Univer
sity are involved in such a premise. Many differ
ent opinions exist within the University about
what constitutes valid service to external con
cerns and interests. While it is possible to con
ceive that under certain circumstances the pres
ence of ROTC could be inimical to Stanford, we
do not find that presence, in actuality, to be a
threat to the integrity of the University. We do
find that over the years institutional relationships
for ROTC established by contract and law have
become archaic and in need of reform. Therefore
we have mainly responded to the charge of the
Senate of the Academic Council by proposing
reforms that will establish suitable relationships
for ROTC. We believe the program which we rec
ommend for ROTC at Stanford will, upon criti
cal evaluation, be found to amend those features
which the majority members considered most ob
jectionable in the present program.
Our position rests upon the belief that a point
by point comparison of the following program
and the objections raised to ROTC by the major
ity report will affirm that ROTC can be contin
ued at Stanford as a compatible and worthwhile
academic endeavor.

Departmental Structure
The Departments of Military Science, Naval
Science, and Aerospace Studies shall be com
bined into a Department of Military Studies. The
Chairmanship of this single department shall be
rotated among the heads of ROTC Units. A dis
tinction shall be made between the Department
of Military Studies and the ROTC Units. The De
partment of Military Studies shall be a part of
the academic structure of the University. The
ROTC Units shall be administrative agencies with
the function of serving students preparing for a
commission in the Armed Forces. The Units shall
administer scholarships and contracts, conduct
extra-curricular sessions, and advise students on
preparation for commissioning. The three units
of the Department of Military Studies shall re
ceive University administrative support as the
Provost may designate.
Rationale: The present arrangement of
three separate military science departments
results in an excessive administrative over
head and overrepresentation at councils of
departmental chairmen not warranted by
the size of these departments' instructional
staff or the variety of their course offer
ings. Different budgeting, personnel admin
istration, and reporting in the three mili
tary services, however, do require that each
ROTC Unit be administratively separate.
The ROTC Units will appropriately operate
at Stanford as administrative agencies of
the military services, and not as direct
sponsors for academic programs.
Organization of Military Studies Programs
A program of Military Science, of Naval Sci
ence, and of Aerospace Studies shall be offered
in the Stanford curriculum under the aegis of a
Military Studies Committee. The Committee
shall be appointed by the Senate and be com
posed of four Professors from the University at
large, the senior military officer from each ROTC
unit of the Department of Military Studies, and
four undergraduate students (two of whom will
be enrolled in ROTC and two from the univer
sity-at-large).
The Military Studies Committee shall deter
mine credit for courses offered by the Depart
ment of Military Studies, shall determine the cur
riculum for the Military Studies Programs, and
shall review the qualifications of military officers
recommended for appointment to instructional
positions. The military Studies Committee shall
be responsible to the Committee on Undergrad
uate Education. Proposed military science
courses which appropriately fall into the cate
gory of Undergraduate Specials shall be sub
mitted to the Committee on Undergraduate Edu
cation for approval. The Military Studies Pro
grams shall include these courses which are neces
sary to qualify students for a commission
through the ROTC programs, and are available
for students who wish to attain a background
knowledge of military art and science. The Pro
grams shall include accredited courses offered by
the Department of Military Studies, courses of
fered in other departments of the University, and
any approved military science Undergraduate
Specials.
Rationale: The determination of programs
of military study, review and of appoint
ments of military teachers and adjudication
of course credit by a Military Studies Com
mittee will fix responsibility for military
studies at the University in a manner more
consistent with institutional practices. The
military services, under this arrangement,
will assume more a role of an accrediting
body with respect to curriculum.
Other features of this proposal which seem
beneficial are: (1) the provision for contin
ual review and upgrading of military stud
ies programs, (2) the attractiveness to able
military officers, providing for appoint
ment of those officers who can make the
most substantial academic contributions to
the University, (3) the involvement of stu
dents and non-military faculty along with
military officers in determining the mili
tary studies to be undertaken, and (4) a
reduction of the sense of isolation of mili
tary teachers within the academic com
munity.
The extent of the nation's gross national
product that is allocated for defense and
the fact that warfare unhappily continues
adds relevancy to this field of academic
study. A fear that a militaristic view will
prevail is unfounded from the evidence this
committee has received, and in any event,
the military point of view can be leavened
by a standing committee which is plural
istic in perspective and reflects the values
of the University.
Academic Rank
The senior military officer of each unit of the
Department of Military Studies shall have the
rank and title of Professor of Military Science,
Naval Science, and Aerospace Studies, respec
tively, with the same perquisites which now per
tain to those positions.
All other military officers of the instructional
staff shall have the rank and title of Lecturer,
with the privileges and perquisites which now
pertain to that position.
In the event that officers who ordinarily
would be appointed Lecturer have unusual quali
fications, the Military Studies Committee may
recommend appointment as Assistant or Associ
ate Professor for the term of their anticipated
presence at Stanford.
Rationale: The rank of Professor for the
senior military officer appointed to each
ROTC unit is considered appropriate to his
experience, knowledge and responsibilities,
and is stipulated in present law.
This academic rank also attracts to ROTC
assignments better senior officers with
about twenty-four years of broad military
experience and education. Membership in
the Academic Council provides a means for
desirable involvement by the senior mili
tary officer in university affairs.
Since no direct correlation between mili
tary education and experience and regular
academic credentials exists it seems ap
propriate to make "Lecturer" the normal
appointment for more junior military of
ficers. This rank is consistent with that ac
corded well-qualified individuals from the
professions and the community who teach
courses at Stanford. However, when special
competence is available or found, a provis
ion for professorial appointment of these
officers is warranted.
Appointment Procedures
Those to be considered for appointment to
the rank of Professor shall go through the normal
review and appointment procedure, or as close to
that procedure as is possible. The following pro
cedure is proposed.
a. The Service concerned will submit a panel
of nominations, together with their creden
tials, to the President of the University.
The credentials will include:
(1) Personal resume.
(2) Educational record, including trans
cripts of academic work, service school
attendance, etc.
(3) Evidence of instructional and other
faculty-type experience.
b. The President will submit the nominations
to the Military Studies Committee for re

view and recommendation. It is intended
that the Committee for this purpose,
would function as a school or department
faculty "search committee." Regular Ad
visory Board recommendation forms will
be prepared as completely as possible.
c. The service concerned shall be prepared to
present at least the Committee's preferred
candidate for interview by the Committee
and the President (or his designated repre
sentative).
d. The Committee will then submit its recom
mended and preferred candidate to the
Provost for review at that level.
e. The Provost will submit the recommenda
tion to the Advisory Board for consider
ation. It is assumed that the Advisory
Board will review the cases in the light of
the special considerations in the same way
that it takes into account other appoint
ments in other professional fields.
112. Following Advisory Board action, the rec
ommendation will follow the usual course
to the Board of Trustees for final action.
For those to be considered for appointment as
Lecturers, the procedure shall be the same as for
professors, except that the recommendation need
not be submitted to the Advisory Board.
In the event that a junior officer is proposed
for an assistant or associate professor, the candi
date would be processed through the same chan
nel as are professors of military programs.
Rationale: The foregoing proposals provide
a procedure closely akin to the normal pro
cedure for faculty appointments. The ma
jor difference is of course the initial search
mechanism which is conducted through the
heads of ROTC units and their respective
military services. The minority members
considered the title of Visiting Professor
but rejected it on the basis that deviations
from the norm would be greater with this
title than under the procedures outlined.
Visiting professors are typically appointed
for one year, and have no administrative
responsibility. Senior military officer ap
pointments are usually for a period of
three years. Senior military officers are res
ponsible for direction of their programs as
well as representation to other elements of
the University.
Academic Credit
The courses of the Department of Military
Studies which are approved by the Military Stud
ies Committee shall be offered for degree credit.
Instruction desirable for potential military of
ficers but considered by the Military Studies
Committee to be of a narrow training scope shall
be conducted as extra-curricular sessions. Assum
ing that studies in military history and national
security affairs will, in the future, be available in
other departments, degree credit for courses of
fered by the Department of Military Studies shall
not exceed 18 quarter units or 12 semester units
or their equivalent in a four-year curriculum.
Rationale: The military science and studies
courses which meet University standards
should not be excluded arbitrarily from the
curriculum or credit. The evidence before
this committee has indicated that most of
the courses offered in the military sciences
are equivalent in quality to those of other
departments. A few, such as Naval Orienta
tion, have been generally acknowledged to
be of a narrow training nature and credit
will not be sought for these and similar
courses. The proposed limitation on total
degree credit is not the result of a bargain
ing process resulting in a compromise limit.
Eighteen quarter units or 12 semester units
over a four-year period represents our judg
ment on courses existing and planned for
the military studies cirricula which are
likely to be deemed worthy of academic
credit and at the same time meet the needs
of the services. Additionally it is believed
that this proposed limitation on academic
credit for military studies will insure ROTC
students the flexibility to undertake their
other academic responsibilities without in
curring an undue overload.
Wherever possible, courses offered by other
departments of the University should be
substituted for military-taught courses,
thus further reducing the amount of degree
credit and student overload.
Student Contracts
Individual contracts between students and the
military departments shall be changed to clearly
reflect actual practices. Specifically any ROTC
student—either those on financial assistance or
associated on another contractual basis—must be
assured in writing that he may disenroll from
ROTC within the first two years of a four-year
program without prejudice or obligation.
Rationale: The practice has always been to
disenroll any ROTC student without pre
judice for future military service and with
out obligation during his first two years. In
no case has a student not receiving finan
cial assistance been denied disenrollment
without obligation at any time over four
years. The real nature of the agreement be
tween students in ROTC and the services is
a compact which the student may break
without obligation assuming he is acting in
good faith.
Changes in individual contracts will require
negotiations with the military services.
Such negotiations should be undertaken
immediately.
It should be noted that students may enroll
or audit military science courses without
joining ROTC. Those who are not certain
of their interest or choice may use this
means of securing increased information on
which to base their decision about ROTC.
University Contracts
Contractual agreements between Stanford
University and the military services should be al
tered to reflect the provisions of this proposed
program.
Rationale: Contracts are subject to renego
tiation on a yearly basis and either party
may terminate on a year's notice. If altered
relationships are agreed upon, the changes
in contracts and agreements must follow
immediately.
Retroactive Application
Loss of academic credit by students enrolled
in ROTC or change in faculty status of military
officers already appointed to the Stanford fac
ulty shall not be incurred as a result of the pro
visions of this recommendation. All other
changes shall be implemented as expeditiously as
possible.
Trial Period
The proposed program shall be undertaken for
a five-year trial period upon mutual agreement
between the military services and Stanford Uni
versity. At the end of the five-year trial period
there shall be a searching review of the success of
the proposed program.
Rationale: A five-year trial period was se
lected to permit evaluation of two com
plete cycles of the four-year program with
particular regard to the evaluation of stu
dents completing the program.
CONCLUSION
The foregoing recommendations are based up
on a particular view of the University and of the
appropriate relations between the military ser

vices and this University. We believe Stanford to
be, among other things, a pluralistic community
serving a number of important and worthwhile
functions, including liberal arts and preprofes
sional undergraduate education as well as grad
uate training in the arts and sciences and in the
professional fields. No one college or university
can or should attempt to serve every possible in
terest in all of these areas, but we hold that
ROTC has a long and honorable history as part
of the Stanford scene and that it fits within the
framework of what Stanford does well.
In our consideration of the place of ROTC at
Stanford, we accepted the premise that, given the
evident state of the world and this nation's re
sponsibilities in it, there will be for some time to
come a substantial need for military forces of
considerable size. Such a force will require the
very best leadership at all levels that the country
can provide. ROTC is a major source of that
leadership and will continue to be so for the fore
seeable future. The service academies and other
means of officer training, as presently consti
tuted, cannot possibly supply the need of over
30,000 new officers each year. The colleges and
universities are reasonable sources of young of
ficers, and ROTC has been for many years the
means of the cooperative effort between the mili
tary services and universities to provide these of
ficers.
We accept the view that the University has a
responsibility to serve the nation and society, for
the University benefits directly from its privi
leged place in that society. No single institution
can render every service, and each must, of its
own free choice, select those areas in which it
can serve effectively. The University cannot be
isolated from the pressing problems of our
society, nor should it be. One important set of
problems facing the country is that of foreign
and military policy. This has been so since the
establishment of the United States and it can be
assumed that it will continue to be so for some
time to come. Stanford and many other colleges
and universities have, over the years, cooperated
with the Federal Government and the military
services in the training of young officers; this is
one of the relevant major problem areas in which
this University has served.
We believe that much of the current anxiety
about and opposition to ROTC is rooted in the
profound disagreements with the conduct of our
policy in Southeast Asia and our involvement in
the Vietnam War. We urge, however, that ROTC
be judged in the context of the nation's history
and in the context of a reasonable estimate of
the future. The termination of the present war
will not end the need for adequate national se
curity forces and for the need to provide the
leadership for them. We believe that the nation's
colleges and universities, including Stanford Uni
versity, should participate in training the leader
ship for these security forces.
There is no doubt that accommodation of
ROTC on a university campus requires arrange
ments at variance with accepted and standard
academic policy and practice. As we have shown,
we do not argue for the status quo with respect
to the way in which ROTC is organized and ad

FINAL REPORT OF THE MINORITY
AD HOC SENATE COMMITTEE ON ROTC
FOREWORD
The undersigned members of the Senate ad

Minority Report with recommendations for the

ford students of existing opportunities for rele
vant academic inquiry without accompanying
benefit to any other constituency of the Univer
sity.
RECOMMENDA TIONS
The minority members of the Senate ad hoc
Committee on ROTC recommend:
1. That ROTC continue at Stanford Univer
sity;
2. That ROTC continue to be part of the aca
demic program of the University with specific
provision for a closer integration of ROTC into
its academic structure;
3. That ROTC programs be modified with re
spect to the organization and administration of
ROTC, the status of and appointment procedures
for its instructional staff, the curriculum, and the
contractual relationships between the military
services and the University and between the ser
vices and Stanford students.
4. That, to accomplish the above recommend
ations, the following program for ROTC be insti
tuted at Stanford.
AN IMPROVED ROTC PROGRAM FOR
STANFORD
The minority members reject the premise that
a substantive case for or against ROTC at Stan
ford has been established upon purely institu
tional considerations. Many subjective judgments
about the proper educational role of the Univer
sity are involved in such a premise. Many differ
ent opinions exist within the University about
what constitutes valid service to external con
cerns and interests. While it is possible to con
ceive that under certain circumstances the pres
ence of ROTC could be inimical to Stanford, we
do not find that presence, in actuality, to be a
threat to the integrity of the University. We do
find that over the years institutional relationships
for ROTC established by contract and law have
become archaic and in need of reform. Therefore
we have mainly responded to the charge of the
Senate of the Academic Council by proposing
reforms that will establish suitable relationships
for ROTC. We believe the program which we rec
ommend for ROTC at Stanford will, upon criti
cal evaluation, be found to amend those features
which the majority members considered most ob
jectionable in the present program.
Our position rests upon the belief that a point
by point comparison of the following program
and the objections raised to ROTC by the major
ity report will affirm that ROTC can be contin
ued at Stanford as a compatible and worthwhile
academic endeavor.

Departmental Structure
The Departments of Military Science, Naval
Science, and Aerospace Studies shall be com
bined into a Department of Military Studies. The
Chairmanship of this single department shall be
rotated among the heads of ROTC Units. A dis
tinction shall be made between the Department
of Military Studies and the ROTC Units. The De
partment of Military Studies shall be a part of
the academic structure of the University. The
ROTC Units shall be administrative agencies with
the function of serving students preparing for a
commission in the Armed Forces. The Units shall
administer scholarships and contracts, conduct
extra-curricular sessions, and advise students on
preparation for commissioning. The three units
of the Department of Military Studies shall re
ceive University administrative support as the
Provost may designate.
Rationale: The present arrangement of
three separate military science departments
results in an excessive administrative over
head and overrepresentation at councils of
departmental chairmen not warranted by
the size of these departments' instructional
staff or the variety of their course offer
ings. Different budgeting, personnel admin
istration, and reporting in the three mili
tary services, however, do require that each
ROTC Unit be administratively separate.
The ROTC Units will appropriately operate
at Stanford as administrative agencies of
the military services, and not as direct
sponsors for academic programs.
Organization of Military Studies Programs
A program of Military Science, of Naval Sci
ence, and of Aerospace Studies shall be offered
in the Stanford curriculum under the aegis of a
Military Studies Committee. The Committee
shall be appointed by the Senate and be com
posed of four Professors from the University at
large, the senior military officer from each ROTC
unit of the Department of Military Studies, and
four undergraduate students (two of whom will
be enrolled in ROTC and two from the univer
sity-at-large).
The Military Studies Committee shall deter
mine credit for courses offered by the Depart
ment of Military Studies, shall determine the cur
riculum for the Military Studies Programs, and
shall review the qualifications of military officers
recommended for appointment to instructional
positions. The military Studies Committee shall
be responsible to the Committee on Undergrad
uate Education. Proposed military science
courses which appropriately fall into the cate
gory of Undergraduate Specials shall be sub
mitted to the Committee on Undergraduate Edu
cation for approval. The Military Studies Pro
grams shall include these courses which are neces
sary to qualify students for a commission
through the ROTC programs, and are available
for students who wish to attain a background
knowledge of military art and science. The Pro
grams shall include accredited courses offered by
the Department of Military Studies, courses of
fered in other departments of the University, and
any approved military science Undergraduate
Specials.
Rationale: The determination of programs
of military study, review and of appoint
ments of military teachers and adjudication
of course credit by a Military Studies Com
mittee will fix responsibility for military
studies at the University in a manner more
consistent with institutional practices. The
military services, under this arrangement,
will assume more a role of an accrediting
body with respect to curriculum.
Other features of this proposal which seem
beneficial are: (1) the provision for contin
ual review and upgrading of military stud
ies programs, (2) the attractiveness to able
military officers, providing for appoint
ment of those officers who can make the
most substantial academic contributions to
the University, (3) the involvement of stu
dents and non-military faculty along with
military officers in determining the mili
tary studies to be undertaken, and (4) a
reduction of the sense of isolation of mili
tary teachers within the academic com
munity.
The extent of the nation's gross national
product that is allocated for defense and
the fact that warfare unhappily continues
adds relevancy to this field of academic
study. A fear that a militaristic view will
prevail is unfounded from the evidence this
committee has received, and in any event,
the military point of view can be leavened
by a standing committee which is plural
istic in perspective and reflects the values
of the University.
Academic Rank
The senior military officer of each unit of the
Department of Military Studies shall have the
rank and title of Professor of Military Science,
Naval Science, and Aerospace Studies, respec
tively, with the same perquisites which now per
tain to those positions.
All other military officers of the instructional
staff shall have the rank and title of Lecturer,
with the privileges and perquisites which now
pertain to that position.
In the event that officers who ordinarily
would be appointed Lecturer have unusual quali
fications, the Military Studies Committee may
recommend appointment as Assistant or Associ
ate Professor for the term of their anticipated
presence at Stanford.
Rationale: The rank of Professor for the
senior military officer appointed to each
ROTC unit is considered appropriate to his
experience, knowledge and responsibilities,
and is stipulated in present law.
This academic rank also attracts to ROTC
assignments better senior officers with
about twenty-four years of broad military
experience and education. Membership in
the Academic Council provides a means for
desirable involvement by the senior mili
tary officer in university affairs.
Since no direct correlation between mili
tary education and experience and regular
academic credentials exists it seems ap
propriate to make "Lecturer" the normal
appointment for more junior military of
ficers. This rank is consistent with that ac
corded well-qualified individuals from the
professions and the community who teach
courses at Stanford. However, when special
competence is available or found, a provis
ion for professorial appointment of these
officers is warranted.
Appointment Procedures
Those to be considered for appointment to
the rank of Professor shall go through the normal
review and appointment procedure, or as close to
that procedure as is possible. The following pro
cedure is proposed.
a. The Service concerned will submit a panel
of nominations, together with their creden
tials, to the President of the University.
The credentials will include:
(1) Personal resume.
(2) Educational record, including trans
cripts of academic work, service school
attendance, etc.
(3) Evidence of instructional and other
faculty-type experience.
b. The President will submit the nominations
to the Military Studies Committee for re

view and recommendation. It is intended
that the Committee for this purpose,
would function as a school or department
faculty "search committee." Regular Ad
visory Board recommendation forms will
be prepared as completely as possible.
c. The service concerned shall be prepared to
present at least the Committee's preferred
candidate for interview by the Committee
and the President (or his designated repre
sentative).
d. The Committee will then submit its recom
mended and preferred candidate to the
Provost for review at that level.
e. The Provost will submit the recommenda
tion to the Advisory Board for consider
ation. It is assumed that the Advisory
Board will review the cases in the light of
the special considerations in the same way
that it takes into account other appoint
ments in other professional fields.
112. Following Advisory Board action, the rec
ommendation will follow the usual course
to the Board of Trustees for final action.
For those to be considered for appointment as
Lecturers, the procedure shall be the same as for
professors, except that the recommendation need
not be submitted to the Advisory Board.
In the event that a junior officer is proposed
for an assistant or associate professor, the candi
date would be processed through the same chan
nel as are professors of military programs.
Rationale: The foregoing proposals provide
a procedure closely akin to the normal pro
cedure for faculty appointments. The ma
jor difference is of course the initial search
mechanism which is conducted through the
heads of ROTC units and their respective
military services. The minority members
considered the title of Visiting Professor
but rejected it on the basis that deviations
from the norm would be greater with this
title than under the procedures outlined.
Visiting professors are typically appointed
for one year, and have no administrative
responsibility. Senior military officer ap
pointments are usually for a period of
three years. Senior military officers are res
ponsible for direction of their programs as
well as representation to other elements of
the University.
Academic Credit
The courses of the Department of Military
Studies which are approved by the Military Stud
ies Committee shall be offered for degree credit.
Instruction desirable for potential military of
ficers but considered by the Military Studies
Committee to be of a narrow training scope shall
be conducted as extra-curricular sessions. Assum
ing that studies in military history and national
security affairs will, in the future, be available in
other departments, degree credit for courses of
fered by the Department of Military Studies shall
not exceed 18 quarter units or 12 semester units
or their equivalent in a four-year curriculum.
Rationale: The military science and studies
courses which meet University standards
should not be excluded arbitrarily from the
curriculum or credit. The evidence before
this committee has indicated that most of
the courses offered in the military sciences
are equivalent in quality to those of other
departments. A few, such as Naval Orienta
tion, have been generally acknowledged to
be of a narrow training nature and credit
will not be sought for these and similar
courses. The proposed limitation on total
degree credit is not the result of a bargain
ing process resulting in a compromise limit.
Eighteen quarter units or 12 semester units
over a four-year period represents our judg
ment on courses existing and planned for
the military studies cirricula which are
likely to be deemed worthy of academic
credit and at the same time meet the needs
of the services. Additionally it is believed
that this proposed limitation on academic
credit for military studies will insure ROTC
students the flexibility to undertake their
other academic responsibilities without in
curring an undue overload.
Wherever possible, courses offered by other
departments of the University should be
substituted for military-taught courses,
thus further reducing the amount of degree
credit and student overload.
Student Contracts
Individual contracts between students and the
military departments shall be changed to clearly
reflect actual practices. Specifically any ROTC
student—either those on financial assistance or
associated on another contractual basis—must be
assured in writing that he may disenroll from
ROTC within the first two years of a four-year
program without prejudice or obligation.
Rationale: The practice has always been to
disenroll any ROTC student without pre
judice for future military service and with
out obligation during his first two years. In
no case has a student not receiving finan
cial assistance been denied disenrollment
without obligation at any time over four
years. The real nature of the agreement be
tween students in ROTC and the services is
a compact which the student may break
without obligation assuming he is acting in
good faith.
Changes in individual contracts will require
negotiations with the military services.
Such negotiations should be undertaken
immediately.
It should be noted that students may enroll
or audit military science courses without
joining ROTC. Those who are not certain
of their interest or choice may use this
means of securing increased information on
which to base their decision about ROTC.
University Contracts
Contractual agreements between Stanford
University and the military services should be al
tered to reflect the provisions of this proposed
program.
Rationale: Contracts are subject to renego
tiation on a yearly basis and either party
may terminate on a year's notice. If altered
relationships are agreed upon, the changes
in contracts and agreements must follow
immediately.
Retroactive Application
Loss of academic credit by students enrolled
in ROTC or change in faculty status of military
officers already appointed to the Stanford fac
ulty shall not be incurred as a result of the pro
visions of this recommendation. All other
changes shall be implemented as expeditiously as
possible.
Trial Period
The proposed program shall be undertaken for
a five-year trial period upon mutual agreement
between the military services and Stanford Uni
versity. At the end of the five-year trial period
there shall be a searching review of the success of
the proposed program.
Rationale: A five-year trial period was se
lected to permit evaluation of two com
plete cycles of the four-year program with
particular regard to the evaluation of stu
dents completing the program.
CONCLUSION
The foregoing recommendations are based up
on a particular view of the University and of the
appropriate relations between the military ser

vices and this University. We believe Stanford to
be, among other things, a pluralistic community
serving a number of important and worthwhile
functions, including liberal arts and preprofes
sional undergraduate education as well as grad
uate training in the arts and sciences and in the
professional fields. No one college or university
can or should attempt to serve every possible in
terest in all of these areas, but we hold that
ROTC has a long and honorable history as part
of the Stanford scene and that it fits within the
framework of what Stanford does well.
In our consideration of the place of ROTC at
Stanford, we accepted the premise that, given the
evident state of the world and this nation's re
sponsibilities in it, there will be for some time to
come a substantial need for military forces of
considerable size. Such a force will require the
very best leadership at all levels that the country
can provide. ROTC is a major source of that
leadership and will continue to be so for the fore
seeable future. The service academies and other
means of officer training, as presently consti
tuted, cannot possibly supply the need of over
30,000 new officers each year. The colleges and
universities are reasonable sources of young of
ficers, and ROTC has been for many years the
means of the cooperative effort between the mili
tary services and universities to provide these of
ficers.
We accept the view that the University has a
responsibility to serve the nation and society, for
the University benefits directly from its privi
leged place in that society. No single institution
can render every service, and each must, of its
own free choice, select those areas in which it
can serve effectively. The University cannot be
isolated from the pressing problems of our
society, nor should it be. One important set of
problems facing the country is that of foreign
and military policy. This has been so since the
establishment of the United States and it can be
assumed that it will continue to be so for some
time to come. Stanford and many other colleges
and universities have, over the years, cooperated
with the Federal Government and the military
services in the training of young officers; this is
one of the relevant major problem areas in which
this University has served.
We believe that much of the current anxiety
about and opposition to ROTC is rooted in the
profound disagreements with the conduct of our
policy in Southeast Asia and our involvement in
the Vietnam War. We urge, however, that ROTC
be judged in the context of the nation's history
and in the context of a reasonable estimate of
the future. The termination of the present war
will not end the need for adequate national se
curity forces and for the need to provide the
leadership for them. We believe that the nation's
colleges and universities, including Stanford Uni
versity, should participate in training the leader
ship for these security forces.
There is no doubt that accommodation of
ROTC on a university campus requires arrange
ments at variance with accepted and standard
academic policy and practice. As we have shown,
we do not argue for the status quo with respect
to the way in which ROTC is organized and ad
ministered and in the way in which it relates to
the academic structure of the University.
The presence of ROTC as an academic pro
gram offends some members of the faculty and
of the student body who hold that there should
be no pre-professional educational programs, at
least at the undergraduate level. Some faculty
members and students are concerned with the
presence of a program that has certain marked
external controls in contrast to the more typical
internally-regulated activities. Some conclude
that instruction by the military is inevitably anti
thetical to free intellectual inquiry. But in our
investigations and inquiries, we have found that
there are several other pre-professional academic
programs with an accepted place in the Stanford
scene. We have found that there are other activi
ties subject to various forms and degrees of exter
nal constraint. We have found no evidence that
military instruction inhibits the development of
the freely inquiring minds of those enrolled in
ROTC; indeed there is no evidence that the pres
ent system, with its admitted variations from
standard academic practice, is the least harmful
to the academic community or to anyone in it.
We do not hold that ROTC is essential to
Stanford University nor do we hold that Stan
ford University is essential to the military ser
vices. We do not claim that in the long run ROTC
is necessarily the ultimate means of preparing
college-educated officers for military service. But
for the present, it is the best means available to
the country and is likely to be so for the foresee
able future. In the meantime, ROTC provides im
portant advantages to the University and to its
students. The presence of ROTC provides our
students with the means of earning a commission
so that they may meet their military service obli
gations as officers. The ROTC programs provide
approximately $250,000 per year in student fin
ancial aid, bringing to the University a very able
student element including a number who other
wise might not be able to come to Stanford.
ROTC provides an opportunity to study in a
field that is certainly relevant to modern day
concerns and which would not otherwise be
available to the Stanford students.
Moreover, we have found the military services
to be not unmindful of trends in educational
thought and have undertaken serious steps to im
prove the quality and acceptability of ROTC pro
grams on college and university campuses. While
each service has varied in its approach to the sti
uation, they all have important elements in com
mon. Each has given its department chairmen
considerable flexibility to substitute courses in
other departments for military courses, to ar
range schedules to suit individual students, and
to negotiate with their institutions other aspects
of the ROTC programs. The Professor of Naval
Science is told, for example, that he "will func
tion as an academic department head in fact as
well as name . . . (and) is expected to structure a
program of studies for each Naval Science stu
dent that will satisfy the University's overall de
gree requirements."
In considering the manner in which ROTC
should be related to the academic structure of
the University, we took cognizance of these pres
ent and continuing efforts of the military services
to make ROTC more compatible with the desires
and procedures of the academic community.
What the minority members of the Committee
have recommended is fully compatible with the
trends in the services.
Since we hold that ROTC should continue at
Stanford University, we consider it essential that
it be integrated as closely as possible into the
regular academic structure. We believe that it
should be an academic program subject to nor
mal University controls and supervision. We con
sider this to be essential to the survival of ROTC
at Stanford.
We do not believe that ROTC could survive
with vitality and challenge, be useful to the ser
vices and worthy of the University's support, as a
non-credit "voluntary activity" program outside
the academic structure. We doubt that it would
be attractive to any significant number of high
quality students and we doubt that it would be
subject to adequate control by the University. As
we have said earlier in this paper, we reject this
proposal for we consider it tantamount to aboli
tion.

We have proposed a different solution, one
designed to bring an improved ROTC program
more into line with accepted standards of the
University. Separation from the academic struc
ture would, in our judgment, •ender ROTC inef
fective and unmanageable and eventually unac
ceptable to the military services. We take the
position that ROTC can and must be improved in
the interests of the nation, of Stanford Univer
sity and of Stanford students.

FINAL REPORT OF THE MINORITY
AD HOC SENATE COMMITTEE ON ROTC
FOREWORD
The undersigned members of the Senate ad
hoc Committee on ROTC submit the following
Minority Report with recommendations for the
improvement of ROTC at Stanford University.
This Minority Report is based upon the following
fundamental position.
For the foreseeable future, this nation will re
quire armed forces of considerable size, and will
require substantial numbers of well-educated and
well-trained officers to lead them. The ROTC
programs have been for many years the principal
means for providing such officers for the perman
ent forces or for reserve components. Participa
tion by such installations as Stanford University
in the ROTC programs, voluntary on the part of
the University and voluntary on the part of its
students, is therefore of considerable importance
to the nation. Moreover, maintenance of ROTC
programs on the campus provides a desirable op
portunity for those students who wish to earn a
military commission and thus meet their military
service obligations as commissioned officers.
In the proceedings of the Senate ad hoc Com
mittee on ROTC there has been no evidence pre
sented to show that ROTC programs are inimical
to the fundamental interests of Stanford Univer
sity or its students. On balance, it has been
shown that the availability of ROTC programs is
beneficial to the University, particularly in its
financial aid programs for students. If for these
reasons, the University concludes that it should
participate in ROTC, the University is obligated
to support ROTC in conditions that offer reason
able assurances of vitality and worth to its stu
dents, as well as to the military services.
It is the judgment of the minority members of
the Committee that ROTC cannot survive as an
extra-curricular activity separated from the aca
demic structure of the University. Indeed, we
consider that such separation is inconsistent with
a decision to continue ROTC at Stanford and
would be tantamount to abolition.
On the other hand, the minority members are
firmly convinced that a number of important im
provements should and can be made in ROTC to
meet the legitimate criticisms of its present form
and to place ROTC in an appropriate relationship
to the academic structure of the University.
The improvements we propose retain military
studies of worthy academic quality and proven
interest to substantial numbers of Stanford stu
dents as academic programs. Removal of these
studies from the curriculum would deprive Stan
ford students of existing opportunities for rele
vant academic inquiry without accompanying
benefit to any other constituency of the Univer
sity.
RECOMMENDA TIONS
The minority members of the Senate ad hoc
Committee on ROTC recommend:
1. That ROTC continue at Stanford Univer
sity;
2. That ROTC continue to be part of the aca
demic program of the University with specific
provision for a closer integration of ROTC into
its academic structure;
3. That ROTC programs be modified with re
spect to the organization and administration of
ROTC, the status of and appointment procedures
for its instructional staff, the curriculum, and the
contractual relationships between the military
services and the University and between the ser
vices and Stanford students.
4. That, to accomplish the above recommend
ations, the following program for ROTC be insti
tuted at Stanford.
AN IMPROVED ROTC PROGRAM FOR
STANFORD
The minority members reject the premise that
a substantive case for or against ROTC at Stan
ford has been established upon purely institu
tional considerations. Many subjective judgments
about the proper educational role of the Univer
sity are involved in such a premise. Many differ
ent opinions exist within the University about
what constitutes valid service to external con
cerns and interests. While it is possible to con

be prepared as completely as possible.
c. The service concerned shall be prepared to
present at least the Committee's preferred
candidate for interview by the Committee
and the President (or his designated repre
sentative).
d. The Committee will then submit its recom
mended and preferred candidate to the
Provost for review at that level.
e. The Provost will submit the recommenda
tion to the Advisory Board for consider
ation. It is assumed that the Advisory
Board will review the cases in the light of
the special considerations in the same way
that it takes into account other appoint
ments in other professional fields.
112. Following Advisory Board action, the rec
ommendation will follow the usual course
to the Board of Trustees for final action.
For those to be considered for appointment as
Lecturers, the procedure shall be the same as for
professors, except that the recommendation need
not be submitted to the Advisory Board.
In the event that a junior officer is proposed
for an assistant or associate professor, the candi
date would be processed through the same chan
nel as are professors of military programs.
Rationale: The foregoing proposals provide
a procedure closely akin to the normal pro
cedure for faculty appointments. The ma
jor difference is of course the initial search
mechanism which is conducted through the
heads of ROTC units and their respective
military services. The minority members
considered the title of Visiting Professor
but rejected it on the basis that deviations
from the norm would be greater with this
title than under the procedures outlined.
Visiting professors are typically appointed
for one year, and have no administrative
responsibility. Senior military officer ap
pointments are usually for a period of
three years. Senior military officers are res
ponsible for direction of their programs as
well as representation to other elements of
the University.
Academic Credit
The courses of the Department of Military
Studies which are approved by the Military Stud
ies Committee shall be offered for degree credit.
Instruction desirable for potential military of
ficers but considered by the Military Studies
Committee to be of a narrow training scope shall
be conducted as extra-curricular sessions. Assum
ing that studies in military history and national
security affairs will, in the future, be available in
other departments, degree credit for courses of
fered by the Department of Military Studies shall
not exceed 18 quarter units or 12 semester units
or their equivalent in a four-year curriculum.
Rationale: The military science and studies
courses which meet University standards
should not be excluded arbitrarily from the
curriculum or credit. The evidence before
this committee has indicated that most of
the courses offered in the military sciences
are equivalent in quality to those of other
departments. A few, such as Naval Orienta
tion, have been generally acknowledged to
be of a narrow training nature and credit
will not be sought for these and similar
courses. The proposed limitation on total
degree credit is not the result of a bargain
ing process resulting in a compromise limit.
Eighteen quarter units or 12 semester units
over a four-year period represents our judg
ment on courses existing and planned for
the military studies cirricula which are
likely to be deemed worthy of academic
credit and at the same time meet the needs
of the services. Additionally it is believed
that this proposed limitation on academic
credit for military studies will insure ROTC
students the flexibility to undertake their
other academic responsibilities without in
curring an undue overload.
Wherever possible, courses offered by other
departments of the University should be
substituted for military-taught courses,
thus further reducing the amount of degree
credit and student overload.
Student Contracts
Individual contracts between students and the
military departments shall be changed to clearly
reflect actual practices. Specifically any ROTC
student—either those on financial assistance or
associated on another contractual basis—must be
assured in writing that he may disenroll from
ROTC within the first two years of a four-year
program without prejudice or obligation.
Rationale: The practice has always been to
disenroll any ROTC student without pre
judice for future military service and with
out obligation during his first two years. In
no case has a student not receiving finan
cial assistance been denied disenrollment
without obligation at any time over four
years. The real nature of the agreement be
tween students in ROTC and the services is
a compact which the student may break
without obligation assuming he is acting in
good faith.
Changes in individual contracts will require
negotiations with the military services.
Such negotiations should be undertaken
immediately.
It should be noted that students may enroll
or audit military science courses without
joining ROTC. Those who are not certain
of their interest or choice may use this
means of securing increased information on
which to base their decision about ROTC.
University Contracts
Contractual agreements between Stanford
University and the military services should be al
tered to reflect the provisions of this proposed
program.
Rationale: Contracts are subject to renego
tiation on a yearly basis and either party
may terminate on a year's notice. If altered
relationships are agreed upon, the changes
in contracts and agreements must follow
immediately.
Retroactive Application
Loss of academic credit by students enrolled
in ROTC or change in faculty status of military
officers already appointed to the Stanford fac
ulty shall not be incurred as a result of the pro
visions of this recommendation. All other
changes shall be implemented as expeditiously as
possible.
Trial Period
The proposed program shall be undertaken for
a five-year trial period upon mutual agreement
between the military services and Stanford Uni
versity. At the end of the five-year trial period
there shall be a searching review of the success of
the proposed program.
Rationale: A five-year trial period was se
lected to permit evaluation of two com
plete cycles of the four-year program with
particular regard to the evaluation of stu
dents completing the program.
CONCLUSION
The foregoing recommendations are based up
on a particular view of the University and of the
appropriate relations between the military ser

vices and this University. We believe Stanford to
be, among other things, a pluralistic community
serving a number of important and worthwhile
functions, including liberal arts and preprofes
sional undergraduate education as well as grad
uate training in the arts and sciences and in the
professional fields. No one college or university
can or should attempt to serve every possible in
terest in all of these areas, but we hold that
ROTC has a long and honorable history as part
of the Stanford scene and that it fits within the
framework of what Stanford does well.
In our consideration of the place of ROTC at
Stanford, we accepted the premise that, given the
evident state of the world and this nation's re
sponsibilities in it, there will be for some time to
come a substantial need for military forces of
considerable size. Such a force will require the
very best leadership at all levels that the country
can provide. ROTC is a major source of that
leadership and will continue to be so for the fore
seeable future. The service academies and other
means of officer training, as presently consti
tuted, cannot possibly supply the need of over
30,000 new officers each year. The colleges and
universities are reasonable sources of young of
ficers, and ROTC has been for many years the
means of the cooperative effort between the mili
tary services and universities to provide these of
ficers.
We accept the view that the University has a
responsibility to serve the nation and society, for
the University benefits directly from its privi
leged place in that society. No single institution
can render every service, and each must, of its
own free choice, select those areas in which it
can serve effectively. The University cannot be
isolated from the pressing problems of our
society, nor should it be. One important set of
problems facing the country is that of foreign
and military policy. This has been so since the
establishment of the United States and it can be
assumed that it will continue to be so for some
time to come. Stanford and many other colleges
and universities have, over the years, cooperated
with the Federal Government and the military
services in the training of young officers; this is
one of the relevant major problem areas in which
this University has served.
We believe that much of the current anxiety
about and opposition to ROTC is rooted in the
profound disagreements with the conduct of our
policy in Southeast Asia and our involvement in
the Vietnam War. We urge, however, that ROTC
be judged in the context of the nation's history
and in the context of a reasonable estimate of
the future. The termination of the present war
will not end the need for adequate national se
curity forces and for the need to provide the
leadership for them. We believe that the nation's
colleges and universities, including Stanford Uni
versity, should participate in training the leader
ship for these security forces.
There is no doubt that accommodation of
ROTC on a university campus requires arrange
ments at variance with accepted and standard
academic policy and practice. As we have shown,
we do not argue for the status quo with respect
to the way in which ROTC is organized and ad
ministered and in the way in which it relates to
the academic structure of the University.
The presence of ROTC as an academic pro
gram offends some members of the faculty and
of the student body who hold that there should
be no pre-professional educational programs, at
least at the undergraduate level. Some faculty
members and students are concerned with the
presence of a program that has certain marked
external controls in contrast to the more typical
internally-regulated activities. Some conclude
that instruction by the military is inevitably anti
thetical to free intellectual inquiry. But in our
investigations and inquiries, we have found that
there are several other pre-professional academic
programs with an accepted place in the Stanford
scene. We have found that there are other activi
ties subject to various forms and degrees of exter
nal constraint. We have found no evidence that
military instruction inhibits the development of
the freely inquiring minds of those enrolled in
ROTC; indeed there is no evidence that the pres
ent system, with its admitted variations from
standard academic practice, is the least harmful
to the academic community or to anyone in it.
We do not hold that ROTC is essential to
Stanford University nor do we hold that Stan
ford University is essential to the military ser
vices. We do not claim that in the long run ROTC
is necessarily the ultimate means of preparing
college-educated officers for military service. But
for the present, it is the best means available to
the country and is likely to be so for the foresee
able future. In the meantime, ROTC provides im
portant advantages to the University and to its
students. The presence of ROTC provides our
students with the means of earning a commission
so that they may meet their military service obli
gations as officers. The ROTC programs provide
approximately $250,000 per year in student fin
ancial aid, bringing to the University a very able
student element including a number who other
wise might not be able to come to Stanford.
ROTC provides an opportunity to study in a
field that is certainly relevant to modern day
concerns and which would not otherwise be
available to the Stanford students.
Moreover, we have found the military services
to be not unmindful of trends in educational
thought and have undertaken serious steps to im
prove the quality and acceptability of ROTC pro
grams on college and university campuses. While
each service has varied in its approach to the sti
uation, they all have important elements in com
mon. Each has given its department chairmen
considerable flexibility to substitute courses in
other departments for military courses, to ar
range schedules to suit individual students, and
to negotiate with their institutions other aspects
of the ROTC programs. The Professor of Naval
Science is told, for example, that he "will func
tion as an academic department head in fact as
well as name . . . (and) is expected to structure a
program of studies for each Naval Science stu
dent that will satisfy the University's overall de
gree requirements."
In considering the manner in which ROTC
should be related to the academic structure of
the University, we took cognizance of these pres
ent and continuing efforts of the military services
to make ROTC more compatible with the desires
and procedures of the academic community.
What the minority members of the Committee
have recommended is fully compatible with the
trends in the services.
Since we hold that ROTC should continue at
Stanford University, we consider it essential that
it be integrated as closely as possible into the
regular academic structure. We believe that it
should be an academic program subject to nor
mal University controls and supervision. We con
sider this to be essential to the survival of ROTC
at Stanford.
We do not believe that ROTC could survive
with vitality and challenge, be useful to the ser
vices and worthy of the University's support, as a
non-credit "voluntary activity" program outside
the academic structure. We doubt that it would
be attractive to any significant number of high
quality students and we doubt that it would be
subject to adequate control by the University. As
we have said earlier in this paper, we reject this
proposal for we consider it tantamount to aboli
tion.

We have proposed a different solution, one
designed to bring an improved ROTC program
more into line with accepted standards of the
University. Separation from the academic struc
ture would, in our judgment, •ender ROTC inef
fective and unmanageable and eventually unac
ceptable to the military services. We take the
position that ROTC can and must be improved in
the interests of the nation, of Stanford Univer
sity and of Stanford students.

FINAL REPORT OF THE MINORITY
AD HOC SENATE COMMITTEE ON ROTC
FOREWORD
The undersigned members of the Senate ad
hoc Committee on ROTC submit the following
Minority Report with recommendations for the
improvement of ROTC at Stanford University.
This Minority Report is based upon the following
fundamental position.
For the foreseeable future, this nation will re
quire armed forces of considerable size, and will
require substantial numbers of well-educated and
well-trained officers to lead them. The ROTC
programs have been for many years the principal
means for providing such officers for the perman
ent forces or for reserve components. Participa
tion by such installations as Stanford University
in the ROTC programs, voluntary on the part of
the University and voluntary on the part of its
students, is therefore of considerable importance
to the nation. Moreover, maintenance of ROTC
programs on the campus provides a desirable op
portunity for those students who wish to earn a
military commission and thus meet their military
service obligations as commissioned officers.
In the proceedings of the Senate ad hoc Com
mittee on ROTC there has been no evidence pre
sented to show that ROTC programs are inimical
to the fundamental interests of Stanford Univer
sity or its students. On balance, it has been
shown that the availability of ROTC programs is
beneficial to the University, particularly in its
financial aid programs for students. If for these
reasons, the University concludes that it should
participate in ROTC, the University is obligated
to support ROTC in conditions that offer reason
able assurances of vitality and worth to its stu
dents, as well as to the military services.
It is the judgment of the minority members of
the Committee that ROTC cannot survive as an
extra-curricular activity separated from the aca
demic structure of the University. Indeed, we
consider that such separation is inconsistent with
a decision to continue ROTC at Stanford and
would be tantamount to abolition.
On the other hand, the minority members are
firmly convinced that a number of important im
provements should and can be made in ROTC to
meet the legitimate criticisms of its present form
and to place ROTC in an appropriate relationship
to the academic structure of the University.
The improvements we propose retain military
studies of worthy academic quality and proven
interest to substantial numbers of Stanford stu
dents as academic programs. Removal of these
studies from the curriculum would deprive Stan
ford students of existing opportunities for rele
vant academic inquiry without accompanying
benefit to any other constituency of the Univer
sity.
RECOMMENDA TIONS
The minority members of the Senate ad hoc
Committee on ROTC recommend:
1. That ROTC continue at Stanford Univer
sity;
2. That ROTC continue to be part of the aca
demic program of the University with specific
provision for a closer integration of ROTC into
its academic structure;
3. That ROTC programs be modified with re
spect to the organization and administration of
ROTC, the status of and appointment procedures
for its instructional staff, the curriculum, and the
contractual relationships between the military
services and the University and between the ser
vices and Stanford students.
4. That, to accomplish the above recommend
ations, the following program for ROTC be insti
tuted at Stanford.
AN IMPROVED ROTC PROGRAM FOR
STANFORD
The minority members reject the premise that
a substantive case for or against ROTC at Stan
ford has been established upon purely institu
tional considerations. Many subjective judgments
about the proper educational role of the Univer
sity are involved in such a premise. Many differ
ent opinions exist within the University about
what constitutes valid service to external con
cerns and interests. While it is possible to con
ceive that under certain circumstances the pres
ence of ROTC could be inimical to Stanford, we
do not find that presence, in actuality, to be a
threat to the integrity of the University. We do
find that over the years institutional relationships
for ROTC established by contract and law have
become archaic and in need of reform. Therefore
we have mainly responded to the charge of the
Senate of the Academic Council by proposing
reforms that will establish suitable relationships
for ROTC. We believe the program which we rec
ommend for ROTC at Stanford will, upon criti
cal evaluation, be found to amend those features
which the majority members considered most ob
jectionable in the present program.
Our position rests upon the belief that a point
by point comparison of the following program
and the objections raised to ROTC by the major
ity report will affirm that ROTC can be contin
ued at Stanford as a compatible and worthwhile
academic endeavor.

Departmental Structure
The Departments of Military Science, Naval
Science, and Aerospace Studies shall be com
bined into a Department of Military Studies. The
Chairmanship of this single department shall be
rotated among the heads of ROTC Units. A dis
tinction shall be made between the Department
of Military Studies and the ROTC Units. The De
partment of Military Studies shall be a part of
the academic structure of the University. The
ROTC Units shall be administrative agencies with
the function of serving students preparing for a
commission in the Armed Forces. The Units shall
administer scholarships and contracts, conduct
extra-curricular sessions, and advise students on
preparation for commissioning. The three units
of the Department of Military Studies shall re
ceive University administrative support as the
Provost may designate.
Rationale: The present arrangement of
three separate military science departments
results in an excessive administrative over
head and overrepresentation at councils of
departmental chairmen not warranted by
the size of these departments' instructional
staff or the variety of their course offer
ings. Different budgeting, personnel admin
istration, and reporting in the three mili
tary services, however, do require that each
ROTC Unit be administratively separate.
The ROTC Units will appropriately operate
at Stanford as administrative agencies of
the military services, and not as direct
sponsors for academic programs.
Organization of Military Studies Programs
A program of Military Science, of Naval Sci
ence, and of Aerospace Studies shall be offered
in the Stanford curriculum under the aegis of a
Military Studies Committee. The Committee
shall be appointed by the Senate and be com
posed of four Professors from the University at
large, the senior military officer from each ROTC
unit of the Department of Military Studies, and
four undergraduate students (two of whom will
be enrolled in ROTC and two from the univer
sity-at-large).
The Military Studies Committee shall deter
mine credit for courses offered by the Depart
ment of Military Studies, shall determine the cur
riculum for the Military Studies Programs, and
shall review the qualifications of military officers
recommended for appointment to instructional
positions. The military Studies Committee shall
be responsible to the Committee on Undergrad
uate Education. Proposed military science
courses which appropriately fall into the cate
gory of Undergraduate Specials shall be sub
mitted to the Committee on Undergraduate Edu
cation for approval. The Military Studies Pro
grams shall include these courses which are neces
sary to qualify students for a commission
through the ROTC programs, and are available
for students who wish to attain a background
knowledge of military art and science. The Pro
grams shall include accredited courses offered by
the Department of Military Studies, courses of
fered in other departments of the University, and
any approved military science Undergraduate
Specials.
Rationale: The determination of programs
of military study, review and of appoint
ments of military teachers and adjudication
of course credit by a Military Studies Com
mittee will fix responsibility for military
studies at the University in a manner more
consistent with institutional practices. The
military services, under this arrangement,
will assume more a role of an accrediting
body with respect to curriculum.
Other features of this proposal which seem
beneficial are: (1) the provision for contin
ual review and upgrading of military stud
ies programs, (2) the attractiveness to able
military officers, providing for appoint
ment of those officers who can make the
most substantial academic contributions to
the University, (3) the involvement of stu
dents and non-military faculty along with
military officers in determining the mili
tary studies to be undertaken, and (4) a
reduction of the sense of isolation of mili
tary teachers within the academic com
munity.
The extent of the nation's gross national
product that is allocated for defense and
the fact that warfare unhappily continues
adds relevancy to this field of academic
study. A fear that a militaristic view will
prevail is unfounded from the evidence this
committee has received, and in any event,
the military point of view can be leavened
by a standing committee which is plural
istic in perspective and reflects the values
of the University.
Academic Rank
The senior military officer of each unit of the
Department of Military Studies shall have the
rank and title of Professor of Military Science,
Naval Science, and Aerospace Studies, respec
tively, with the same perquisites which now per
tain to those positions.
All other military officers of the instructional
staff shall have the rank and title of Lecturer,
with the privileges and perquisites which now
pertain to that position.
In the event that officers who ordinarily
would be appointed Lecturer have unusual quali
fications, the Military Studies Committee may
recommend appointment as Assistant or Associ
ate Professor for the term of their anticipated
presence at Stanford.
Rationale: The rank of Professor for the
senior military officer appointed to each
ROTC unit is considered appropriate to his
experience, knowledge and responsibilities,
and is stipulated in present law.
This academic rank also attracts to ROTC
assignments better senior officers with
about twenty-four years of broad military
experience and education. Membership in
the Academic Council provides a means for
desirable involvement by the senior mili
tary officer in university affairs.
Since no direct correlation between mili
tary education and experience and regular
academic credentials exists it seems ap
propriate to make "Lecturer" the normal
appointment for more junior military of
ficers. This rank is consistent with that ac
corded well-qualified individuals from the
professions and the community who teach
courses at Stanford. However, when special
competence is available or found, a provis
ion for professorial appointment of these
officers is warranted.
Appointment Procedures
Those to be considered for appointment to
the rank of Professor shall go through the normal
review and appointment procedure, or as close to
that procedure as is possible. The following pro
cedure is proposed.
a. The Service concerned will submit a panel
of nominations, together with their creden
tials, to the President of the University.
The credentials will include:
(1) Personal resume.
(2) Educational record, including trans
cripts of academic work, service school
attendance, etc.
(3) Evidence of instructional and other
faculty-type experience.
b. The President will submit the nominations
to the Military Studies Committee for re

view and recommendation. It is intended
that the Committee for this purpose,
would function as a school or department
faculty "search committee." Regular Ad
visory Board recommendation forms will
be prepared as completely as possible.
c. The service concerned shall be prepared to
present at least the Committee's preferred
candidate for interview by the Committee
and the President (or his designated repre
sentative).
d. The Committee will then submit its recom
mended and preferred candidate to the
Provost for review at that level.
e. The Provost will submit the recommenda
tion to the Advisory Board for consider
ation. It is assumed that the Advisory
Board will review the cases in the light of
the special considerations in the same way
that it takes into account other appoint
ments in other professional fields.
112. Following Advisory Board action, the rec
ommendation will follow the usual course
to the Board of Trustees for final action.
For those to be considered for appointment as
Lecturers, the procedure shall be the same as for
professors, except that the recommendation need
not be submitted to the Advisory Board.
In the event that a junior officer is proposed
for an assistant or associate professor, the candi
date would be processed through the same chan
nel as are professors of military programs.
Rationale: The foregoing proposals provide
a procedure closely akin to the normal pro
cedure for faculty appointments. The ma
jor difference is of course the initial search
mechanism which is conducted through the
heads of ROTC units and their respective
military services. The minority members
considered the title of Visiting Professor
but rejected it on the basis that deviations
from the norm would be greater with this
title than under the procedures outlined.
Visiting professors are typically appointed
for one year, and have no administrative
responsibility. Senior military officer ap
pointments are usually for a period of
three years. Senior military officers are res
ponsible for direction of their programs as
well as representation to other elements of
the University.
Academic Credit
The courses of the Department of Military
Studies which are approved by the Military Stud
ies Committee shall be offered for degree credit.
Instruction desirable for potential military of
ficers but considered by the Military Studies
Committee to be of a narrow training scope shall
be conducted as extra-curricular sessions. Assum
ing that studies in military history and national
security affairs will, in the future, be available in
other departments, degree credit for courses of
fered by the Department of Military Studies shall
not exceed 18 quarter units or 12 semester units
or their equivalent in a four-year curriculum.
Rationale: The military science and studies
courses which meet University standards
should not be excluded arbitrarily from the

tion, have been generally acknowledged to

will not be sought for these and similar
courses. The proposed limitation on total
degree credit is not the result of a bargain
ing process resulting in a compromise limit.
Eighteen quarter units or 12 semester units
over a four-year period represents our judg
ment on courses existing and planned for
the military studies cirricula which are
likely to be deemed worthy of academic
credit and at the same time meet the needs
of the services. Additionally it is believed
that this proposed limitation on academic

other academic responsibilities without in
curring an undue overload.
Wherever possible, courses offered by other
departments of the University should be

Student Contracts
Individual contracts between students and the
military departments shall be changed to clearly
reflect actual practices. Specifically any ROTC

associated on another contractual basis—must be
assured in writing that he may disenroll from
ROTC within the first two years of a four-year

University Contracts
Contractual agreements between Stanford
University and the military services should be al
tered to reflect the provisions of this proposed
program.
Rationale: Contracts are subject to renego
tiation on a yearly basis and either party
may terminate on a year's notice. If altered
relationships are agreed upon, the changes
in contracts and agreements must follow
immediately.
Retroactive Application
Loss of academic credit by students enrolled
in ROTC or change in faculty status of military
officers already appointed to the Stanford fac
ulty shall not be incurred as a result of the pro
visions of this recommendation. All other
changes shall be implemented as expeditiously as

Trial Period
The proposed program shall be undertaken for
a five-year trial period upon mutual agreement

curity forces and for the need to provide the
leadership for them. We believe that the nation's
colleges and universities, including Stanford Uni
versity, should participate in training the leader
ship for these security forces.
There is no doubt that accommodation of
ROTC on a university campus requires arrange
ments at variance with accepted and standard
academic policy and practice. As we have shown,
we do not argue for the status quo with respect
to the way in which ROTC is organized and ad
ministered and in the way in which it relates to
the academic structure of the University.
The presence of ROTC as an academic pro
gram offends some members of the faculty and
of the student body who hold that there should
be no pre-professional educational programs, at
least at the undergraduate level. Some faculty
members and students are concerned with the
presence of a program that has certain marked
external controls in contrast to the more typical
internally-regulated activities. Some conclude
that instruction by the military is inevitably anti
thetical to free intellectual inquiry. But in our
investigations and inquiries, we have found that
there are several other pre-professional academic
programs with an accepted place in the Stanford
scene. We have found that there are other activi
ties subject to various forms and degrees of exter
nal constraint. We have found no evidence that
military instruction inhibits the development of
the freely inquiring minds of those enrolled in
ROTC; indeed there is no evidence that the pres
ent system, with its admitted variations from
standard academic practice, is the least harmful
to the academic community or to anyone in it.
We do not hold that ROTC is essential to
Stanford University nor do we hold that Stan
ford University is essential to the military ser
vices. We do not claim that in the long run ROTC
is necessarily the ultimate means of preparing
college-educated officers for military service. But
for the present, it is the best means available to
the country and is likely to be so for the foresee
able future. In the meantime, ROTC provides im
portant advantages to the University and to its
students. The presence of ROTC provides our
students with the means of earning a commission
so that they may meet their military service obli
gations as officers. The ROTC programs provide
approximately $250,000 per year in student fin
ancial aid, bringing to the University a very able
student element including a number who other
wise might not be able to come to Stanford.
ROTC provides an opportunity to study in a
field that is certainly relevant to modern day
concerns and which would not otherwise be
available to the Stanford students.
Moreover, we have found the military services
to be not unmindful of trends in educational
thought and have undertaken serious steps to im
prove the quality and acceptability of ROTC pro
grams on college and university campuses. While
each service has varied in its approach to the sti
uation, they all have important elements in com
mon. Each has given its department chairmen
considerable flexibility to substitute courses in
other departments for military courses, to ar
range schedules to suit individual students, and
to negotiate with their institutions other aspects
of the ROTC programs. The Professor of Naval
Science is told, for example, that he "will func
tion as an academic department head in fact as
well as name . . . (and) is expected to structure a
program of studies for each Naval Science stu
dent that will satisfy the University's overall de
gree requirements."
In considering the manner in which ROTC
should be related to the academic structure of
the University, we took cognizance of these pres
ent and continuing efforts of the military services
to make ROTC more compatible with the desires
and procedures of the academic community.
What the minority members of the Committee
have recommended is fully compatible with the
trends in the services.
Since we hold that ROTC should continue at
Stanford University, we consider it essential that
it be integrated as closely as possible into the
regular academic structure. We believe that it
should be an academic program subject to nor
mal University controls and supervision. We con
sider this to be essential to the survival of ROTC
at Stanford.
We do not believe that ROTC could survive
with vitality and challenge, be useful to the ser
vices and worthy of the University's support, as a
non-credit "voluntary activity" program outside
the academic structure. We doubt that it would
be attractive to any significant number of high
quality students and we doubt that it would be
subject to adequate control by the University. As
we have said earlier in this paper, we reject this
proposal for we consider it tantamount to aboli
tion.

We have proposed a different solution, one
designed to bring an improved ROTC program
more into line with accepted standards of the
University. Separation from the academic struc
ture would, in our judgment, •ender ROTC inef
fective and unmanageable and eventually unac
ceptable to the military services. We take the
position that ROTC can and must be improved in
the interests of the nation, of Stanford Univer
sity and of Stanford students.

FINAL REPORT OF THE MINORITY
AD HOC SENATE COMMITTEE ON ROTC
FOREWORD
The undersigned members of the Senate ad
hoc Committee on ROTC submit the following
Minority Report with recommendations for the
improvement of ROTC at Stanford University.
This Minority Report is based upon the following
fundamental position.
For the foreseeable future, this nation will re
quire armed forces of considerable size, and will
require substantial numbers of well-educated and
well-trained officers to lead them. The ROTC
programs have been for many years the principal
means for providing such officers for the perman
ent forces or for reserve components. Participa
tion by such installations as Stanford University
in the ROTC programs, voluntary on the part of
the University and voluntary on the part of its
students, is therefore of considerable importance
to the nation. Moreover, maintenance of ROTC
programs on the campus provides a desirable op
portunity for those students who wish to earn a
military commission and thus meet their military
service obligations as commissioned officers.
In the proceedings of the Senate ad hoc Com
mittee on ROTC there has been no evidence pre
sented to show that ROTC programs are inimical
to the fundamental interests of Stanford Univer
sity or its students. On balance, it has been
shown that the availability of ROTC programs is
beneficial to the University, particularly in its
financial aid programs for students. If for these
reasons, the University concludes that it should
participate in ROTC, the University is obligated
to support ROTC in conditions that offer reason
able assurances of vitality and worth to its stu
dents, as well as to the military services.
It is the judgment of the minority members of
the Committee that ROTC cannot survive as an
extra-curricular activity separated from the aca
demic structure of the University. Indeed, we
consider that such separation is inconsistent with
a decision to continue ROTC at Stanford and
would be tantamount to abolition.
On the other hand, the minority members are
firmly convinced that a number of important im
provements should and can be made in ROTC to
meet the legitimate criticisms of its present form
and to place ROTC in an appropriate relationship
to the academic structure of the University.
The improvements we propose retain military
studies of worthy academic quality and proven
interest to substantial numbers of Stanford stu
dents as academic programs. Removal of these
studies from the curriculum would deprive Stan
ford students of existing opportunities for rele
vant academic inquiry without accompanying
benefit to any other constituency of the Univer
sity.
RECOMMENDA TIONS
The minority members of the Senate ad hoc
Committee on ROTC recommend:
1. That ROTC continue at Stanford Univer
sity;
2. That ROTC continue to be part of the aca
demic program of the University with specific
provision for a closer integration of ROTC into
its academic structure;
3. That ROTC programs be modified with re
spect to the organization and administration of
ROTC, the status of and appointment procedures
for its instructional staff, the curriculum, and the
contractual relationships between the military
services and the University and between the ser
vices and Stanford students.
4. That, to accomplish the above recommend
ations, the following program for ROTC be insti
tuted at Stanford.
AN IMPROVED ROTC PROGRAM FOR
STANFORD
The minority members reject the premise that
a substantive case for or against ROTC at Stan
ford has been established upon purely institu
tional considerations. Many subjective judgments
about the proper educational role of the Univer
sity are involved in such a premise. Many differ
ent opinions exist within the University about
what constitutes valid service to external con
cerns and interests. While it is possible to con
ceive that under certain circumstances the pres
ence of ROTC could be inimical to Stanford, we
do not find that presence, in actuality, to be a
threat to the integrity of the University. We do
find that over the years institutional relationships
for ROTC established by contract and law have
become archaic and in need of reform. Therefore
we have mainly responded to the charge of the
Senate of the Academic Council by proposing
reforms that will establish suitable relationships
for ROTC. We believe the program which we rec
ommend for ROTC at Stanford will, upon criti
cal evaluation, be found to amend those features
which the majority members considered most ob
jectionable in the present program.
Our position rests upon the belief that a point
by point comparison of the following program
and the objections raised to ROTC by the major
ity report will affirm that ROTC can be contin
ued at Stanford as a compatible and worthwhile
academic endeavor.

Departmental Structure
The Departments of Military Science, Naval
Science, and Aerospace Studies shall be com
bined into a Department of Military Studies. The
Chairmanship of this single department shall be
rotated among the heads of ROTC Units. A dis
tinction shall be made between the Department
of Military Studies and the ROTC Units. The De
partment of Military Studies shall be a part of
the academic structure of the University. The
ROTC Units shall be administrative agencies with
the function of serving students preparing for a
commission in the Armed Forces. The Units shall
administer scholarships and contracts, conduct
extra-curricular sessions, and advise students on
preparation for commissioning. The three units
of the Department of Military Studies shall re
ceive University administrative support as the
Provost may designate.
Rationale: The present arrangement of
three separate military science departments
results in an excessive administrative over
head and overrepresentation at councils of
departmental chairmen not warranted by
the size of these departments' instructional
staff or the variety of their course offer
ings. Different budgeting, personnel admin
istration, and reporting in the three mili
tary services, however, do require that each
ROTC Unit be administratively separate.
The ROTC Units will appropriately operate
at Stanford as administrative agencies of
the military services, and not as direct
sponsors for academic programs.
Organization of Military Studies Programs
A program of Military Science, of Naval Sci
ence, and of Aerospace Studies shall be offered
in the Stanford curriculum under the aegis of a
Military Studies Committee. The Committee
shall be appointed by the Senate and be com
posed of four Professors from the University at
large, the senior military officer from each ROTC
unit of the Department of Military Studies, and
four undergraduate students (two of whom will
be enrolled in ROTC and two from the univer
sity-at-large).
The Military Studies Committee shall deter
mine credit for courses offered by the Depart
ment of Military Studies, shall determine the cur
riculum for the Military Studies Programs, and
shall review the qualifications of military officers
recommended for appointment to instructional
positions. The military Studies Committee shall
be responsible to the Committee on Undergrad
uate Education. Proposed military science
courses which appropriately fall into the cate
gory of Undergraduate Specials shall be sub
mitted to the Committee on Undergraduate Edu
cation for approval. The Military Studies Pro
grams shall include these courses which are neces
sary to qualify students for a commission
through the ROTC programs, and are available
for students who wish to attain a background
knowledge of military art and science. The Pro
grams shall include accredited courses offered by
the Department of Military Studies, courses of
fered in other departments of the University, and
any approved military science Undergraduate
Specials.
Rationale: The determination of programs
of military study, review and of appoint
ments of military teachers and adjudication
of course credit by a Military Studies Com
mittee will fix responsibility for military
studies at the University in a manner more
consistent with institutional practices. The
military services, under this arrangement,
will assume more a role of an accrediting
body with respect to curriculum.
Other features of this proposal which seem
beneficial are: (1) the provision for contin
ual review and upgrading of military stud
ies programs, (2) the attractiveness to able
military officers, providing for appoint
ment of those officers who can make the
most substantial academic contributions to
the University, (3) the involvement of stu
dents and non-military faculty along with
military officers in determining the mili
tary studies to be undertaken, and (4) a
reduction of the sense of isolation of mili
tary teachers within the academic com
munity.
The extent of the nation's gross national
product that is allocated for defense and
the fact that warfare unhappily continues
adds relevancy to this field of academic
study. A fear that a militaristic view will
prevail is unfounded from the evidence this
committee has received, and in any event,
the military point of view can be leavened
by a standing committee which is plural
istic in perspective and reflects the values
of the University.
Academic Rank
The senior military officer of each unit of the
Department of Military Studies shall have the
rank and title of Professor of Military Science,
Naval Science, and Aerospace Studies, respec
tively, with the same perquisites which now per
tain to those positions.
All other military officers of the instructional
staff shall have the rank and title of Lecturer,
with the privileges and perquisites which now
pertain to that position.
In the event that officers who ordinarily
would be appointed Lecturer have unusual quali
fications, the Military Studies Committee may
recommend appointment as Assistant or Associ
ate Professor for the term of their anticipated
presence at Stanford.
Rationale: The rank of Professor for the
senior military officer appointed to each
ROTC unit is considered appropriate to his
experience, knowledge and responsibilities,
and is stipulated in present law.
This academic rank also attracts to ROTC
assignments better senior officers with
about twenty-four years of broad military
experience and education. Membership in
the Academic Council provides a means for
desirable involvement by the senior mili
tary officer in university affairs.
Since no direct correlation between mili
tary education and experience and regular
academic credentials exists it seems ap
propriate to make "Lecturer" the normal
appointment for more junior military of
ficers. This rank is consistent with that ac
corded well-qualified individuals from the
professions and the community who teach
courses at Stanford. However, when special
competence is available or found, a provis
ion for professorial appointment of these
officers is warranted.
Appointment Procedures
Those to be considered for appointment to
the rank of Professor shall go through the normal
review and appointment procedure, or as close to
that procedure as is possible. The following pro
cedure is proposed.
a. The Service concerned will submit a panel
of nominations, together with their creden
tials, to the President of the University.
The credentials will include:
(1) Personal resume.
(2) Educational record, including trans
cripts of academic work, service school
attendance, etc.
(3) Evidence of instructional and other
faculty-type experience.
b. The President will submit the nominations
to the Military Studies Committee for re

view and recommendation. It is intended
that the Committee for this purpose,
would function as a school or department
faculty "search committee." Regular Ad
visory Board recommendation forms will
be prepared as completely as possible.
c. The service concerned shall be prepared to
present at least the Committee's preferred
candidate for interview by the Committee
and the President (or his designated repre
sentative).
d. The Committee will then submit its recom
mended and preferred candidate to the
Provost for review at that level.
e. The Provost will submit the recommenda
tion to the Advisory Board for consider
ation. It is assumed that the Advisory
Board will review the cases in the light of
the special considerations in the same way
that it takes into account other appoint
ments in other professional fields.
112. Following Advisory Board action, the rec
ommendation will follow the usual course
to the Board of Trustees for final action.
For those to be considered for appointment as
Lecturers, the procedure shall be the same as for
professors, except that the recommendation need
not be submitted to the Advisory Board.
In the event that a junior officer is proposed
for an assistant or associate professor, the candi
date would be processed through the same chan
nel as are professors of military programs.
Rationale: The foregoing proposals provide
a procedure closely akin to the normal pro
cedure for faculty appointments. The ma
jor difference is of course the initial search
mechanism which is conducted through the
heads of ROTC units and their respective
military services. The minority members
considered the title of Visiting Professor
but rejected it on the basis that deviations
from the norm would be greater with this
title than under the procedures outlined.
Visiting professors are typically appointed
for one year, and have no administrative
responsibility. Senior military officer ap
pointments are usually for a period of
three years. Senior military officers are res
ponsible for direction of their programs as
well as representation to other elements of
the University.
Academic Credit
The courses of the Department of Military
Studies which are approved by the Military Stud
ies Committee shall be offered for degree credit.
Instruction desirable for potential military of
ficers but considered by the Military Studies
Committee to be of a narrow training scope shall
be conducted as extra-curricular sessions. Assum
ing that studies in military history and national
security affairs will, in the future, be available in
other departments, degree credit for courses of
fered by the Department of Military Studies shall
not exceed 18 quarter units or 12 semester units
or their equivalent in a four-year curriculum.
Rationale: The military science and studies
courses which meet University standards
should not be excluded arbitrarily from the
curriculum or credit. The evidence before
this committee has indicated that most of
the courses offered in the military sciences
are equivalent in quality to those of other
departments. A few, such as Naval Orienta
tion, have been generally acknowledged to
be of a narrow training nature and credit
will not be sought for these and similar
courses. The proposed limitation on total
degree credit is not the result of a bargain
ing process resulting in a compromise limit.
Eighteen quarter units or 12 semester units
over a four-year period represents our judg
ment on courses existing and planned for
the military studies cirricula which are
likely to be deemed worthy of academic
credit and at the same time meet the needs
of the services. Additionally it is believed
that this proposed limitation on academic
credit for military studies will insure ROTC
students the flexibility to undertake their
other academic responsibilities without in
curring an undue overload.
Wherever possible, courses offered by other
departments of the University should be
substituted for military-taught courses,
thus further reducing the amount of degree
credit and student overload.
Student Contracts
Individual contracts between students and the
military departments shall be changed to clearly
reflect actual practices. Specifically any ROTC
student—either those on financial assistance or
associated on another contractual basis—must be
assured in writing that he may disenroll from
ROTC within the first two years of a four-year
program without prejudice or obligation.
Rationale: The practice has always been to
disenroll any ROTC student without pre
judice for future military service and with
out obligation during his first two years. In
no case has a student not receiving finan
cial assistance been denied disenrollment
without obligation at any time over four
years. The real nature of the agreement be
tween students in ROTC and the services is
a compact which the student may break
without obligation assuming he is acting in
good faith.
Changes in individual contracts will require
negotiations with the military services.
Such negotiations should be undertaken
immediately.
It should be noted that students may enroll
or audit military science courses without
joining ROTC. Those who are not certain
of their interest or choice may use this
means of securing increased information on
which to base their decision about ROTC.
University Contracts
Contractual agreements between Stanford
University and the military services should be al
tered to reflect the provisions of this proposed
program.
Rationale: Contracts are subject to renego
tiation on a yearly basis and either party
may terminate on a year's notice. If altered
relationships are agreed upon, the changes
in contracts and agreements must follow
immediately.
Retroactive Application
Loss of academic credit by students enrolled
in ROTC or change in faculty status of military
officers already appointed to the Stanford fac
ulty shall not be incurred as a result of the pro
visions of this recommendation. All other
changes shall be implemented as expeditiously as
possible.
Trial Period
The proposed program shall be undertaken for
a five-year trial period upon mutual agreement
between the military services and Stanford Uni
versity. At the end of the five-year trial period
there shall be a searching review of the success of
the proposed program.
Rationale: A five-year trial period was se
lected to permit evaluation of two com
plete cycles of the four-year program with
particular regard to the evaluation of stu
dents completing the program.
CONCLUSION
The foregoing recommendations are based up
on a particular view of the University and of the
appropriate relations between the military ser

vices and this University. We believe Stanford to
be, among other things, a pluralistic community
serving a number of important and worthwhile
functions, including liberal arts and preprofes
sional undergraduate education as well as grad
uate training in the arts and sciences and in the
professional fields. No one college or university
can or should attempt to serve every possible in
terest in all of these areas, but we hold that
ROTC has a long and honorable history as part
of the Stanford scene and that it fits within the
framework of what Stanford does well.
In our consideration of the place of ROTC at
Stanford, we accepted the premise that, given the
evident state of the world and this nation's re
sponsibilities in it, there will be for some time to
come a substantial need for military forces of
considerable size. Such a force will require the
very best leadership at all levels that the country
can provide. ROTC is a major source of that
leadership and will continue to be so for the fore
seeable future. The service academies and other
means of officer training, as presently consti
tuted, cannot possibly supply the need of over
30,000 new officers each year. The colleges and
universities are reasonable sources of young of
ficers, and ROTC has been for many years the
means of the cooperative effort between the mili
tary services and universities to provide these of
ficers.
We accept the view that the University has a
responsibility to serve the nation and society, for
the University benefits directly from its privi
leged place in that society. No single institution
can render every service, and each must, of its
own free choice, select those areas in which it
can serve effectively. The University cannot be
isolated from the pressing problems of our
society, nor should it be. One important set of
problems facing the country is that of foreign
and military policy. This has been so since the
establishment of the United States and it can be
assumed that it will continue to be so for some
time to come. Stanford and many other colleges
and universities have, over the years, cooperated
with the Federal Government and the military
services in the training of young officers; this is
one of the relevant major problem areas in which
this University has served.
We believe that much of the current anxiety
about and opposition to ROTC is rooted in the
profound disagreements with the conduct of our
policy in Southeast Asia and our involvement in
the Vietnam War. We urge, however, that ROTC
be judged in the context of the nation's history
and in the context of a reasonable estimate of
the future. The termination of the present war
will not end the need for adequate national se
curity forces and for the need to provide the
leadership for them. We believe that the nation's
colleges and universities, including Stanford Uni
versity, should participate in training the leader
ship for these security forces.
There is no doubt that accommodation of
ROTC on a university campus requires arrange
ments at variance with accepted and standard
academic policy and practice. As we have shown,
we do not argue for the status quo with respect
to the way in which ROTC is organized and ad
ministered and in the way in which it relates to
the academic structure of the University.
The presence of ROTC as an academic pro
gram offends some members of the faculty and
of the student body who hold that there should
be no pre-professional educational programs, at

sity are involved in such a premise. Many differ
ent opinions exist within the University about
what constitutes valid service to external con
cerns and interests. While it is possible to con
ceive that under certain circumstances the pres
ence of ROTC could be inimical to Stanford, we
do not find that presence, in actuality, to be a
threat to the integrity of the University. We do
find that over the years institutional relationships
for ROTC established by contract and law have
become archaic and in need of reform. Therefore
we have mainly responded to the charge of the
Senate of the Academic Council by proposing
reforms that will establish suitable relationships
for ROTC. We believe the program which we rec
ommend for ROTC at Stanford will, upon criti
cal evaluation, be found to amend those features
which the majority members considered most ob
jectionable in the present program.
Our position rests upon the belief that a point
by point comparison of the following program
and the objections raised to ROTC by the major
ity report will affirm that ROTC can be contin
ued at Stanford as a compatible and worthwhile
academic endeavor.

Departmental Structure
The Departments of Military Science, Naval
Science, and Aerospace Studies shall be com
bined into a Department of Military Studies. The
Chairmanship of this single department shall be
rotated among the heads of ROTC Units. A dis
tinction shall be made between the Department
of Military Studies and the ROTC Units. The De
partment of Military Studies shall be a part of
the academic structure of the University. The
ROTC Units shall be administrative agencies with
the function of serving students preparing for a
commission in the Armed Forces. The Units shall
administer scholarships and contracts, conduct
extra-curricular sessions, and advise students on
preparation for commissioning. The three units
of the Department of Military Studies shall re
ceive University administrative support as the
Provost may designate.
Rationale: The present arrangement of
three separate military science departments
results in an excessive administrative over
head and overrepresentation at councils of
departmental chairmen not warranted by
the size of these departments' instructional
staff or the variety of their course offer
ings. Different budgeting, personnel admin
istration, and reporting in the three mili
tary services, however, do require that each
ROTC Unit be administratively separate.
The ROTC Units will appropriately operate
at Stanford as administrative agencies of
the military services, and not as direct
sponsors for academic programs.
Organization of Military Studies Programs
A program of Military Science, of Naval Sci
ence, and of Aerospace Studies shall be offered
in the Stanford curriculum under the aegis of a
Military Studies Committee. The Committee
shall be appointed by the Senate and be com
posed of four Professors from the University at
large, the senior military officer from each ROTC
unit of the Department of Military Studies, and
four undergraduate students (two of whom will
be enrolled in ROTC and two from the univer
sity-at-large).
The Military Studies Committee shall deter
mine credit for courses offered by the Depart
ment of Military Studies, shall determine the cur
riculum for the Military Studies Programs, and
shall review the qualifications of military officers
recommended for appointment to instructional
positions. The military Studies Committee shall
be responsible to the Committee on Undergrad
uate Education. Proposed military science
courses which appropriately fall into the cate
gory of Undergraduate Specials shall be sub
mitted to the Committee on Undergraduate Edu
cation for approval. The Military Studies Pro
grams shall include these courses which are neces
sary to qualify students for a commission
through the ROTC programs, and are available
for students who wish to attain a background
knowledge of military art and science. The Pro
grams shall include accredited courses offered by
the Department of Military Studies, courses of
fered in other departments of the University, and
any approved military science Undergraduate
Specials.
Rationale: The determination of programs
of military study, review and of appoint
ments of military teachers and adjudication
of course credit by a Military Studies Com
mittee will fix responsibility for military
studies at the University in a manner more
consistent with institutional practices. The
military services, under this arrangement,
will assume more a role of an accrediting
body with respect to curriculum.
Other features of this proposal which seem
beneficial are: (1) the provision for contin
ual review and upgrading of military stud
ies programs, (2) the attractiveness to able
military officers, providing for appoint
ment of those officers who can make the
most substantial academic contributions to
the University, (3) the involvement of stu
dents and non-military faculty along with
military officers in determining the mili
tary studies to be undertaken, and (4) a
reduction of the sense of isolation of mili
tary teachers within the academic com
munity.
The extent of the nation's gross national
product that is allocated for defense and
the fact that warfare unhappily continues
adds relevancy to this field of academic
study. A fear that a militaristic view will
prevail is unfounded from the evidence this
committee has received, and in any event,
the military point of view can be leavened
by a standing committee which is plural
istic in perspective and reflects the values
of the University.
Academic Rank
The senior military officer of each unit of the
Department of Military Studies shall have the
rank and title of Professor of Military Science,
Naval Science, and Aerospace Studies, respec
tively, with the same perquisites which now per
tain to those positions.
All other military officers of the instructional
staff shall have the rank and title of Lecturer,
with the privileges and perquisites which now
pertain to that position.
In the event that officers who ordinarily
would be appointed Lecturer have unusual quali
fications, the Military Studies Committee may
recommend appointment as Assistant or Associ
ate Professor for the term of their anticipated
presence at Stanford.
Rationale: The rank of Professor for the
senior military officer appointed to each
ROTC unit is considered appropriate to his
experience, knowledge and responsibilities,
and is stipulated in present law.
This academic rank also attracts to ROTC
assignments better senior officers with
about twenty-four years of broad military
experience and education. Membership in
the Academic Council provides a means for
desirable involvement by the senior mili
tary officer in university affairs.
Since no direct correlation between mili
tary education and experience and regular
academic credentials exists it seems ap
propriate to make "Lecturer" the normal
appointment for more junior military of
ficers. This rank is consistent with that ac
corded well-qualified individuals from the
professions and the community who teach
courses at Stanford. However, when special
competence is available or found, a provis
ion for professorial appointment of these
officers is warranted.
Appointment Procedures
Those to be considered for appointment to
the rank of Professor shall go through the normal
review and appointment procedure, or as close to
that procedure as is possible. The following pro
cedure is proposed.
a. The Service concerned will submit a panel
of nominations, together with their creden
tials, to the President of the University.
The credentials will include:
(1) Personal resume.
(2) Educational record, including trans
cripts of academic work, service school
attendance, etc.
(3) Evidence of instructional and other
faculty-type experience.
b. The President will submit the nominations
to the Military Studies Committee for re

view and recommendation. It is intended
that the Committee for this purpose,
would function as a school or department
faculty "search committee." Regular Ad
visory Board recommendation forms will
be prepared as completely as possible.
c. The service concerned shall be prepared to
present at least the Committee's preferred
candidate for interview by the Committee
and the President (or his designated repre
sentative).
d. The Committee will then submit its recom
mended and preferred candidate to the
Provost for review at that level.
e. The Provost will submit the recommenda
tion to the Advisory Board for consider
ation. It is assumed that the Advisory
Board will review the cases in the light of
the special considerations in the same way
that it takes into account other appoint
ments in other professional fields.
112. Following Advisory Board action, the rec
ommendation will follow the usual course
to the Board of Trustees for final action.
For those to be considered for appointment as
Lecturers, the procedure shall be the same as for
professors, except that the recommendation need
not be submitted to the Advisory Board.
In the event that a junior officer is proposed
for an assistant or associate professor, the candi
date would be processed through the same chan
nel as are professors of military programs.
Rationale: The foregoing proposals provide
a procedure closely akin to the normal pro
cedure for faculty appointments. The ma
jor difference is of course the initial search
mechanism which is conducted through the
heads of ROTC units and their respective
military services. The minority members
considered the title of Visiting Professor
but rejected it on the basis that deviations
from the norm would be greater with this
title than under the procedures outlined.
Visiting professors are typically appointed
for one year, and have no administrative
responsibility. Senior military officer ap
pointments are usually for a period of
three years. Senior military officers are res
ponsible for direction of their programs as
well as representation to other elements of
the University.
Academic Credit
The courses of the Department of Military
Studies which are approved by the Military Stud
ies Committee shall be offered for degree credit.
Instruction desirable for potential military of
ficers but considered by the Military Studies
Committee to be of a narrow training scope shall
be conducted as extra-curricular sessions. Assum
ing that studies in military history and national
security affairs will, in the future, be available in
other departments, degree credit for courses of
fered by the Department of Military Studies shall
not exceed 18 quarter units or 12 semester units
or their equivalent in a four-year curriculum.
Rationale: The military science and studies
courses which meet University standards
should not be excluded arbitrarily from the
curriculum or credit. The evidence before
this committee has indicated that most of
the courses offered in the military sciences
are equivalent in quality to those of other
departments. A few, such as Naval Orienta
tion, have been generally acknowledged to
be of a narrow training nature and credit
will not be sought for these and similar
courses. The proposed limitation on total
degree credit is not the result of a bargain
ing process resulting in a compromise limit.
Eighteen quarter units or 12 semester units
over a four-year period represents our judg
ment on courses existing and planned for
the military studies cirricula which are
likely to be deemed worthy of academic
credit and at the same time meet the needs
of the services. Additionally it is believed
that this proposed limitation on academic
credit for military studies will insure ROTC
students the flexibility to undertake their
other academic responsibilities without in
curring an undue overload.
Wherever possible, courses offered by other
departments of the University should be
substituted for military-taught courses,
thus further reducing the amount of degree
credit and student overload.
Student Contracts
Individual contracts between students and the
military departments shall be changed to clearly
reflect actual practices. Specifically any ROTC
student—either those on financial assistance or
associated on another contractual basis—must be
assured in writing that he may disenroll from
ROTC within the first two years of a four-year
program without prejudice or obligation.
Rationale: The practice has always been to
disenroll any ROTC student without pre
judice for future military service and with
out obligation during his first two years. In
no case has a student not receiving finan
cial assistance been denied disenrollment
without obligation at any time over four
years. The real nature of the agreement be
tween students in ROTC and the services is
a compact which the student may break
without obligation assuming he is acting in
good faith.
Changes in individual contracts will require
negotiations with the military services.
Such negotiations should be undertaken
immediately.
It should be noted that students may enroll
or audit military science courses without
joining ROTC. Those who are not certain
of their interest or choice may use this
means of securing increased information on
which to base their decision about ROTC.
University Contracts
Contractual agreements between Stanford
University and the military services should be al
tered to reflect the provisions of this proposed
program.
Rationale: Contracts are subject to renego
tiation on a yearly basis and either party
may terminate on a year's notice. If altered
relationships are agreed upon, the changes
in contracts and agreements must follow
immediately.
Retroactive Application
Loss of academic credit by students enrolled
in ROTC or change in faculty status of military
officers already appointed to the Stanford fac
ulty shall not be incurred as a result of the pro
visions of this recommendation. All other
changes shall be implemented as expeditiously as
possible.
Trial Period
The proposed program shall be undertaken for
a five-year trial period upon mutual agreement
between the military services and Stanford Uni
versity. At the end of the five-year trial period
there shall be a searching review of the success of
the proposed program.
Rationale: A five-year trial period was se
lected to permit evaluation of two com
plete cycles of the four-year program with
particular regard to the evaluation of stu
dents completing the program.
CONCLUSION
The foregoing recommendations are based up
on a particular view of the University and of the
appropriate relations between the military ser

vices and this University. We believe Stanford to
be, among other things, a pluralistic community
serving a number of important and worthwhile
functions, including liberal arts and preprofes
sional undergraduate education as well as grad
uate training in the arts and sciences and in the
professional fields. No one college or university
can or should attempt to serve every possible in
terest in all of these areas, but we hold that
ROTC has a long and honorable history as part
of the Stanford scene and that it fits within the
framework of what Stanford does well.
In our consideration of the place of ROTC at
Stanford, we accepted the premise that, given the
evident state of the world and this nation's re
sponsibilities in it, there will be for some time to
come a substantial need for military forces of
considerable size. Such a force will require the
very best leadership at all levels that the country
can provide. ROTC is a major source of that
leadership and will continue to be so for the fore
seeable future. The service academies and other
means of officer training, as presently consti
tuted, cannot possibly supply the need of over
30,000 new officers each year. The colleges and
universities are reasonable sources of young of
ficers, and ROTC has been for many years the
means of the cooperative effort between the mili
tary services and universities to provide these of
ficers.
We accept the view that the University has a
responsibility to serve the nation and society, for
the University benefits directly from its privi
leged place in that society. No single institution
can render every service, and each must, of its
own free choice, select those areas in which it
can serve effectively. The University cannot be
isolated from the pressing problems of our
society, nor should it be. One important set of
problems facing the country is that of foreign
and military policy. This has been so since the
establishment of the United States and it can be
assumed that it will continue to be so for some
time to come. Stanford and many other colleges
and universities have, over the years, cooperated
with the Federal Government and the military
services in the training of young officers; this is
one of the relevant major problem areas in which
this University has served.
We believe that much of the current anxiety
about and opposition to ROTC is rooted in the
profound disagreements with the conduct of our
policy in Southeast Asia and our involvement in
the Vietnam War. We urge, however, that ROTC
be judged in the context of the nation's history
and in the context of a reasonable estimate of
the future. The termination of the present war
will not end the need for adequate national se
curity forces and for the need to provide the
leadership for them. We believe that the nation's
colleges and universities, including Stanford Uni
versity, should participate in training the leader
ship for these security forces.
There is no doubt that accommodation of
ROTC on a university campus requires arrange
ments at variance with accepted and standard
academic policy and practice. As we have shown,
we do not argue for the status quo with respect
to the way in which ROTC is organized and ad
ministered and in the way in which it relates to
the academic structure of the University.
The presence of ROTC as an academic pro
gram offends some members of the faculty and
of the student body who hold that there should
be no pre-professional educational programs, at
least at the undergraduate level. Some faculty
members and students are concerned with the
presence of a program that has certain marked
external controls in contrast to the more typical
internally-regulated activities. Some conclude
that instruction by the military is inevitably anti
thetical to free intellectual inquiry. But in our
investigations and inquiries, we have found that
there are several other pre-professional academic
programs with an accepted place in the Stanford
scene. We have found that there are other activi
ties subject to various forms and degrees of exter
nal constraint. We have found no evidence that
military instruction inhibits the development of
the freely inquiring minds of those enrolled in
ROTC; indeed there is no evidence that the pres
ent system, with its admitted variations from
standard academic practice, is the least harmful
to the academic community or to anyone in it.
We do not hold that ROTC is essential to
Stanford University nor do we hold that Stan
ford University is essential to the military ser
vices. We do not claim that in the long run ROTC
is necessarily the ultimate means of preparing
college-educated officers for military service. But
for the present, it is the best means available to
the country and is likely to be so for the foresee
able future. In the meantime, ROTC provides im
portant advantages to the University and to its
students. The presence of ROTC provides our
students with the means of earning a commission
so that they may meet their military service obli
gations as officers. The ROTC programs provide
approximately $250,000 per year in student fin
ancial aid, bringing to the University a very able
student element including a number who other
wise might not be able to come to Stanford.
ROTC provides an opportunity to study in a
field that is certainly relevant to modern day
concerns and which would not otherwise be
available to the Stanford students.
Moreover, we have found the military services
to be not unmindful of trends in educational
thought and have undertaken serious steps to im
prove the quality and acceptability of ROTC pro
grams on college and university campuses. While
each service has varied in its approach to the sti
uation, they all have important elements in com
mon. Each has given its department chairmen
considerable flexibility to substitute courses in
other departments for military courses, to ar
range schedules to suit individual students, and
to negotiate with their institutions other aspects
of the ROTC programs. The Professor of Naval
Science is told, for example, that he "will func
tion as an academic department head in fact as
well as name . . . (and) is expected to structure a
program of studies for each Naval Science stu
dent that will satisfy the University's overall de
gree requirements."
In considering the manner in which ROTC
should be related to the academic structure of
the University, we took cognizance of these pres
ent and continuing efforts of the military services
to make ROTC more compatible with the desires
and procedures of the academic community.
What the minority members of the Committee
have recommended is fully compatible with the
trends in the services.
Since we hold that ROTC should continue at
Stanford University, we consider it essential that
it be integrated as closely as possible into the
regular academic structure. We believe that it
should be an academic program subject to nor
mal University controls and supervision. We con
sider this to be essential to the survival of ROTC
at Stanford.
We do not believe that ROTC could survive
with vitality and challenge, be useful to the ser
vices and worthy of the University's support, as a
non-credit "voluntary activity" program outside
the academic structure. We doubt that it would
be attractive to any significant number of high
quality students and we doubt that it would be
subject to adequate control by the University. As
we have said earlier in this paper, we reject this
proposal for we consider it tantamount to aboli
tion.

We have proposed a different solution, one
designed to bring an improved ROTC program
more into line with accepted standards of the
University. Separation from the academic struc
ture would, in our judgment, •ender ROTC inef
fective and unmanageable and eventually unac
ceptable to the military services. We take the
position that ROTC can and must be improved in
the interests of the nation, of Stanford Univer
sity and of Stanford students.

FINAL REPORT OF THE MINORITY
AD HOC SENATE COMMITTEE ON ROTC
FOREWORD
The undersigned members of the Senate ad
hoc Committee on ROTC submit the following
Minority Report with recommendations for the
improvement of ROTC at Stanford University.
This Minority Report is based upon the following
fundamental position.
For the foreseeable future, this nation will re
quire armed forces of considerable size, and will
require substantial numbers of well-educated and
well-trained officers to lead them. The ROTC
programs have been for many years the principal
means for providing such officers for the perman
ent forces or for reserve components. Participa
tion by such installations as Stanford University
in the ROTC programs, voluntary on the part of
the University and voluntary on the part of its
students, is therefore of considerable importance
to the nation. Moreover, maintenance of ROTC
programs on the campus provides a desirable op
portunity for those students who wish to earn a
military commission and thus meet their military
service obligations as commissioned officers.
In the proceedings of the Senate ad hoc Com
mittee on ROTC there has been no evidence pre
sented to show that ROTC programs are inimical
to the fundamental interests of Stanford Univer
sity or its students. On balance, it has been
shown that the availability of ROTC programs is
beneficial to the University, particularly in its
financial aid programs for students. If for these
reasons, the University concludes that it should
participate in ROTC, the University is obligated
to support ROTC in conditions that offer reason
able assurances of vitality and worth to its stu
dents, as well as to the military services.
It is the judgment of the minority members of
the Committee that ROTC cannot survive as an
extra-curricular activity separated from the aca
demic structure of the University. Indeed, we
consider that such separation is inconsistent with
a decision to continue ROTC at Stanford and
would be tantamount to abolition.
On the other hand, the minority members are
firmly convinced that a number of important im
provements should and can be made in ROTC to
meet the legitimate criticisms of its present form
and to place ROTC in an appropriate relationship
to the academic structure of the University.
The improvements we propose retain military
studies of worthy academic quality and proven
interest to substantial numbers of Stanford stu
dents as academic programs. Removal of these
studies from the curriculum would deprive Stan
ford students of existing opportunities for rele
vant academic inquiry without accompanying
benefit to any other constituency of the Univer
sity.
RECOMMENDA TIONS
The minority members of the Senate ad hoc
Committee on ROTC recommend:
1. That ROTC continue at Stanford Univer
sity;
2. That ROTC continue to be part of the aca
demic program of the University with specific
provision for a closer integration of ROTC into
its academic structure;
3. That ROTC programs be modified with re
spect to the organization and administration of
ROTC, the status of and appointment procedures
for its instructional staff, the curriculum, and the
contractual relationships between the military
services and the University and between the ser
vices and Stanford students.
4. That, to accomplish the above recommend
ations, the following program for ROTC be insti
tuted at Stanford.
AN IMPROVED ROTC PROGRAM FOR
STANFORD
The minority members reject the premise that
a substantive case for or against ROTC at Stan
ford has been established upon purely institu
tional considerations. Many subjective judgments
about the proper educational role of the Univer
sity are involved in such a premise. Many differ
ent opinions exist within the University about
what constitutes valid service to external con
cerns and interests. While it is possible to con
ceive that under certain circumstances the pres
ence of ROTC could be inimical to Stanford, we
do not find that presence, in actuality, to be a
threat to the integrity of the University. We do
find that over the years institutional relationships
for ROTC established by contract and law have
become archaic and in need of reform. Therefore
we have mainly responded to the charge of the
Senate of the Academic Council by proposing
reforms that will establish suitable relationships
for ROTC. We believe the program which we rec
ommend for ROTC at Stanford will, upon criti
cal evaluation, be found to amend those features
which the majority members considered most ob
jectionable in the present program.
Our position rests upon the belief that a point
by point comparison of the following program
and the objections raised to ROTC by the major

academic endeavor.

a procedure closely akin to the normal pro
cedure for faculty appointments. The ma
jor difference is of course the initial search
mechanism which is conducted through the
heads of ROTC units and their respective
military services. The minority members
considered the title of Visiting Professor
but rejected it on the basis that deviations
from the norm would be greater with this
title than under the procedures outlined.
Visiting professors are typically appointed
for one year, and have no administrative
responsibility. Senior military officer ap
pointments are usually for a period of
three years. Senior military officers are res
ponsible for direction of their programs as
well as representation to other elements of
the University.
Academic Credit
The courses of the Department of Military
Studies which are approved by the Military Stud
ies Committee shall be offered for degree credit.
Instruction desirable for potential military of
ficers but considered by the Military Studies
Committee to be of a narrow training scope shall
be conducted as extra-curricular sessions. Assum
ing that studies in military history and national
security affairs will, in the future, be available in
other departments, degree credit for courses of
fered by the Department of Military Studies shall
not exceed 18 quarter units or 12 semester units
or their equivalent in a four-year curriculum.
Rationale: The military science and studies
courses which meet University standards
should not be excluded arbitrarily from the
curriculum or credit. The evidence before
this committee has indicated that most of
the courses offered in the military sciences
are equivalent in quality to those of other
departments. A few, such as Naval Orienta
tion, have been generally acknowledged to
be of a narrow training nature and credit
will not be sought for these and similar
courses. The proposed limitation on total
degree credit is not the result of a bargain
ing process resulting in a compromise limit.
Eighteen quarter units or 12 semester units
over a four-year period represents our judg
ment on courses existing and planned for
the military studies cirricula which are
likely to be deemed worthy of academic
credit and at the same time meet the needs
of the services. Additionally it is believed
that this proposed limitation on academic
credit for military studies will insure ROTC
students the flexibility to undertake their
other academic responsibilities without in
curring an undue overload.
Wherever possible, courses offered by other
departments of the University should be
substituted for military-taught courses,
thus further reducing the amount of degree
credit and student overload.
Student Contracts
Individual contracts between students and the
military departments shall be changed to clearly
reflect actual practices. Specifically any ROTC
student—either those on financial assistance or
associated on another contractual basis—must be
assured in writing that he may disenroll from
ROTC within the first two years of a four-year
program without prejudice or obligation.
Rationale: The practice has always been to
disenroll any ROTC student without pre
judice for future military service and with
out obligation during his first two years. In
no case has a student not receiving finan
cial assistance been denied disenrollment
without obligation at any time over four
years. The real nature of the agreement be
tween students in ROTC and the services is
a compact which the student may break
without obligation assuming he is acting in
good faith.
Changes in individual contracts will require
negotiations with the military services.
Such negotiations should be undertaken
immediately.
It should be noted that students may enroll
or audit military science courses without
joining ROTC. Those who are not certain
of their interest or choice may use this
means of securing increased information on
which to base their decision about ROTC.
University Contracts
Contractual agreements between Stanford
University and the military services should be al
tered to reflect the provisions of this proposed
program.
Rationale: Contracts are subject to renego
tiation on a yearly basis and either party
may terminate on a year's notice. If altered
relationships are agreed upon, the changes
in contracts and agreements must follow
immediately.
Retroactive Application
Loss of academic credit by students enrolled
in ROTC or change in faculty status of military
officers already appointed to the Stanford fac
ulty shall not be incurred as a result of the pro
visions of this recommendation. All other
changes shall be implemented as expeditiously as
possible.
Trial Period
The proposed program shall be undertaken for
a five-year trial period upon mutual agreement
between the military services and Stanford Uni
versity. At the end of the five-year trial period
there shall be a searching review of the success of
the proposed program.
Rationale: A five-year trial period was se
lected to permit evaluation of two com
plete cycles of the four-year program with
particular regard to the evaluation of stu
dents completing the program.
CONCLUSION
The foregoing recommendations are based up
on a particular view of the University and of the
appropriate relations between the military ser

vices and this University. We believe Stanford to
be, among other things, a pluralistic community
serving a number of important and worthwhile
functions, including liberal arts and preprofes
sional undergraduate education as well as grad
uate training in the arts and sciences and in the
professional fields. No one college or university
can or should attempt to serve every possible in
terest in all of these areas, but we hold that
ROTC has a long and honorable history as part
of the Stanford scene and that it fits within the
framework of what Stanford does well.
In our consideration of the place of ROTC at
Stanford, we accepted the premise that, given the
evident state of the world and this nation's re
sponsibilities in it, there will be for some time to
come a substantial need for military forces of
considerable size. Such a force will require the
very best leadership at all levels that the country
can provide. ROTC is a major source of that
leadership and will continue to be so for the fore
seeable future. The service academies and other
means of officer training, as presently consti
tuted, cannot possibly supply the need of over
30,000 new officers each year. The colleges and
universities are reasonable sources of young of
ficers, and ROTC has been for many years the
means of the cooperative effort between the mili
tary services and universities to provide these of
ficers.
We accept the view that the University has a
responsibility to serve the nation and society, for
the University benefits directly from its privi
leged place in that society. No single institution
can render every service, and each must, of its
own free choice, select those areas in which it
can serve effectively. The University cannot be
isolated from the pressing problems of our
society, nor should it be. One important set of
problems facing the country is that of foreign
and military policy. This has been so since the
establishment of the United States and it can be
assumed that it will continue to be so for some
time to come. Stanford and many other colleges
and universities have, over the years, cooperated
with the Federal Government and the military
services in the training of young officers; this is
one of the relevant major problem areas in which
this University has served.
We believe that much of the current anxiety
about and opposition to ROTC is rooted in the
profound disagreements with the conduct of our
policy in Southeast Asia and our involvement in
the Vietnam War. We urge, however, that ROTC
be judged in the context of the nation's history
and in the context of a reasonable estimate of
the future. The termination of the present war
will not end the need for adequate national se
curity forces and for the need to provide the
leadership for them. We believe that the nation's
colleges and universities, including Stanford Uni
versity, should participate in training the leader
ship for these security forces.
There is no doubt that accommodation of
ROTC on a university campus requires arrange
ments at variance with accepted and standard
academic policy and practice. As we have shown,
we do not argue for the status quo with respect
to the way in which ROTC is organized and ad
ministered and in the way in which it relates to
the academic structure of the University.
The presence of ROTC as an academic pro
gram offends some members of the faculty and
of the student body who hold that there should
be no pre-professional educational programs, at
least at the undergraduate level. Some faculty
members and students are concerned with the
presence of a program that has certain marked
external controls in contrast to the more typical
internally-regulated activities. Some conclude
that instruction by the military is inevitably anti
thetical to free intellectual inquiry. But in our
investigations and inquiries, we have found that
there are several other pre-professional academic
programs with an accepted place in the Stanford
scene. We have found that there are other activi
ties subject to various forms and degrees of exter
nal constraint. We have found no evidence that
military instruction inhibits the development of
the freely inquiring minds of those enrolled in
ROTC; indeed there is no evidence that the pres
ent system, with its admitted variations from
standard academic practice, is the least harmful
to the academic community or to anyone in it.
We do not hold that ROTC is essential to
Stanford University nor do we hold that Stan
ford University is essential to the military ser
vices. We do not claim that in the long run ROTC
is necessarily the ultimate means of preparing
college-educated officers for military service. But
for the present, it is the best means available to
the country and is likely to be so for the foresee
able future. In the meantime, ROTC provides im
portant advantages to the University and to its
students. The presence of ROTC provides our
students with the means of earning a commission
so that they may meet their military service obli
gations as officers. The ROTC programs provide
approximately $250,000 per year in student fin
ancial aid, bringing to the University a very able
student element including a number who other
wise might not be able to come to Stanford.
ROTC provides an opportunity to study in a
field that is certainly relevant to modern day
concerns and which would not otherwise be
available to the Stanford students.
Moreover, we have found the military services
to be not unmindful of trends in educational
thought and have undertaken serious steps to im
prove the quality and acceptability of ROTC pro
grams on college and university campuses. While
each service has varied in its approach to the sti
uation, they all have important elements in com
mon. Each has given its department chairmen
considerable flexibility to substitute courses in
other departments for military courses, to ar
range schedules to suit individual students, and
to negotiate with their institutions other aspects
of the ROTC programs. The Professor of Naval
Science is told, for example, that he "will func
tion as an academic department head in fact as
well as name . . . (and) is expected to structure a
program of studies for each Naval Science stu
dent that will satisfy the University's overall de
gree requirements."
In considering the manner in which ROTC
should be related to the academic structure of
the University, we took cognizance of these pres
ent and continuing efforts of the military services
to make ROTC more compatible with the desires
and procedures of the academic community.
What the minority members of the Committee
have recommended is fully compatible with the
trends in the services.
Since we hold that ROTC should continue at
Stanford University, we consider it essential that
it be integrated as closely as possible into the
regular academic structure. We believe that it
should be an academic program subject to nor
mal University controls and supervision. We con
sider this to be essential to the survival of ROTC
at Stanford.
We do not believe that ROTC could survive
with vitality and challenge, be useful to the ser
vices and worthy of the University's support, as a
non-credit "voluntary activity" program outside
the academic structure. We doubt that it would
be attractive to any significant number of high
quality students and we doubt that it would be
subject to adequate control by the University. As
we have said earlier in this paper, we reject this
proposal for we consider it tantamount to aboli
tion.

We have proposed a different solution, one
designed to bring an improved ROTC program
more into line with accepted standards of the
University. Separation from the academic struc
ture would, in our judgment, •ender ROTC inef
fective and unmanageable and eventually unac
ceptable to the military services. We take the
position that ROTC can and must be improved in
the interests of the nation, of Stanford Univer
sity and of Stanford students.
