Trends in ROTC—lnstitutional Relations at
Selected Colleges and Universities
I. The East
Columbia (Navy)
A 1966-67 review resulted in a reduction in the
amount of academic credit for Naval Science
courses from 21 "points" to 9, out of a total of
126 required for the degree. Naval Science work
in the sophomore year has been eliminated; "rote
work" has been shifted to three summer cruises,
where only one cruise was previously required.
The Department of the Navy has given the Col
umbia Professor of Naval Science considerable
flexibility to adapt to the changing requirements
of Columbia College.
Cornell University (Army, Air Force, Navy)
A faculty-student commission has recently com
pleted a review of the status of ROTC
recommending retention subject to important
changes in the next three years. Specifically rec
ommended: courses with substantial political or
policy content required of ROTC students
should be taught in regular academic depart
ments by regular faculty; the services should
make greater use of the University's resources
with respect to scientific and technical training;
no credit be given for courses offered solely by
the military departments; all drill, indoctrination
and training in military skills should be either
extra-curricular or confined to summer camps or
cruises; there should be improvements in ap
pointment procedures of military officers and
the title professor should be confined to the sen
ior officer for each service; provision for Univer
sity supervision of ROTC should be strength
ened. In addition to other minor recommenda
tions, the Commission recommended that
Cornell join with other Universities and develop a
set of new proposals for ROTC and officer pro
curement to the Department of Defense. The
Commission also recommended that if substan
tial changes in ROTC "are not forthcoming with
in three years, the University seek other means of
meeting the provision of the Morrill Act and its
Charter."
The faculty of the College of Arts and Sciences
voted in favor of this report.
Dartmouth (Army, Air Force, Navy)
Dartmouth considerations have been very similar
to those at Cornell. A Dartmouth committee has
recommended reduction of degree credit to two
courses, cooperation with other institutions to
work out new methods of recruitment of college
graduates, limitation of faculty status to the sen
ior officer of each service, improved supervision
by the college. All of these are good for only
three years; if no action by the services to change
or improve, everything should be moved to sum
mer camps or cruises. These recommendations
were approved by the Dartmouth Faculty Jan
uary 30, 1969.
Harvard (Army, Air Force, Navy)
No response has been made to inquiries, but a
newspaper report of December 13, 1968 indica
ted that the SDS broke up a faculty meeting as
sembled to debate the status of ROTC. More re
cent newspaper accounts indicate that the Har
vard faculty has abolished academic status for
ROTC.
Pennsylvania (Army, Navy)
The faculty of the College has recommended that
no credit be given for courses taught by military
personnel. Other changes are pending.
Princeton (Army, Air Force, Navy)
A faculty committee is at work on the status of
ROTC. The following are indications of the trend
of thought as reported by the committee's secre
tary.
Recognizing the need for college trained officers,
the committee is searching for a "more approp
riate relationship." ROTC courses will not count
for credit in the future. Faculty status will be
limited to the senior officer or "Lecturer with
the rank of Professor." ROTC programs will
probably lose departmental status.
Yale (Army, Navy)
On January 30, the faculty of Yale Colleges
voted that ROTC should be given "extra-curricu
lar status without academic credit." Command
ing officers should be "designated by a title indi
cating that they do not have the academic auth
ority usually associated with a professorship."
The Dean of Yale College has indicated that Pres
ident Brewster and the Fellows are likely to
accept this recommendation.
11. The Mid-West
Michigan (Army, Air Force, Navy)
There is at present "no great or urgent push" for
complete abolition of credit, although it if came
to a vote, there probably would be reduction.
Faculty rank is considered "honorary." A com
mittee has been appointed to look into the status
of ROTC, and is considering the same question
as are other institutions.
Northwestern (Navy)
A committee has just been appointed to "con
sider the role of the NROTC in the College."
111. The West
California-Berkeley (Army, Air Force, Navy)
According to the Vice Chancellor for Academic
Affairs, it is not likely that "in the present cli
mate" the Regents will approve any change in
the academic credit and faculty status provisions.
There are, underway, reviews of courses and ef
forts to improve faculty selection to make ROTC
"more respectable and acceptable." A substantial
interest among faculty and students on the
ROTC question seems to have died away, al
though the Yale action may stir it up again.
Pomona (Army)
The College Policy Review Council has recom
mended that ROTC be continued, but that no
credit be given for military science courses (al
though a student's transcript should "list" such
courses). With respect to faculty status, the
Council recommended that the senior military
officer be given the status of "any other tempor
ary appointment," but that no professorial rank
be given to junior officers.
Southern California (Army, Air Force, Navy)
"We are to date pleased with our association with
the ROTC programs and have no plans at present
for altering this association." (1/29/69)

voted that ROTC should be given "extra-curricu
lar status without academic credit." Command
ing officers should be "designated by a title indi
cating that they do not have the academic auth
ority usually associated with a professorship."
The Dean of Yale College has indicated that Pres
ident Brewster and the Fellows are likely to
accept this recommendation.
11. The Mid-West
Michigan (Army, Air Force, Navy)
There is at present "no great or urgent push" for
complete abolition of credit, although it if came
to a vote, there probably would be reduction.
Faculty rank is considered "honorary." A com
mittee has been appointed to look into the status
of ROTC, and is considering the same question
as are other institutions.
Northwestern (Navy)
A committee has just been appointed to "con
sider the role of the NROTC in the College."
111. The West
California-Berkeley (Army, Air Force, Navy)
According to the Vice Chancellor for Academic
Affairs, it is not likely that "in the present cli
mate" the Regents will approve any change in
the academic credit and faculty status provisions.
There are, underway, reviews of courses and ef
forts to improve faculty selection to make ROTC
"more respectable and acceptable." A substantial
interest among faculty and students on the
ROTC question seems to have died away, al
though the Yale action may stir it up again.
Pomona (Army)
The College Policy Review Council has recom
mended that ROTC be continued, but that no
credit be given for military science courses (al
though a student's transcript should "list" such
courses). With respect to faculty status, the
Council recommended that the senior military
officer be given the status of "any other tempor
ary appointment," but that no professorial rank
be given to junior officers.

Trends in ROTC—lnstitutional Relations at
Selected Colleges and Universities
I. The East
Columbia (Navy)
A 1966-67 review resulted in a reduction in the
amount of academic credit for Naval Science
courses from 21 "points" to 9, out of a total of
126 required for the degree. Naval Science work
in the sophomore year has been eliminated; "rote
work" has been shifted to three summer cruises,
where only one cruise was previously required.
The Department of the Navy has given the Col
umbia Professor of Naval Science considerable
flexibility to adapt to the changing requirements
of Columbia College.
Cornell University (Army, Air Force, Navy)
A faculty-student commission has recently com
pleted a review of the status of ROTC
recommending retention subject to important
changes in the next three years. Specifically rec
ommended: courses with substantial political or
policy content required of ROTC students
should be taught in regular academic depart
ments by regular faculty; the services should
make greater use of the University's resources
with respect to scientific and technical training;
no credit be given for courses offered solely by
the military departments; all drill, indoctrination
and training in military skills should be either
extra-curricular or confined to summer camps or
cruises; there should be improvements in ap
pointment procedures of military officers and
the title professor should be confined to the sen
ior officer for each service; provision for Univer
sity supervision of ROTC should be strength
ened. In addition to other minor recommenda
tions, the Commission recommended that
Cornell join with other Universities and develop a
set of new proposals for ROTC and officer pro
curement to the Department of Defense. The
Commission also recommended that if substan
tial changes in ROTC "are not forthcoming with
in three years, the University seek other means of
meeting the provision of the Morrill Act and its
Charter."
The faculty of the College of Arts and Sciences
voted in favor of this report.
Dartmouth (Army, Air Force, Navy)
Dartmouth considerations have been very similar
to those at Cornell. A Dartmouth committee has
recommended reduction of degree credit to two
courses, cooperation with other institutions to
work out new methods of recruitment of college
graduates, limitation of faculty status to the sen
ior officer of each service, improved supervision
by the college. All of these are good for only
three years; if no action by the services to change
or improve, everything should be moved to sum
mer camps or cruises. These recommendations
were approved by the Dartmouth Faculty Jan
uary 30, 1969.
Harvard (Army, Air Force, Navy)
No response has been made to inquiries, but a
newspaper report of December 13, 1968 indica
ted that the SDS broke up a faculty meeting as
sembled to debate the status of ROTC. More re
cent newspaper accounts indicate that the Har
vard faculty has abolished academic status for
ROTC.
Pennsylvania (Army, Navy)
The faculty of the College has recommended that
no credit be given for courses taught by military
personnel. Other changes are pending.
Princeton (Army, Air Force, Navy)
A faculty committee is at work on the status of

Recognizing the need for college trained officers,
the committee is searching for a "more approp

limited to the senior officer or "Lecturer with
the rank of Professor." ROTC programs will

sity supervision of ROTC should be strength
ened. In addition to other minor recommenda
tions, the Commission recommended that
Cornell join with other Universities and develop a
set of new proposals for ROTC and officer pro
curement to the Department of Defense. The
Commission also recommended that if substan
tial changes in ROTC "are not forthcoming with
in three years, the University seek other means of
meeting the provision of the Morrill Act and its
Charter."
The faculty of the College of Arts and Sciences
voted in favor of this report.
Dartmouth (Army, Air Force, Navy)
Dartmouth considerations have been very similar
to those at Cornell. A Dartmouth committee has
recommended reduction of degree credit to two
courses, cooperation with other institutions to
work out new methods of recruitment of college
graduates, limitation of faculty status to the sen
ior officer of each service, improved supervision
by the college. All of these are good for only
three years; if no action by the services to change
or improve, everything should be moved to sum
mer camps or cruises. These recommendations
were approved by the Dartmouth Faculty Jan
uary 30, 1969.
Harvard (Army, Air Force, Navy)
No response has been made to inquiries, but a
newspaper report of December 13, 1968 indica
ted that the SDS broke up a faculty meeting as
sembled to debate the status of ROTC. More re
cent newspaper accounts indicate that the Har
vard faculty has abolished academic status for
ROTC.
Pennsylvania (Army, Navy)
The faculty of the College has recommended that
no credit be given for courses taught by military
personnel. Other changes are pending.
Princeton (Army, Air Force, Navy)
A faculty committee is at work on the status of
ROTC. The following are indications of the trend
of thought as reported by the committee's secre
tary.
Recognizing the need for college trained officers,
the committee is searching for a "more approp
riate relationship." ROTC courses will not count
for credit in the future. Faculty status will be
limited to the senior officer or "Lecturer with
the rank of Professor." ROTC programs will
probably lose departmental status.
Yale (Army, Navy)
On January 30, the faculty of Yale Colleges
voted that ROTC should be given "extra-curricu
lar status without academic credit." Command
ing officers should be "designated by a title indi
cating that they do not have the academic auth
ority usually associated with a professorship."
The Dean of Yale College has indicated that Pres
ident Brewster and the Fellows are likely to
accept this recommendation.
11. The Mid-West
Michigan (Army, Air Force, Navy)
There is at present "no great or urgent push" for
complete abolition of credit, although it if came
to a vote, there probably would be reduction.
Faculty rank is considered "honorary." A com
mittee has been appointed to look into the status
of ROTC, and is considering the same question
as are other institutions.
Northwestern (Navy)
A committee has just been appointed to "con
sider the role of the NROTC in the College."
111. The West
California-Berkeley (Army, Air Force, Navy)
According to the Vice Chancellor for Academic
Affairs, it is not likely that "in the present cli
mate" the Regents will approve any change in
the academic credit and faculty status provisions.
There are, underway, reviews of courses and ef
forts to improve faculty selection to make ROTC
"more respectable and acceptable." A substantial
interest among faculty and students on the
ROTC question seems to have died away, al
though the Yale action may stir it up again.
Pomona (Army)
The College Policy Review Council has recom
mended that ROTC be continued, but that no
credit be given for military science courses (al
though a student's transcript should "list" such
courses). With respect to faculty status, the
Council recommended that the senior military
officer be given the status of "any other tempor
ary appointment," but that no professorial rank
be given to junior officers.
Southern California (Army, Air Force, Navy)
"We are to date pleased with our association with
the ROTC programs and have no plans at present
for altering this association." (1/29/69)
Washington (Army, Air Force, Navy)
Under review.

Trends in ROTC—lnstitutional Relations at
Selected Colleges and Universities
I. The East
Columbia (Navy)
A 1966-67 review resulted in a reduction in the
amount of academic credit for Naval Science
courses from 21 "points" to 9, out of a total of
126 required for the degree. Naval Science work
in the sophomore year has been eliminated; "rote
work" has been shifted to three summer cruises,
where only one cruise was previously required.
The Department of the Navy has given the Col
umbia Professor of Naval Science considerable
flexibility to adapt to the changing requirements
of Columbia College.
Cornell University (Army, Air Force, Navy)
A faculty-student commission has recently com
pleted a review of the status of ROTC
recommending retention subject to important
changes in the next three years. Specifically rec
ommended: courses with substantial political or
policy content required of ROTC students
should be taught in regular academic depart
ments by regular faculty; the services should
make greater use of the University's resources
with respect to scientific and technical training;
no credit be given for courses offered solely by
the military departments; all drill, indoctrination
and training in military skills should be either
extra-curricular or confined to summer camps or
cruises; there should be improvements in ap
pointment procedures of military officers and
the title professor should be confined to the sen
ior officer for each service; provision for Univer
sity supervision of ROTC should be strength
ened. In addition to other minor recommenda
