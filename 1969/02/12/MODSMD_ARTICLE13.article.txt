# SES Amendment
## 
### 
The General Studies Commit
tee adopted at their Jan. 22 meet
ing an amendment to the pro
posal, arguing that certain "skill
courses" such as languages, calcu
lus, and others should not be
counted toward fulfilling the re
quirement that students take two
courses in each of humanities,
social sciences, and sciences.
The amendment was opposed
by the three student members of
the Committee in a minority re
port to the Academic Senate, call
ing the amendment "a reverse
general studies requirement."
Professor Lorie Tarshis of eco
monics, who proposed the amend
ment, said Monday that he "saw
many ways a student without
good advising could fulfill the re
quirement, without being exposed
to the substance of the humani
ties, social sciences, or sciences."
Barbara Levin, one of the stu
dents, countered, saying that the
amendment would eo against the

purpose of SES and "legislate a
general education" for a future.
The minority report points out
that the distinction between "skill
courses" and "theory courses"
seems "to oppose the develop
ment of a more cohesive view of
general educaitonâ€”a view inherent
in SES."
Another criticism of the Com
mittee's proposed amendment is
that it will set up a bureaucracy to
process the waivers, changes, and
variances. Tarshis, however, felt
the "administrative rigamaroll"
would be averted because the Uni
versity would be "excluding only
a very few courses." Professor
Bradley Efron, statistics, who was
not at the meeting has also ex
pressed his dissent in a letter to
the committee.
The Committee proposal and
the minority report will be trans
mitted to the Academic Senate
for consideration with the SES
recommendations.
