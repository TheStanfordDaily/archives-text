# Joanna: A Grotesque Exploitation Of 60's
## 
### 
I have no strong quarrels with
Joanna as thoroughly modern
movie entertainment, but I think
this film reveals to the extreme the
danger of the trend in movies over
the past few years. Recently, with
the breakdown of the studio
system and the increase of inde
pendent production, film direc
tors have gained a greater amount
of control over their projects,
which has generally been a good
thing. In Joanna, however, 29
year-old Michael Same's first fea
ture, the words director, Director,
DIRECTOR are written all over
the film and an upsetting balance
of importance is felt throughout.
All the fashionable touches are
there; the ocean-side romance out
of A Man and a Woman, the soft
focus strolls in the country from
Elvira Madigan, the sleep-around
for-success attitude of Darling and
the flashy, mod look of dozens of
recent films. Same, in a sense, has
combined everything that has
been hailed as "dazzling direc
tion" and over-used it. Thus, the
excesses of this film raise some
doubt as to whether many ad
vances have indeed been made re
cently. If a tyro like Same can do
it, can then anyone slap some
fancy shots together and then be
hailed by Time as "the most daz
zling directorial debut of the
year?"
The picture is " '60's" through
and through. True to fashion,
there isn't a story line per se but
what there is of one naturally
takes place in swinging London,
where nobody has inhibitions
about nothing, nobody, nohow.
Though no one seems to have a
job, responsibility or care in the
world, all the characters are able
to buy the fanciest clothes, live in
the plushest apartments and ship
off to the Riviera at any time. But
when the heroine's boyfriend is
beaten up by some mugs, she
simply calls back home for "of
ficial" help.
This lack of care and oblivion
to reality typifies the tone of the
whole movie, one of assured ever
lasting irresponsibility. Indeed, an
awareness of the film's lack of
conscience may have come over
the filmakers toward the end of
the shooting, for the cameraman,
lights and the whole crew are in
cluded in the action toward the
end. The picture is then capped
by a Rockettes-style dance num
ber performed by the entire cast
in a railroad station. Doubtless,
this routine is to clue the audience
in on the fact that it's all been a
clever joke but the last minutes of
the movie is a bit late to apologize
for what's come before.
A few traces of talent are able
to appear (fleetingly) between the
splices. Donald Sutherland is in
itially appaling yet ultimately very
touching as a dying sophisticate
and is the only actor who manages
to convey any emotion in an oth
erwise apparently unfeeling slice
of society. Glenna Forster-Jones is
also striking as a black swinger

who shop lifts the best the bou
tiques have to offer. And though
at times unbelievable, a black
white romantic entanglement is
carried on with no comment and
all honesty, which is rare, despite
what the Stanley Kramer-oriented
liberals say.
Joanna is strictly a grotesque
exploitation of the 1960'5, its
fashions and philosophies. I only
hope that this film is not placed in
a time capsule by some misguided
well-doer, only to be opened years
hence and be considered represen
tative of the state of film art in
our time. Joanna makes a pre
tence of art but comes off only as
"pop" corn.
