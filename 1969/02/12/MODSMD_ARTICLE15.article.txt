# Keyes Praises Gov. Reagan's Efforts To End Discrimination

### SHERI COOPER 
According to Robert J. Keyes,
Governor Reagan's Special Assis
tant for Community Relations,
the Governor has personally hired
about 80 blacks and between 60
and 70 Mexican-Americans but he
doesn't "want to publicize it".
Speaking before a crowd of
about 50 mostly middle-aged
people Monday night in Tresidder,
Keyes defended the present ad
ministration by citing several ex
isting programs designed to aid
underprivileged Californians,
especially those of minority
groups. He was sponsored by the
Young Republicans.
"The purpose of our 'creative
society' is to form a partnership
with the industry to combat the
problems facing the poor and the
state of California," Keyes stated.
"Though education is the most
important ingredient for bettering
the poor," he admitted, "available
jobs would solve a lot of the exist
ing problem."
According to Keyes, under
privileged children receive seven
tenths of a year instruction per
year of school attendance, while
middle-class children receive one
year of instruction for each year
of attendance. Thus, by the third
grade underprivileged children are
already one year behind, and by
the eighth grade they are two
years behind.
Welfare, he maintained, is only
a temporary expedient which will
be retained only as long as neces
sary to regain the citizen's "sense
of dignity".
Keyes briefly outlined such
programs as "Focus" and
"When", whose purpose is to train
the underprivileged and, hope
fully, to close "the welfare gap".
The emphasis is on motivating
welfare recipients to work and on

rewarding them by supplementing
their wages (which are often less
than their welfare stipends) with a
"bonus".
Last summer some 400,000
youths applied for jobs, some
125,000 of them from under
privileged minorities. "We were
able to obtain jobs for over
160,000 of the applicants," Keyes
boasted.
When prompted to comment
on his recent non-political tour of
the state with Governor Reagan,
Keyes said they discovered that
the civil service examinations are
geared to high school graduates.
They are thus discriminating
against many blacks and Mexican-
Americans who are not given
sufficient education in the course
of their public schooling. This
problem has been referred to a

committee for possible legislation.
"We also discovered the
minorities want quality education,
not bussing," he added.
Keyes, alter winning national
football honors for his per
formance in junior college, went
on to play ball for the San Fran
cisco 49'ers and the Oakland
Raiders.
