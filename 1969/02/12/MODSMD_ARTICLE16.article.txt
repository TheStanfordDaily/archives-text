The Stanford Repertory
Theater will open its second pro
duction of the season, Ugo Betti's
tense contemporary drama, "The
Queen and the Rebels," at 8 p.m.
Wednesday in Memorial Hall. The
play will continue Wednesdays
through Saturdays until Mar. 1.
In this, the Italian dramatist's
final play, a prostitute is caught
up in the violence of a postwar
revolution in Eastern Europe and
is mistaken for the fleeing Queen.
Deserted by the man she loves,
she gradually finds within her own
self the courage, nobility, and in
tegrity to equal her role.
Betti is considered by many to
be Italy's greatest playwright since
Pirandello. He was a high court
judge during the Fascist regime
and the years following Musso
lini's death, and his works reflect
a tremendous questioning, per
haps guilt on his part, as to the
meaning of justice.
Betti's themes were often
Christian-oriented. In "The Queen
and the Rebels," Argia, the prosti
tute struggles against her past to
find dignity in the face of martyr
dom.
Betti died in 1953 but it was

not until two years after his death
that his last plays were produced.
In 1955, the British Broadcasting
Company commissioned Henry
Reed to translate three of them,
"The Queen and the Rebels,"
on the surface, is an exciting ad
venture story. For some, it may
be only an intriguing, yet ironic,
combination of the tales of Ana
stasia and Anouilh's Antigone.
But Director Morgan is trying
to <iay more and the set design by
Richard L. Hay may help him.
Says Morgan, "One of the first
things I said to Dick was that be
sides wanting the set to be an en
vironment for the play, I also
wanted it to be a forum for dis
cussion."
Appearing in the leading role
of Argia is Randi Douglas. Also
appearing in pivotal roles are
Charles Edelman, Sally Kemp,
Roger Kozol, Stephen D. New
man, Gene Parseghian, and Kurt
wood Smith.

Tickets to Friday and Saturday
evening performances are $2. Call
