# Pitching Strong
## Stanford Nine Splits 
### DAN BERNSTEIN 
The University of San Fran
cisco (USF) scored two runs in
the top of the fourteenth inning,
and then held off a short-lived
Stanford rally to gain a 3-2 vic
tory over the Indians at the
sunken diamond last Saturday.
They made up for it Monday,
however, by nipping the Phila
delphia Rookies, 2-1.
In what was supposed to be the
first game of a doubleheader,
Stanford, plagued by frozen bats
and shoddy fielding, gave the con
test away, thus spoiling the bril
liant pitching performances
turned in by Rod Poteete and
Steve Dunning.
Poteete started the clash and
hurled four innings, giving up one
unearned run on one hit. The run
came in the third inning on a
single by USF's Joe Gregory.
Pitcher Mike Delagnes' sacrifice
moved him all the way to third,
and Gregory continued to circle
the bases as first baseman Mark
Marquess' errant throw sailed out
of bounds.
USF held that lead until the
bottom of the seventh, when the
Indian bats finally showed some
signs of life. Jack Lynn opened

the inning with a single, and
Chuck Hoffmeister came in to run
for him. With one out, Hoff
meister stole second, and scored
moments later when Hank Snider
smashed a pinch-hit double all the
way to the right-field fence.
Steve Dunning had replaced
Poteete in the fifth inning, and
USF called upon Dana Honder
shott to bail it out of the seventh,
and until the fourteenth stanza,
the two relievers hooked up in a
scoreless pitching duel.
Dunning fired nine innings of
scoreless ball for the Indians,
giving up only four hits and
striking out 5, before being taken
out of the game after the
thirteenth.
While USF could muster no
formidable threat against Dunn
ing, the Indians threatened in the
tenth, when Russ Tweet drew a
walk and Bob Boone's single
moved him to third base with one
out. After an unsuccessful
squeeze-play attempt, Tweet was
picked off at third.
Jack Hodges then reached base
safely on a fielder's choice,
moving Boone to second.
When Hoffmeister was safe on
an error, Stanford had the bases

loaded with two men out. But the
Indian bats cooled, and Honder
shott got Don Shellenberg on
strikes.
Joe Gregory started the USF
fourteenth with an infield hit off
losing pitcher, Ben Burch, and was
sacrificed to second by Honder
shott. First baseman Bill Garcia
was safe on Tweet's error at short
stop, and there were men on first
and third with one out.
Larry Jones laid down a per
fectly placed bunt between third
base and the mound, scoring
Gregory and moving Garcia to
second. Garcia and Jones at
tempted a double-steal. Jones
made it but Garcia didn't. The
winning run was scored on
Tweet's second error of the
inning—a low throw to first on Pete
Barry's grounder-allowing Jones
to score all the way from second.
Trailing 3-1 in the bottom of
the fourteenth, the Indians tried
to battle back, but fell one run
short. With one man out Mike
Ammirato was safe on an error.
Mark Marquess, who went hitless
in six trips, gounded into what ap
peared to be a game-ending
double play. But the throw to
first was wild, and the Indians had
another life with Marquess moving
to second with two out.
Tweet, in partial redemption
for his erratic fielding, lined a
run-scoring single, bringing the
Indians to a 3-2 deficit. Bob
Boone made the score official
when his deep fly was snared in
left field.
Darkness prevented the second
game from going further than 2
innings, and that game will be re
scheduled for a loture date. The
Stanford pitching showed en
couraging signs despite the loss,
but untimely errors and a punch
less offense -one that left four
teen men stranded in Saturday's
game—can't win games for the
best of pitchers.
In Monday's action, the
Indians overcame their fielding
difficulties and beat the Phila
delphia Rookies, 2-1. Bob
Marshall got the win for hurling
the final three innings. Stanford's
Jim Coate started and gave up two
hits and an unearned run in three
frames. Bob Boone threw a per
fect three in the middle innings.
Boone also knocked in the
Cards' first run in the seventh,
with a single. In the eighth, Jack
Hodges came around to score the
winning tally on the strength of
Dick Borchers' double down the
left field line.
Tweet and Marquess played
errorless ball, and the infield
turned in three DP's to kill any
Phillie rally.
