# Pac 8 Stats Show Cagers In Cellar
## 
### 
After a dismal weekend in the
freezing state of Oregon, the Stan
ford Indians returned home as the
last place basketball team in the
Pacific Eight.
The Tribe slipped to 1-6 with
their one point loss to Oregon
State, and a two point defeat at
the hands of Oregon. The statis
tics tell the story.
In team offense in the Pac 8,
Stanford ranks seventh, ahead of
only OSU. In team defense, the
Cards are sixth. UCLA, 6-0 in
league, and 18-0 on the season,
are the conference leaders in the
offensive category, but are only
fourth in team defense. Washing
ton has allowed only 58 points a
game, and are rated first.
Field goal percentage finds The
Bruins on top with 53 per cent,
and Stanford in the doldrums of
seventh, shooting 39 per cent.
The telling tale for Coach
Howie Dallmar's team has been
free throws. This weekend they
slipped from fourth to seventh
place, now hitting only 60.3 from
the line.
The freshman team however is
enjoying a fine year. They are 6-4,

even though they dropped a
103-86 game to the mighty Santa
Clara frosh last weekend. The
young Broncos are 13-0, and their
center, Mike Stewart is averaging
over 27 points a game. The third
ranked Broncos will be tough for
years to come.
