# Faculty Club Incident
## First Disruption Hearing Held 
### 
By MARSHALL KILDUFF
The first hearings dealing with the al
leged Students for a Democratic Society
(SDS) disruption of the Jan. 12 meeting
of the Board of Trustees at the Faculty
Club provided only more questions and
fewer answers.
The nine member Stanford Judicial
Council (SJC) has yet to begin consider
ing the charges brought against the 27
students and instead was forced last
night to contend with lengthy examina
tions of a number of witnesses.
The first session of a two-part hear
ing opened with council chairman Prof.
Jack Friedenthal announcing that the
proceedings were to find out "what oc
curred —what each student did in con
nection with this alleged disruption."
He stated that roughly 27 students were
involved.
The hearings immediately bogged
down in disputes between the defend
ants and Friedenthal over the SJC's jur
isdiction. Steve Smith pointed out that
Prof. Robert Sprouse had worked with
SRI at one time; Smith felt this was a
clear conflict of interest since part of
the motivation for the alleged dis
ruption was SDS's opposition to SRI de
fense work.

The first witness was Chuck Painter,
a photographer for the University News
and Publication Service. He was shown a
stack of photographs taken at the Fac
ulty Club during the alleged disturbance
and said that he had taken them.
In taking the pictures he said "I fol
lowed the action; anyone that's present
on the scene." He mentioned that that
included "demonstrators or anyone else
that's there. The pictures were taken
purely at random except that people in
the News Service would tell me, 'You
better go over there.' "
LASSU Speaker
The next witness was Yale Braun
stein, speaker of LASSU, who had
spoken to the Board of Trustees shortly
before the alleged disruption took place.
He said that Associate Dean of Students
Willard Wyman refused to convey the
request of the defendants that the
Board meeting be opened, and so he
went himself to ask.
The Trustees listened to him, and
then asked him a sharp series of ques
tions "about who I was, and who did I
represent . . . They were an antagonistic
bunch of bastards . . . They were trying
to push the whole thing out of their
minds." The Board then decided not to

admit the students.
"Ethical Codes"
Daily News Editor Craig Wilson was
asked to testify as to what he saw while
reporting the incident. However, he re
fused to testify "on the grounds that a
journalist has ethical codes and confid
ences that he can not violate." Frieden
thal maintained that there were no
grounds for this kind of position, but he
dismissed Wilson anyway.
The Council then asked biology pro
fessor Donald Kennedy to describe what
he saw inside the Faculty Club. He re
called Bill Wyman coming out and de
claring "this demonstration or whatever
you call it was in violation of the dem
onstration ordinance." Once when the
door to the Trustees' dining room
opened, "Mr. Glover (Assistant to Presi
dent Kenneth Pitzer) popped very sud
denly out into the hallway and fell on
his back . . . Mr. Siegel tried to catch
him as he fell."
Kennedy identified defendant Fred
Cohen as being in the Faculty Club and
"he was shouting, but a lot of other
people were shouting too." He said that
he heard Wyman threatened verbally at
least twice.
Cohen then charged, "It's clear that

it's necessary to get information from
the administration." He asked Kennedy
if he learned the defendants' names on
his own or had administration officials
told him. Kennedy said, "In each case
the initiative was mine."
Prof. Eugene Yearian then testified
to what he witnessed. He identified
"James Johnson kicking the door and
Rick Bogart standing around on the per
iphery." When he asked if he thought
the defendants wanted to end the Trus
tees' meeting he admitted, "It's difficult
to answer; I am not quite sure that I
heard it ... I can only judge by their
actions which were clearly disruptive."
After the students entered the Trus
tees' dining room, "a student dashed by
me and picked up a folder. Eventually
he gave the documents back, but only
after another student yelled, 'It's all
right; we've got another one.' " Yearian
identified the person as Cohen, and the
student promptly denied it.
The most pointed questions of the
evening were asked of the Board of
Trustee member and former professor
Dean Watkins. He said that during lunch
the Trustees "were told the meeting
room in Bowman (Alumni House) was
occupied by students . . . we might as
well hold our meeting in the Faculty
Club ... At some point I became aware
that students were milling around in the
courtyard and hallway while we at
tempted to carry on our business."
"Someone came in the room and
asked us if we considered that the meet
ing was being disrupted . . . The answer
was given that yes, we did, and we went
ahead with the regular agenda." Watkins
mentioned, "It was not an atmosphere
conducive to constructive thought."
As the Daily went to press, the meet
ing had not adjourned. Wyman, Dean of
Students Joel P. Smith, and Director of
the News Service Bob Beyers had not
yet testified.
