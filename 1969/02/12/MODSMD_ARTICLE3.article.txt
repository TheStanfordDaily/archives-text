# Campus-Wide Panels Debate SES Report
## 
### 
The Study of Education at Stanford
(SES) reports were the subject of cam
pus-wide debates yesterday. Following
are six summaries of panel discussions
on the freshman year, the campus com
munity, requirements, special programs,
fraternities, and university housing.
Freshman Year
The near unanimous opinion of fac
ulty and students on the panel con
cerned with the Freshman year at Stan
ford was that all requirements should be
dropped and that freshmen "should not
be treated as a separate caste."
At present, according to panelist Jeff
Kane, "Freshman year is equivalent to
grade thirteen." Panelist freshman, Greg
Leftson agreed saying, "The faster you
get a conception of your position in the
university, the faster you can get on
your way. You either go all the way
into college or you stay as a high school
student."
Director of the Western Civilization
Program, Paul Seaver believes that the
real issue in question is how to intro
duce freshmen to the realities of an in
tellectual endeavor. "We are starting off
on the wrong foot," he says referring to
the present system. "We are telling a
freshman that there is a specific body of
knowledge that he needs to start off on
to be an educated man ... If we want
self-motivated intellectuals then requir
ing courses is a mistake. In effect, we
are telling them they are incapable of
free choice . . . SES doesn't go nearly
far enough but it is a step in the right
direction."
Requirement Alternatives
The alternatives to the present re
quirements of Western Civ and freshman
English which were proposed by the

panelists and members of the audience
(approx. 50 students and faculty) fo
cuscd on an enlarged system of counsel
ing.
Polemus said that "There won't be a
strong freshman tutorial going until
there is a Dean of Undergraduate Educa
tion."
Davis from the Student Counseling
Service said that he could see no possi
ble way of expanding the system of stu
dent counseling unless "you have paid
freshmen advisors or a Dean of Under
graduate Studies."
Guides to Freshmen
English Professor, Anne Kostelanetz
expressed the need to guide freshmen
with full and strong "recommendations
not requirements."
Polhemus seconded her belief: "Peo
ple don't learn anything unless they
want to. Education is such an individual
matter."
Holmes sees that there will be
little objection in the Academic Senate
to the SES proposals regarding freshman
year. "The recommendation will have
no trouble passing the Academic Sen
ate," he said, "but I don't see that there
will be any significant change in the
freshman year program until two years
from now."
Campus Community
"The idea of a main street through
the campus is high minded nonsense. In
effect it amounts to a smoke screen.
The university is in the process of cut
ting itself off from the community like
the faculty is cutting itself off from the
students," stated Edward McClanahan, a
panel member in the SES discussion on
the Campus Community which took
place in Branner Hall.
Panelists included Keith Boyle,
associate professor of art; Abbie
von Schlegel, undergrad in
psychology and co-chairman of
ASSU Special Events Board;
Barbara Troxell, executive direc
tor of Stanford's YWCA and a
leader in the Stanford United Min
istry; Forrest Tregea, director of
Tresidder Union and Manager of
the Faculty Club, and McClana
han, lecturer in creative writing.
Moderator was Eric Espen, an
undergrad in philosophy. Barbara
Dray, assistant to the Dean of Stu
dents and a member of the Coffee
House Committee, served as re
corder.
Interaction with Palo Alto
Espen also feels that building a
mainstreet, as suggested by the
SES committee, would isolate the
campus even more. "A lot more
student services like restaurants or
coffee houses could be offered,
but with an adequate transporta
tion system to the stores, down
town Palo Alto could handle the
merchandise."
"We could have a shuttle bus,"
said McClanahan. "With the funds
available for a mall, we could
build a monorail from Hoo Tow
to the Poppycock—or a moving
sidewalk—anything that would
tend to funnel the university out
ward in that direction.
Speculating on the plans for
more places for faculty and stu
dents to meet informally, the
group's discussion turned to the
lack of faculty-student communi
cation and the restrictiveness of
the Faculty Club membership.
Faculty Club
"The Faculty Club," McClana
han stated, "is a metaphor of the
problem of separation of faculty
and students. It is a monument to
the principle that the faculty
ought to be able to escape the stu
dents."
"There is always the discussion
of lack of communication be
tween students and faculty," com
mented Boyle, "but, before the
Club was built, there was no com
munication between the faculty.
Now there is an exchange of
ideas."

Smorgasbord Approach
"Why not satisfy the problem
by creating more places than by
trying to put it into one?" asked
Tregea. "I like the idea of dispers
ing services. My approach is smor
gasbord. Don't argue about having
something on the table that you
don't like—just so there's some
thing that you do like."
Tregea revealed plans for a res
taurant or banquet area in the re
modeled kitchen of Encina Hall.
It would be a "satellite of Tres
idder—a Tresidder East."
Other suggestions for more di
versity on campus included a stu
dent co-op and facilities for stu
dents to experiment with art and
music.
Stanford Architecture
Architecture at Stanford was
another topic discussed, primarily
by Boyle, who was involved in the
controversies over planning and
building the new art building.
To revise the present system,
Boyle suggested that the Planning
Office be eliminated. "A faculty
member, with his course load re
duced, could act as a consultant
with the architect and be on the
construction site . . . There
should be far more open selection
of architects than the two or three
who get in on the gravy train."
Apprehension Towards SES
SES in general was discussed
towards the close of the afternoon
session. Several people expressed
apprehension that SES might
serve to "appease" the Stanford
Community into believing that it
includes enough charges so that
further revisions will not be neces
sary for "another 20 years." They
hoped the SES report would be
only a "step" in further education
changes.
Course Requirements
Diverse opinions were heard at the
SES panel discussion on Distri
bution Policies and Requirements
held yesterday in Tresidder's large
lounge. Panel members' convic
tions ranged from opposition to
all requirements to support for
continued compulsory Western
Civilization.

Members of the panel included
Peter Dahl, Assistant to the Direc
tor of General Studies; Richard
1 Jahns, Dean of the School of
Earth Science; Professors Walter
Meyerhof (Physics) and Walter
Sokel (German); and students
Brad Cornell (Physics), Barbara
Levin (Psychology), and James
Spickard (Political Science).
Cornell warned that allowing
students to choose courses usually
results in their choosing a course
that supports their preconceived
worldview. "We need something
like Western Civilization to force
people to confront one another."
Flexible System
The university must develop a
flexible system that takes care of
both the motivated and unmoti
vated, according to Meyerhof. He
proposed guidelines—Freshman
English, "so that people can com
municate," and perhaps area re
quirements in broad fields-that
students could avoid, if they de
sired, by convincing either their
advisors or a review committee.
Dahl stated that a liberal edu
cation, by design, attempts to
contribute to the development of
the whole man, achieving a bal
ance between logic and intuition.
"Hopefully scientists will refuse
to make napalm, and humanists
will have a respect for science.
The problem is, how do you
create such a human being?"
A recurring theme in the c«s
cussion was that before deciding
on requirements policy, one has
to first define the purposes of ed
ucation. Among the resulting def
initions were the following:
Education Defined
Member of the audience—"The
only ideal that educational should
teach is tolerance."
Another member of the audi
ence—"Some people think that
any educated man must learn a
language. Others believe he must
study King Lear in depth. I per
sonally don't think an education
is complete without a course in
population biology. Since we
can't agree on what should be re
quired, let's leave the decision to
the individual."
Sokel: "Education should lead
-t the student out of his inherited
view of the world. It involves dif
| ficulty and a jolt. Satisfaction of
i immediate wants is not educa
tion."
Special Programs
"To think that we've discov
; ered something immutable in a
special program is a mistake," As
sociate Dean of Undergraduate
Studies Robert Hind said, in pre
face to a discussion held in Soto
I House lounge yesterday.
Hind was a panel member of
I the student-faculty group, which
discussed the Special Programs
section of the SES report. Other
faculty panel members were Prof.
David Gray of the Communica
tions Department and Dean Ryan
of Humanities and Sciences. The
student members of the panel in
cluded Yale Braunstein, speaker
of the student legislature; David
Pugh of SDS; graduate students
: Mike Menke,Eckhard Schultz, and
j Sally Main; and undergraduate I
Patrick Shea.
Hind went on to explain that
the best of special programs does
not necessarily stay good over a
long period of time. "We should
be able to shut it off," Hind said.
Student Initiated Programs
During the discussion, Shea ex
plained in general terms the idea
of setting up a centralized depart- ■
ment to handle student-initiated
special programs. These programs
could be in the form of inter-de
partmental majors, or of seminars,
or of independent studies. The de
partment would co-ordinate these
programs.
Two different examples of
special programs were given by
; Mike Menke and Eckert Schultz.
Menke described a specialized pro
gram of requirements which is in
effect at the College at Montiethe,
in industrial Detroit. This consists •
of a sequence of courses in natural I
sciences, the last of which was an J
independent studies program.
Schultz discussed a course
which he had taken, in which
communal research was done,
bringing students of different
fields together with a common in
terest.

Examples of student-initiated
programs already in effect at Stan
ford are the student-initiated
courses, the inter-departmental
major, and Grove House.
Fraternities
Does selection provide a more
autonomous group? Can any judg
ment be made about a person's
character or compatibility on the
basis of fraternity rush?
These were the major topics of
controversy at the panel discus
sion on fraternities in Donner
lounge yesterday morning, which
about 30 students attended.
The panel was formed to dis
cuss the SES proposals on frater
nities, which included: abolition
of all discriminatory clauses from
their local and national constitu
tions, and a new rush system.
Members of the panel were
Doug Chandler, President of the
inter-fraternity council; Bob Sum
mers, Manager of fraternities; Bill
Freivogel and Grey Bryan, Theta
Delta Chi undergraduates; Robert
Freelen, faculty resident in the
new fraternity cluster; Christo
pher Murlas, president of Lambda
Nu; Vic von Schlegel, ASSU vice
president; Peter Ryan, Alpha Delt
graduate; Daniel Williams, Assis
tant Dean of Students; and Sue
Ott, Lambda Nu undergraduate.
First Proposal Dismissed
The first proposal was quickly
dismissed, it was pointed out that
only one fraternity's national still
had a discriminatory clause, and
that, in the past at least, frater
nities had a higher percentage of
minority group members than uni
versity housing.
Discussion of the selectivity of
fraternities, on the othe;hand, was
quite heated, von Schlegel ques
tioned the place of selectivity in
the Stanford community. "We
want to get away from any selec
tivity at all," he said. "If frater
nities have to move off campus it
will be because they haven't
adapted to the free-flowing
society of the University."
Freelen thought it would be
"impossible to delay decisions on
selectivity much longer if frater
nities want to stay on campus."
When they "can't get enough
members to fill their houses,
something is wrong," he added.
Selectivity Defended
Many of the persons present
defended selection in fraternities.
They maintained that selectivity

was required to maintain the au
tonomous group that makes a
fraternity so attractive as a place
to live.
Von Schlegel questioned
whether selective rush is "covert
descrimination." A student an
swered, "We all have the right to
choose our friends. Why not have
the right to choose to live with
them?"
The weaknesses of rush were
agreed upon, but aside from just
lengthening its duration, no alter
native methods of meeting and
selecting members were suggested.
University Housing
About 20 students braved the
storm to meet yesterday morning
in Larkin lounge for a panel dis
cussion on SES Report No. 3 on
University Housing and Campus
Life.
Barry Askinas, graduate in
sociology and tutor in Otero mod
erated the discussion. Gerald
Elliott, Assistant to the Dean of
Students, served as recorder.
Class Integration in Dorms
The question of how, where,
and when to integrate freshman
into upper-class residences was the
first topic of discussion. Com
ments, generally favorable, called
for integrated housing as "a more
balanced environment" and a de
sire to avoid "perpetuating high
school ways."
Co-ed housing canie in for both
praise and criticism but the group
was largely in agreement with
moderator Askinas who summar
ized that "It's (co-ed dorm) a
place where people enjoy living
rather than just having a room."
Every graduate student present
agreed immediately and enthusias
tically to the need for putting
pressure on the administration to
construct more low-cost housing
for graduate students.
Co-operative Housing
Co-operative housing as a stu
dent-run and student-controlled
mechanism for cutting costs and
increasing community sensitivity
was the final focus of discussion.
Reactions to the co-operative
proposition were mixed but as
Jim Glenn concluded, "There can
be no scapegoats but the members
of the house."

Dariey, Jack Kaplan, Felicity Bar
