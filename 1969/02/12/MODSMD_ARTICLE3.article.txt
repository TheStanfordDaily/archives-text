# Campus-Wide Panels Debate SES Report
## 
### 
The Study of Education at Stanford
(SES) reports were the subject of cam
pus-wide debates yesterday. Following
are six summaries of panel discussions
on the freshman year, the campus com
munity, requirements, special programs,
fraternities, and university housing.
Freshman Year
The near unanimous opinion of fac
ulty and students on the panel con
cerned with the Freshman year at Stan
ford was that all requirements should be
dropped and that freshmen "should not
be treated as a separate caste."
At present, according to panelist Jeff
Kane, "Freshman year is equivalent to
grade thirteen." Panelist freshman, Greg
Leftson agreed saying, "The faster you
get a conception of your position in the
university, the faster you can get on
your way. You either go all the way
into college or you stay as a high school
student."
Director of the Western Civilization
Program, Paul Seaver believes that the
real issue in question is how to intro
duce freshmen to the realities of an in
tellectual endeavor. "We are starting off
on the wrong foot," he says referring to
the present system. "We are telling a
freshman that there is a specific body of
knowledge that he needs to start off on
to be an educated man ... If we want
self-motivated intellectuals then requir
ing courses is a mistake. In effect, we
are telling them they are incapable of
free choice . . . SES doesn't go nearly
far enough but it is a step in the right
direction."
Requirement Alternatives
The alternatives to the present re
quirements of Western Civ and freshman
English which were proposed by the

panelists and members of the audience
(approx. 50 students and faculty) fo
cuscd on an enlarged system of counsel
ing.
Polemus said that "There won't be a
strong freshman tutorial going until
there is a Dean of Undergraduate Educa
tion."
Davis from the Student Counseling
Service said that he could see no possi
ble way of expanding the system of stu
dent counseling unless "you have paid
freshmen advisors or a Dean of Under
graduate Studies."
Guides to Freshmen
English Professor, Anne Kostelanetz
expressed the need to guide freshmen
with full and strong "recommendations
not requirements."
Polhemus seconded her belief: "Peo
ple don't learn anything unless they
want to. Education is such an individual
matter."
Holmes sees that there will be
little objection in the Academic Senate
to the SES proposals regarding freshman
year. "The recommendation will have
no trouble passing the Academic Sen
ate," he said, "but I don't see that there
will be any significant change in the
freshman year program until two years
from now."
Campus Community
"The idea of a main street through
the campus is high minded nonsense. In
effect it amounts to a smoke screen.
The university is in the process of cut
ting itself off from the community like
the faculty is cutting itself off from the
students," stated Edward McClanahan, a
panel member in the SES discussion on
the Campus Community which took
place in Branner Hall.
