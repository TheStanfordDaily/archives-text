PREAMBLE
The Ad Hoc Senate Committee on ROTC was
appointed by a letter of October 17, 1968, rom
the chairman of the Senate Committee on Com
mittees. The appointment followed the Senate
action of September 26, 1968, expressed in the
following resolution:
It is the sense of the Senate that the ROTC
program should be altered but that proper re
lations between the ROTC departments and
Stanford may be established by review and
reform of the present relations.
Therefore, the matter of such relations
should be recommitted to an ad hoc commit
tee which shall report recommendations no
later than January 15, 1969 ; and the matter
of this committee's charge shall be further dis
cussed at an early meeting of the Senate.
ROTC has a history of some 50 years at Stan
ford. An Army program was established in 1919;
Air Force and Navy programs were established in
1946. In the academic year 1958-59, the three
departments had a total enrollment of 732 stu
dents and commissioned 186 officers. In
1963-64, the corresponding numbers were 586
and 86; in 1967-68, they were 383 and 98. In
1967-68, there were 125 students on full tuition

scholarships. Currently, the ROTC programs
operate under the federal statute known as the
"Reserve Officers' Training Corps Vitalization
Act of 1964." Stanford and each military depart
ment have negotiated a contract stipulating the
terms and conditions under which the particular
ROTC program shall operate at Stanford.
In its study of the details of the ROTC pro
grams and the relationship between the ROTC
departments and the University, the Committee
held 12 meetings from October 28, 1968, to
February 3, 1969. At these meetings of the
whole Committee, as well as at many subcommit
tee meetings, scores of documents were exam
ined, covering such matters as relevant legisla
tion, contractual agreements between military
departments and the University and between mil
itary departments and students, and procedures
for appointment of teaching personnel to ROTC
departments.
The Committee also invited several members
of the Stanford community to present their
views on ROTC. Among those giving testimony
were Colonel Stanley M. Ramey, Department of
Military Science, Major Leon C. Heinle, Depart
ment of Aerospace Studies, Prof. Philip Rhine
lander, Philosophy, Prof. William Clebsch, Hu
manities, Mr. Lauress Wise, Military Programs Co

ordinator at Stanford, Mr. Allan Strain, Draft
Counselor in the Office of Special Services at
Stanford, and Prof. Barton Bernstein, History. In
ddition, on January 16, an all-campus open
hearing on ROTC was held in the Meyer Library.
Because it was common knowledge that sev
eral universities were also in the process of re
viewing the ROTC programs, one of the Commit
tee members contacted a number of institutions
and asked for information on their current posi
tion. The information received is summarized in
an appendix to this report.
As the study and discussion of various issues
progressed, the Committee found that three basic
positions could be defined: (1) the University
should dissociate itself completely from the
ROTC programs; (2) the University should re
move military education and training as formal,
on-campus programs; (3) the University should
preserve the present relationship in its essential
form but proceed to implement several changes
designed to make the ROTC programs more
closely conform to academic practice at Stan
ford.
No member of the Committee supported the
first of these positions. The members were clear
ly divided, however, on a choice between the
second and third. Although in discussions of sev

eral individual issues, there were often consider
able agreement on the need for change and the
nature of the change, the members found their
overall positions to be so substantively different
that a fair presentation could only be made in
separate reports. Accordingly, the Committee re
port to the Senate is in two parts, a majority and
a minority report.
The majority finds that the ROTC depart
ments are, by their nature, incompatible with the
University's primary commitment to the unre
stricted creation and dissemination of knowledge
and recommends that, with due regard to exist
ing legal and moral commitments, the University
discontinue the presentation of ROTC depart
ment courses as a part of its formal on-campus
program, either with or without degree credit;
that the role of military personnel on campus be
limited to administrative, counseling and recruit
ment functions; that all on-campus military activ
ities be conducted in accordance with rules gov
erning voluntary activities. The minority report
finds that the ROTC programs, in substantially
their current form, are in the best interests of the
students, the University and the nation and rec
ommends that they remain a part of the aca
demic program of the University but that a num
ber of changes in their administration and presen

tation be implemented to bring them in closer
conformity with standard academic practice.
FINAL REPORT OF THE MAJORITY
AD HOC SENATE COMMITTEE ON ROTC
OUTLINE
I. Definition
II. Preliminary considerations
III. General and specific objections to the pres-
Stanford-ROTC arrangements
IV. Objections to ROTC as an organized, non
credit, on-campus program
V. Recommendations
I. Definition
In seeking to define the proper relation of
the ROTC programs to Stanford University, the
majority became aware of the necessity of de
fining its concept of the university. We realize
that such definitions have been subject to histor
ial change, and that no single definition has
gained universal agreement. The working defini
tion used in this report is that the university is a
community whose members, including both fac
ulty and students, have a primary commitment
to the creation and dissemination of knowledge,
