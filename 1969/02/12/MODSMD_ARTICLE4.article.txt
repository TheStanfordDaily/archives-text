PREAMBLE
The Ad Hoc Senate Committee on ROTC was
appointed by a letter of October 17, 1968, rom
the chairman of the Senate Committee on Com
mittees. The appointment followed the Senate
action of September 26, 1968, expressed in the
following resolution:
It is the sense of the Senate that the ROTC
program should be altered but that proper re
lations between the ROTC departments and
Stanford may be established by review and
reform of the present relations.
Therefore, the matter of such relations
should be recommitted to an ad hoc commit
tee which shall report recommendations no
later than January 15, 1969 ; and the matter
of this committee's charge shall be further dis
cussed at an early meeting of the Senate.
ROTC has a history of some 50 years at Stan
ford. An Army program was established in 1919;
Air Force and Navy programs were established in
1946. In the academic year 1958-59, the three
departments had a total enrollment of 732 stu
dents and commissioned 186 officers. In
1963-64, the corresponding numbers were 586
and 86; in 1967-68, they were 383 and 98. In
1967-68, there were 125 students on full tuition

scholarships. Currently, the ROTC programs
operate under the federal statute known as the
"Reserve Officers' Training Corps Vitalization
Act of 1964." Stanford and each military depart
ment have negotiated a contract stipulating the
terms and conditions under which the particular
ROTC program shall operate at Stanford.
In its study of the details of the ROTC pro
grams and the relationship between the ROTC
departments and the University, the Committee
held 12 meetings from October 28, 1968, to
February 3, 1969. At these meetings of the
whole Committee, as well as at many subcommit
tee meetings, scores of documents were exam
ined, covering such matters as relevant legisla
tion, contractual agreements between military
departments and the University and between mil
itary departments and students, and procedures
for appointment of teaching personnel to ROTC
departments.
The Committee also invited several members
of the Stanford community to present their
views on ROTC. Among those giving testimony
were Colonel Stanley M. Ramey, Department of
Military Science, Major Leon C. Heinle, Depart
ment of Aerospace Studies, Prof. Philip Rhine
lander, Philosophy, Prof. William Clebsch, Hu
manities, Mr. Lauress Wise, Military Programs Co

ordinator at Stanford, Mr. Allan Strain, Draft
Counselor in the Office of Special Services at
Stanford, and Prof. Barton Bernstein, History. In
ddition, on January 16, an all-campus open
hearing on ROTC was held in the Meyer Library.
Because it was common knowledge that sev
eral universities were also in the process of re
viewing the ROTC programs, one of the Commit
tee members contacted a number of institutions
and asked for information on their current posi
tion. The information received is summarized in
an appendix to this report.
As the study and discussion of various issues
progressed, the Committee found that three basic
positions could be defined: (1) the University
should dissociate itself completely from the
ROTC programs; (2) the University should re
move military education and training as formal,
on-campus programs; (3) the University should
preserve the present relationship in its essential
form but proceed to implement several changes
designed to make the ROTC programs more
closely conform to academic practice at Stan
ford.
No member of the Committee supported the
first of these positions. The members were clear
ly divided, however, on a choice between the
second and third. Although in discussions of sev

eral individual issues, there were often consider
able agreement on the need for change and the
nature of the change, the members found their
overall positions to be so substantively different
that a fair presentation could only be made in
separate reports. Accordingly, the Committee re
port to the Senate is in two parts, a majority and
a minority report.
The majority finds that the ROTC depart
ments are, by their nature, incompatible with the
University's primary commitment to the unre
stricted creation and dissemination of knowledge
and recommends that, with due regard to exist
ing legal and moral commitments, the University
discontinue the presentation of ROTC depart
ment courses as a part of its formal on-campus
program, either with or without degree credit;
that the role of military personnel on campus be
limited to administrative, counseling and recruit
ment functions; that all on-campus military activ
ities be conducted in accordance with rules gov
erning voluntary activities. The minority report
finds that the ROTC programs, in substantially
their current form, are in the best interests of the
students, the University and the nation and rec
ommends that they remain a part of the aca
demic program of the University but that a num
ber of changes in their administration and presen

tation be implemented to bring them in closer
conformity with standard academic practice.

AD HOC SENATE COMMITTEE ON ROTC

Stanford-ROTC arrangements

credit, on-campus program
V. Recommendations
I. Definition
In seeking to define the proper relation of
the ROTC programs to Stanford University, the
majority became aware of the necessity of de
fining its concept of the university. We realize
that such definitions have been subject to histor
ial change, and that no single definition has
gained universal agreement. The working defini
tion used in this report is that the university is a
community whose members, including both fac
ulty and students, have a primary commitment
to the creation and dissemination of knowledge,
in an pnvirnninpnt of fr-uo Snfnllophiul ortlvifir
Service to concerns and interests beyond the
university, we believe, is entirely proper, but the
university should participate institutionally in
such service only insofar as it is consistent with
this definition. External sanctions and defini
tions of the university's roles, obligations,
duties, etc., are valid only if, and only so long
as, they coincide with the values and premises
generated within Stanford, by the Stanford
community.
11. Preliminary Considerations
We examined ROTC as a program within the
institution of Stanford University, and the basis
for our objections is institutional. It is impor
tant to draw the distinction between the larger
objectives which ROTC serves and the vehicle
(ROTC) which is the means to that end. ROTC
is an important mechanism for procuring junior
officers to staff the armed forces of the United
States. The military requires a constant supply
of well-educated officers and ROTC serves that
need with programs of recruitment and training
on many of the nation's college and university
campuses.
We believe, however, that there are important
differences between educated men and educated
officers. Stanford best serves its own purpose
and the interests of the nation when it strives to
educate men in the way it is best prepared to
do, and when it openly acknowledges that it
cannot provide all men with all the education
they seek. In turn, some of the men whom Stan
ford educates will choose to become military
officers. It does not follow, however, that Stan
ford must provide these men with the education
specifically required by military officers. The
armed forces acknowledge this fact by requiring
that military training supplement general educa
tion. The military does not recruit officers;
rather, educated men interested in becoming
officers are recruited so that the armed forces
may develop them into educated officers.
The institutional foundation for our objec
tions leads us to exclude political criteria from
our report. We did not attempt to pass judge
ment on the objectives of the Department of
Defense or their relation to the social interests
of the nation. Nor did we measure the degree to
which ROTC serves either of these two pur
poses. To exclude these considerations from our
recommendations merely recognizes the fact
that such an undertaking would have been fruit
less. From our institutional perspective, such
political or normative evaluations would have
provided neither necessary nor sufficient justifi
cation for the inclusion, exclusion, or alterna
tion of ROTC at Stanford University.
The Maiority also consciously sought to ex
clude personal feeling about the war in Vietnam
from its deliberations. Though testimony was
heard which suggested an inconsistency between
opposition to the present war and continuation
of ROTC at Stanford, the Majority was uncon
vinced by the argument, and still believes that
no specific institutional response must neces
sarily follow from the opinion or beliefs of in
dividuals within that institution. Undoubtedly,
contemporary sensitivity to the Vietnam War, in
part, gave impetus to the concern which led to
this committee's assignment. What is lamentable
about this fact is the apparent need for crisis
before a university is moved to examine itself.
(See page 4 of the SES Report, No. 1.) It is our
conviction that these recommendations will
serve well this institution and society in times of
peace as well as war.
Lastly, it has been suggested that the institu
tional basis of our objections blinds us to the
wishes and preferences of individual students.
The argument is made that the Committee has
no right, through its recommendations, to limit
a student's freedom to choose a particular
course of study or career objective. The Major
ity has no desire to deprive the student of the
choice to become an officer in the military.
Rather, we seek to change the procedures
through which a student must pass in order to
become an officer, only insofar as they relate to
Stanford. Since this University can never offer
all possible alternatives, to be realized in all pos
sible ways, the question of total freedom of
choice is not pertinent (Stanford, for example,
does not offer programs in agriculture, hotel
management, etc.) Beyond our recommenda
tions, which would still allow Stanford students
to be recruited as junior officers, the Majority
wishes to call attention to such programs as
Officer Candidate School and the military
academies as at least two other avenues for stu
dents who desire to become officers.
111. General and Specific Objections to
Present Stanford-ROTC Relations
In considering the place of ROTC—or indeed
any program—at Stanford, the first standard to
be applied is whether or not that program is com
patible with the concept of the University as de
fined, autonomously, by Stanford itself. All
members of the Committee and all witnesses ap
pearing before it, acknowledge that present
ROTC practices depart from general University
practice in many areas. Some have suggested to
the Committee that the very constellation of
problems is a kind of ipso facto case against
ROTC. While not accepting this view at face
value, we have found that anomalies and excep
tions to prevailing practice exist academically,
structurally, contractually and in matters of per
sonnel.
A great number of changes have been sug
gested to bring the ROTC programs into closer
conformity with accepted practice, many of
them on the initiative of the armed forces and
the ROTC programs themselves. These have been
most extensive in, but not limited to, the aca
demic area: curriculum planning, course credit,
content, and substitution. It seems clear that the
implementation of these changes would represent
definite improvement, perhaps eliminating some
problems and reducing others.
But even if all these alterations are in fact
made, there will still remain a residuum of
anomaly. In the Majority's view, the crucial ques
tion before the Stanford community is whether
or not this residuum is compatible with Stanford
University—or at least compatible enough to be
acceptable. The conclusion of the Majority, after
weighing the evidence, is that as a formal, on
campus program, sponsored, sanctioned, and par
tially supported by Stanford University, the
ROTC program is not compatible with the Uni
versity. Moreover, this incompatibility is inherent
in the very nature of the ROTC programs, and
therefore cannot be removed by various changes
which are from time to time proposed.
Before going further, the Majority wishes to
say that it recognizes the existence of anomaly
and exception elsewhere in the University. But to
justify the one by the other is clearly fallacious.
If it seems to be singling out ROTC, this is only
PREAMBLE

provided neither necessary nor sufficient justifi

The Maiority also consciously sought to ex
clude personal feeling about the war in Vietnam
from its deliberations. Though testimony was
heard which suggested an inconsistency between
opposition to the present war and continuation
of ROTC at Stanford, the Majority was uncon

no specific institutional response must neces

dividuals within that institution. Undoubtedly,
contemporary sensitivity to the Vietnam War, in
part, gave impetus to the concern which led to
this committee's assignment. What is lamentable
about this fact is the apparent need for crisis
before a university is moved to examine itself.
(See page 4 of the SES Report, No. 1.) It is our
conviction that these recommendations will
serve well this institution and society in times of
peace as well as war.
Lastly, it has been suggested that the institu
tional basis of our objections blinds us to the
wishes and preferences of individual students.
The argument is made that the Committee has
no right, through its recommendations, to limit
a student's freedom to choose a particular
course of study or career objective. The Major
ity has no desire to deprive the student of the
choice to become an officer in the military.
Rather, we seek to change the procedures
through which a student must pass in order to
become an officer, only insofar as they relate to
Stanford. Since this University can never offer
all possible alternatives, to be realized in all pos
sible ways, the question of total freedom of
choice is not pertinent (Stanford, for example,
does not offer programs in agriculture, hotel
management, etc.) Beyond our recommenda
tions, which would still allow Stanford students
to be recruited as junior officers, the Majority
wishes to call attention to such programs as
Officer Candidate School and the military
academies as at least two other avenues for stu
dents who desire to become officers.
111. General and Specific Objections to
Present Stanford-ROTC Relations
In considering the place of ROTC—or indeed
any program—at Stanford, the first standard to
be applied is whether or not that program is com
patible with the concept of the University as de
fined, autonomously, by Stanford itself. All
members of the Committee and all witnesses ap
pearing before it, acknowledge that present
ROTC practices depart from general University
practice in many areas. Some have suggested to
the Committee that the very constellation of
problems is a kind of ipso facto case against
ROTC. While not accepting this view at face
value, we have found that anomalies and excep
tions to prevailing practice exist academically,
structurally, contractually and in matters of per
sonnel.
A great number of changes have been sug
gested to bring the ROTC programs into closer
conformity with accepted practice, many of
them on the initiative of the armed forces and
the ROTC programs themselves. These have been
most extensive in, but not limited to, the aca
demic area: curriculum planning, course credit,
content, and substitution. It seems clear that the
implementation of these changes would represent
definite improvement, perhaps eliminating some
problems and reducing others.
But even if all these alterations are in fact
made, there will still remain a residuum of
anomaly. In the Majority's view, the crucial ques
tion before the Stanford community is whether
or not this residuum is compatible with Stanford
University—or at least compatible enough to be
acceptable. The conclusion of the Majority, after
weighing the evidence, is that as a formal, on
campus program, sponsored, sanctioned, and par
tially supported by Stanford University, the
ROTC program is not compatible with the Uni
versity. Moreover, this incompatibility is inherent
in the very nature of the ROTC programs, and
therefore cannot be removed by various changes
which are from time to time proposed.
Before going further, the Majority wishes to
say that it recognizes the existence of anomaly
and exception elsewhere in the University. But to
justify the one by the other is clearly fallacious.
If it seems to be singling out ROTC, this is only
PREAMBLE
The Ad Hoc Senate Committee on ROTC was
appointed by a letter of October 17, 1968, rom
the chairman of the Senate Committee on Com
mittees. The appointment followed the Senate
action of September 26, 1968, expressed in the
following resolution:
It is the sense of the Senate that the ROTC
program should be altered but that proper re
lations between the ROTC departments and
Stanford may be established by review and
reform of the present relations.
Therefore, the matter of such relations
should be recommitted to an ad hoc commit
tee which shall report recommendations no
later than January 15, 1969 ; and the matter
of this committee's charge shall be further dis
cussed at an early meeting of the Senate.
ROTC has a history of some 50 years at Stan
ford. An Army program was established in 1919;
Air Force and Navy programs were established in
1946. In the academic year 1958-59, the three
departments had a total enrollment of 732 stu
dents and commissioned 186 officers. In
1963-64, the corresponding numbers were 586
and 86; in 1967-68, they were 383 and 98. In
1967-68, there were 125 students on full tuition

scholarships. Currently, the ROTC programs
operate under the federal statute known as the
"Reserve Officers' Training Corps Vitalization
Act of 1964." Stanford and each military depart
ment have negotiated a contract stipulating the
terms and conditions under which the particular
ROTC program shall operate at Stanford.
In its study of the details of the ROTC pro
grams and the relationship between the ROTC
departments and the University, the Committee
held 12 meetings from October 28, 1968, to
February 3, 1969. At these meetings of the
whole Committee, as well as at many subcommit
tee meetings, scores of documents were exam
ined, covering such matters as relevant legisla
tion, contractual agreements between military
departments and the University and between mil
itary departments and students, and procedures
for appointment of teaching personnel to ROTC
departments.
The Committee also invited several members
of the Stanford community to present their
views on ROTC. Among those giving testimony
were Colonel Stanley M. Ramey, Department of
Military Science, Major Leon C. Heinle, Depart
ment of Aerospace Studies, Prof. Philip Rhine
lander, Philosophy, Prof. William Clebsch, Hu
manities, Mr. Lauress Wise, Military Programs Co

ordinator at Stanford, Mr. Allan Strain, Draft
Counselor in the Office of Special Services at
Stanford, and Prof. Barton Bernstein, History. In
ddition, on January 16, an all-campus open
hearing on ROTC was held in the Meyer Library.
Because it was common knowledge that sev
eral universities were also in the process of re
viewing the ROTC programs, one of the Commit
tee members contacted a number of institutions
and asked for information on their current posi
tion. The information received is summarized in
an appendix to this report.
As the study and discussion of various issues
progressed, the Committee found that three basic
positions could be defined: (1) the University
should dissociate itself completely from the
ROTC programs; (2) the University should re
move military education and training as formal,
on-campus programs; (3) the University should
preserve the present relationship in its essential
form but proceed to implement several changes
designed to make the ROTC programs more
closely conform to academic practice at Stan
ford.
No member of the Committee supported the
first of these positions. The members were clear
ly divided, however, on a choice between the
second and third. Although in discussions of sev

eral individual issues, there were often consider
able agreement on the need for change and the
nature of the change, the members found their
overall positions to be so substantively different
that a fair presentation could only be made in
separate reports. Accordingly, the Committee re
port to the Senate is in two parts, a majority and
a minority report.
The majority finds that the ROTC depart
ments are, by their nature, incompatible with the
University's primary commitment to the unre
stricted creation and dissemination of knowledge
and recommends that, with due regard to exist
ing legal and moral commitments, the University
discontinue the presentation of ROTC depart
ment courses as a part of its formal on-campus
program, either with or without degree credit;
that the role of military personnel on campus be
limited to administrative, counseling and recruit
ment functions; that all on-campus military activ
ities be conducted in accordance with rules gov
erning voluntary activities. The minority report
finds that the ROTC programs, in substantially
their current form, are in the best interests of the
students, the University and the nation and rec
ommends that they remain a part of the aca
demic program of the University but that a num
ber of changes in their administration and presen

tation be implemented to bring them in closer
conformity with standard academic practice.

AD HOC SENATE COMMITTEE ON ROTC

II. Preliminary considerations
III. General and specific objections to the pres-
Stanford-ROTC arrangements
IV. Objections to ROTC as an organized, non
credit, on-campus program
V. Recommendations
I. Definition
In seeking to define the proper relation of
the ROTC programs to Stanford University, the
majority became aware of the necessity of de
fining its concept of the university. We realize
that such definitions have been subject to histor
ial change, and that no single definition has
gained universal agreement. The working defini
tion used in this report is that the university is a
community whose members, including both fac
ulty and students, have a primary commitment
to the creation and dissemination of knowledge,
in an pnvirnninpnt of fr-uo Snfnllophiul ortlvifir
Service to concerns and interests beyond the
university, we believe, is entirely proper, but the
university should participate institutionally in
such service only insofar as it is consistent with
this definition. External sanctions and defini
tions of the university's roles, obligations,
duties, etc., are valid only if, and only so long
as, they coincide with the values and premises
generated within Stanford, by the Stanford
community.
11. Preliminary Considerations
We examined ROTC as a program within the
institution of Stanford University, and the basis
for our objections is institutional. It is impor
tant to draw the distinction between the larger
objectives which ROTC serves and the vehicle
(ROTC) which is the means to that end. ROTC
is an important mechanism for procuring junior
officers to staff the armed forces of the United
States. The military requires a constant supply
of well-educated officers and ROTC serves that
need with programs of recruitment and training
on many of the nation's college and university
campuses.
We believe, however, that there are important
differences between educated men and educated
officers. Stanford best serves its own purpose
and the interests of the nation when it strives to
educate men in the way it is best prepared to
do, and when it openly acknowledges that it
cannot provide all men with all the education
they seek. In turn, some of the men whom Stan
ford educates will choose to become military
officers. It does not follow, however, that Stan
ford must provide these men with the education
specifically required by military officers. The
armed forces acknowledge this fact by requiring
that military training supplement general educa
tion. The military does not recruit officers;
rather, educated men interested in becoming
officers are recruited so that the armed forces
may develop them into educated officers.
The institutional foundation for our objec
tions leads us to exclude political criteria from
our report. We did not attempt to pass judge
ment on the objectives of the Department of
Defense or their relation to the social interests
of the nation. Nor did we measure the degree to
which ROTC serves either of these two pur
poses. To exclude these considerations from our
recommendations merely recognizes the fact
that such an undertaking would have been fruit
less. From our institutional perspective, such
political or normative evaluations would have
provided neither necessary nor sufficient justifi
cation for the inclusion, exclusion, or alterna
tion of ROTC at Stanford University.
The Maiority also consciously sought to ex
clude personal feeling about the war in Vietnam
from its deliberations. Though testimony was
heard which suggested an inconsistency between
opposition to the present war and continuation
of ROTC at Stanford, the Majority was uncon
vinced by the argument, and still believes that
no specific institutional response must neces
sarily follow from the opinion or beliefs of in
dividuals within that institution. Undoubtedly,
contemporary sensitivity to the Vietnam War, in
part, gave impetus to the concern which led to
this committee's assignment. What is lamentable
about this fact is the apparent need for crisis
before a university is moved to examine itself.
(See page 4 of the SES Report, No. 1.) It is our
conviction that these recommendations will
serve well this institution and society in times of
peace as well as war.
Lastly, it has been suggested that the institu
tional basis of our objections blinds us to the
wishes and preferences of individual students.
The argument is made that the Committee has
no right, through its recommendations, to limit
a student's freedom to choose a particular
course of study or career objective. The Major
ity has no desire to deprive the student of the
choice to become an officer in the military.
Rather, we seek to change the procedures

overall positions to be so substantively different
that a fair presentation could only be made in
separate reports. Accordingly, the Committee re
port to the Senate is in two parts, a majority and
a minority report.
The majority finds that the ROTC depart
ments are, by their nature, incompatible with the
University's primary commitment to the unre
stricted creation and dissemination of knowledge
and recommends that, with due regard to exist
ing legal and moral commitments, the University
discontinue the presentation of ROTC depart
ment courses as a part of its formal on-campus
program, either with or without degree credit;
that the role of military personnel on campus be
limited to administrative, counseling and recruit
ment functions; that all on-campus military activ
ities be conducted in accordance with rules gov
erning voluntary activities. The minority report
finds that the ROTC programs, in substantially
their current form, are in the best interests of the
students, the University and the nation and rec
ommends that they remain a part of the aca
demic program of the University but that a num
ber of changes in their administration and presen

tation be implemented to bring them in closer
conformity with standard academic practice.

I. Definition
In seeking to define the proper relation of
the ROTC programs to Stanford University, the
majority became aware of the necessity of de
fining its concept of the university. We realize
that such definitions have been subject to histor
ial change, and that no single definition has
gained universal agreement. The working defini
tion used in this report is that the university is a
community whose members, including both fac
ulty and students, have a primary commitment
to the creation and dissemination of knowledge,
in an pnvirnninpnt of fr-uo Snfnllophiul ortlvifir
Service to concerns and interests beyond the
university, we believe, is entirely proper, but the
university should participate institutionally in
such service only insofar as it is consistent with
this definition. External sanctions and defini
tions of the university's roles, obligations,
duties, etc., are valid only if, and only so long
as, they coincide with the values and premises
generated within Stanford, by the Stanford
community.
11. Preliminary Considerations
We examined ROTC as a program within the
institution of Stanford University, and the basis
for our objections is institutional. It is impor
tant to draw the distinction between the larger
objectives which ROTC serves and the vehicle
(ROTC) which is the means to that end. ROTC
is an important mechanism for procuring junior
officers to staff the armed forces of the United
States. The military requires a constant supply
of well-educated officers and ROTC serves that
need with programs of recruitment and training
on many of the nation's college and university
campuses.
We believe, however, that there are important
differences between educated men and educated
officers. Stanford best serves its own purpose
and the interests of the nation when it strives to
educate men in the way it is best prepared to
do, and when it openly acknowledges that it
cannot provide all men with all the education
they seek. In turn, some of the men whom Stan
ford educates will choose to become military
officers. It does not follow, however, that Stan
ford must provide these men with the education
specifically required by military officers. The
armed forces acknowledge this fact by requiring
that military training supplement general educa
tion. The military does not recruit officers;
rather, educated men interested in becoming
officers are recruited so that the armed forces
may develop them into educated officers.
The institutional foundation for our objec
tions leads us to exclude political criteria from
our report. We did not attempt to pass judge
ment on the objectives of the Department of
Defense or their relation to the social interests
of the nation. Nor did we measure the degree to
which ROTC serves either of these two pur
poses. To exclude these considerations from our
recommendations merely recognizes the fact
that such an undertaking would have been fruit
less. From our institutional perspective, such
political or normative evaluations would have
provided neither necessary nor sufficient justifi
cation for the inclusion, exclusion, or alterna
tion of ROTC at Stanford University.
The Maiority also consciously sought to ex
clude personal feeling about the war in Vietnam
from its deliberations. Though testimony was
heard which suggested an inconsistency between
opposition to the present war and continuation
of ROTC at Stanford, the Majority was uncon
vinced by the argument, and still believes that
no specific institutional response must neces
sarily follow from the opinion or beliefs of in
dividuals within that institution. Undoubtedly,
contemporary sensitivity to the Vietnam War, in
part, gave impetus to the concern which led to
this committee's assignment. What is lamentable
about this fact is the apparent need for crisis
before a university is moved to examine itself.
(See page 4 of the SES Report, No. 1.) It is our
conviction that these recommendations will
serve well this institution and society in times of
peace as well as war.
Lastly, it has been suggested that the institu
tional basis of our objections blinds us to the
wishes and preferences of individual students.
The argument is made that the Committee has
no right, through its recommendations, to limit
a student's freedom to choose a particular
course of study or career objective. The Major
ity has no desire to deprive the student of the
choice to become an officer in the military.
Rather, we seek to change the procedures
through which a student must pass in order to
become an officer, only insofar as they relate to
Stanford. Since this University can never offer
all possible alternatives, to be realized in all pos
sible ways, the question of total freedom of
choice is not pertinent (Stanford, for example,
does not offer programs in agriculture, hotel
management, etc.) Beyond our recommenda
tions, which would still allow Stanford students
to be recruited as junior officers, the Majority
wishes to call attention to such programs as
Officer Candidate School and the military
academies as at least two other avenues for stu
dents who desire to become officers.
111. General and Specific Objections to
Present Stanford-ROTC Relations
In considering the place of ROTC—or indeed
any program—at Stanford, the first standard to
be applied is whether or not that program is com
patible with the concept of the University as de
fined, autonomously, by Stanford itself. All
members of the Committee and all witnesses ap
pearing before it, acknowledge that present
ROTC practices depart from general University
practice in many areas. Some have suggested to
the Committee that the very constellation of
problems is a kind of ipso facto case against
ROTC. While not accepting this view at face
value, we have found that anomalies and excep
tions to prevailing practice exist academically,
structurally, contractually and in matters of per
sonnel.
A great number of changes have been sug
gested to bring the ROTC programs into closer
conformity with accepted practice, many of
them on the initiative of the armed forces and
the ROTC programs themselves. These have been
most extensive in, but not limited to, the aca
demic area: curriculum planning, course credit,
content, and substitution. It seems clear that the
implementation of these changes would represent
definite improvement, perhaps eliminating some
problems and reducing others.
But even if all these alterations are in fact
made, there will still remain a residuum of
anomaly. In the Majority's view, the crucial ques
tion before the Stanford community is whether
or not this residuum is compatible with Stanford
University—or at least compatible enough to be
acceptable. The conclusion of the Majority, after
weighing the evidence, is that as a formal, on
campus program, sponsored, sanctioned, and par
tially supported by Stanford University, the
ROTC program is not compatible with the Uni
versity. Moreover, this incompatibility is inherent
in the very nature of the ROTC programs, and
therefore cannot be removed by various changes
which are from time to time proposed.
Before going further, the Majority wishes to
say that it recognizes the existence of anomaly
and exception elsewhere in the University. But to
justify the one by the other is clearly fallacious.
If it seems to be singling out ROTC, this is only
PREAMBLE
The Ad Hoc Senate Committee on ROTC was
appointed by a letter of October 17, 1968, rom
the chairman of the Senate Committee on Com
mittees. The appointment followed the Senate
action of September 26, 1968, expressed in the
following resolution:
It is the sense of the Senate that the ROTC
program should be altered but that proper re
lations between the ROTC departments and
Stanford may be established by review and
reform of the present relations.
Therefore, the matter of such relations
should be recommitted to an ad hoc commit
tee which shall report recommendations no
later than January 15, 1969 ; and the matter
of this committee's charge shall be further dis
cussed at an early meeting of the Senate.
ROTC has a history of some 50 years at Stan
ford. An Army program was established in 1919;
Air Force and Navy programs were established in
1946. In the academic year 1958-59, the three
departments had a total enrollment of 732 stu
dents and commissioned 186 officers. In
1963-64, the corresponding numbers were 586
and 86; in 1967-68, they were 383 and 98. In
1967-68, there were 125 students on full tuition

scholarships. Currently, the ROTC programs
operate under the federal statute known as the
"Reserve Officers' Training Corps Vitalization
Act of 1964." Stanford and each military depart
ment have negotiated a contract stipulating the
terms and conditions under which the particular
ROTC program shall operate at Stanford.
In its study of the details of the ROTC pro
grams and the relationship between the ROTC
departments and the University, the Committee
held 12 meetings from October 28, 1968, to
February 3, 1969. At these meetings of the
whole Committee, as well as at many subcommit
tee meetings, scores of documents were exam
ined, covering such matters as relevant legisla
tion, contractual agreements between military
departments and the University and between mil
itary departments and students, and procedures
for appointment of teaching personnel to ROTC
departments.
The Committee also invited several members
of the Stanford community to present their
views on ROTC. Among those giving testimony
were Colonel Stanley M. Ramey, Department of
Military Science, Major Leon C. Heinle, Depart
ment of Aerospace Studies, Prof. Philip Rhine
lander, Philosophy, Prof. William Clebsch, Hu
manities, Mr. Lauress Wise, Military Programs Co

ordinator at Stanford, Mr. Allan Strain, Draft
Counselor in the Office of Special Services at
Stanford, and Prof. Barton Bernstein, History. In
ddition, on January 16, an all-campus open
hearing on ROTC was held in the Meyer Library.
Because it was common knowledge that sev
eral universities were also in the process of re
viewing the ROTC programs, one of the Commit
tee members contacted a number of institutions
and asked for information on their current posi
tion. The information received is summarized in
an appendix to this report.
As the study and discussion of various issues
progressed, the Committee found that three basic
positions could be defined: (1) the University
should dissociate itself completely from the
ROTC programs; (2) the University should re
move military education and training as formal,
on-campus programs; (3) the University should
preserve the present relationship in its essential
form but proceed to implement several changes
designed to make the ROTC programs more
closely conform to academic practice at Stan
ford.
No member of the Committee supported the
first of these positions. The members were clear
ly divided, however, on a choice between the
second and third. Although in discussions of sev

eral individual issues, there were often consider
able agreement on the need for change and the
nature of the change, the members found their
overall positions to be so substantively different
that a fair presentation could only be made in
separate reports. Accordingly, the Committee re
port to the Senate is in two parts, a majority and
a minority report.
The majority finds that the ROTC depart
ments are, by their nature, incompatible with the
University's primary commitment to the unre
stricted creation and dissemination of knowledge
and recommends that, with due regard to exist
ing legal and moral commitments, the University
discontinue the presentation of ROTC depart

The Ad Hoc Senate Committee on ROTC was
appointed by a letter of October 17, 1968, rom
the chairman of the Senate Committee on Com
mittees. The appointment followed the Senate
action of September 26, 1968, expressed in the
following resolution:
It is the sense of the Senate that the ROTC
program should be altered but that proper re
lations between the ROTC departments and
Stanford may be established by review and
reform of the present relations.
Therefore, the matter of such relations
should be recommitted to an ad hoc commit
tee which shall report recommendations no
later than January 15, 1969 ; and the matter
of this committee's charge shall be further dis
cussed at an early meeting of the Senate.
ROTC has a history of some 50 years at Stan
ford. An Army program was established in 1919;
Air Force and Navy programs were established in
1946. In the academic year 1958-59, the three
departments had a total enrollment of 732 stu
dents and commissioned 186 officers. In
1963-64, the corresponding numbers were 586
and 86; in 1967-68, they were 383 and 98. In
1967-68, there were 125 students on full tuition

scholarships. Currently, the ROTC programs
operate under the federal statute known as the
"Reserve Officers' Training Corps Vitalization
Act of 1964." Stanford and each military depart
ment have negotiated a contract stipulating the
terms and conditions under which the particular
ROTC program shall operate at Stanford.
In its study of the details of the ROTC pro
grams and the relationship between the ROTC
departments and the University, the Committee
held 12 meetings from October 28, 1968, to
February 3, 1969. At these meetings of the
whole Committee, as well as at many subcommit
tee meetings, scores of documents were exam
ined, covering such matters as relevant legisla
tion, contractual agreements between military
departments and the University and between mil
itary departments and students, and procedures
for appointment of teaching personnel to ROTC
departments.
The Committee also invited several members
of the Stanford community to present their
views on ROTC. Among those giving testimony
were Colonel Stanley M. Ramey, Department of
Military Science, Major Leon C. Heinle, Depart
ment of Aerospace Studies, Prof. Philip Rhine
lander, Philosophy, Prof. William Clebsch, Hu
manities, Mr. Lauress Wise, Military Programs Co

ordinator at Stanford, Mr. Allan Strain, Draft
Counselor in the Office of Special Services at
Stanford, and Prof. Barton Bernstein, History. In
ddition, on January 16, an all-campus open
hearing on ROTC was held in the Meyer Library.
Because it was common knowledge that sev
eral universities were also in the process of re
viewing the ROTC programs, one of the Commit
tee members contacted a number of institutions
and asked for information on their current posi
tion. The information received is summarized in
an appendix to this report.
As the study and discussion of various issues
progressed, the Committee found that three basic
positions could be defined: (1) the University
should dissociate itself completely from the
ROTC programs; (2) the University should re
move military education and training as formal,
on-campus programs; (3) the University should
preserve the present relationship in its essential
form but proceed to implement several changes
designed to make the ROTC programs more
closely conform to academic practice at Stan
ford.
No member of the Committee supported the
first of these positions. The members were clear
ly divided, however, on a choice between the
second and third. Although in discussions of sev

eral individual issues, there were often consider
able agreement on the need for change and the
nature of the change, the members found their
overall positions to be so substantively different
that a fair presentation could only be made in
separate reports. Accordingly, the Committee re
port to the Senate is in two parts, a majority and
a minority report.
The majority finds that the ROTC depart
ments are, by their nature, incompatible with the
University's primary commitment to the unre
stricted creation and dissemination of knowledge
and recommends that, with due regard to exist
ing legal and moral commitments, the University
discontinue the presentation of ROTC depart
ment courses as a part of its formal on-campus
program, either with or without degree credit;
that the role of military personnel on campus be
limited to administrative, counseling and recruit
ment functions; that all on-campus military activ
ities be conducted in accordance with rules gov
erning voluntary activities. The minority report
finds that the ROTC programs, in substantially
their current form, are in the best interests of the
students, the University and the nation and rec
ommends that they remain a part of the aca
demic program of the University but that a num
ber of changes in their administration and presen

tation be implemented to bring them in closer
conformity with standard academic practice.

Stanford-ROTC arrangements

V. Recommendations
I. Definition
In seeking to define the proper relation of
the ROTC programs to Stanford University, the
majority became aware of the necessity of de
fining its concept of the university. We realize
that such definitions have been subject to histor
ial change, and that no single definition has
gained universal agreement. The working defini
tion used in this report is that the university is a
community whose members, including both fac
ulty and students, have a primary commitment
to the creation and dissemination of knowledge,
in an pnvirnninpnt of fr-uo Snfnllophiul ortlvifir
Service to concerns and interests beyond the
university, we believe, is entirely proper, but the
university should participate institutionally in
such service only insofar as it is consistent with
this definition. External sanctions and defini
tions of the university's roles, obligations,
duties, etc., are valid only if, and only so long
as, they coincide with the values and premises
generated within Stanford, by the Stanford
community.
11. Preliminary Considerations
We examined ROTC as a program within the
institution of Stanford University, and the basis
for our objections is institutional. It is impor
tant to draw the distinction between the larger
objectives which ROTC serves and the vehicle
(ROTC) which is the means to that end. ROTC
is an important mechanism for procuring junior
officers to staff the armed forces of the United
States. The military requires a constant supply
of well-educated officers and ROTC serves that
need with programs of recruitment and training
on many of the nation's college and university
campuses.
We believe, however, that there are important
differences between educated men and educated
officers. Stanford best serves its own purpose
and the interests of the nation when it strives to
educate men in the way it is best prepared to
do, and when it openly acknowledges that it
cannot provide all men with all the education
they seek. In turn, some of the men whom Stan
ford educates will choose to become military
officers. It does not follow, however, that Stan
ford must provide these men with the education
specifically required by military officers. The
armed forces acknowledge this fact by requiring
that military training supplement general educa
tion. The military does not recruit officers;
rather, educated men interested in becoming
officers are recruited so that the armed forces
may develop them into educated officers.
The institutional foundation for our objec
tions leads us to exclude political criteria from
our report. We did not attempt to pass judge
ment on the objectives of the Department of
Defense or their relation to the social interests
of the nation. Nor did we measure the degree to
which ROTC serves either of these two pur
poses. To exclude these considerations from our
recommendations merely recognizes the fact
that such an undertaking would have been fruit
less. From our institutional perspective, such
political or normative evaluations would have
provided neither necessary nor sufficient justifi
cation for the inclusion, exclusion, or alterna
tion of ROTC at Stanford University.
The Maiority also consciously sought to ex
clude personal feeling about the war in Vietnam
from its deliberations. Though testimony was
heard which suggested an inconsistency between
opposition to the present war and continuation
of ROTC at Stanford, the Majority was uncon
vinced by the argument, and still believes that
no specific institutional response must neces
sarily follow from the opinion or beliefs of in
dividuals within that institution. Undoubtedly,
contemporary sensitivity to the Vietnam War, in
part, gave impetus to the concern which led to
this committee's assignment. What is lamentable
about this fact is the apparent need for crisis
before a university is moved to examine itself.
(See page 4 of the SES Report, No. 1.) It is our
conviction that these recommendations will
serve well this institution and society in times of
peace as well as war.
Lastly, it has been suggested that the institu
tional basis of our objections blinds us to the
wishes and preferences of individual students.
The argument is made that the Committee has
no right, through its recommendations, to limit
a student's freedom to choose a particular
course of study or career objective. The Major
ity has no desire to deprive the student of the
choice to become an officer in the military.
Rather, we seek to change the procedures
through which a student must pass in order to
become an officer, only insofar as they relate to
Stanford. Since this University can never offer
all possible alternatives, to be realized in all pos
sible ways, the question of total freedom of
choice is not pertinent (Stanford, for example,
does not offer programs in agriculture, hotel
management, etc.) Beyond our recommenda
tions, which would still allow Stanford students
to be recruited as junior officers, the Majority
wishes to call attention to such programs as
Officer Candidate School and the military
academies as at least two other avenues for stu
dents who desire to become officers.
111. General and Specific Objections to
Present Stanford-ROTC Relations
In considering the place of ROTC—or indeed
any program—at Stanford, the first standard to
be applied is whether or not that program is com
patible with the concept of the University as de
fined, autonomously, by Stanford itself. All
members of the Committee and all witnesses ap
pearing before it, acknowledge that present
ROTC practices depart from general University
practice in many areas. Some have suggested to
the Committee that the very constellation of
problems is a kind of ipso facto case against
ROTC. While not accepting this view at face
value, we have found that anomalies and excep
tions to prevailing practice exist academically,
structurally, contractually and in matters of per
sonnel.
A great number of changes have been sug
gested to bring the ROTC programs into closer
conformity with accepted practice, many of
them on the initiative of the armed forces and
the ROTC programs themselves. These have been
most extensive in, but not limited to, the aca
demic area: curriculum planning, course credit,
content, and substitution. It seems clear that the
implementation of these changes would represent
definite improvement, perhaps eliminating some
problems and reducing others.
But even if all these alterations are in fact
made, there will still remain a residuum of
anomaly. In the Majority's view, the crucial ques
tion before the Stanford community is whether
or not this residuum is compatible with Stanford
University—or at least compatible enough to be
acceptable. The conclusion of the Majority, after
weighing the evidence, is that as a formal, on
campus program, sponsored, sanctioned, and par
tially supported by Stanford University, the
ROTC program is not compatible with the Uni
versity. Moreover, this incompatibility is inherent
in the very nature of the ROTC programs, and
therefore cannot be removed by various changes
which are from time to time proposed.
Before going further, the Majority wishes to
say that it recognizes the existence of anomaly
and exception elsewhere in the University. But to
justify the one by the other is clearly fallacious.
If it seems to be singling out ROTC, this is only

of the nation. Nor did we measure the degree to
which ROTC serves either of these two pur

recommendations merely recognizes the fact
that such an undertaking would have been fruit
less. From our institutional perspective, such
political or normative evaluations would have
provided neither necessary nor sufficient justifi
cation for the inclusion, exclusion, or alterna
tion of ROTC at Stanford University.
The Maiority also consciously sought to ex
clude personal feeling about the war in Vietnam
from its deliberations. Though testimony was
heard which suggested an inconsistency between
opposition to the present war and continuation
of ROTC at Stanford, the Majority was uncon
vinced by the argument, and still believes that
no specific institutional response must neces
sarily follow from the opinion or beliefs of in
dividuals within that institution. Undoubtedly,
contemporary sensitivity to the Vietnam War, in
part, gave impetus to the concern which led to
this committee's assignment. What is lamentable
about this fact is the apparent need for crisis
before a university is moved to examine itself.
(See page 4 of the SES Report, No. 1.) It is our
conviction that these recommendations will
serve well this institution and society in times of
peace as well as war.
Lastly, it has been suggested that the institu
tional basis of our objections blinds us to the
wishes and preferences of individual students.
The argument is made that the Committee has
no right, through its recommendations, to limit
a student's freedom to choose a particular
course of study or career objective. The Major
ity has no desire to deprive the student of the
choice to become an officer in the military.
Rather, we seek to change the procedures
through which a student must pass in order to
become an officer, only insofar as they relate to
Stanford. Since this University can never offer
all possible alternatives, to be realized in all pos
sible ways, the question of total freedom of
choice is not pertinent (Stanford, for example,
does not offer programs in agriculture, hotel
management, etc.) Beyond our recommenda
tions, which would still allow Stanford students
to be recruited as junior officers, the Majority
wishes to call attention to such programs as
Officer Candidate School and the military
academies as at least two other avenues for stu
dents who desire to become officers.
111. General and Specific Objections to
Present Stanford-ROTC Relations
In considering the place of ROTC—or indeed
any program—at Stanford, the first standard to
be applied is whether or not that program is com
patible with the concept of the University as de
fined, autonomously, by Stanford itself. All
members of the Committee and all witnesses ap
pearing before it, acknowledge that present
ROTC practices depart from general University
practice in many areas. Some have suggested to
the Committee that the very constellation of
problems is a kind of ipso facto case against
ROTC. While not accepting this view at face
value, we have found that anomalies and excep
tions to prevailing practice exist academically,
structurally, contractually and in matters of per
sonnel.
A great number of changes have been sug
gested to bring the ROTC programs into closer
conformity with accepted practice, many of
them on the initiative of the armed forces and
the ROTC programs themselves. These have been
most extensive in, but not limited to, the aca
demic area: curriculum planning, course credit,
content, and substitution. It seems clear that the
implementation of these changes would represent
definite improvement, perhaps eliminating some
problems and reducing others.
But even if all these alterations are in fact
made, there will still remain a residuum of
anomaly. In the Majority's view, the crucial ques
tion before the Stanford community is whether
or not this residuum is compatible with Stanford
University—or at least compatible enough to be
acceptable. The conclusion of the Majority, after
weighing the evidence, is that as a formal, on
campus program, sponsored, sanctioned, and par
tially supported by Stanford University, the
ROTC program is not compatible with the Uni
versity. Moreover, this incompatibility is inherent
in the very nature of the ROTC programs, and
therefore cannot be removed by various changes
which are from time to time proposed.
Before going further, the Majority wishes to
say that it recognizes the existence of anomaly
and exception elsewhere in the University. But to
justify the one by the other is clearly fallacious.
If it seems to be singling out ROTC, this is only
PREAMBLE
The Ad Hoc Senate Committee on ROTC was
appointed by a letter of October 17, 1968, rom
the chairman of the Senate Committee on Com
mittees. The appointment followed the Senate
action of September 26, 1968, expressed in the
following resolution:
It is the sense of the Senate that the ROTC
program should be altered but that proper re
lations between the ROTC departments and
Stanford may be established by review and
reform of the present relations.
Therefore, the matter of such relations
should be recommitted to an ad hoc commit
tee which shall report recommendations no
later than January 15, 1969 ; and the matter
of this committee's charge shall be further dis
cussed at an early meeting of the Senate.
ROTC has a history of some 50 years at Stan
ford. An Army program was established in 1919;
Air Force and Navy programs were established in
1946. In the academic year 1958-59, the three
departments had a total enrollment of 732 stu
dents and commissioned 186 officers. In
1963-64, the corresponding numbers were 586
and 86; in 1967-68, they were 383 and 98. In
1967-68, there were 125 students on full tuition

scholarships. Currently, the ROTC programs
operate under the federal statute known as the
"Reserve Officers' Training Corps Vitalization
Act of 1964." Stanford and each military depart
ment have negotiated a contract stipulating the
terms and conditions under which the particular
ROTC program shall operate at Stanford.
In its study of the details of the ROTC pro
grams and the relationship between the ROTC
departments and the University, the Committee
held 12 meetings from October 28, 1968, to
February 3, 1969. At these meetings of the
whole Committee, as well as at many subcommit
tee meetings, scores of documents were exam
ined, covering such matters as relevant legisla
tion, contractual agreements between military
departments and the University and between mil
itary departments and students, and procedures
for appointment of teaching personnel to ROTC
departments.
The Committee also invited several members
of the Stanford community to present their
views on ROTC. Among those giving testimony
were Colonel Stanley M. Ramey, Department of
Military Science, Major Leon C. Heinle, Depart
ment of Aerospace Studies, Prof. Philip Rhine
lander, Philosophy, Prof. William Clebsch, Hu
manities, Mr. Lauress Wise, Military Programs Co

ordinator at Stanford, Mr. Allan Strain, Draft
Counselor in the Office of Special Services at
Stanford, and Prof. Barton Bernstein, History. In
ddition, on January 16, an all-campus open
hearing on ROTC was held in the Meyer Library.
Because it was common knowledge that sev
eral universities were also in the process of re
viewing the ROTC programs, one of the Commit
tee members contacted a number of institutions
and asked for information on their current posi
tion. The information received is summarized in
an appendix to this report.
As the study and discussion of various issues
progressed, the Committee found that three basic
positions could be defined: (1) the University
should dissociate itself completely from the
ROTC programs; (2) the University should re
move military education and training as formal,
on-campus programs; (3) the University should
preserve the present relationship in its essential
form but proceed to implement several changes
designed to make the ROTC programs more
closely conform to academic practice at Stan
ford.
No member of the Committee supported the
first of these positions. The members were clear
ly divided, however, on a choice between the
second and third. Although in discussions of sev

eral individual issues, there were often consider
able agreement on the need for change and the
nature of the change, the members found their
overall positions to be so substantively different
that a fair presentation could only be made in
separate reports. Accordingly, the Committee re
port to the Senate is in two parts, a majority and
a minority report.
The majority finds that the ROTC depart
ments are, by their nature, incompatible with the
University's primary commitment to the unre
stricted creation and dissemination of knowledge
and recommends that, with due regard to exist
ing legal and moral commitments, the University
discontinue the presentation of ROTC depart
ment courses as a part of its formal on-campus
program, either with or without degree credit;
that the role of military personnel on campus be
limited to administrative, counseling and recruit
ment functions; that all on-campus military activ
ities be conducted in accordance with rules gov
erning voluntary activities. The minority report
finds that the ROTC programs, in substantially
their current form, are in the best interests of the
students, the University and the nation and rec
ommends that they remain a part of the aca
demic program of the University but that a num
ber of changes in their administration and presen

tation be implemented to bring them in closer
conformity with standard academic practice.

AD HOC SENATE COMMITTEE ON ROTC

II. Preliminary considerations
III. General and specific objections to the pres-
Stanford-ROTC arrangements
IV. Objections to ROTC as an organized, non
credit, on-campus program
V. Recommendations
I. Definition
In seeking to define the proper relation of
the ROTC programs to Stanford University, the
majority became aware of the necessity of de
fining its concept of the university. We realize
that such definitions have been subject to histor
ial change, and that no single definition has
gained universal agreement. The working defini
tion used in this report is that the university is a
community whose members, including both fac
ulty and students, have a primary commitment
to the creation and dissemination of knowledge,
in an pnvirnninpnt of fr-uo Snfnllophiul ortlvifir
Service to concerns and interests beyond the
university, we believe, is entirely proper, but the
university should participate institutionally in
such service only insofar as it is consistent with
this definition. External sanctions and defini
tions of the university's roles, obligations,
duties, etc., are valid only if, and only so long
as, they coincide with the values and premises
generated within Stanford, by the Stanford
community.
11. Preliminary Considerations
We examined ROTC as a program within the
institution of Stanford University, and the basis
for our objections is institutional. It is impor
tant to draw the distinction between the larger
objectives which ROTC serves and the vehicle
(ROTC) which is the means to that end. ROTC
is an important mechanism for procuring junior
officers to staff the armed forces of the United
States. The military requires a constant supply
of well-educated officers and ROTC serves that
need with programs of recruitment and training
on many of the nation's college and university
campuses.
We believe, however, that there are important
differences between educated men and educated
officers. Stanford best serves its own purpose
and the interests of the nation when it strives to
educate men in the way it is best prepared to
do, and when it openly acknowledges that it
cannot provide all men with all the education
they seek. In turn, some of the men whom Stan
ford educates will choose to become military
officers. It does not follow, however, that Stan
ford must provide these men with the education
specifically required by military officers. The
armed forces acknowledge this fact by requiring
that military training supplement general educa
tion. The military does not recruit officers;
rather, educated men interested in becoming
officers are recruited so that the armed forces
may develop them into educated officers.
The institutional foundation for our objec
tions leads us to exclude political criteria from
our report. We did not attempt to pass judge
ment on the objectives of the Department of
Defense or their relation to the social interests
of the nation. Nor did we measure the degree to
which ROTC serves either of these two pur
poses. To exclude these considerations from our
recommendations merely recognizes the fact
that such an undertaking would have been fruit
less. From our institutional perspective, such
political or normative evaluations would have
provided neither necessary nor sufficient justifi
cation for the inclusion, exclusion, or alterna
tion of ROTC at Stanford University.
The Maiority also consciously sought to ex
clude personal feeling about the war in Vietnam
from its deliberations. Though testimony was
heard which suggested an inconsistency between
opposition to the present war and continuation
of ROTC at Stanford, the Majority was uncon
vinced by the argument, and still believes that
no specific institutional response must neces
sarily follow from the opinion or beliefs of in
dividuals within that institution. Undoubtedly,
contemporary sensitivity to the Vietnam War, in
part, gave impetus to the concern which led to
this committee's assignment. What is lamentable
about this fact is the apparent need for crisis
before a university is moved to examine itself.
(See page 4 of the SES Report, No. 1.) It is our
conviction that these recommendations will
serve well this institution and society in times of
peace as well as war.
Lastly, it has been suggested that the institu
tional basis of our objections blinds us to the
wishes and preferences of individual students.
The argument is made that the Committee has
no right, through its recommendations, to limit
a student's freedom to choose a particular
course of study or career objective. The Major
ity has no desire to deprive the student of the
choice to become an officer in the military.

ly divided, however, on a choice between the
second and third. Although in discussions of sev

eral individual issues, there were often consider
able agreement on the need for change and the
nature of the change, the members found their
overall positions to be so substantively different
that a fair presentation could only be made in
separate reports. Accordingly, the Committee re
port to the Senate is in two parts, a majority and
a minority report.
The majority finds that the ROTC depart
ments are, by their nature, incompatible with the
University's primary commitment to the unre
stricted creation and dissemination of knowledge
and recommends that, with due regard to exist
ing legal and moral commitments, the University
discontinue the presentation of ROTC depart
ment courses as a part of its formal on-campus
program, either with or without degree credit;
that the role of military personnel on campus be
limited to administrative, counseling and recruit
ment functions; that all on-campus military activ
ities be conducted in accordance with rules gov
erning voluntary activities. The minority report
finds that the ROTC programs, in substantially
their current form, are in the best interests of the
students, the University and the nation and rec
ommends that they remain a part of the aca
demic program of the University but that a num
ber of changes in their administration and presen

tation be implemented to bring them in closer
conformity with standard academic practice.

I. Definition
In seeking to define the proper relation of
the ROTC programs to Stanford University, the
majority became aware of the necessity of de
fining its concept of the university. We realize
that such definitions have been subject to histor
ial change, and that no single definition has
gained universal agreement. The working defini
tion used in this report is that the university is a
community whose members, including both fac
ulty and students, have a primary commitment
to the creation and dissemination of knowledge,
in an pnvirnninpnt of fr-uo Snfnllophiul ortlvifir
Service to concerns and interests beyond the
university, we believe, is entirely proper, but the
university should participate institutionally in
such service only insofar as it is consistent with
this definition. External sanctions and defini
tions of the university's roles, obligations,
duties, etc., are valid only if, and only so long
as, they coincide with the values and premises
generated within Stanford, by the Stanford
community.
11. Preliminary Considerations
We examined ROTC as a program within the
institution of Stanford University, and the basis
for our objections is institutional. It is impor
tant to draw the distinction between the larger
objectives which ROTC serves and the vehicle
(ROTC) which is the means to that end. ROTC
is an important mechanism for procuring junior
officers to staff the armed forces of the United
States. The military requires a constant supply
of well-educated officers and ROTC serves that
need with programs of recruitment and training
on many of the nation's college and university
campuses.
We believe, however, that there are important
differences between educated men and educated
officers. Stanford best serves its own purpose
and the interests of the nation when it strives to
educate men in the way it is best prepared to
do, and when it openly acknowledges that it
cannot provide all men with all the education
they seek. In turn, some of the men whom Stan
ford educates will choose to become military
officers. It does not follow, however, that Stan
ford must provide these men with the education
specifically required by military officers. The
armed forces acknowledge this fact by requiring
that military training supplement general educa
tion. The military does not recruit officers;
rather, educated men interested in becoming
officers are recruited so that the armed forces
may develop them into educated officers.
The institutional foundation for our objec
tions leads us to exclude political criteria from
our report. We did not attempt to pass judge
ment on the objectives of the Department of
Defense or their relation to the social interests
of the nation. Nor did we measure the degree to
which ROTC serves either of these two pur
poses. To exclude these considerations from our
recommendations merely recognizes the fact
that such an undertaking would have been fruit
less. From our institutional perspective, such
political or normative evaluations would have
provided neither necessary nor sufficient justifi
cation for the inclusion, exclusion, or alterna
tion of ROTC at Stanford University.
The Maiority also consciously sought to ex
clude personal feeling about the war in Vietnam
from its deliberations. Though testimony was
heard which suggested an inconsistency between
opposition to the present war and continuation
of ROTC at Stanford, the Majority was uncon
vinced by the argument, and still believes that
no specific institutional response must neces
sarily follow from the opinion or beliefs of in
dividuals within that institution. Undoubtedly,
contemporary sensitivity to the Vietnam War, in
part, gave impetus to the concern which led to
this committee's assignment. What is lamentable
about this fact is the apparent need for crisis
before a university is moved to examine itself.
(See page 4 of the SES Report, No. 1.) It is our
conviction that these recommendations will
serve well this institution and society in times of
peace as well as war.
Lastly, it has been suggested that the institu
tional basis of our objections blinds us to the
wishes and preferences of individual students.
The argument is made that the Committee has
no right, through its recommendations, to limit
a student's freedom to choose a particular
course of study or career objective. The Major
ity has no desire to deprive the student of the
choice to become an officer in the military.
Rather, we seek to change the procedures
through which a student must pass in order to
become an officer, only insofar as they relate to
Stanford. Since this University can never offer
all possible alternatives, to be realized in all pos
sible ways, the question of total freedom of
choice is not pertinent (Stanford, for example,
does not offer programs in agriculture, hotel
management, etc.) Beyond our recommenda
tions, which would still allow Stanford students
to be recruited as junior officers, the Majority
wishes to call attention to such programs as
Officer Candidate School and the military
academies as at least two other avenues for stu
dents who desire to become officers.
111. General and Specific Objections to
Present Stanford-ROTC Relations
In considering the place of ROTC—or indeed
any program—at Stanford, the first standard to
be applied is whether or not that program is com
patible with the concept of the University as de
fined, autonomously, by Stanford itself. All
members of the Committee and all witnesses ap
pearing before it, acknowledge that present
ROTC practices depart from general University
practice in many areas. Some have suggested to
the Committee that the very constellation of
problems is a kind of ipso facto case against
ROTC. While not accepting this view at face
value, we have found that anomalies and excep
tions to prevailing practice exist academically,
structurally, contractually and in matters of per
sonnel.
A great number of changes have been sug
gested to bring the ROTC programs into closer
conformity with accepted practice, many of
them on the initiative of the armed forces and
the ROTC programs themselves. These have been
most extensive in, but not limited to, the aca
demic area: curriculum planning, course credit,
content, and substitution. It seems clear that the
implementation of these changes would represent
definite improvement, perhaps eliminating some
problems and reducing others.
But even if all these alterations are in fact
made, there will still remain a residuum of
anomaly. In the Majority's view, the crucial ques
tion before the Stanford community is whether
or not this residuum is compatible with Stanford
University—or at least compatible enough to be
acceptable. The conclusion of the Majority, after
weighing the evidence, is that as a formal, on
campus program, sponsored, sanctioned, and par
tially supported by Stanford University, the
ROTC program is not compatible with the Uni
versity. Moreover, this incompatibility is inherent
in the very nature of the ROTC programs, and
therefore cannot be removed by various changes
which are from time to time proposed.
Before going further, the Majority wishes to
say that it recognizes the existence of anomaly
and exception elsewhere in the University. But to
justify the one by the other is clearly fallacious.
If it seems to be singling out ROTC, this is only
