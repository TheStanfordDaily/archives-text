# ROTC
## 
### 
There is a tragic consistency in the in
ability or unwillingness of individuals and
institutions of this society to confront an
issue under anything less than the most
intense pressure. We need seek no further
than the issue of "Stanford-and-ROTC" for
a specific example. The majority report of
the Ad Hoc Senate Committee on ROTC
fully admits that "contemporary sensitivity
to the Vietnam War, in part, gave impetus
to the concern which led to this com
mittee's assignment. What is lamentable
about this fact is the apparent need for
crsis before a university is moved to ex
amine itself.'"
We endorse and support the recom
mendations of the majority contingent of
the committee. We view these proposals as
a positive, though inherently limited, im
provement on the status quo, and we
strongly urge their immediate adoption.
Predicated on and deriving from the stated
premises of the signatories, they are
probably the best possible recommenda
tions, or at least the best that could be
reasonably expected.
However, there is a bone of more
fundamental contention inherent in this
entire dispute-that is the whole question
of point of departure, of initial assump
tions and value judgments.
The majority group makes its positon
unmistakably clear: "The institutional
foundation of our objections leads us to
exclude political criteria from our report
. . .The majority also consciously sought to
exclude personal feeling about the war in
Vietnam from its deliberations. . .the
majority. . .still believes that no specific
institutional response must necessarily
follow from the opinions or beliefs of in
dividuals within that institution."
Most crucially, the report states, "The
Majority has emphasized the distinction
between ROTC as a mechanism and the
objectives which ROTC serves. Our argu
ments have been directed to the mech
anism, not the objectives or purposes."
Confronted with so specific a delineation,
it is incumbent upon us to be equally clear:
to this value framework, and to the im
plicitly concomitant view of the proper

role of the University, we stand unequiv
ocally opposed.
It is at least ironic that a virtually flaw
less articulation of our own values in this
connection should be found in the min
ority report, the conclusions and recom
mendations of which we find unacceptable:
"The University cannot be isolated from
the pressing problems of society, nor
should it be. One important set of prob
lems facing the country is that of foreign
and military policy. This has been so since
the establishment of the United States and
it can be assumed that it will continue to
be so for some time to come. . .We urge. .
that ROTC be judged in the context of a
reasonable estimate of the future."
In propounding the above view, we state
that the crucial point at issue is the anti
thetical relation of the goals of ROTC to
the goals of the University (a question
intentionally ignored in the majority re
port), and we relegate the discussion of
mechanics to a position of peripheral im
portance.
The report suffers from its failure to
consider questions of morality and to
stringently examine the purposes, avowed
and otherwise, of ROTC and the entire
military establishment of the United States,
both within this country and throughout
the world.
We contend this is indefensible abdica
tion of one of the most fundamental right
and duties of any University worthy of the
designation "educational institution." In
herent in the educational process is the
development of the faculty for critical
analysis, and no individual, institution, or
society may rightfully claim exemption
from this examination.
In the realm of concrete proposals, our
perception of the essential nature of ROTC
demands that it be discontinued as both an
academic and an extra-curricular program.
Purely informational considerations may
fall within the competence of the Student
Services Office, but the actual operation of
the program (recruitment, instruction, etc.)
must be based outside the University and
relate to the community in the manner of
any other entity whose interests are not
coincident with the furtherence of educa
tion.
