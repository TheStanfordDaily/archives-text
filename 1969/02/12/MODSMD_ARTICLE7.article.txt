## Mother Protests 
### 
Editor, THE DAILY:
Several weekends ago I visited
my son, a member of Beta Chi fra
ternity and a third generation
Stanfordite. I was in that fraterni
ty when the arrest referred to in
your article of Feb. 3, took place.
Friday afternoon while at the
house I went upstairs with the in
tention of going to rny son's
room. At the top of the stairwell
on the third floor I was stopped
by two men, one of whom de
manded that I halt stating that I
could not "pass this point" thus
preventing my entering my son's
room These men had a most bel
ligerent attitude and they gave no
explanation for their actions nor
in fact did they volunteer any in
formation whatsoever at any time.
From their attire it was not
possible to identify them as of
ficers of the law. I suppose you
would call them plainclothesmen
because they had on business
suits—all except one casually
dressed unkept young man whom
I had previously seen in and out
of various rooms of the house
during the day, although he ob
viously was not a fraternity mem
ber. That he was not a member
became glaringly apparent when
the house President arrived on the
scene to ask who these people
were. One man in a business suit
replied Sargent , and showed
his badge.
When the house President then
asked the casual young man who
he was, he answered with a very
hostile voice, "I don't have to tell
you who I am. I'm not arresting
anyone." Although he appeared
to be part of this plain-clothed
team, he was strangely dressed for
the part, it seemed to me.
Actually the attitude of all
these men was rude and inconsider
ate. I was frankly offended by
way they treated me ( a person
certainly not involved in whatever
their business was) And I was
shocked to see the boys at the
house harrassed in a fashion I
found distasteful to say the least.
Apparently the house membership
was no more involved than I in
whatever was going on because
nothing was done about them in
terms of arrest, instruction, etc.
But regardless of whether or not
some crime had been committed,
do innocent bystanders have to be
subjected to such treatment?
My understanding of the law is
that an officer, plain-clothes-man
or not, must either present a
search warrent or be invited in.
These men did neither. They
walked into the house without in
vitation or \ysrrent and treated
everyone as if they were giving
orders in a Fascist State.
Where is the due process of
law? It was not followed in this
instance, nor again, in fact, when
some of these same men returned
to the house Monday night. At
that time several of the fraternity
members saw them walk in the
front door, recognized them from
the previous Friday and asked if
they had a search warrent. The
question was ignored and they
proceeded to walk in, again unin
vited, through the house and up
to the top floor where I met them
outside my son's room. The house
President said he was told that if
he persisted in asking for warrents

they would arrest him for ob
structing justice.
The knowledge that harrass
ment of this type, warrented or
not, exists in American life is
shocking indeed. That it should
take place on the Stanford cam
pus is to me unbelievable. Since
its founding, Stanford has clung
to many traditions; in most cases
with good reason. Among these
generally permeates a feeling of
friendliness and trust. The Honor
Code, lack of proctors at exams,
unlocked doors and many more
are not only regarded with high
esteem but respected.
Please understand that I do not
in any way mean to criticize the
Stanford police. According to
your article they were not even
aware that these "law enforce
ment officers" were on campus at
the time of the arrest. But who
ever these men were who did
come to the house and whatever
their objective, they did not con
duct themselves with man
ners or consideration for others
whether others be innocent by
standers or not.

In regard to the Speech Asso
ciation bill, the Daily would do
well to leave the cries of "fiscal
irresponsibility" to Ronald
Reagan and consider the facts.
First, the money appropriated by
LASSU is spent on nearby tourna
ments where we enter as many
teams as possible. The University
grant is used for tournaments on
the east coast and in the midwest,
where only one or two teams can
be entered.
Secondly, the Speech Associ
ation has been forced to cancel a
large proportion of tournament
activity in the immediate area be
cause LASSU decreased its appro
priation last spring. These cancel
lations are harmful to the program
in that fewer students have an op
portunity to meet teams of high
quality and to improve their own
abilities.
Stanford has sent large dele
gations (twenty to forty students)
to those in-area tournaments
which we did attend and has used
student cars, youth fare, student
housing and all other means possi
ble to keep costs down.
May I add that these tourna
ments are not vacations. Debaters
spend an average of more than
twelve hours in competitive
rounds at these tournaments as
well as the many hours it takes to
prepare cases and arguments.

In regard to the Speech Asso
ciation bill, the Daily would do
well to leave the cries of "fiscal
irresponsibility" to Ronald
Reagan and consider the facts.
First, the money appropriated by
LASSU is spent on nearby tourna
ments where we enter as many
teams as possible. The University
grant is used for tournaments on
the east coast and in the midwest,
where only one or two teams can
be entered.
Secondly, the Speech Associ
ation has been forced to cancel a
large proportion of tournament
activity in the immediate area be
cause LASSU decreased its appro
priation last spring. These cancel
lations are harmful to the program
in that fewer students have an op
portunity to meet teams of high
quality and to improve their own
abilities.
Stanford has sent large dele
gations (twenty to forty students)
to those in-area tournaments
which we did attend and has used
student cars, youth fare, student
housing and all other means possi
ble to keep costs down.
May I add that these tourna
ments are not vacations. Debaters
spend an average of more than
twelve hours in competitive
rounds at these tournaments as
well as the many hours it takes to
prepare cases and arguments.

Several weekends ago I visited
my son, a member of Beta Chi fra
ternity and a third generation
Stanfordite. I was in that fraterni
ty when the arrest referred to in
your article of Feb. 3, took place.
Friday afternoon while at the
house I went upstairs with the in
tention of going to rny son's
room. At the top of the stairwell
on the third floor I was stopped
by two men, one of whom de
manded that I halt stating that I
could not "pass this point" thus
preventing my entering my son's
room These men had a most bel
ligerent attitude and they gave no
explanation for their actions nor
in fact did they volunteer any in
formation whatsoever at any time.
From their attire it was not
possible to identify them as of
ficers of the law. I suppose you
would call them plainclothesmen
because they had on business
suits—all except one casually
dressed unkept young man whom
I had previously seen in and out
of various rooms of the house
during the day, although he ob
viously was not a fraternity mem
ber. That he was not a member
became glaringly apparent when
the house President arrived on the
scene to ask who these people
were. One man in a business suit
replied Sargent , and showed
his badge.
When the house President then
asked the casual young man who
he was, he answered with a very
hostile voice, "I don't have to tell
you who I am. I'm not arresting
anyone." Although he appeared
to be part of this plain-clothed
team, he was strangely dressed for
the part, it seemed to me.
Actually the attitude of all
these men was rude and inconsider
ate. I was frankly offended by
way they treated me ( a person
certainly not involved in whatever
their business was) And I was
shocked to see the boys at the
house harrassed in a fashion I
found distasteful to say the least.
Apparently the house membership
was no more involved than I in
whatever was going on because
nothing was done about them in
terms of arrest, instruction, etc.
But regardless of whether or not
some crime had been committed,
do innocent bystanders have to be
subjected to such treatment?
My understanding of the law is
that an officer, plain-clothes-man
or not, must either present a
search warrent or be invited in.
These men did neither. They
walked into the house without in
vitation or \ysrrent and treated
everyone as if they were giving
orders in a Fascist State.
Where is the due process of
law? It was not followed in this
instance, nor again, in fact, when
some of these same men returned
to the house Monday night. At
that time several of the fraternity
members saw them walk in the
front door, recognized them from
the previous Friday and asked if
they had a search warrent. The
question was ignored and they
proceeded to walk in, again unin
vited, through the house and up
to the top floor where I met them
outside my son's room. The house
President said he was told that if
he persisted in asking for warrents

they would arrest him for ob
structing justice.
The knowledge that harrass
ment of this type, warrented or
not, exists in American life is
shocking indeed. That it should
take place on the Stanford cam
pus is to me unbelievable. Since
its founding, Stanford has clung
to many traditions; in most cases
with good reason. Among these
generally permeates a feeling of
friendliness and trust. The Honor
Code, lack of proctors at exams,
unlocked doors and many more
are not only regarded with high
esteem but respected.
Please understand that I do not
in any way mean to criticize the
Stanford police. According to
your article they were not even
aware that these "law enforce
ment officers" were on campus at
the time of the arrest. But who
ever these men were who did
come to the house and whatever
their objective, they did not con
duct themselves with man
ners or consideration for others
whether others be innocent by
standers or not.

vited, through the house and up
to the top floor where I met them
outside my son's room. The house
President said he was told that if
he persisted in asking for warrents

they would arrest him for ob
structing justice.
The knowledge that harrass
ment of this type, warrented or
not, exists in American life is
shocking indeed. That it should
take place on the Stanford cam
pus is to me unbelievable. Since
its founding, Stanford has clung
to many traditions; in most cases
with good reason. Among these
generally permeates a feeling of
friendliness and trust. The Honor
Code, lack of proctors at exams,
unlocked doors and many more
are not only regarded with high
esteem but respected.
Please understand that I do not
in any way mean to criticize the
Stanford police. According to
your article they were not even
aware that these "law enforce
ment officers" were on campus at
the time of the arrest. But who
ever these men were who did
come to the house and whatever
their objective, they did not con
duct themselves with man
ners or consideration for others
whether others be innocent by
standers or not.

In regard to the Speech Asso
ciation bill, the Daily would do
well to leave the cries of "fiscal
irresponsibility" to Ronald
Reagan and consider the facts.
First, the money appropriated by
LASSU is spent on nearby tourna
ments where we enter as many
teams as possible. The University
grant is used for tournaments on
the east coast and in the midwest,
where only one or two teams can
be entered.
Secondly, the Speech Associ
ation has been forced to cancel a
large proportion of tournament
activity in the immediate area be
cause LASSU decreased its appro
priation last spring. These cancel
lations are harmful to the program
in that fewer students have an op
portunity to meet teams of high
quality and to improve their own
abilities.
Stanford has sent large dele
gations (twenty to forty students)
to those in-area tournaments
which we did attend and has used
student cars, youth fare, student
housing and all other means possi
ble to keep costs down.
May I add that these tourna
ments are not vacations. Debaters
spend an average of more than
twelve hours in competitive
rounds at these tournaments as
well as the many hours it takes to
prepare cases and arguments.

Several weekends ago I visited
my son, a member of Beta Chi fra
ternity and a third generation
Stanfordite. I was in that fraterni
ty when the arrest referred to in
your article of Feb. 3, took place.
Friday afternoon while at the
house I went upstairs with the in
tention of going to rny son's
room. At the top of the stairwell
on the third floor I was stopped
by two men, one of whom de
manded that I halt stating that I
could not "pass this point" thus
preventing my entering my son's
room These men had a most bel
ligerent attitude and they gave no
explanation for their actions nor
in fact did they volunteer any in
formation whatsoever at any time.
From their attire it was not
possible to identify them as of
ficers of the law. I suppose you
would call them plainclothesmen
because they had on business
suits—all except one casually
dressed unkept young man whom
I had previously seen in and out
of various rooms of the house
during the day, although he ob
viously was not a fraternity mem
ber. That he was not a member
became glaringly apparent when
the house President arrived on the
scene to ask who these people
were. One man in a business suit
replied Sargent , and showed
his badge.
When the house President then
asked the casual young man who
he was, he answered with a very
hostile voice, "I don't have to tell
you who I am. I'm not arresting
anyone." Although he appeared
to be part of this plain-clothed
team, he was strangely dressed for
the part, it seemed to me.
Actually the attitude of all
these men was rude and inconsider
ate. I was frankly offended by
way they treated me ( a person
certainly not involved in whatever
their business was) And I was
shocked to see the boys at the
house harrassed in a fashion I
found distasteful to say the least.
Apparently the house membership
was no more involved than I in
whatever was going on because
nothing was done about them in
terms of arrest, instruction, etc.
But regardless of whether or not
some crime had been committed,
do innocent bystanders have to be
subjected to such treatment?
My understanding of the law is
that an officer, plain-clothes-man
or not, must either present a
search warrent or be invited in.
These men did neither. They
walked into the house without in
vitation or \ysrrent and treated
everyone as if they were giving
orders in a Fascist State.
Where is the due process of
law? It was not followed in this
instance, nor again, in fact, when
some of these same men returned
to the house Monday night. At
that time several of the fraternity
members saw them walk in the
front door, recognized them from
the previous Friday and asked if
they had a search warrent. The
question was ignored and they
proceeded to walk in, again unin
vited, through the house and up
