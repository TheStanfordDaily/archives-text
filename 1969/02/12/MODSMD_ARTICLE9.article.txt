# Dissenting Views Of ROTC Report
## 
### 
(The subject of today's editorial has
uncovered differences of opinion
among the staff. The editorial repre
sents the opinions of the editor and a
majority of the editorial committee.
The following presents dissenting views
from the other editors.—Ed.)
• Apolitical Stance Desirable
Universities, as institutions,
should be apolitical and dis
passionate. In every way that they
can, universities should divorce
themselves from the aims and con
cerns of the nation-state.
This is not to say that indi
viduals within the University
should be apolitical. It is desirable
to have many ideas propounded in
the University community; it is
odious to us to have the Uni
versity supporting them.
It is desirable to have the inter
ests and knowledge of ROTC
members; it is undesirable to have
the University directly support
ROTC through use of University
titles, facilities, and academic
credit.
ROTC is strictly a voluntary
political activity and should have
the same status on campus as any
other volunteer political activity.
Stanford has a policy for such
voluntary organizations and their
use of Univeristy facilities.
In the very way that Mid
peninsula Free University can con
duct its activities on this
campus- through a student sup
port group, ROTC can conduct its
activities as long as some students
wish it.
To purge ROTC from its cam
pus, a university sets a dangerous
precedent of removing political
groups from campus. Who would
be next? SDS? Young
Republicans?

There are some areas in which
the ROTC recommendations do
not sufficiently alter ROTC status
to a voluntary political activity,
but within this nation-state the re
port may offer the best short
range solution.
We support the ROTC Com
mittee majority report and urge
the Academic Senate to pass it
unanimously.

• Majority Goes Too Far
Those in the University com
munity who had hoped for a
speedy resolution of the ROTC
question with the release of the
Academic Senate committee re
port will be disappointed, as we
were, to read the minority and
majority positions.
The University should reso
lutely ascribe towards an apoliti
cal position.
But this is not an apolitical
world. Protestations to the con
trary are mere intellectual exer
cises on this politically aware cam
pus.
Some conflict does exist be
tween ROTC and the neutral char
acter of the University. This con
flict, contrary to the opinions ex
pressed by the majority of the
committee and The Daily edi
torial, is not irreconcilable.
Substantive changes are needed
in the program.
These changes, which we had
hoped the committee would have
recommended, should not unduly
restrict the opportunity for stu
dents to elect participation in the
ROTC program.
Banning ROTC from the col
lege campus is not the way to re
move the frustration of the Paris
peace talks in February or to re
gain student losses in Chicago last
August.

Instead, we fear, banning
ROTC from campus will lead to
an even less enlightened officer
corps. It might encourage the for
mation of a military clique which
—as has happened elsewhere—take
it upon itself to guide the nation's
policies, foreign and domestic.
Civilians cannot control this
country's military structure, un
less they understand the basic
nature of military service.
Stanford, as an institution of
free inquiry, needs more, not less,
contact and intellectual inter
change with the military. Concur
rent with this, we would hope
that the split opinion of the com
mittee during the latter part of
their deliberations is not indica
tive of a total breakdown in cam
pus communication on the sub
ject.
The irony and tragedy of the
divided opinion at this point is the
nature of responses and counter
responses to date. The situation is
rapidly escalating into one of in
tense anger and vindictiveness.
Quite clearly, the University is
deadlocking itself in a wild battle
for primacy of values.
In our view, students taking
part in the ROTC program should
not receive academic credit. How
ever, the departments should be
allowed use of university facilities
for teaching purposes.
Hopefully, in implementing
SES recommendations, the fac
ulty will apply the same scrutiny
to all other courses in the Univer
sity in ascertaining their true aca
demic value. There is a further
need, not only for students wish
ing to participate in ROTC, but
other extra-curricular activities as
well, for a more flexible academic
schedule.
To as great an extent as pos
sible, ROTC requirements should
be fulfilled by regular university

courses. In so far as this is infeas
ible, the remaining courses should
be offered by qualified military
personnel.
The military instructors would
not have any professorial ranking
and their courses would not be for
credit.
Given the split decision by the
committee, we see a need for a
clearer expression of student
opinion on the subject. Both re
ports fail to consider implications
for the individual student, for
whom the program was estab
lished and should continue to op
erate.
We urge President Pitzer, in his
final recommendation to the
Board of Trustees, to carefully
weigh all sides of the case.
A recommendation based on
narrowly-defined political, moral,
or philosophical considerations
will only extend the controversy.
The University cannot lend undue
weight to any one of the disparate
views held by members of the
campus community.
The statement by the majority
report that their recommenda
tions should not be "construed t.o
mean that the Majority believes
no proper relations can be estab
lished between the objectives
served by the existing depart
ments and Stanford" is very mis
leading. Regardless of their stated
objectives, the majority clearly
seeks to drive ROTC off campus.

• End All Government lies
The majority report on ROTC
is unacceptable. ROTC should be
nowhere present on the Stanford
campus. Furthermore, the logic of

not allowing ROTC on campus
needs to be followed through.
Just as the Reserve Officer Train
ing Corps should not recruit for
the government's foreign "police
actions," so the Peace Corps and
the Job Corps should not recruit
for the government's welfare
colonialsim.
According to Education and
Military Leadership, a 1959
Princeton study done by Lyons
and Masland, "taken in con
junction with the service aca
demies, the ROTC remains the
single federal program that de
liberately operates to allocate a
segment of American manpower
to meet a specific national re
quirement."
Some people at Stanford say:
"Let's not deny an existing alter
native that hundreds of students
use." But to understand free
choice is to understand that we
have no choice about the U.S.
Army, which conscripts our re
sources and our bodies.
Other people take the Uni
versity as it stands now as a zero
point and then say: "Let's not
change for fear of politicalizing
the University." But the Uni
versity has not been "above poli
tics" in the past, nor is it now.
The University's present role in
the social and political order bears
witness to that. Clark Kerr's Uses
of (he University is a celebration
of the fact that "taking the cam
pus to the state brings the state to
the campus." Kerr quotes a limer
ick from Don Price's Government
and Science. - There was a young
lady from Kent
Who said that she knew what it
meant
When men took her to dine,
Gave her cocktails and wine;
She knew what it meant but she
went.
It is time to end ROTC at Stan
ford.
