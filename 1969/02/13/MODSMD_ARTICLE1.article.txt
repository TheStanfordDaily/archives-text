# SJC Hearings Continue As Three Motions Denied
## 
### CRAIG WILSON 
Defendants at the second hearing of
the Stanford Judicial Council (SJC) suf
fered a minor setback last night as the
court overruled one motion for dis
missal of charges and dismissed two
others for a decision until "all the evi
dence is in."
The motions which were made in
Tuesday nights marathon eight hour
hearing claimed that the Campus Policy
on Disruption had expired prior to the
date of the January 14 fracas in ques
tion.
In the SJC ruling last night Chairman
Jack Friendenthal stated that the policy
was enforceable in fact and that it was
not subject to the 90-day expiration
date set by the Judicial Charter.
Two other points raised by Doron
Weinberg, a graduate student in law,
were also set aside.
Chairman Friedenthal said that the
point that Associate Dean of Students
Bill Wyman had not identified himself
when he began taking names the after
noon of the alleged disruption was not
yet completely substantiated.
In addition the question raised re
garding the possibility that the Funda
mental Standard could not have been
violated because the students were not
told of such a violation was dismissed
because this too was subject to further
testimony.
Friedenthal opened the second hear
ing last night with the stipulation that
"we want to continue the kind of open
proceedings we had last evening, but we
will not have the proceedings which oc
curred yesterday evening."
It soon became evident however that
the courtroom was in for much of the
same.
Posters On Wall
Posters of all sorts were posted on
the walls, a dogfight broke out early,
and the hearing was constantly charac
terized by interruptions either by vari
ous defendants or from the audience.

Tuesday evening the hearings re
ceived an early jolt when a guerilla thea
tre group marched into the proceedings
and left only at the urging of both the
court and the defendants.
At one point the lights were out for a
period of a couple minutes. Friedenthal
threatened to close the proceedings at
that time if order was not restored.
Last night the prosecution concluded
its case for the first half of the hearings
calling four witnesses including Dean of
Students Joel Smith and Bob Beyers
Director of the Stanford News Service.
At press time the students had just
opened their defense.
Divided In Two Sections
The hearings have been divided into
two sections, with the first part of the
hearings to delve into the facts and the
remaining half to deal with motives.
Beyers particularly was subjected to
a stiff cross-examination after defendant
Fred Cohen charged that he was "pre
judiced against me."
Beyers said of Cohen he "recalled
your voice having been the loudest and
the dominant single voice. You seemed
to me to be the dominant individual in
the hallway."
Beyers referred to a number of quo
tations he had jotted down in his notes
taken during the demonstration.
Remarks by Cohen
He stated that Fred Cohen made sev
eral remarks including one during the
demonstration: "I don't give a damn
about your policies. The Faculty Club is
run by the Trustees at their whimsey."
Beyers referred to remarks he said
that he heard Jim Johnson make*includ
ing "I might club you," directed to
Dean Wyman.
The charge of prejudice was' the
second leveled by Cohen in two nights.
Tuesday night he accused Associate
Dean Wyman of being prejudiced
"against me personally, against Black
and Jewish people, and against the radi
cal movement in general."
Education Paper Quoted
Cohen attempted to prove his point
quoting from a paper written by three
Stanford graduate students in education
December 9, 1968.
In that paper entitled "Student Ac

tivism: A Case Study of SDS at Stan
ford" the three cited an interview with
Dean VVyman in which he made consid
erable remarks.
In the interview VVyman said that
"the radicals on this campus want a
benevolent dictatorship."
"The sit-ins of today take the place
of the panty-raids and such shenanigans
of the 50's and the 20's.
Lytton Plaza Vigil
He quoted further, "I thought the
vigil in Lytton Plaza the night of the
election was a great idea; very effective.
Some of the students wanted to be ar
rested as martyrs.
"Take Fred Cohen for instance, he's
Jewish but would like nothing better
than to have black skin."
VVyman stated that the quotations
were accurate but that the statement
concerning Cohen specifically was some
thing he had heard a "Black man say
and had used because he agreed with
it."
It was during Wyman's testimony
that Weinberg, in his defense brought up
several points which he said were
grounds for dismissal of all charges.
Last nights hearings ended those
challenges, at least temporarily.
The hearings will resume again to
night at 4 p.m. in room 163E of the law
school.
