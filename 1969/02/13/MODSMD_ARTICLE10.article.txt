# Letters To The Editor
## Wyman Charges: Misquoted 
### 
Editor, THE DAILY:
With reference to the SJC hear
ings on Tuesday, February 11,
1969, we would like to make the
following clarifications:
1. In the cross-examination of
Dean Wyman by Fred
Cohen, alleged statements
by Dean Wyman were pre
sented to him for verifica
tion, namely,
a) The sit-ins of today take
the place of the panty
raids and such shenani
gans of the 50's & 20's.
b) Take Fred Cohen, for in
stance, he's Jewish, but
would like nothing bet
ter than to have black
skin.
These statements were taken
from the write-up of our two in
terviews with Dean Wyman in
October and November, 1968.
The interviews were conducted
for a class paper in the School of
Education.
2. It should be clearly under
stood that these were not
direct quotations, but
merely our own summa
tions of more than two
hours of conversation. We
took these summations out
of the context of the inter

a) In particular, the state
ment which refers to
Fred Cohen is a conden
sation of an anecdote
told to Mr. Wyman by
another student.
3. Statements from our sum
mary of the interview were
quoted by Fred Cohen out
of context. So, these state
ments have been twice
taken out of context.
Therefore, we do not feel
that these summations
should in any way be used
to judge Mr. Wyman's char
acter.
4. The appendix to the paper
was prepared to fulfill a
class assignment with abso
lutely no intent on our part
for any public display or
use. We deeply resent that
the appendix of the paper
was taken and used without
our consent, knowledge, or
any attempt to consult us as
to the exact nature of the
statements.

Editor, THE DAILY:
Jane Franklin's guest column
in Monday's Daily was nearly in
credible. Although it is not neces
sary to counter her groundless at
tacks on certain corporate of
fiipials and Stanford's "seizure" of
its own property, I do feel that
her call for the socialization of oil
industries cannot go unanswered.
Mrs. Franklin implied that oil
companies would not be allowed
to do offshore drilling if things
were run "for the general wel
fare". Although she now objects
to the danger of offshore drilling,
she naively has not yet noticed
the eyesore, stench, and danger
from fire and explosion due to on
shore drilling.
People like Mrs. Franklin
would soon stop drilling alto
gether and then wonder why their
socialist paradise could not keep
their cars running. Mrs. Franklin
thinks everything would be fine if
all production were controlled by
socially wise people like herself.
What does Mrs. Franklin know
about drilling an oil well?
Nothing. Isn't that right?

Dean Wyman by Fred
Cohen, alleged statements
by Dean Wyman were pre
sented to him for verifica
tion, namely,
a) The sit-ins of today take
the place of the panty
raids and such shenani
gans of the 50's & 20's.
b) Take Fred Cohen, for in
stance, he's Jewish, but
would like nothing bet
ter than to have black
skin.
These statements were taken
from the write-up of our two in
terviews with Dean Wyman in
October and November, 1968.
The interviews were conducted
for a class paper in the School of
Education.
2. It should be clearly under
stood that these were not
direct quotations, but
merely our own summa
tions of more than two
hours of conversation. We
took these summations out
of the context of the inter

a) In particular, the state
ment which refers to
Fred Cohen is a conden
sation of an anecdote
told to Mr. Wyman by
another student.
3. Statements from our sum
mary of the interview were
quoted by Fred Cohen out
of context. So, these state
ments have been twice
taken out of context.
Therefore, we do not feel
that these summations
should in any way be used
to judge Mr. Wyman's char
acter.
4. The appendix to the paper
was prepared to fulfill a
class assignment with abso
lutely no intent on our part
for any public display or
use. We deeply resent that
the appendix of the paper
was taken and used without
our consent, knowledge, or
any attempt to consult us as
to the exact nature of the
statements.

Editor, THE DAILY:
Jane Franklin's guest column
in Monday's Daily was nearly in
credible. Although it is not neces
sary to counter her groundless at
tacks on certain corporate of
fiipials and Stanford's "seizure" of
its own property, I do feel that
her call for the socialization of oil
industries cannot go unanswered.
Mrs. Franklin implied that oil
companies would not be allowed
to do offshore drilling if things
were run "for the general wel
fare". Although she now objects
to the danger of offshore drilling,
she naively has not yet noticed
the eyesore, stench, and danger
from fire and explosion due to on
shore drilling.
People like Mrs. Franklin
would soon stop drilling alto
gether and then wonder why their
socialist paradise could not keep
their cars running. Mrs. Franklin
thinks everything would be fine if
all production were controlled by
socially wise people like herself.
What does Mrs. Franklin know
about drilling an oil well?
Nothing. Isn't that right?
