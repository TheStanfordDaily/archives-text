# The 						Bad Mouth
## Myths And Realities 
### Johnie Scott 
High-pressure rhetoric and re
actionary chauvinism appear to
constitute those images on the
WASP mentality at the present
hour on the American campus, an
unfortunate reality in the light of
those probings by BSU and Third
World student politicos and cre
ative intellectuals.
The Reality is an unfortunate
one in that we are now, Black and
White, forced to go through a
repetition of an all-too familiar
social and cultural life-cycle in the
American social dynamic. This
life-cycle, as many responses to
The Stanford Daily by white
members of the Stanford commu
nity have proven, is of such nature
as to be hidden from what I,
myself, and other Black people
hopefully assumed was the innate
objectivity of white peoples in
America.
In seeking to understand the
nuances of the Black Rebellion on
America's college campuses, it is
important to keep in mind that
much more is occuring than the
mere reshuffling of administrative
personnel, or faculty members, or
course content offerings (Ethnic
Studies, for example).
White People must understand
that the native American social
dynamic, as it operates in the
economic, politital, and cultural
spheres of human activity, is now
being subjected to internal stress
of its own particular making and
that nothing short of a complete
revolution in terms of cultural val
ues is capable of ending this stress.
There is precedent for this
present-day tension. The years
1900-1920 saw the Russian Revo
lution, in which the Marxist in
dustrial dialectic, born of the
Western capitalistic system, came
into the full flush of its being.
However, what White People in
America have failed to openly
realize, and what we Black People
have intuitively understood, is
that the situation as it exists in
urban ghetto and Southern parish
have no parallels at any point and
that, furthermore, the revolution
ary initiative as it presently exists
in this country has passed from
the hands of the leftwing and the
(white) working class into the
black masses.
Unique Black Masses
You cannot confuse the white
working class with the black
masses. The latter has been tradi
tionally unemployed and unem
ployable, disenchanted and never
was-enchanted-in-the-first-place.
In fact, it was in the early days
of the violent struggles between
the labor unions and f he ruling
industrial patriarchs that thfe spe
cific rift between the black work
ing-man and his white counterpart
first occurred. Black people sup
plied the physical bodies on those
picket-lines, and yet white people
reaped all of the materialistic
benefits.
Even today, when Marxists and
would-be revivalists of the Com

munist International speak of the
labor unions as centers for revolu
tionary activity, they are forced
to deal with the realities of racial
prejudice in thos same unions.
Black People have been kept
from leadership positions in the
unions, even though it is black
men who form a bulk of the
work ing-body—the Longshore
men's Union, for instance, is filled
with black men at the worker's
level; the powerful Teamster's
Union is another example.
Divided Labor Force
The old myth of the working
class being the proletariat is shat
tered in the face of this reality:
that what was true in the early
1900's is not only inapplicable
now, but as well was proven so in
those very years when Marx made
his trip to America in 1888 and
saw the division of the labor
force.
He saw who it was that consti
tuted the truly underprivileged in
American society, and he saw that
it was not the white worker who
was underprivileged (he might be
underpaid, but never underpriv
ileged), but the black worker.
What is happening on the cam
puses today is a direct descendant
of those early realities in this
country's own Black History. It is
not that SDS, or the New Left, by
themselves, have proven ineffec
tual revolutionaries. It is the con
commitant fact that what had
been the Black Bourgeoisie, as
well, has been shunted over to the
side in the face of the new insis
tency of the Black student from
the incubus for all radical, dyn
amic activity in this country—the
urban ghetto.
Afro-American Nationalism
Afro-American Nationalism,
which even today on many cam
puses is abhorred by the
"Boojies," has manifested itself
not only in what sounds like high
pressure rhetoric, but in the
vastly-broadened scope of de
mands and the politicking, the
political awareness that goes with
such demands. The fact that both
the White Radical and the Black
Bourgeoise have to subordinate
their interests in the face of this
Black Nationalistic energy is clear
from the dramas unveiling them
selves on these campuses where
we, in fact, are.
Harold Cruse, leading Afro-
American ideologian and our
counterpart to Algeria's Frantz
Fanon, comments on this reality
in his encyclical document on
black-inspired revolution in Amer
ica,"The Crisis of the Negro Intel
lectual."
"It is the culmination of that
racial drama of love and hate
between slave and master, bound
together in the purgatory of the
plantations. Today the African
foster-child in the American racial
equation must grow to manhood,
break the psychologiccl umbilical
ties to intellectual paternalism.
The American Negro has never yet

been able to break entirely free of
the ministrations of his white
masters to the extent that he is
willing to exile himself, in search
of wisdom, into the wastelands of
the American desert. That is what
must be done, if he is to deal with
the Anglo-Saxon as the independ
ent political power that he, the
Negro, potentially is."
To Answer Anti-Semitism
I plan to comment in another
issue of The Bad Mouth, to come
later, on the role that the Jewish
intellectual must play in the Black
Movement. This will, in part, give
answer to charges of anti-
Semitism within the ranks of
dedicated Black Peoples.
I plan, as well, to delve into
exactly what is meant by the
symbols—"Cultural Imperialism"
and "Cultural Castration"—as we
Afro-Americans understand them.
One thing is clear, however, and
this is that Afro-America does not
need a white Christian ethic that
cannot answer its own rapistic
actions in Vietnam, the Middle
East, Latin America, Africa much
less right here, in its own cities, in
its own bowels.
We no longer need to hear
from white America as it answers
us with the pre-assumed stance of
the Greater White Father (greater
than the Europeans who invaded
South Africa, for example, with
the Bible; or Cortez, who, wel
comed by the Aztecs like a God,
laid waste to that glorious civiliza
tion). This revolution is predi
cated around one fundamental
issue—that of whose cultural
values are relevant to survival in
the world today!
As Harold Cruse says in his
essay on "The Intellectuals and
Force and Violence" from the
aforementioned "Crisis" on this
one fundamental fact, on the
stance that we, right here today,
as Black students and Black peo
ples, have to take in order to sur
vive and relate our position:
"Negro intellectuals have been
sold a bill of goods on interracial
ism by white Communists and
white liberals. As a result of this, a
peculiar form of what might be
called the psychology of political
interracialisrn (for want of a bet
ter term) has been inculcated in
the Negro's mind. Even before the
average Negro attempts to under
take any action himself, he as
sumes, almost involuntarily, that
he must not, cannot, dare not ex
clude whites, because he cannot
succeed without them. "
I think the lesson for today is
clear enough for all of us to
understand, and I thank the Daily
for having the journalistic balls to
print this entire column as op
posed to the piecemeal bullshit
that normally is doled out every
morning over coffee in Tresidder
Memorial Student Union!

As Harold Cruse says in his

High-pressure rhetoric and re
actionary chauvinism appear to
constitute those images on the
WASP mentality at the present
hour on the American campus, an
unfortunate reality in the light of
those probings by BSU and Third
World student politicos and cre
ative intellectuals.
The Reality is an unfortunate
one in that we are now, Black and
White, forced to go through a
repetition of an all-too familiar
social and cultural life-cycle in the
American social dynamic. This
life-cycle, as many responses to
The Stanford Daily by white
members of the Stanford commu
nity have proven, is of such nature
as to be hidden from what I,
myself, and other Black people
hopefully assumed was the innate
objectivity of white peoples in
America.
In seeking to understand the
nuances of the Black Rebellion on
America's college campuses, it is
important to keep in mind that
much more is occuring than the
mere reshuffling of administrative
personnel, or faculty members, or
course content offerings (Ethnic
Studies, for example).
White People must understand
that the native American social
dynamic, as it operates in the
economic, politital, and cultural
spheres of human activity, is now
being subjected to internal stress
of its own particular making and
that nothing short of a complete
revolution in terms of cultural val
ues is capable of ending this stress.
There is precedent for this
present-day tension. The years
1900-1920 saw the Russian Revo
lution, in which the Marxist in
dustrial dialectic, born of the
Western capitalistic system, came
into the full flush of its being.
However, what White People in
America have failed to openly
realize, and what we Black People
have intuitively understood, is
that the situation as it exists in
urban ghetto and Southern parish
have no parallels at any point and
that, furthermore, the revolution
ary initiative as it presently exists
in this country has passed from
the hands of the leftwing and the
(white) working class into the
black masses.
Unique Black Masses
You cannot confuse the white
working class with the black
masses. The latter has been tradi
tionally unemployed and unem
ployable, disenchanted and never
was-enchanted-in-the-first-place.
In fact, it was in the early days
of the violent struggles between
the labor unions and f he ruling
industrial patriarchs that thfe spe
cific rift between the black work
ing-man and his white counterpart
first occurred. Black people sup
plied the physical bodies on those
picket-lines, and yet white people
reaped all of the materialistic
benefits.
Even today, when Marxists and
would-be revivalists of the Com

munist International speak of the
labor unions as centers for revolu
tionary activity, they are forced
to deal with the realities of racial
prejudice in thos same unions.
Black People have been kept
from leadership positions in the
unions, even though it is black
men who form a bulk of the
work ing-body—the Longshore
men's Union, for instance, is filled
with black men at the worker's
level; the powerful Teamster's
Union is another example.
Divided Labor Force
The old myth of the working
class being the proletariat is shat
tered in the face of this reality:
that what was true in the early
1900's is not only inapplicable
now, but as well was proven so in
those very years when Marx made
his trip to America in 1888 and
saw the division of the labor
force.
He saw who it was that consti
tuted the truly underprivileged in
American society, and he saw that
it was not the white worker who
was underprivileged (he might be
underpaid, but never underpriv
ileged), but the black worker.
What is happening on the cam
puses today is a direct descendant
of those early realities in this
country's own Black History. It is
not that SDS, or the New Left, by
themselves, have proven ineffec
tual revolutionaries. It is the con
commitant fact that what had
been the Black Bourgeoisie, as
well, has been shunted over to the
side in the face of the new insis
tency of the Black student from
the incubus for all radical, dyn
amic activity in this country—the
urban ghetto.
Afro-American Nationalism
Afro-American Nationalism,
which even today on many cam
puses is abhorred by the
"Boojies," has manifested itself
not only in what sounds like high
pressure rhetoric, but in the
vastly-broadened scope of de
mands and the politicking, the
political awareness that goes with
such demands. The fact that both
the White Radical and the Black
Bourgeoise have to subordinate
their interests in the face of this
Black Nationalistic energy is clear
from the dramas unveiling them
selves on these campuses where
we, in fact, are.
Harold Cruse, leading Afro-
American ideologian and our
counterpart to Algeria's Frantz
Fanon, comments on this reality
in his encyclical document on
black-inspired revolution in Amer
ica,"The Crisis of the Negro Intel
lectual."
"It is the culmination of that
racial drama of love and hate
between slave and master, bound
together in the purgatory of the
plantations. Today the African
foster-child in the American racial
equation must grow to manhood,
break the psychologiccl umbilical
ties to intellectual paternalism.
The American Negro has never yet

been able to break entirely free of
the ministrations of his white
masters to the extent that he is
willing to exile himself, in search
of wisdom, into the wastelands of
the American desert. That is what
must be done, if he is to deal with
the Anglo-Saxon as the independ
ent political power that he, the
Negro, potentially is."
To Answer Anti-Semitism
I plan to comment in another
issue of The Bad Mouth, to come
later, on the role that the Jewish
intellectual must play in the Black
Movement. This will, in part, give
answer to charges of anti-
Semitism within the ranks of
dedicated Black Peoples.
I plan, as well, to delve into
exactly what is meant by the
symbols—"Cultural Imperialism"
and "Cultural Castration"—as we
Afro-Americans understand them.
One thing is clear, however, and
this is that Afro-America does not
need a white Christian ethic that
cannot answer its own rapistic
actions in Vietnam, the Middle
East, Latin America, Africa much
less right here, in its own cities, in
its own bowels.
We no longer need to hear
from white America as it answers
us with the pre-assumed stance of
the Greater White Father (greater
than the Europeans who invaded
South Africa, for example, with
the Bible; or Cortez, who, wel
comed by the Aztecs like a God,
laid waste to that glorious civiliza
tion). This revolution is predi

issue—that of whose cultural
values are relevant to survival in

We no longer need to hear

As Harold Cruse says in his

one fundamental fact, on the
stance that we, right here today,
as Black students and Black peo

"Negro intellectuals have been
sold a bill of goods on interracial

(Johnie Scott is a senior,

High-pressure rhetoric and re
actionary chauvinism appear to
constitute those images on the
WASP mentality at the present
hour on the American campus, an
unfortunate reality in the light of
those probings by BSU and Third
World student politicos and cre
ative intellectuals.
The Reality is an unfortunate
one in that we are now, Black and
White, forced to go through a
repetition of an all-too familiar
social and cultural life-cycle in the
American social dynamic. This
life-cycle, as many responses to
The Stanford Daily by white
members of the Stanford commu
nity have proven, is of such nature
as to be hidden from what I,
myself, and other Black people
hopefully assumed was the innate
objectivity of white peoples in
America.
In seeking to understand the
nuances of the Black Rebellion on
America's college campuses, it is
important to keep in mind that
much more is occuring than the
mere reshuffling of administrative
personnel, or faculty members, or
course content offerings (Ethnic
Studies, for example).
White People must understand
that the native American social
dynamic, as it operates in the
economic, politital, and cultural
spheres of human activity, is now
being subjected to internal stress
of its own particular making and
that nothing short of a complete
revolution in terms of cultural val
ues is capable of ending this stress.
There is precedent for this
present-day tension. The years
1900-1920 saw the Russian Revo
lution, in which the Marxist in
dustrial dialectic, born of the
Western capitalistic system, came
into the full flush of its being.
However, what White People in
America have failed to openly
realize, and what we Black People
have intuitively understood, is
that the situation as it exists in
urban ghetto and Southern parish
have no parallels at any point and
that, furthermore, the revolution
ary initiative as it presently exists
in this country has passed from
the hands of the leftwing and the
(white) working class into the
black masses.
Unique Black Masses
You cannot confuse the white
working class with the black
masses. The latter has been tradi
tionally unemployed and unem
ployable, disenchanted and never
was-enchanted-in-the-first-place.
In fact, it was in the early days
of the violent struggles between
the labor unions and f he ruling
industrial patriarchs that thfe spe
cific rift between the black work
ing-man and his white counterpart
first occurred. Black people sup
plied the physical bodies on those
picket-lines, and yet white people
reaped all of the materialistic
benefits.
Even today, when Marxists and
would-be revivalists of the Com

munist International speak of the
labor unions as centers for revolu
tionary activity, they are forced
to deal with the realities of racial
prejudice in thos same unions.
Black People have been kept
from leadership positions in the
unions, even though it is black
men who form a bulk of the
work ing-body—the Longshore
men's Union, for instance, is filled
with black men at the worker's
level; the powerful Teamster's
Union is another example.
Divided Labor Force
The old myth of the working
class being the proletariat is shat
tered in the face of this reality:
that what was true in the early
1900's is not only inapplicable
now, but as well was proven so in
those very years when Marx made
his trip to America in 1888 and
saw the division of the labor
force.
He saw who it was that consti
tuted the truly underprivileged in
American society, and he saw that
it was not the white worker who
was underprivileged (he might be
underpaid, but never underpriv
ileged), but the black worker.
What is happening on the cam
puses today is a direct descendant
of those early realities in this
country's own Black History. It is
not that SDS, or the New Left, by
themselves, have proven ineffec
tual revolutionaries. It is the con
commitant fact that what had
been the Black Bourgeoisie, as
well, has been shunted over to the
side in the face of the new insis
tency of the Black student from
the incubus for all radical, dyn
amic activity in this country—the
urban ghetto.
Afro-American Nationalism
Afro-American Nationalism,
which even today on many cam
puses is abhorred by the
"Boojies," has manifested itself
not only in what sounds like high
pressure rhetoric, but in the
vastly-broadened scope of de
mands and the politicking, the
political awareness that goes with
such demands. The fact that both
the White Radical and the Black
Bourgeoise have to subordinate
their interests in the face of this
Black Nationalistic energy is clear
from the dramas unveiling them
selves on these campuses where
we, in fact, are.
Harold Cruse, leading Afro-
American ideologian and our
counterpart to Algeria's Frantz
Fanon, comments on this reality
in his encyclical document on
black-inspired revolution in Amer
ica,"The Crisis of the Negro Intel
lectual."
"It is the culmination of that
racial drama of love and hate
between slave and master, bound

it was not the white worker who
was underprivileged (he might be
underpaid, but never underpriv
ileged), but the black worker.
What is happening on the cam
puses today is a direct descendant
of those early realities in this
country's own Black History. It is
not that SDS, or the New Left, by
themselves, have proven ineffec
tual revolutionaries. It is the con
commitant fact that what had
been the Black Bourgeoisie, as
well, has been shunted over to the
side in the face of the new insis
tency of the Black student from
the incubus for all radical, dyn
amic activity in this country—the
urban ghetto.
Afro-American Nationalism
Afro-American Nationalism,
which even today on many cam
puses is abhorred by the
"Boojies," has manifested itself
not only in what sounds like high
pressure rhetoric, but in the
vastly-broadened scope of de
mands and the politicking, the
political awareness that goes with
such demands. The fact that both
the White Radical and the Black
Bourgeoise have to subordinate
their interests in the face of this
Black Nationalistic energy is clear
from the dramas unveiling them
selves on these campuses where
we, in fact, are.
Harold Cruse, leading Afro-
American ideologian and our
counterpart to Algeria's Frantz
Fanon, comments on this reality
in his encyclical document on
black-inspired revolution in Amer
ica,"The Crisis of the Negro Intel
lectual."
"It is the culmination of that
racial drama of love and hate
between slave and master, bound
together in the purgatory of the
plantations. Today the African
foster-child in the American racial
equation must grow to manhood,
break the psychologiccl umbilical
ties to intellectual paternalism.
The American Negro has never yet

been able to break entirely free of
the ministrations of his white
masters to the extent that he is
willing to exile himself, in search
of wisdom, into the wastelands of
the American desert. That is what
must be done, if he is to deal with
the Anglo-Saxon as the independ
ent political power that he, the
Negro, potentially is."
To Answer Anti-Semitism
I plan to comment in another
issue of The Bad Mouth, to come
later, on the role that the Jewish
intellectual must play in the Black
Movement. This will, in part, give
answer to charges of anti-
Semitism within the ranks of
dedicated Black Peoples.
I plan, as well, to delve into
exactly what is meant by the
symbols—"Cultural Imperialism"
and "Cultural Castration"—as we
Afro-Americans understand them.
One thing is clear, however, and
this is that Afro-America does not
need a white Christian ethic that
cannot answer its own rapistic
actions in Vietnam, the Middle
East, Latin America, Africa much
less right here, in its own cities, in
its own bowels.
We no longer need to hear
from white America as it answers
us with the pre-assumed stance of
the Greater White Father (greater
than the Europeans who invaded
South Africa, for example, with
the Bible; or Cortez, who, wel
comed by the Aztecs like a God,
laid waste to that glorious civiliza
tion). This revolution is predi
cated around one fundamental
issue—that of whose cultural
values are relevant to survival in
the world today!
As Harold Cruse says in his
essay on "The Intellectuals and
Force and Violence" from the
aforementioned "Crisis" on this
one fundamental fact, on the
stance that we, right here today,
as Black students and Black peo
ples, have to take in order to sur
vive and relate our position:
"Negro intellectuals have been
sold a bill of goods on interracial
ism by white Communists and
white liberals. As a result of this, a
peculiar form of what might be
called the psychology of political
interracialisrn (for want of a bet
ter term) has been inculcated in
the Negro's mind. Even before the
average Negro attempts to under
take any action himself, he as
sumes, almost involuntarily, that
he must not, cannot, dare not ex
clude whites, because he cannot
succeed without them. "
I think the lesson for today is
clear enough for all of us to
understand, and I thank the Daily
for having the journalistic balls to
print this entire column as op
posed to the piecemeal bullshit
that normally is doled out every
morning over coffee in Tresidder
Memorial Student Union!
(Johnie Scott is a senior,
majoring in English and a member
of the BSU —Ed.)
High-pressure rhetoric and re
actionary chauvinism appear to
constitute those images on the
WASP mentality at the present
hour on the American campus, an
unfortunate reality in the light of
those probings by BSU and Third
World student politicos and cre
ative intellectuals.
The Reality is an unfortunate
one in that we are now, Black and
White, forced to go through a
repetition of an all-too familiar
social and cultural life-cycle in the
American social dynamic. This
life-cycle, as many responses to
The Stanford Daily by white
members of the Stanford commu
nity have proven, is of such nature
as to be hidden from what I,
myself, and other Black people
hopefully assumed was the innate
objectivity of white peoples in
America.
In seeking to understand the
nuances of the Black Rebellion on
America's college campuses, it is
important to keep in mind that
much more is occuring than the
mere reshuffling of administrative
personnel, or faculty members, or
course content offerings (Ethnic
Studies, for example).
White People must understand
that the native American social
dynamic, as it operates in the
economic, politital, and cultural
spheres of human activity, is now
being subjected to internal stress
of its own particular making and
that nothing short of a complete
revolution in terms of cultural val
ues is capable of ending this stress.
There is precedent for this
present-day tension. The years
1900-1920 saw the Russian Revo
lution, in which the Marxist in
dustrial dialectic, born of the
Western capitalistic system, came
into the full flush of its being.
However, what White People in
America have failed to openly
realize, and what we Black People
have intuitively understood, is
that the situation as it exists in
urban ghetto and Southern parish
have no parallels at any point and
that, furthermore, the revolution
ary initiative as it presently exists
in this country has passed from
the hands of the leftwing and the
(white) working class into the
black masses.
Unique Black Masses
You cannot confuse the white
working class with the black
masses. The latter has been tradi
tionally unemployed and unem
ployable, disenchanted and never
was-enchanted-in-the-first-place.
In fact, it was in the early days
of the violent struggles between
the labor unions and f he ruling
industrial patriarchs that thfe spe
cific rift between the black work
ing-man and his white counterpart
first occurred. Black people sup
plied the physical bodies on those
picket-lines, and yet white people
reaped all of the materialistic
benefits.
Even today, when Marxists and
would-be revivalists of the Com

munist International speak of the
labor unions as centers for revolu
tionary activity, they are forced
to deal with the realities of racial
prejudice in thos same unions.
Black People have been kept
from leadership positions in the
unions, even though it is black
men who form a bulk of the
work ing-body—the Longshore
men's Union, for instance, is filled
with black men at the worker's
level; the powerful Teamster's
Union is another example.
Divided Labor Force
The old myth of the working
class being the proletariat is shat
tered in the face of this reality:
that what was true in the early
1900's is not only inapplicable
now, but as well was proven so in
those very years when Marx made
his trip to America in 1888 and
saw the division of the labor
force.
He saw who it was that consti
tuted the truly underprivileged in
American society, and he saw that
it was not the white worker who
was underprivileged (he might be
underpaid, but never underpriv
ileged), but the black worker.
What is happening on the cam
puses today is a direct descendant
of those early realities in this
