## What The Oil Strike Means 
### David Pugh 
Recently there's been a short
age of candle wax. For most Stan
ford students, this is the closest
the nationwide oil strike will get
to them. But for the striking
workers at Richmond, several
miles north of San Francisco,
jobs, life savings, family security,
and basic human dignity are at
stake.
The oil strike began on January
4. Most of the companies have
since settled for a 6% wage in
crease spread over 2 years (the
cost-of-living rose 5% last year),
but Stanford Oil (Richmond) and
Shell Oil (Martinez) have con
tinued to hold dut. The main
reason why Standard and Shell
have been able to deny their
workers a wage increase that will
be immediately outstripped by in
flation is that they aren't as highly
unionized as the other oil com
panies. In addition, they are ready
to spend several million dollars to
break the backs of the striking
unions.
With sales around $3 billion
and profits running over $500 mil
lion last year, Cal Standard is re

fusing to grant the Oil, Chemical,
and Atomic Workers' demands for
a 72 cent wage increase and in
creased pension benefits. Instead,
Standard is offering a 46 cent
raise to the senior workers and
nothing to the newest workers,
many of whom are manning the
picket lines.
Standard's control of the local
courts has resulted in a court in
junction preventing the workers
from having any more than 5 men
on a picket line; Standard's con
trol of the local cops has meant
continued harrassment of the
picket lines. On Monday, January
13, Richmond cops beat pickets
and their wives. They also maced
an 18-month old child.
What Does II Mean?
So what does all this mean to
us? We've been told that workers
vote for Wallace because they're
stupid and racist; that they sit
around drinking beer and watch
ing TV in materialistic splendor
when they aren't loafing on the
job.
If you're being trained at Stan
ford to be a corporate manager, a

highly skilled technician, or a
government official, certain
material advantages flow from
latching on to these elitist stereo
types. You might not ask why
Stanford isn't training black,
brown, and white working people
and their children to run the
factories in which they're pres
ently condemned to be inter
changeable and dispensable parts.
Sounds a bit like socialism? You
may call it basic economic demo
cracy too.
But most of the striking work
ers I talked to weren't intellectual
izing about a democratic and
socialist economy, though they
were certainly anti-capitalist.
They want a decent living wage so
their wives don't have to work
and so they can send their kids to
college.
With a regressive federal and
local tax structure, galloping war
induced inflation, and a very
threatening draft, these working
men can sense that the cards are
heavily stacked against them. Yet
they continue to strike, taking
constant abuse from company
goons armed with lead pipes and
chains and from the Richmond
cops.
It's not just a coincidence that
some members of Stanford's cor
porate elite have soiled hands. Sit
ting on the board of Cal Standard
with John McCone (former head
of the CIA) is E. Hornby Wasson,
who also sits on the board of dir
ectors of the Stanford Research
Institute.
Shell Oil is represented on the
Stanford Board of Trustees by
Richard McCurdy, president of
Shell. You might ask him at the
next trustee meeting about the
wages of the Shell working men.
Figures, power structure re
search . . . what does this mean to
you? It's probably going to be
hard to understand the human
meaning of a $500 million bundle
of profits existing alongside
workers' rapidly dwindling life
savings unless you drive up to
Richmond. For the last several
weeks, students from all over the
Bay Area have been walking the
picket lines alongside the workers.
There's no way to deny that we
have the time. Most of the time
we don't have the humanity.
