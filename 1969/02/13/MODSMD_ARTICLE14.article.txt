# Another Era For Basketball
## New Pavilion To Be Dedicated 
### SCOTT THACHER KEVIN QUIST 
The completion of the Roscoe
Maples Pavilion has opened a new
era for basketball at Stanford. The
"old" pavilion, the largest pavilion
in the United States devoted pri
marily to basketball when built in
1922, has finally received a re
placement better adapted to the
needs of present-day collegiate
basketball.
The new building has three
times the seating capacity of the
old, numerous locker rooms and
conference lounges, and an archi
tectural style far different than
the tile and brick of the old pa
vilion. John Lynd, Assistant Di
rector of the Planning Office,
says,"the simplicity and boldness
of it make it exciting."
The pavilion will be formally
dedicated in memory of the late
Roscoe Maples on March first, be
fore the USC game. Maples
entered Stanford with the class of
1904, but left to support his
parents before graduating. Eventu
ally he established a successful
lumber business in Oregon, where
he made his fortune.
When Roscoe Maples died in
1963, he left almost all of his two
million dollar fortune to Stanford.
President Sterling, in consultation
with his widow, decided to use
1.2 million dollars of his bequest
as the chief donation for the 3.35
million costs of the pavilion. Last
January third, during the opening
game against Bringham Young
University, Mrs. Maples was pre
sented with the first game ball
used in the pavilion.
Money A Problem
As adequate funds did not
seem to be forthcoming, in 1962
the architect submitted a two
stage plan of construction: first to
build a 6000 seat Pavilion and

second to tack on an additional
2000 seats. But in 1965, when a
reappraisal of the building costs
added $800,000 to the original
price-tag, it was decided to fi
nance the building in one shot
rather than delaying further.
Before the dedication, cross
court baskets and glass around the
edge of the roof must be installed,
while painters must finish much
of the bare concrete. University
officials will accept the building
from the contractors late this
summer only when the land
scaping is complete and the air
conditioning system has been
tested.
The basketball team is the
happiest of the Pavilion's new
tenants. Says Co-Captain Don
Griffin: "The floor is superior to
any I've played on, with the possi
ble exception of the old pavilion."
Similarly, Coach Howard Dall
mar is "very enthused" with his
new haunts—he maintains that the
floor and lighting are the best—in
fact he is afraid he team will be
spoiled. But he is certain the
superior facilities will attract more
basketball talent to Stanford,
especially from out of state.
Warnecke, whose buildings on
campus include the Under
graduate Library, the Post Office,
the bookstore, and the new art
building, and who is working on a
new athletic complex, had some
comments about Stanford's archi
tecture. He feels Stanford has the
environment of a special place:
"You know you're not just in the
midst of urban turmoil.
"My feeling is that as Stanford
gets larger and larger, we need
more diversity. They (buildings)
ought to represent the best of
what we're trying to do. As the
Pavilion emphasizes, things should
change "

Despite the Pavilion's large
size, a sports fan can still feel
close to the action, Dallmar
claims, since the stands are built
close to the floor.
Members of the defeated Uni
versity of San Francisco basket
ball team agreed that the pavilion
was "one of the better gyms"
they had played in and was
"better than the old barn." One
player was not pleased with the
aesthetics of the building, how
ever. He commented that he
thought there was "too much con
crete in the corners," which are
dominated by the four pillars that
hold up the roof.
Other Pavilion Uses
The basketball team will not be
the sole beneficiaries of this new
arrangement. Wrestling and
gymnastic meets will be able to
take place in the "old" pavilion.
The new pavilion, which has a
seating capacity of 7917, ap
proaches the size of Frost Amphi
theater and is much larger than
Memorial Auditorium. The Maples
Pavilion can also be used for host
ing exceptional speakers or stu
dent rallies.
As a new and unique building
on campus, it contains many unu
sual facets of design and con
struction. The court floor was
copied from the old pavilion. Ac
cording to the Daily Palo Alto of
49 years ago, the old pavilion was
to be "a combined basketball and
dance hall pavilion," which
promised "a spring floor to be
compared only with those of the
St. Francis, Fairmont, and the
Palace Hotels in San Francisco."
The shiny maple spring floor
which shivers like the surface of a
bowl of jello on the impact of a
player's foot employs a king of
webbed construction. The idea is
to have at least three inches of

air-space between a player's foot
and the 26 inches of gravel and
cement that is the base of the
floor.
Floor Construction
First, redwood beams, called
sleepers, are laid cross-court every
eight feet. On top of the sleepers,
at right angles to them, 3 x 3 fir
beams are placed at intervals of
one foot. More fir beams parallel
to the sleepers, are separated by
eight feet and placed exactly in
the middle of each eight-foot span
between the sleepers. The maple
floor is nailed to another layer of
3x3 fir, laid one foot apart.
However, the floor is one of
the few familiar aspects of the
new building. Architect John Carl
Warnecke ('4l) feels he came up
with a fairly unusual structure,
due to the need for economy and
the fact that he was designing his
first sports building.
"In the search for economy
and function this was the most
satisfactory solution," he com
mented. Referring to the old
Spanish style that is prevalent on
campus, he added, "I felt I should
build with a strong feeling
towards the Quad that was appro
priate to the total Standord
scene."
Budget And Style
But because of the building's
site, he felt he could depart from
the usual style in adhering to the
tight budget."The building had to
be absolutely functional—no non
sense, no decor, no tile-roof—the
minimum type structure but the
maximum type quality for the
purpose."
Most roofs are supported by

the walls of the building, entailing
expensive reinforcement both in
the walls and the roof, especially
when a roof must cover a great
area. Warnecke eliminated the cor
ner seats, which are poor for view
ing basketball, and placed four
eighty-five-foot concrete columns
at the corners of the court.
The roof is covered with a type
of steel called "Cortan," which, in
two or three years, will develop a
deep reddish-brown protective
rust, in the "same range of tones"
as tile roofs on campus. The walls
will be finished with a "warm
grey" that blends with the sub
dued brown walls of the Quad.

fact he is afraid he team will be
spoiled. But he is certain the
superior facilities will attract more
basketball talent to Stanford,
especially from out of state.
Warnecke, whose buildings on
campus include the Under
graduate Library, the Post Office,
the bookstore, and the new art
building, and who is working on a
new athletic complex, had some
comments about Stanford's archi
tecture. He feels Stanford has the
environment of a special place:
"You know you're not just in the
midst of urban turmoil.
"My feeling is that as Stanford
gets larger and larger, we need
more diversity. They (buildings)
ought to represent the best of
what we're trying to do. As the
Pavilion emphasizes, things should
change "

Despite the Pavilion's large
size, a sports fan can still feel
close to the action, Dallmar
claims, since the stands are built
close to the floor.
Members of the defeated Uni
versity of San Francisco basket
ball team agreed that the pavilion
was "one of the better gyms"
they had played in and was
"better than the old barn." One
player was not pleased with the
aesthetics of the building, how
ever. He commented that he
thought there was "too much con
crete in the corners," which are
dominated by the four pillars that
hold up the roof.
Other Pavilion Uses
The basketball team will not be
the sole beneficiaries of this new
arrangement. Wrestling and
gymnastic meets will be able to
take place in the "old" pavilion.
The new pavilion, which has a
seating capacity of 7917, ap
proaches the size of Frost Amphi
theater and is much larger than
Memorial Auditorium. The Maples
Pavilion can also be used for host
ing exceptional speakers or stu
dent rallies.
As a new and unique building
on campus, it contains many unu
sual facets of design and con
struction. The court floor was
copied from the old pavilion. Ac
cording to the Daily Palo Alto of
49 years ago, the old pavilion was
to be "a combined basketball and
dance hall pavilion," which
promised "a spring floor to be
compared only with those of the
St. Francis, Fairmont, and the
Palace Hotels in San Francisco."
The shiny maple spring floor
which shivers like the surface of a
bowl of jello on the impact of a
player's foot employs a king of
webbed construction. The idea is
to have at least three inches of

air-space between a player's foot
and the 26 inches of gravel and
cement that is the base of the
floor.
Floor Construction
First, redwood beams, called
sleepers, are laid cross-court every
eight feet. On top of the sleepers,
at right angles to them, 3 x 3 fir
beams are placed at intervals of
one foot. More fir beams parallel
to the sleepers, are separated by
eight feet and placed exactly in
the middle of each eight-foot span
between the sleepers. The maple
floor is nailed to another layer of
3x3 fir, laid one foot apart.
However, the floor is one of
the few familiar aspects of the
new building. Architect John Carl
Warnecke ('4l) feels he came up
with a fairly unusual structure,
due to the need for economy and
the fact that he was designing his
first sports building.
"In the search for economy
and function this was the most
satisfactory solution," he com
mented. Referring to the old
Spanish style that is prevalent on
campus, he added, "I felt I should
build with a strong feeling
towards the Quad that was appro
priate to the total Standord
scene."
Budget And Style
But because of the building's
site, he felt he could depart from
the usual style in adhering to the
tight budget."The building had to
be absolutely functional—no non
sense, no decor, no tile-roof—the
minimum type structure but the
maximum type quality for the
purpose."
Most roofs are supported by

the walls of the building, entailing
expensive reinforcement both in
the walls and the roof, especially
when a roof must cover a great
area. Warnecke eliminated the cor
ner seats, which are poor for view
ing basketball, and placed four
eighty-five-foot concrete columns
at the corners of the court.
The roof is covered with a type
of steel called "Cortan," which, in
two or three years, will develop a
deep reddish-brown protective
rust, in the "same range of tones"
as tile roofs on campus. The walls
will be finished with a "warm
grey" that blends with the sub
dued brown walls of the Quad.
The completion of the Roscoe
Maples Pavilion has opened a new
era for basketball at Stanford. The
"old" pavilion, the largest pavilion
in the United States devoted pri
marily to basketball when built in
1922, has finally received a re
placement better adapted to the
needs of present-day collegiate
basketball.
The new building has three
times the seating capacity of the
old, numerous locker rooms and
conference lounges, and an archi
tectural style far different than
the tile and brick of the old pa
vilion. John Lynd, Assistant Di
rector of the Planning Office,
says,"the simplicity and boldness
of it make it exciting."
The pavilion will be formally
dedicated in memory of the late
Roscoe Maples on March first, be
fore the USC game. Maples
entered Stanford with the class of
1904, but left to support his
parents before graduating. Eventu
ally he established a successful
lumber business in Oregon, where
he made his fortune.
When Roscoe Maples died in
1963, he left almost all of his two
million dollar fortune to Stanford.
President Sterling, in consultation
with his widow, decided to use
1.2 million dollars of his bequest
as the chief donation for the 3.35
million costs of the pavilion. Last
January third, during the opening
game against Bringham Young
University, Mrs. Maples was pre
sented with the first game ball
used in the pavilion.
Money A Problem
As adequate funds did not
seem to be forthcoming, in 1962
the architect submitted a two
stage plan of construction: first to
build a 6000 seat Pavilion and

second to tack on an additional
2000 seats. But in 1965, when a
reappraisal of the building costs
added $800,000 to the original
price-tag, it was decided to fi
nance the building in one shot
rather than delaying further.
Before the dedication, cross
court baskets and glass around the
edge of the roof must be installed,
while painters must finish much
of the bare concrete. University
officials will accept the building
from the contractors late this
summer only when the land
scaping is complete and the air
conditioning system has been
tested.
The basketball team is the
happiest of the Pavilion's new
tenants. Says Co-Captain Don
Griffin: "The floor is superior to
any I've played on, with the possi
ble exception of the old pavilion."
Similarly, Coach Howard Dall
mar is "very enthused" with his
new haunts—he maintains that the
floor and lighting are the best—in

spoiled. But he is certain the

eight feet. On top of the sleepers,
at right angles to them, 3 x 3 fir
beams are placed at intervals of
one foot. More fir beams parallel
to the sleepers, are separated by
eight feet and placed exactly in
the middle of each eight-foot span
between the sleepers. The maple
floor is nailed to another layer of
3x3 fir, laid one foot apart.
However, the floor is one of
the few familiar aspects of the
new building. Architect John Carl
Warnecke ('4l) feels he came up
with a fairly unusual structure,
due to the need for economy and
the fact that he was designing his
first sports building.
"In the search for economy
and function this was the most
satisfactory solution," he com
mented. Referring to the old
Spanish style that is prevalent on
campus, he added, "I felt I should
build with a strong feeling
towards the Quad that was appro
priate to the total Standord
scene."
Budget And Style
But because of the building's
site, he felt he could depart from
the usual style in adhering to the
tight budget."The building had to
be absolutely functional—no non
sense, no decor, no tile-roof—the
minimum type structure but the
maximum type quality for the
purpose."
Most roofs are supported by

the walls of the building, entailing
expensive reinforcement both in
the walls and the roof, especially
when a roof must cover a great
area. Warnecke eliminated the cor
ner seats, which are poor for view
ing basketball, and placed four
eighty-five-foot concrete columns
at the corners of the court.
The roof is covered with a type
of steel called "Cortan," which, in
two or three years, will develop a
deep reddish-brown protective
rust, in the "same range of tones"
as tile roofs on campus. The walls
will be finished with a "warm
grey" that blends with the sub
dued brown walls of the Quad.
The completion of the Roscoe
Maples Pavilion has opened a new
era for basketball at Stanford. The
"old" pavilion, the largest pavilion
in the United States devoted pri
marily to basketball when built in
1922, has finally received a re
placement better adapted to the
needs of present-day collegiate
basketball.
The new building has three
times the seating capacity of the
old, numerous locker rooms and
conference lounges, and an archi
tectural style far different than
the tile and brick of the old pa
vilion. John Lynd, Assistant Di
rector of the Planning Office,
says,"the simplicity and boldness
of it make it exciting."
The pavilion will be formally
dedicated in memory of the late
Roscoe Maples on March first, be
fore the USC game. Maples
entered Stanford with the class of
1904, but left to support his
parents before graduating. Eventu
ally he established a successful
lumber business in Oregon, where
he made his fortune.
When Roscoe Maples died in
1963, he left almost all of his two
million dollar fortune to Stanford.
President Sterling, in consultation
with his widow, decided to use
1.2 million dollars of his bequest
as the chief donation for the 3.35
million costs of the pavilion. Last
January third, during the opening
game against Bringham Young
University, Mrs. Maples was pre
sented with the first game ball
used in the pavilion.
Money A Problem
As adequate funds did not
seem to be forthcoming, in 1962
the architect submitted a two
stage plan of construction: first to
build a 6000 seat Pavilion and

second to tack on an additional
2000 seats. But in 1965, when a
reappraisal of the building costs
added $800,000 to the original
price-tag, it was decided to fi
nance the building in one shot
rather than delaying further.
Before the dedication, cross
court baskets and glass around the
edge of the roof must be installed,
while painters must finish much
of the bare concrete. University
officials will accept the building
from the contractors late this
summer only when the land
scaping is complete and the air
conditioning system has been
tested.
The basketball team is the
happiest of the Pavilion's new
tenants. Says Co-Captain Don
Griffin: "The floor is superior to
any I've played on, with the possi
ble exception of the old pavilion."
Similarly, Coach Howard Dall
mar is "very enthused" with his
new haunts—he maintains that the
floor and lighting are the best—in
fact he is afraid he team will be
spoiled. But he is certain the
superior facilities will attract more
basketball talent to Stanford,
especially from out of state.
Warnecke, whose buildings on
campus include the Under
graduate Library, the Post Office,
the bookstore, and the new art
building, and who is working on a
new athletic complex, had some
comments about Stanford's archi
tecture. He feels Stanford has the
environment of a special place:
"You know you're not just in the
midst of urban turmoil.
"My feeling is that as Stanford
gets larger and larger, we need
more diversity. They (buildings)
ought to represent the best of
what we're trying to do. As the
Pavilion emphasizes, things should
change "

Despite the Pavilion's large
size, a sports fan can still feel
close to the action, Dallmar
claims, since the stands are built
close to the floor.
Members of the defeated Uni
versity of San Francisco basket
ball team agreed that the pavilion
was "one of the better gyms"
they had played in and was
"better than the old barn." One
player was not pleased with the
aesthetics of the building, how
ever. He commented that he
thought there was "too much con
crete in the corners," which are
dominated by the four pillars that
hold up the roof.
Other Pavilion Uses
The basketball team will not be
the sole beneficiaries of this new
arrangement. Wrestling and
gymnastic meets will be able to
take place in the "old" pavilion.
The new pavilion, which has a
seating capacity of 7917, ap
proaches the size of Frost Amphi
theater and is much larger than
Memorial Auditorium. The Maples
Pavilion can also be used for host
ing exceptional speakers or stu
dent rallies.
As a new and unique building
on campus, it contains many unu
sual facets of design and con
struction. The court floor was
copied from the old pavilion. Ac
cording to the Daily Palo Alto of
49 years ago, the old pavilion was
to be "a combined basketball and
dance hall pavilion," which
promised "a spring floor to be
compared only with those of the
St. Francis, Fairmont, and the
Palace Hotels in San Francisco."
The shiny maple spring floor
which shivers like the surface of a
bowl of jello on the impact of a
player's foot employs a king of
webbed construction. The idea is
to have at least three inches of

air-space between a player's foot
and the 26 inches of gravel and
cement that is the base of the
floor.

Roscoe Maples on March first, be
fore the USC game. Maples
entered Stanford with the class of
1904, but left to support his
parents before graduating. Eventu
ally he established a successful
lumber business in Oregon, where
he made his fortune.
When Roscoe Maples died in
1963, he left almost all of his two
million dollar fortune to Stanford.
President Sterling, in consultation
with his widow, decided to use
1.2 million dollars of his bequest
as the chief donation for the 3.35
million costs of the pavilion. Last
January third, during the opening
game against Bringham Young
University, Mrs. Maples was pre
sented with the first game ball
used in the pavilion.
Money A Problem
As adequate funds did not
seem to be forthcoming, in 1962
the architect submitted a two
stage plan of construction: first to
build a 6000 seat Pavilion and

second to tack on an additional
2000 seats. But in 1965, when a
reappraisal of the building costs
added $800,000 to the original
price-tag, it was decided to fi
nance the building in one shot
rather than delaying further.
Before the dedication, cross
court baskets and glass around the
edge of the roof must be installed,
while painters must finish much
of the bare concrete. University
officials will accept the building
from the contractors late this
summer only when the land
scaping is complete and the air
conditioning system has been
tested.
The basketball team is the
happiest of the Pavilion's new
tenants. Says Co-Captain Don
Griffin: "The floor is superior to
any I've played on, with the possi
ble exception of the old pavilion."
Similarly, Coach Howard Dall
mar is "very enthused" with his
new haunts—he maintains that the
floor and lighting are the best—in
fact he is afraid he team will be
spoiled. But he is certain the
superior facilities will attract more
basketball talent to Stanford,
especially from out of state.
Warnecke, whose buildings on
campus include the Under
graduate Library, the Post Office,
the bookstore, and the new art
building, and who is working on a
new athletic complex, had some
comments about Stanford's archi
tecture. He feels Stanford has the
environment of a special place:
"You know you're not just in the
midst of urban turmoil.
"My feeling is that as Stanford
gets larger and larger, we need
more diversity. They (buildings)
ought to represent the best of
what we're trying to do. As the
Pavilion emphasizes, things should
change "

Despite the Pavilion's large
size, a sports fan can still feel
close to the action, Dallmar
claims, since the stands are built
close to the floor.
Members of the defeated Uni
versity of San Francisco basket
ball team agreed that the pavilion
was "one of the better gyms"
they had played in and was
"better than the old barn." One
player was not pleased with the
aesthetics of the building, how
ever. He commented that he
thought there was "too much con
crete in the corners," which are
dominated by the four pillars that
hold up the roof.
Other Pavilion Uses
The basketball team will not be
the sole beneficiaries of this new
arrangement. Wrestling and
gymnastic meets will be able to
take place in the "old" pavilion.
The new pavilion, which has a
seating capacity of 7917, ap
proaches the size of Frost Amphi
theater and is much larger than
Memorial Auditorium. The Maples
Pavilion can also be used for host
ing exceptional speakers or stu
dent rallies.
As a new and unique building
on campus, it contains many unu
sual facets of design and con
struction. The court floor was
copied from the old pavilion. Ac
cording to the Daily Palo Alto of
49 years ago, the old pavilion was
to be "a combined basketball and
dance hall pavilion," which
promised "a spring floor to be
compared only with those of the
St. Francis, Fairmont, and the
Palace Hotels in San Francisco."
The shiny maple spring floor
which shivers like the surface of a
bowl of jello on the impact of a
player's foot employs a king of
webbed construction. The idea is
to have at least three inches of

air-space between a player's foot
and the 26 inches of gravel and
cement that is the base of the
floor.
Floor Construction
First, redwood beams, called
sleepers, are laid cross-court every
eight feet. On top of the sleepers,
at right angles to them, 3 x 3 fir
beams are placed at intervals of
one foot. More fir beams parallel
to the sleepers, are separated by
eight feet and placed exactly in
the middle of each eight-foot span
between the sleepers. The maple
floor is nailed to another layer of
3x3 fir, laid one foot apart.
However, the floor is one of
the few familiar aspects of the
new building. Architect John Carl
Warnecke ('4l) feels he came up
with a fairly unusual structure,
due to the need for economy and
the fact that he was designing his
first sports building.
"In the search for economy
and function this was the most
satisfactory solution," he com
mented. Referring to the old
Spanish style that is prevalent on
campus, he added, "I felt I should
build with a strong feeling
towards the Quad that was appro
priate to the total Standord
scene."
Budget And Style
But because of the building's
site, he felt he could depart from
the usual style in adhering to the
tight budget."The building had to
be absolutely functional—no non
sense, no decor, no tile-roof—the
minimum type structure but the
maximum type quality for the
purpose."
Most roofs are supported by

the walls of the building, entailing
expensive reinforcement both in
the walls and the roof, especially
when a roof must cover a great
area. Warnecke eliminated the cor
ner seats, which are poor for view
ing basketball, and placed four
eighty-five-foot concrete columns
at the corners of the court.
The roof is covered with a type
of steel called "Cortan," which, in
two or three years, will develop a
deep reddish-brown protective
rust, in the "same range of tones"
as tile roofs on campus. The walls
will be finished with a "warm
grey" that blends with the sub
dued brown walls of the Quad.
