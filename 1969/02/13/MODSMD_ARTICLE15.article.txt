# 'Change Men--Then Society'
## 
### JEANNE McCOMISH 
"The world is in such a mess."
Having started with this observa
tion, J. Krishnamurti went on to
expand on the statement for an
hour an a half Tuesday to an aud
ience of Stanford residents in
Dinkelspiel.
Krishnamurti began his discus
sion with the need for change in
the world and some of the means
for making these changes. He
systematically discarded efforts to
change society and social institu
tions unless these efforts are pre
ceded by an improvement in the
individual.
"To understand the misery and
confusion that exist within our
selves, and so in the world, we
must find clarity within ourselves,
and that clarity comes about
through right thinking. Right
thinking comes through self
knowledge." He emphasized that
"there is hope in men, not in soci
ety, not in systems, organized reli
gious systems, but in you in me."
However, he denied that the
individual could be changed by
religion, force, teaching, or out
side authority. Change of the
individual, he explained, will only
come about when each individual
is aware of his inherent faults and

can face his own fears and inhibi
tions.
He cautioned that if individuals
respond to this new challenge of
change as a Catholic, a Hindu, or a
Communist, then the individual is
responding according to a pat
terned thought and his response
has no significance. The individual
cannot succeed in meeting a new
challenge with the same old solu
tions.
Nor can he seek change
through relationships with other
human beings since these relation
ships are basically false
The individuals involved, rather
than touching one another
psychologically, merely present
images of themselves to each

other. By holding these image
masks before their faces they
ignore one another, thereby cre
ating deep divisions which are dif
ficult to overcome.
Krishnamurti explained that he
is not a teacher, guru, or leader
because he, unlike a teacher or
guru, does not bring gratification
to his followers by supplying easy
answers and pat solutions for
what people should do. "I'm not
telling you what you should do
from moment to moment, but I
am just pointing out something to
you; you can take it or leave it,
depending on you, not me. And
most of you will leave it, for the
obvious reason that you do not
find gratification in it."

has no significance. The individual
cannot succeed in meeting a new
challenge with the same old solu

Nor can he seek change
through relationships with other
human beings since these relation
ships are basically false
The individuals involved, rather
than touching one another
psychologically, merely present
images of themselves to each

other. By holding these image
masks before their faces they
ignore one another, thereby cre
ating deep divisions which are dif

Krishnamurti explained that he
is not a teacher, guru, or leader
because he, unlike a teacher or
guru, does not bring gratification
to his followers by supplying easy
answers and pat solutions for
what people should do. "I'm not
telling you what you should do
from moment to moment, but I
am just pointing out something to
you; you can take it or leave it,
depending on you, not me. And
most of you will leave it, for the
obvious reason that you do not
find gratification in it."
