# YAF And SDS Members Debate
## Students Characterize Group Tactics 
### BETTY NISHIOKA 
On the question of limi
tations on tactics used on campus,
"two points of view must be con
sidered: the University adminis
tration which says what is accept
able and the political organi
zations which say what is neces
sary." With this opening state
ment, Harvey Hukari, leader of
Young Americans for Freedom
(YAF) and editor of the Arena,
initiated the group tactics panel
discussion in Lassen Lounge Tues
day night. Also featured on the
panel was Students for a Demo
cratic Society (SDS) member
| Jeanne Friedman.
In his prefacing statement,
Hukari asserted that he is a tra
ditionalist and believes in making

changes through the system,
noting, "I believe that at Stanford
we have a system that allows
student voices to be heard."
Hukari asserted, however,
that his position as a conservative
was a lrustrating one. He regretted
that "'the only time the adminis
tration seems to respond quickly
is when they are pressured."
Speaking in defense of the
University, one of the items he
pointed to was the recent SES re
port. "Of course, there is the
question of the extent of the stu
dents' voice in its ultimate ap
proval," Hukari stated, "but the
SES report is evidence of Stan
ford's willingness to be a flexible
and open institution."

Jeanne Friedman pursued
the theme of Hukari's opening
statementâ€”the college com
munity's view on what is neces
sary. "It is not proper for men
who see themselves as benevolent
men (the trustees who put time
and effort into University manage
ment) to be so schizophrenic as to
think that what they do on the
business level does not have any
thing to do with their involvement
with the University."
Miss Friedman agreed that
SES is doing many innovative
things but stressed the importance
of the role of the students as see
ing themselves as legitimately
having the definite voice.
Miss Friedman also brought
up the question of power and
cited as an example a University
housing committee on which she
is a member. The results of her
committee's study will reflect six
months of careful research, but
she commented that the trustees
may not even read the results.
Since a trustee is defined as
merely a "guardian of a trust,"
Miss Friedman continued, "It is
the responsibility as well as a right
of the students to demand
change."
Hukari agreed that "as a con
sumer" (a student pays for one
third of his education), "students
have the right to ask for and work
for change. He noted, however, a
certain "air of licentiousness on
campus which makes anything ac
ceptable if the goal is."
Hukari cited committees and
dialogues as desirable tactics, ad

mitting, however, that committees
may be frustrating but that they
necessary. He emphazized that
students working through the
system are making progress in ef
fecting change, although the
change may not be as dynamic as
confrontation tactics.
Miss Friedman, however, at
tributed the success of com
mittees this year to the people
who are in other committees
threatening violence if immediate
results are not obtained.
Effectiveness of Protest
The problem of the effective
ness of tactics led to Miss Fried
man's assertion that now "after
three years of protest and
marches, the war (in Vietnam)
goes on and on. When you know
you're not listened to because
nothing happens, then we have
proved that we never had to
listen. Change through the use of
peaceful tactics was a myth."
Hukari objected, noting that
there are legitimate reasons for
both sides of the war and that the
protests and marches have
worked, in focusing attention to
the war and activating so many
people to work for candidates to
achieve its termination.
On the question of the Viet
nam War, Miss Friedman indicated
that President Pitzer, who has ex
pressed his disagreement with the
war, should now take action that
is appropriate to his position on
the war and to his rank in the Uni
versity. Actions which she
thought were meaningful and ap
propriate were to call on all
campus convocation to discuss the
war and to stop research for one
day to allow researchers to ques
tion their involvement in the war.
"I'm not saying what he should
do," Miss Friedman clarified, "but
I'm saying he should do some
thing."
Keep Channels Open
On the preservation of legal
tactics, Hukari argued that "we

have spent a long time in achiev
ing the state of civilization that
we have" and legitimate channels
have been effective. He confirmed
the success of the Human Rights
Commission and added that the
"BSU demands and tactics have
accomplished more than those of
SDS."
"There are certain legal
rights not always recognized by
the University," he said, about the
importance of legitimate actions,
"that are recognized by the out
side world. If I felt strongly
enough, I will work through legal
channels."
Moral Self-Kighteousness
Hukari warned against the
"moral sel f-righ teousness of
goals" of such groups as the SDS,
ans asked, "if the goals are so
good, why aren't people support
ing them? It is too easy to justify
tactics with moral self
righteousness."
In defense of SDS tactics,
Miss Friedman challenged those
who condemn SDS to develop
other tactics that work.
Miss Friedman noted that
the main difference between her
view and Hukari's is that "tactical
ly speaking, Hukari is saying that
he will work within the system.
But in an ultimate situation, for
example Nazi Germany, this
method won't work." Miss Fried
man believes that there Eire things
going on now that are so threaten
ing that she is willing to take
action outside of the law.
Avoid Confrontation Tactics
Miss Friedman cited methods
of avoiding confrontation
politics-"to have the University
run by a majority of the people
there, the students and faculty."
She believed that the University
can be restructured so that dia
logue, necessary to inform people
and make decisions, can reach
everyone, and so that all can work
together as a community. To
achieve this end, she suggested the
breakdown of the University into
smaller colleges and having general
policies made by trustees while
specific policies would be made
by those directly involved who
have the time and competence to
do so.
The closing statement of the
evening was made by Hukari. To
eliminate any misconceptions
which may have been made in the
course of the discussion, Hukari
stated, "I was the conservative."
