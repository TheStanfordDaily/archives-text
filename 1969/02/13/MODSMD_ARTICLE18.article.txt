# Suttle Sole Survivor
## Wrestlers Wracked 
### LARRY MOWELL 
Stanford wrestling coach
Dave Reed felt like a football
coach who had just lost all his
quarterbacks as his charges were
losing 31-3 to Portland State Mon
day night at Encina Gym.
Len Borchers, Bill Ross, and
Hal Hothan, the three leading win
ners on the team, were sidelined
by a skin infection.
As a result, Sophomore
George Hansen and senior Bert
Ambler were required to wrestle
two classes above normal to keep
the forfeits down to four.

A shutout seemed imminent
since Portland State had three
very powerful and experienced
wrestlers from Japan, plus Chuck
Seal, a victor over Borchers two
years ago.
However, senior John Suttle,
wrestling by far his best match of
the year, upset Yoshio Kojima,
9-7. Kojima was a Japanese
national high school champion,
but Suttle took him to the mat
for a two-point takedown and a
two-point predicament in the first
round and rode him the entire
second period.
Suttle tired noticeably in the
third round and Hojima wracked
up seven points, but his bid was
too late.
George Hansen also turned in
a heartening performance for
Stanford. He lost 5-1 to a much
bigger opponent in his best effort
of the year.

Bert Ambler was simply out
muscled at 177 as Portland State's
Rich Wright lifted him from the
mat, hurled him down, and fell on
him for a third round pin.
Sophomore Bob Toda and
senior Brian Smith also suffered
falls. Toda was pinned by Toshi
Kasahara in the second round.
Smith was flattened by Chuck
Seal with six seconds left in the
first round of their 152 pound
bout.
Soph Dave Thomas kept the
score close for two rounds in his
137 pound clash, but Portland
State's Koji Watanabe slaughtered
him in the third to run the count
to 9-2.
Craig Bernhard at 145 was
unable to cope with Terry Moore
of Portland State and suffered an
8-2 loss.
