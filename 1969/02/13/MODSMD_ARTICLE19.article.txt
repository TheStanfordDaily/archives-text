The Stanford ice hockey
team will seek its fourth win Sun
day night against the San Fran
cisco Senior Hockey Club.
San Francisco is considered
to be the strongest of the six
amateur clubs in the Bay Area this
season, and has two wins over
Berkeley, the team that handed
Stanford its only loss. It will take
a major team effort by the Indians
to pull this one out, but they have
shown distict signs of improve
ment over the past two weeks as
they begin to mature as a hockey
team.
The game will be played at
the Belmont Iceland, starting at
10:15 P.M. Admission is free.


VET NETTERâ€”Dean Schlobohm, No. 2 man tin Stanford's tennis team for the
past two years, sparked the Indians to a 6-0 victory over San Fernando Valley
State last week. Schlobohm, playing No. 1 in the absence of John Spiegel and
Stan Pasarell, outlasted Steve Messiner 3-6, 6-2, 6-3. Paul Marienthal, Chuck
Alloo, Roy Kahn, llrad Cornell and Dave Bleeker were the other winners for the
Tribe. Rain washed out the doubles matches.
