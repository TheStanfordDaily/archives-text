# ROTC Proposals Move Into Senate
## 
### 
The fate of Stanford's' ROTC pro
grams moves into the hands of the Aca
demic Senate this afternoon as it begins
consideration of the mammoth and con
troversial report issued by the student
faculty committee on ROTC yesterday.
As the primary decision-making body
of the faculty, the Senate has control
over Stanford's curricula. It could deny
academic credit for ROTC courses to
day.
The Senate's agenda includes short
presentations explaining both the
minority and majority report followed
by discussions. Voting may be delayed
to a later date.
The majority report from six of the
nine members recommended that Stan
ford discontinue offering ROTC courses
with or without credit and that on
campus military activities be required to
conform with rules governing voluntary
activities.
The minority report recommended
retaining the present ROTC program
with certain changes in administration
and presentation.
The Senate may pass one or the
other of the reports in full or with
changes. Its decision may be appealed to
the Academic Council if a petition
among the faculty receives 50 signa
tures. There are indications that thiS"will
happen if the majority report is passed
by the Senate.
According to Provost Richard
Lyman, "The faculty is, by long estab
lished tradition, the decisive voice in re
lation to curriculum matters." The ad
ministration will be under strong pres
sure to implement any decision by the
faculty concerning this report.
The administration may have to ne
gotiate any changes in contracts or rela

tions between Stanford and the Depart
ment of Defense. Colonel Robert L.
Thomas, Professor of Naval Science,
said that the majority report presents a
proposal in conflict with the law that
establishes ROTC. A change in the law
would be required to implement the ma
jority report and action by Congress
would be required, he said.
To avoid this conflict, the committee
may have to alter the majority recom
mendations Or decide to drop ROTC
entirely.
The Trustees have the final authority
in the decision.
