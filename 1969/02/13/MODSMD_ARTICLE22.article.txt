"The Exception and the Rule" by Bertolt Brecht, set for presen
tation in Toyon Lounge February 13, 14, and 15, is being sponsored
by Ram's Head Productions.
The troupe of eight men and two women are a traveling unit from
Merrill and Crown Colleges at U.C.S.C. In addition to acting the play,
they sing, juggle and recite their way through a program of Brecht
poems and songs.
The play, though written over twenty years ago, is chillingly
current in its investigation of exploitation, law, order, and justice.
Curtain time is 8:30 P.M. Tickets are $1.
