# Rush Starts Monday
## Frats To Show Positive Aspects 
### FRANK MILLER 
Living in a fraternity as an alternative
to living in coed dorms and other groups
will characterize rush procedures this
year, according to rush chairman, Jay
Voss, a senior in economics.
Under pressure from certain seg
ments of the Stanford community and
the SES regarding selection procedures
for new members, the fraternities are
emphasizing the positive aspect of fra
ternity living and rush procedures. Jay
Voss noted that most fraternities have
abandoned the black-ball or unanimous
vote systems that have been used by
some in the past for admitting fresh
men. Under this old procedure one vote
against someone by a fraternity member
would prevent the prospective member
from receiving an invitation to join the
fraternity.
Voss continued that most fraternities

now have a "positive vote system."Each
fraternity has its own voting procedure
and they do vary, but at least one frater
nity has a system whereby each member
has the same number of votes as there
are total places open in the fraternity.
The member casts these votes for pro
spective freshmen as he wants, and he
can cast as many as five votes for one
person. The freshmen who receive the
highest number of votes are invited to
join the fraternity.
Chance Selection
The SES report recommended that
the fraternities adopt a mutual selection
system. Under this system the student
would list his first choices for a frater
nity and the fraternity would list its
first choices for members. The selec
tions would then be matched by chance
or by computer. Voss criticized this
mutual selection as "taking away the

subjective"â€”taking out personal selec
tion and preference.
Voss stressed that rush is designed so
members of fraternities and freshmen
come into contact and get to know each
other. Fraternities are looking for stu
dents who have compatible outlooks
with its members and who will feel com
fortable in the fraternities. They hope
that freshmen will only join fraternities
in which they feel at home.
Inter-Fraternity Council (IFC) Pres
ident Doug Chandler declared that a
number of fraternities are reevaluating
rush procedures and fraternity life in
general. "Change is an ongoing process"
which the fraternities are always being
involved in but "the SES report has
been a catalyst."
Coed houses have "helped frater
nities because people will now put a
more conscious choice" in their selec
tion of a living group according to Voss.
"The entire residence program has
changed in the last few years and frater
nities are an option. There is no longer
any social pressure to join a fraternity."
Starts Monday
Meal orientation begins the rush pro
cedures next Monday for Stanford's 24
fraternities and the eating clubs.
The meal orientation, as such, is not
a rush function but rather a one-way
meal exchange program in which fresh
men have an opportunity to eat at least
three meals at different fraternities or
eating clubs. The 3000 eating spaces are
assigned at random, with about five
frosh attending each meal. It is hoped
that through these meals and talk fresh
men will gain a better understanding of
the fraternity and eating club living
alternatives.
Voss said that about 30-40% of the
freshmen men have requested places in
the meal orientation program. The
formal rush procedures will start on
March 3 when all fraternities will hold
open houses. There will be another open
house during winter quarter and open
contact with any freshmen will be al
lowed outside their residences.
Spring vacation will begin the final
stages of rush procedure. There will be
more open houses for freshmen and
complete open contact will be allowed
in and outside freshmen residences.
This extra contact will be open
to a maximum of 7 freshmen from
March 3 to April 11. Rush will cul
minate with fraternity parties on April
11 and 12 when freshmen will be in-,
vited to join the fraternities.
Both Voss and IFC President Chand
ler stressed that no pressure was being
put on freshmen. Originally it had been
planned to have open rush all year, i.e.,
freshmen would have been allowed to
attend any fraternity function and any
contact between fraternities and fresh
men would have been allowed. It was
hoped that this would take pressure off
both freshmen and fraternities.
However, the fraternities decided
that this year long open rush might have
an adverse effect on all freshmen dorm
life.
