# University Clarifies Room Rights In Wake Of Pot Bust Paranoia
## 
### JENNY MATTHEWS 
In the wake of the recent student
"paranoia" over campus marijuana ar
rests, the University has published a
statement that police and other law en
forcement officers will be admitted to a
student room only with the consent of
the assigned student or with a valid
search warrant.
This statement answers the major
concern of the new Campus Committee
Against Police Harassment which was
hastily formed to demand official clari
fication of the legal rights of students
on campus.
The statement, released by Associate
Dean of Students Sally Mahoney, and
other housing officials, says that "fire
and health inspectors will be admitted
to a student room only with the consent
of the resident, or upon the presenta
tion of a valid search warrant to inspect,
or upon the giving of 24 hour construc
tive notice to the student.
"If a student explicitly denies con
sent," the policy continues, "the fire or
health inspector must obtain a warrant
before entering the student's room."
"Constructive notice" is defined as a
minimum of posting a notice on a stu
dent room door or other reasonable
public place in a manner that the stu
dent is likely to see it at least 24 hours
prior to the inspection.
If the student does not actually see
the notice, the official memorandum ex
plains, the notice is nevertheless suffic
ient to allow entry into the room.
"Other non-University personnel will
be admitted to a student room only
with the consent of a student assigned
to that room "
Official Clarification
According to Daniel DeYoung of the
Business Affairs Office, who helped re

lease the memorandum, "This has essen
tially always been the University's
policy concerning non-University offic
ials.
"There seems, however, to have been
some misunderstanding recently. We
hope the memorandum has clarified the
issue."
Tim Logan, Chairman of the Campus
Committee, and LASSU Speaker Yale
Braunstein met with President Pitzer
last Friday to discuss the issue of stu
dent rights as campus residents, but ac
cording to Logan, "We weren't given
and substantial answers at that time."
Logan was extremely pleased with
the new statement, however, saying that
it represented "a major breakthrough in
the acquisition of student rights on cam
pus.
"The Dean of Students Office has
been sitting on this request for
months."
Logan pointed out that one of the
campus residences, Soto House, made a
formal request last fall to Dean Robert
Rosch to deny non-University officials
the right to enter student rooms with
out. a warrant, but "I guess it took our
meeting with the President to get any
action taken."
Fll rtlicr Demands
With the major demand of his com
mittee taken care of, Logan stated he
"will nevertheless strive to remove all
undercover police officers without a
valid warrant from the campus."
Logan defined a "valid warrant" as
"one signed by the Dean of Students
Office explicitly stating the reason for
being on campus."
He further pointed out that "all
officers without such warrants should
be apprehended as trespassers.
"Undercover agents are presently at

tending University rallies," Logan com
plained, "such as the recent BSU meet
ing."
"Police who are supposedly on cam
pus to investigate the arson problems on
campus are actually investigating all
sorts of other things including drug use.
"This should be prohibited."
Within Authority
University and police officials, how
ever, have stated that it is fully within
the authority of off-campus police to be
on University property.
According to Logan, Pitzer denied
that undercover agents can get valid stu
dent body cards in order to participate
in University functions.
Logan further stated that when asked
if students' records are open to the
authorities without the permission of
the student, Pitzer "catagorically stated,
'no'."
Legal Fund
Another matter the Committee will
discuss is the institution of a legal de
fense fund for students requiring legal
aid.
"Money could be allocated," ex
plained Logan, "by the same means that
University scholarships are . . .with the
same sort of application to determine
financial need."
By now, the frenzied concern over
"pot busts", seems to have died down.
According to one dorm resident,
"Everything's back to normal, and the
joints, are now being passed around in
the halls again."
As to the validity of the rumor that
"the fifth bust is imminent", a spokes
man for the Santa Clara Sheriff's Office
stated "Stanford is always believing
rumors. That's why everyone's paranoid
up there."

statement that police and other law en
forcement officers will be admitted to a
student room only with the consent of
the assigned student or with a valid
search warrant.
This statement answers the major
concern of the new Campus Committee
Against Police Harassment which was
hastily formed to demand official clari
fication of the legal rights of students
on campus.
The statement, released by Associate
Dean of Students Sally Mahoney, and
other housing officials, says that "fire
and health inspectors will be admitted
to a student room only with the consent
of the resident, or upon the presenta
tion of a valid search warrant to inspect,
or upon the giving of 24 hour construc
tive notice to the student.
"If a student explicitly denies con
sent," the policy continues, "the fire or
health inspector must obtain a warrant
before entering the student's room."
"Constructive notice" is defined as a
minimum of posting a notice on a stu
dent room door or other reasonable
public place in a manner that the stu
dent is likely to see it at least 24 hours
prior to the inspection.
If the student does not actually see
the notice, the official memorandum ex
plains, the notice is nevertheless suffic
ient to allow entry into the room.
"Other non-University personnel will
be admitted to a student room only
with the consent of a student assigned
to that room "
Official Clarification
According to Daniel DeYoung of the
Business Affairs Office, who helped re

lease the memorandum, "This has essen
tially always been the University's
policy concerning non-University offic
ials.
"There seems, however, to have been
some misunderstanding recently. We
hope the memorandum has clarified the
issue."
Tim Logan, Chairman of the Campus
Committee, and LASSU Speaker Yale
Braunstein met with President Pitzer
last Friday to discuss the issue of stu
dent rights as campus residents, but ac
cording to Logan, "We weren't given
and substantial answers at that time."
Logan was extremely pleased with
the new statement, however, saying that
it represented "a major breakthrough in
the acquisition of student rights on cam
pus.
"The Dean of Students Office has
been sitting on this request for
months."
Logan pointed out that one of the
campus residences, Soto House, made a
formal request last fall to Dean Robert
Rosch to deny non-University officials
the right to enter student rooms with
out. a warrant, but "I guess it took our
meeting with the President to get any
action taken."
Fll rtlicr Demands
With the major demand of his com
mittee taken care of, Logan stated he
"will nevertheless strive to remove all
undercover police officers without a
valid warrant from the campus."
Logan defined a "valid warrant" as
"one signed by the Dean of Students
Office explicitly stating the reason for
being on campus."
He further pointed out that "all
officers without such warrants should
be apprehended as trespassers.
"Undercover agents are presently at

tending University rallies," Logan com
plained, "such as the recent BSU meet
ing."
"Police who are supposedly on cam
pus to investigate the arson problems on
campus are actually investigating all
sorts of other things including drug use.
"This should be prohibited."
Within Authority
University and police officials, how
ever, have stated that it is fully within
the authority of off-campus police to be
on University property.
According to Logan, Pitzer denied
that undercover agents can get valid stu
dent body cards in order to participate
in University functions.
Logan further stated that when asked
if students' records are open to the
authorities without the permission of
the student, Pitzer "catagorically stated,
'no'."
Legal Fund
Another matter the Committee will
discuss is the institution of a legal de
fense fund for students requiring legal
aid.
"Money could be allocated," ex
plained Logan, "by the same means that
University scholarships are . . .with the
same sort of application to determine
financial need."
By now, the frenzied concern over
"pot busts", seems to have died down.
According to one dorm resident,
"Everything's back to normal, and the
joints, are now being passed around in
the halls again."
As to the validity of the rumor that
"the fifth bust is imminent", a spokes
man for the Santa Clara Sheriff's Office
stated "Stanford is always believing
rumors. That's why everyone's paranoid
up there."
