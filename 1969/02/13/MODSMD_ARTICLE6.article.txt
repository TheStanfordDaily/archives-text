# More Paly Bombings
## 
### LANG ATWOOD 
Community leaders and police alike
are growing increasingly concerned that
someone is going to be killed or maimed
as terrorist-style bombing attacks con
tinue to plague the Midpeninsula.
The most recent attack occurred
Tuesday night, when a bomb shattered
over 20 windows and blew a hole in the
floor of the Concerned Citizens and Re
sistance headquarters on Lytton Ave. in
Palo Alto.
The blast was apparently the result
of a "grenade-type explosive device" ac
cording to police.
Pieces of shrapnel from a "pineapple
-type" hand grenade partially charged
with powder gouged holes in the walls
and blew off several shingles. The cas
ings of this type of device are available
in most surplus stores.
Neighbors who came outside upon
hearing the blast noticed no suspicious
persons or vehicles. There was no one in
the building when the blast occurred at
about 10:45 p.m.
This was the second attack directed
against the Concerned Citizens in recent
months and is part of a wave of bomb
ings aimed at liberal and left-wing per
sons and institutions.
"One of these bombs is going to
come in a window, explode, and then
we'll have a murder on our hands," said

Captain Guy Wathen of the Palo Alto
Police Dept.
Sunday afternoon a pipe bomb was
discovered on a window ledge behind
the Midpeninsula Free University store
in Menlo Park.
There were 20 people, including a
3-month-old child, inside the store when
the bomb was discovered.
The bomb failed to go off because of
a defective fuse.
The Free U. store has been a favorite
target of the bombers in the past. The
store is currently being remodeled,
partly because of damage suffered in
bombings and break-ins.
Another unexploded device was
found last Thursday on the front seat of
a car parked only two houses away from
the home of Mrs. Enid Pearson, a liberal
member of the Palo Alto City Council.
The home of another liberal council
man, Kirke Comstock was heavily
damaged in a recent bombing.
Last weekend a "peace center" in
San Jose was bombed. No one was in
jured. It is not known if this has any
connection with the incidents in this
area.
Local police agencies are conducting
an extensive investigation, and many
past targets of the bombers are re
portedly under close surveillance.
