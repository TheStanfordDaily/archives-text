# The 						Late Show

For those at Stanford who arc bored
with ancient, dull comedies on the Late
Show, a visit to the Moot Courtroom of the
Stanford Law School should provide a
fresh style of entertainment. In fact, if the
proceedings of the Stanford Judicial Coun
cil (SJC) were not an important matter,
their character would surely out draw any
other farce on campus.
Courtroom drama at 2:30 a.m. is not
even matched by Perry Mason. Simultane
ous defense by 20 defendants would blow
Louis Nizer's mind. Yet such is life with
the SJC and poor Jack Friendenthal, the
chairman, is caught as judge, chairman, and
prosecutor all in one.
The SJC hearings this week have been a
graphic example of ineptitude. They have
been disrupted by marching bands and
shouting defendants. They have been ab
surd and surrealistic-much like a dream in
which one loses all sense of time and place.

Quite simply, the proceedings have made a
mockery of the Stanford judicial system.
The old call for "order in the court" has
apparently been buried. Friedenthal, re
spected as a brilliant law professor, has
neither the toughness nor strength to be a
judge in this situation. Not that he is the
cause of trouble.
More realistically, the defendants and
observers in the court relentlessly disrupt
the proceedings with applause and often
irrelevent questions. It is doubtful Earl
Warren could control the scene. Yet the
defense has made good points. Unfortu
nately their impact has been minimal due
to the constant rumblings, and Frienden
thal can hardly be blamed for missing the
point occasionally after being bombarded
with nonsense for hours.
The Moot Courtroom may be a sym
bolic location for the SJC.
