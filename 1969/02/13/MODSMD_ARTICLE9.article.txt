# Two Minutes Of Haight
## Valentine Festival Of Love 
### Tim Haight 
It was in The Daily one morn
ing. Surely, the columnist had
never imagined it would actually
happen, but he had written it up:
Tomorrow is Valentine's Day.
This is a day we celebrate as a
festival of love. True, its main
beneficiaries these days are Whit
man's Candies and Hallmark
Cards, but that is by default. If
holidays (or enough holidays)
didn't exist, Hallmark would in
vent them (and they have). That is
beside the point.
"But what astral coincidence
made Friday Saint Valentine's
Day this year? That's the start of
a three-day weekend. Practically a
metaphysical invitation for some
thing festive to happen. I mean,
when rituals started, like Christ
mas and Easter and Saint Valen
tine's Day, they were really some
thing, celebrating symbols with
roots deep in human feeling. To
day, that soil seems to be
leached—or can it push its flowers
through the ice of our age?
"What kind of a celebration? A
celebration of love, silly. But how,
that's up to you. Don't organize
anything, except with people
whom you can trust not to put
the idea down. Perhaps just hold
it in your own heart, make a little
plan to give all your superfluous
stuff away, or set up a chalk side
walk painting place. Or just bake
something and hand it out.
"I sort of assume a community
feeling, rather than just loving one
or two. But that's groovy, too.
Bring music back to Pepperland."
Would Be Nice
It was seven thirty in the morn
ing. She read the column and saw
the mixture of hope and disap
pointment that had become one
of that columnist's standard
moves. Sure, it would be nice. A
love festival instead of classes,
work, politics, ego-games. It
would probably rain. Very funny:
"Everybody's making love or else
expecting rain."

But what about it? She
thought love was a personal sort
of thing. Why couldn't she in par
ticular do something—damning all
the rest? Just some little gesture
that day, something non-plastic,
to prove she was still alive. Of
course, it wasn't as if she had had
the general idea, but the idea to
go to classes wasn't hers, either.
In Tresidder, around lunch
time, he read The Daily and that
column about the love festival. He
lived off-campus, had turned off
the alarm for his nine o'clock, and
was now sleepily contemplating
his section at two. He didn't know
anyone in the class. There was one
cute chick, Miss Somebody, just
as he was Mr. Whoosis. He would
rather the class were a love festi
val.
Good Excuse
"Shit, man," one of the guys at
the house said that evening. "It
would be a good excuse for a
party."
And each in their own ways,
getting bands to play, finding
costumes or wild paint to paint
things or organizing some sort of
game, people prepared. It was an
act of faith, like bringing rocks
and stained glass and lead and
carved figures from hundreds of
miles, for tens of years, to build
Chartres.

pened. If came off. Although each
person had expected to confront a
grey day filled with unknowing
people as they tried to light their
particular sparkler, what they
found was a blinding light.
What happened is, of course,
now history. Some of the com
ments deserve mention, however:
Had It In Him
"I never knew he had it in him.
It was like when the Wizard of Oz

went from black-and-white to
Technicolor."
"When I expected all those
other people to do nothing, was I
really hating myself? I guess not. I
don't know. But then Friday
came and I did something, and
they did something. The question
became absurd. I'm not sure you
see exactly what I mean, but it
really doesn't matter."
"I didn't do anything myself,
until I saw others had. And that
wasn't easy, since when I went to
class, all the other people were
waiting, hoping, that somebody
would lead, would make it clear.
At first nobody did. I mean, the
teacher actually started to lecture,
with all of us just sitting there on
edge.
Meek Screamed
"Then this one meek little girl
opened up her purse, screamed,
threw confetti all over us, and
dashed from the room. It was like
a wave breaking. We all rushed
outside and shouted, swung from
trees, danced. And then we heard
the music ..."
"What I will never understand
is how the ratio worked out. It
was like the Feeding of the Five
Thousand."
"I had never gone nude on
Inner Quad before."
"God, if I ever have a day like
that again ... I never thought it
would happen . . . People are so
beautiful, and we all did our
thing, some separately, some to
gether."
"I was stoned all day. There
must be a God."
It really happened, on Febru
ary 14, 1969, at Stanford, because
people let their love and faith
overcome their boredom and fear.
The people that missed it really
knew they had missed something.
