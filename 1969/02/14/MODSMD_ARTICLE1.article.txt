# Defense Claims Accused Students Did Not Violate Disruption Policy
## 
### My BARBARA HYLAND 
At the third hearing of the Stanford
Judicial Council (SJC), in an atmos
phere more composed than previously,
the defense presented its case and con
cluded with a summary of its position
by Doron Weinberg, a graduate law stu
dent.
After two witnesses testified about
the lock system in the Faculty Club,
Weinberg began the defense. Two stu
dents, uninvolved in the alleged 'dis
ruption,' testified that they would not
have been unable to identify Associate
Dean of Students, Bill Wyman, as an ad
ministrator.
Rodney Williams, a defendant, then
came to the stand and said that he h-\d
given his name to Dean Wyman at his
request, but that he had not been aware
of Wyman's official status. He denied
that Wyinan had identified himself.
Basing his defense on this alleged fail
ure to give identification on Wyman's
part and on the nature of the dis
ruption, Weinberg argued that the de
fendants should not be charged with the
Campus Disruption Policy. Moreover, he
tried to show how a fair trial was impos
sible under the SJC.
Weinberg stipulated that all of the ac
cused had been at Bowman Alumni
House, that they had been in the
Faculty Club, that they were there with
hopes of entering and opening the
trustees' meeting, that all actions com
mitted were collective, and that the
only violation of campus policy was in
the trustees' refusal to open the meet
ing.
Analyze Violence
Analyzing the question of violence,
he emphasized that "no aggressive force
whatever" was used by students. He
stated that none of the people who had
hit or pulled on students had "been
brought to trial for the violence they
perpetrated." Students were defending
themselves against violence, he claimed.
Calling SDS a "free flowing and un
stratified group, he suggested that the
administration and trustees can not un
derstand this since they are conditioned
by their "hierarchical structure" which
forces them to think in terms of orders
from above.
Weinberg then approached the de
fense from an interpretation of the am

biguous interim Campus Policy on Dis
ruption, having two provisions. The first
makes it a violation of University policy
to prevent normal University functions
or obstruct the legitimate movement of
individuals on campus.
If disruption occurs, then individuals
are required to identify themselves and
to leave University buildings when asked
by a member of the University com
munity, acting in his official role and
identifying himself as such.
No Ideatification
The Defense felt that Wyman did not
identify himself when he took names at
the alleged disruption and that one can
not assume he is known campus-wide to
be an administrator. Therefore if the
two provisions of the Disruption Policy
are considered inseparable, thp students
can not be charged with breaking it
since proper identification was not
made, as stipulated in the second pro
posal. If the two provisions are con
sidered separate, they can not be

charged with violation of the second
proposal for the same reasons.
Turning then to the first portion of
the policy, Weinberg denied that stu
dents had prevented a University func
tion. He criticized the Council for
making "no effort to determine by any
objective standard if there was enough
noise" to disrupt the meeting. Witnesses
were "quite careful not to characterize
the noise as excessively loud," according
to Weinberg.
The only loud noise mentioned in tes
timony, he recalled, was "the specific
requests made to the trustees in a re
spectful tone of voice" over a bullhorn,
but even then Dean Watkins testified he
"didn't even hear it."
Weinberg questioned what consti
tuted disruption. From Weinberg's inter
pretation, the trustees heard that a
group of students were approaching and
broke up their own meeting to decide
what to do about the disruption that
had not yet occured.

HEARINGS CONTINUE-Doron Weinberg (standing, far left), law student and unofficial defense counsel for members of Students for a
Democratic Society (SDS) charged with disrupting last month's Trustee meeting, questions witness Jim Rummondsat SJC hearings yesterday
aftevnoon as Council members and defendants look on.
At the third hearing of the Stanford
Judicial Council (SJC), in an atmos
phere more composed than previously,
the defense presented its case and con
cluded with a summary of its position
by Doron Weinberg, a graduate law stu
dent.
After two witnesses testified about
the lock system in the Faculty Club,
Weinberg began the defense. Two stu
dents, uninvolved in the alleged 'dis
ruption,' testified that they would not
have been unable to identify Associate
Dean of Students, Bill Wyman, as an ad
ministrator.
Rodney Williams, a defendant, then
came to the stand and said that he h-\d
given his name to Dean Wyman at his
request, but that he had not been aware
of Wyman's official status. He denied
that Wyinan had identified himself.
Basing his defense on this alleged fail
ure to give identification on Wyman's
part and on the nature of the dis
ruption, Weinberg argued that the de
fendants should not be charged with the
Campus Disruption Policy. Moreover, he
tried to show how a fair trial was impos
sible under the SJC.
Weinberg stipulated that all of the ac
cused had been at Bowman Alumni
House, that they had been in the
Faculty Club, that they were there with
hopes of entering and opening the
trustees' meeting, that all actions com
mitted were collective, and that the
only violation of campus policy was in
the trustees' refusal to open the meet
ing.
Analyze Violence
Analyzing the question of violence,
he emphasized that "no aggressive force
whatever" was used by students. He
stated that none of the people who had
hit or pulled on students had "been
brought to trial for the violence they
perpetrated." Students were defending
themselves against violence, he claimed.
Calling SDS a "free flowing and un
stratified group, he suggested that the
administration and trustees can not un
derstand this since they are conditioned
by their "hierarchical structure" which
forces them to think in terms of orders
from above.
Weinberg then approached the de
fense from an interpretation of the am

biguous interim Campus Policy on Dis
ruption, having two provisions. The first
makes it a violation of University policy
to prevent normal University functions
or obstruct the legitimate movement of
individuals on campus.
If disruption occurs, then individuals
are required to identify themselves and
to leave University buildings when asked
by a member of the University com
munity, acting in his official role and
identifying himself as such.
No Ideatification
The Defense felt that Wyman did not
identify himself when he took names at
the alleged disruption and that one can
not assume he is known campus-wide to
be an administrator. Therefore if the
two provisions of the Disruption Policy
are considered inseparable, thp students
can not be charged with breaking it
since proper identification was not
made, as stipulated in the second pro
posal. If the two provisions are con
sidered separate, they can not be

charged with violation of the second
proposal for the same reasons.
Turning then to the first portion of
the policy, Weinberg denied that stu
dents had prevented a University func
tion. He criticized the Council for
making "no effort to determine by any
objective standard if there was enough
noise" to disrupt the meeting. Witnesses
were "quite careful not to characterize
the noise as excessively loud," according
to Weinberg.
The only loud noise mentioned in tes
timony, he recalled, was "the specific
requests made to the trustees in a re
spectful tone of voice" over a bullhorn,
but even then Dean Watkins testified he
"didn't even hear it."
Weinberg questioned what consti
tuted disruption. From Weinberg's inter
