## SDS Antics-Two Reactions 
### Barbara Hyland 
I admit that my first reaction
to the Stanford Judicial Council
hearing of the SDS students I at
tended Wednesday was naive in
that it was one of disgust and dis
belief.
Expecting a dignified, legalistic
courtroom scene, I found what re
sembled a menagerie going
through its repertory of most
attention-seeking antics.
I was stunned, especially since I
arrived just as one student asked
Bob Beyers, "As Director of the
News Service have you ever been
in the situation where you haven't
had enough money to buy
tampax?" The appreciative laugh
ter seemed sickening.
Yet as I sat in what probably is
the hottest room on campus, I
realized how conditioned my re
sponse was and how I was blindly
missing the crux of the problem.
Brought up to respect the
United States legal system, I, and
many other students, have been
persuaded that to make a
mockery of the law is a sacriledge.
This preconceived notion of the
law greatly influenced my initial
and shallow judgment of the SDS
hearing, for it does not concede to
the possibility that the fault may
be with the law. The cheers of
" 1-3-5-9-Friendenthal is doing
fine" mingled with dogs whimper
ing only heightened my anta
gonism towards those who were
seemingly trying to turn the
hallowed procedures into a farce,
and who were undeniably suc
ceeding. The ridicule was continu
ally enforced by placards, like in
the old melodramas, reading
"Boo" and "Yea," that were held
up at appropriate intervals.
Already A Farce
In trying to understand SDS
position, I saw that they were not
creating a farce of the legal
system, but that it was a farce al
ready and that they were merely
reinforcing this fact and making it
more blatant to unaware people
like me. When one's concern is the
Trustees and their involvement in
Southeast Asia, to be tried for
breaking a campus policy on
demonstrations is ludicrous.
The true issue is essentially ig
nored, and frustration is the in
evitable result. It is almost as in
congrous as realizing the existence
of crematoriums in Germany, and

then bringing Hitler to trial for
breaking air pollution laws.
To condemn the disruptions in
the hearing is to ignore the moti
vations behind them. When a legal
system misplaces its priorities, one
has an obligation to protest this.
Unfortunately the choice of tac
tics may again have alienated
many people and kept them from
realizing this critical fault in their
judicial system Hopefully despite
their immediate reaction of dis
gust, they will remain open
minded and look beyond the zoo
like atmosphere of the heraing
into the true problem.
Community Feeling
As I sat in the audience at the
hearing, I became aware of per
vasive community feeling. Songs
like the "Battle Hymn of the Re
public" were sung in the short re
cesses. Gradually and unwilling, I
felt myself sympathizing with this
group, for they shared more than

the communal root beer and
candy that were being passed
down the aisles.
They shared that conviction
that Stanford's legal procedure is
absurd since it avoids the para
mount question. It is for the
world question of South East Asia
that many students are risking
their academic careers. SCLC's re
writing of the demonstration
policy is inconsequential if Stan
ford's whole judicial system is not
revised.
A world view and not only a
campus perspective is needed, dif
ficult as it may be to incorporate
into our legal system. I hope that
the bedlam in the hearings will
lead to a better focus on the prob
lem of priorities and a solution to
it.
