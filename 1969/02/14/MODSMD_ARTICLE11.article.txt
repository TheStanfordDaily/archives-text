## Overseas Stifled 
### 
Editor, THE DAILY:
I was very glad to read the SES
report on the Stanford Overseas
Campus Program. Evidently, I and
my friends with me at the Vienna
Campus (Austria VI) are not the
only ones who have been sub
jected to the rigid policies of the
Overseas administration.
For many, the Stanford term
overseas may be the student's
only exposure to Europe through
his college years. Yet, for some
reason individual initiative is not
actively encouraged.
In our group, for instance,
some guy became very interested
in Greece after his travels during
the break. Unable to remain an
extra quarter after the Stanford
term he tried to arrange an alter
native trip to Greece instead of
going to Berlin with the group.
Unfortunately for him, an ad
ministrative inspection occurred
just prior to the trip, and he was
not permitted to follow through
with his new interest.
Some would argue with all due
justice that this person agreed to
go on both group field trips. But

traveling, it seems to me, preludes
being and letting oneself be open
to new ideas and directions.
The Stanford Overseas adminis
tration has yet to recognize the
value of students learning to think
for themselves and, perhaps, even
experimenting in finding their
own personal fulfillment during
the short time they have abroad.

• PSA Not Cheapest
Editor, THE DAILY:
In the "Youth Fare Is Fair"
Editorial of February 11, you per
petuated a myth. It is not cheaper
to fly to Los Angeles on non-CAB
Certificated Pacific Southwest
Airlines (PSA). TWA, United, and
Western Air Lines will fly anyone
to Los Angeles for $13.50, the
same fare PSA charges.
Few airline pilotes will fly PSA
because they cut some corners
that the regularly scheduled air
lines will not cut.

Three scheduled airlines serve
Los Angeles with Jet Commuter
service for $13.50. PSA equals
their fare, but it isn't the cheap
est.

Editor, THE DAILY:
I was very glad to read the SES
report on the Stanford Overseas
Campus Program. Evidently, I and
my friends with me at the Vienna
Campus (Austria VI) are not the
only ones who have been sub
jected to the rigid policies of the
Overseas administration.
For many, the Stanford term
overseas may be the student's
only exposure to Europe through
his college years. Yet, for some
reason individual initiative is not
actively encouraged.
In our group, for instance,
some guy became very interested
in Greece after his travels during
the break. Unable to remain an
extra quarter after the Stanford
term he tried to arrange an alter
native trip to Greece instead of
going to Berlin with the group.
Unfortunately for him, an ad
ministrative inspection occurred
just prior to the trip, and he was
not permitted to follow through
with his new interest.
Some would argue with all due
justice that this person agreed to
go on both group field trips. But

traveling, it seems to me, preludes
being and letting oneself be open
to new ideas and directions.
The Stanford Overseas adminis
tration has yet to recognize the
value of students learning to think
for themselves and, perhaps, even
experimenting in finding their
own personal fulfillment during
the short time they have abroad.

• PSA Not Cheapest
Editor, THE DAILY:
In the "Youth Fare Is Fair"
Editorial of February 11, you per
petuated a myth. It is not cheaper
to fly to Los Angeles on non-CAB
Certificated Pacific Southwest
Airlines (PSA). TWA, United, and
Western Air Lines will fly anyone
to Los Angeles for $13.50, the
same fare PSA charges.
Few airline pilotes will fly PSA
because they cut some corners
that the regularly scheduled air
lines will not cut.

Three scheduled airlines serve
Los Angeles with Jet Commuter
service for $13.50. PSA equals
their fare, but it isn't the cheap
est.
