# Guest Column
## Dear Col. Thomas 
### Craig Venator 
I was particularly disturbed
when the national news broad
casts reported that Yale Univer
sity is removing academic credit
from Reserve Officer Training
Corps programs.
The professor who headed the
university study group said
"ROTC is an extracurricular activ
ity, like band or choir," and he
concluded that participation in
such voluntary interest groups
hardly merits the awarding of aca
demic credits.
This action at Yale has empha
sized to me both the lack of un
derstanding about the ROTC pro
gram in the university community
and the need for communication
from ROTC graduates to the uni
versity and to their respective
units.
Participation in NROTC was a
major personal commitment on
my part. I vividly remember one
particular speaker who denounced
ROTC for forcing naive young
men into signing a contract of
military servitude by alternately
waving the threat of the draft and
the assurance of a college scholar
ship. The same argument later ap
peared as a letter in the Daily,
which concluded that an eighteen
or nineteen-year-old boy was not
mature enough to fully compre
hend such a major decision.
Somehow Committed
Yet somehow that twenty-year
old orator had commited himself
to Stanford over other good
schools, had chosen a major with
perhaps some doubts, and had put
forth his polemic fresh from the
period of ideological uncertainty
called the "identity crisis." Major
decisions in life are seldom, if
ever, made with complete cer
tainty.
As a prospective NROTC fresh
man, I had exmained the career
opportunities of a junior officer
and the requirements of the
NROTC unit. Concurrently, I had
weighed the financial assistance of
the Navy and the flexibility of the
college program. In the end, I
wholeheartedly commited myself
to the NROTC program at Stan
ford University.
Once in the NROTC program, I
was often exposed to the loud and
sometimes ill-informed talk
against the various aspects of the
ROTC curriculum. Careful listen
ing reveals a preponderance of
half truth and myth, often cou
pled with a hidden vent of polit
ical opinion.
Mickey Mouse?
I have often heard many Uni
versity courses referred to as
"Mickey Mouse." I never did find
an easy course at Stanford. Cer
tainly my NROTC courses were
no exception.
An interesting recollection con
cerns the non-NROTC students
who often enroll in the navigation
course and are usually distressed

at the heavy load, long hours, and
honest grading.
Military drill periods seem to
particularly irritate ROTC critics.
They seem to equate those leader
ship sessions with overzealous
herding of cattle, which proves
their thesis of the military-indus
trial spectre controlled by power
crazed idiots.
Develops Leadership
It is true that men do not
naturally perform the precise
movements of military drill. But
those short sessions give each
ROTC student the experience of
mastering an unfamiliar task
under pressure. Then, each must
take the responsibility of teaching
that task to others. The emphasis
on and responsibility for personal
example and good management
helps develop leadership, a most
important item in achieving goals
in the military or society at large.
The critics who disturbed me
the most are those, often faculty
members, who seem to feel that
ROTC is harmless enough but
does not deserve any academic
credit. They seem to say that
ROTC is somehow a second rate
endeavor.
The importance of the military
establishment in the many areas
of our national life shows this pos
ition to be pompous and distress
ingly narrow.
Demanding
Some feel that ROTC doesn't
demand enough from its students.
But the stated policy on units of
credit is based on hours required
per unit, and ROTC courses are
just as demanding of student time
as courses of equal units in other
University departments.
Anyone who respects Stanford
students realizes that the chance
for a simple and dull cour-e is not
the motivation for this participa
tion. For those who think stu
dents are joining in fear of the
draft, let them realize that there
are many military programs with a
shorter service obligation.
It was vital to me that my
NROTC courses were credited, as
I would not have had time to take
them on a non-credit basis in ad
dition to the academic load each
quarter necessary for graduation.
Personal Importance
As graduation and commis
sioning approached in the spring
of last year, I began to have a full
realization of the important part
that ROTC had played in my
preparation to be a naval officer.
Four years of study in naval
subjects and the close association
with the NROTC staff had given
me the necessary core of military
knowledge and a feeling for the
day to day demands on an officer.
The University setting had pre
sented me the contrasts needed to
place the military and my position
in it in perspective with the other
areas of knowledge and concern in
our society. Very important to me
was the feeling that I was pre
pared, by all my experiences at
Stanford, to graduate and begin a
career in society with confidence
and purpose.
As an ROTC graduate, one
knows exactly where he is headed;
I felt a little sorry for classmates
of mine who viewed graduation as
a shocking and confusing upheaval
from the warm and familiar nest
of college life.
One pleasant surprise has oc
cured in my training to become a
Naval Aviator. When I received
the Captain's List award for high
academic performance in the aca
demic portion of the Basic Prop
syllabus, the base commanding of
ficer told me that Stanford grad
uates had received the award more
often than those from any other
school. I am obviously not the
only Stanford graduate who has
been able to utilize his fine educa
tion to the benefit of himself and
the Navy.
