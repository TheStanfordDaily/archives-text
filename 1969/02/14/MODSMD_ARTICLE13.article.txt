# Text Of Dean James Letter To Pitzer
## 
### 
Dear President Pitzer:
Your letter of February 7,
1969 transmitting the report of
the Stanford Human Relations
Commission in the case of Profes
sor Robert Koff is at hand.
I concur with your judgment
that the Human Relations Com
mission has, within the areas of its
jurisdiction, produced a con
vincing report, and I trust we can
help strengthen the Commission
in performing its chartered func
tion.
You asked that we treat Rec
ommendation Number 1 as an in
formal suggestion, and we referred
it to our Educational Policy Com
mittee for consideration. Many of
the comments I offer in this letter
are drawn from the ensuing dis
cussion.
As an immediate response I
have, with the Director's approval,
asked Cecil Shaw, who is an inter
viewer and supervisor, and an ad
vanced graduate Black student, to
coordinate recruitment and inter
viewing for the secondary teacher
education program (STEP). Some
experimentation with tape re
corded interviews was suggested.
We will also inform applicants
that interviewers are available
from several ethnic groups, and

offer to serve their preferences
wherever practicable, including ac
cess to the Director of the pro
gram when that is requested.
Recommendation Number 2
endorses our existing policy; we
are and have been recruiting stu
dents and staff from minority
groups. The Commission reported
no findings on degree to which
minority group persons are al
ready involved in the School of
Education. Had they inquired,
they would have found that Frank
Hawkinshire was recommended
for appointment to this faculty
prior to last spring's confronta
tion, that two of our six STEP in
terviewers are Black and one has a
Mexican-American background.
The School, with an enrollment of
less than 500, has increased its
Black student enrollment from 22
last year to 33 this year, giving the
School a larger percentage of
Black students than the University
as a whole. We have recently inter
viewed a number of promising
possibilities for new staff appoint
ments, including several Spanish-
Americans, one of whom we ex
pect to appoint assistant director
of STEP.
On Monday morning, in accord
ance with Recommendation Num

ber 3, I called all STEP inter
viewers together and reviewed the
report of the Human Relations
Commission with them. Several
suggestions, including some al
ready alluded to, grew out of this
review. Hereafter, the interviewers
will be more involved in the delib
erations of the Committee that
acts on admissions. Within the
week I will appoint a new com
mittee of faculty and students to
review all procedures related to re
cruitment, interviewing, admis
sion, and orientation of students
in the School, including those en
tering STEP, with special atten
tion to the problems of those stu
dents coming from minority
groups.
Though you have pointed out
that the Commission's findings
Numbers 7 and 8 were outside the
Commission's jurisdiction, you
directed our attention to their
conclusion that certain remarks
made during Miss Stevenson's in
terview were inappropriate and
that Professor Koff was insensitive
to the interviewee's feelings. Cer
tainly no one can argue that the
interview turned out well. Our
faculty members and I are dis
tressed that Miss Stevenson should
have felt so badly about this inter
view. That Professor Koff shares
fully in this distress is evidenced

by his letter of apology to her and
his invitation for her to return to
Stanford at our expense to help
correct the impression left on her.
We are also distressed that Profes
sor Koff and his family have, in
the past several weeks, experi
enced unwarranted criticism and
threats more severe than most of
us experience during the whole of
our academic careers.
It is only just to point out that
this incident is an isolated one.
Professor Koff has successfully
conducted more than forty inter
views since September. Moreover,
we have substantial evidence
drawn from his staff, from stu
dents in the program, and from
faculty and my own observations
that STEP has improved steadily
since he assumed his duties as Di
rector in the late fall of 1968, and
we are seeking ways to encourage
the talented and innovative contri
butions he can make to our pro
grams.
Our faculty members with
whom I have discussed this inci
dent stress that the University's
concern should not be with excor
iation of one professor. My col
leagues interpret this incident as a
symptom of deeper, continuing
general problems in student
faculty relations not confined to
this School or this University. We

shall make an earnest effort to
understand these problems and to
alleviate them.
In attempting to be responsive
to Miss Stevenson's complaint and
the concerns expressed by the
Black students at Stanford, we
have not limited our attention to
the administration of STEP, or to
the problems of minority students
alone. While the faculty of the
School will intensify its efforts to
become acquainted with the prob
lems and aspirations of minority
students, and to improve the
social milieu in which they live at
Stanford, they have begun also an

examination of academic pro
grams, with the intention of im
proving the opportunities of all
students to pursue their interests
and prepare for the work they
want to do after they leave Stan
ford. New faculty appointments,
already made and to be made for
next year, will further strengthen
our capabilities to do so. The Edu
cational Policy Committee will
welcome suggestions from stu
dents and student groups.
Very sincerely yours,
H. THOMAS JAMES
