# Population Spells Growing Crisis
## 
### JUDY LANSING 
"If we don't do something
soon about the population prob
lem, it's going to be curtains,"
stated Harrison Brown, geophysics
professor from the California In
stitute of Technology and author
of The Challenge of Man's Future
at the Population and Environ
ment forum's meeting in Bishop
Auditorium Tuesday night. Also
speaking on "The Challenge of
Man's Future; Population vs.
Planet Earth" were Prof. Dudley
Kirk, Food Research Institute and
Paul Ehrlich, biological sciences
and author of The Population
Bomb.
"When history looks back on
this decade, they will see it as the
one which decided or not to make
a success of civilization," said
Brown.
Brown suggested two ways to
solve the population problem. He
explained that the world society is
dividing into separate groups of
rich and poor. He said the flow of
capital from the richer countries
must be increased.
He felt the flow of capital can
be increased only to a point. He

said we are limited by the educa
tion of the people in the poorer
countires. He emphasized, "There
is no such thing as instantaneous
development."
Brown also suggested birth
control. He felt v e had the neces
sary technology for birth control
but doubted how great an effect it
would have in the next decade. He
said that both an increase in econ
omic flow and birth control are
"necessary but neither are effec
tive."
Not Too Late
Brown admitted that in a sense
he was a pessimist. But he added,
"I am not convinced it is too late,
otherwise I wouldn't be here
now."
Kirk disagreed that population
was a problem, saying, "The
movement to the great metropolis
is our real problem." He explained
the movement out of rural areas
brought the major problems of
pollution, urban planning and
destruction of environment.
Kirk denied that we had to
worry about an increase in our 1
population. He said the baby
boom has vanished in the United
States. He explained, "We are un
doubling what we were doubling
before."
Kirk was optimistic about our
agricultural advances. He said,
"We can't have the vaguest idea
what will happen beyond 2000
but we will have enough till
then." Fathom is not our prob
lem. He said, "The problem is
how to get people who are not
accustomed to protein diets to eat
the right foods."
He described the need for a
reorientation of our social think
ing. He said we need to change
our idea that "quantity of life is
more important than quality." He
added that birth control wouldn't
be effective till you change the
motivations of the people.
Ehrlich disagreed with Kirk
that we don't have to worry about
our population increase and that
our agricultural advances were
successful.
Second Baby Boom
Ehrlich sited that 20% of our
population is in the twenty to
thirty year old age group. He
denied Kirk's statement that the
baby boom has vanished. He said
a second baby boom is coming.
Ehrlich gave examples of the
harmful effects of our agricultural
developments. He said that DDT
is being dispersed into our seas
killing off much of the living pro
cess. He also stated that our nitro
gen process is being ruined.
Ehrlich said, "Population con
trol is not a panacea." However,
he explained, "If we do not con
trol the population anything we
do will go down the drain."
He cited the President of Sci
ence Advisory Committee report
(1966) on the world problem that
said that the situation that faces
us after 1985 demands that we
begin population control now!
Ehrlich said that that was two
years ago and nothing has been
done. He explained, "That's why
I'm a pessimist."
