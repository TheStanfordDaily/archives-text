# Meet Of The Year
## SC, Tribe In Showdown Tomorrow 
### WELLS SHOEMAKER 
USC carries a decade's legacy of
undefeated swimming teams into
Stanford's Encina Pool, tomorrow
at 2 p.m. The Trojans, currently
ranked second in the country
ahead of Stanford and Yale, have
weathered 108 dual meets with
out a loss.
The meet figures to run as close
as the 52-52 spash-down two
years ago, a wild affair which saw
every seat, wall, and tree packed
to overflowing. The addition of a
second diving event eliminates the
chance for a tie this year.
Stanford went on from the dual
meet tie to edge the Trojans for
the 1967 NCAA championship in
spectacular team performance
that bagged Seven NCAA records.
Saturday's meet will be carried
on closed circuit TV to the Old
Pavilion to assure every ticket
holder a live view of the meet or a
dry seat in the event of rain.
Daland Wailin'
Peter Daland, who has coached
USC to five NCAA titles since
1961, returns with his perennially
deep bench and over-generous
speckling of outstanding individ
ual swimmers.
Stanford brings to bear a

predominantly sophomore team
that lanced seven NCAA freshman
records last year. Graduation and
attrition leave only four NCAA
veterans on the squad, three of
which have shared American
records.
Southern Cal's legendary
strength in distance freestyle is no
myth. NCAA champion and
former world record holder Greg
Charlton tops the list. NCAA
medalists Greg Fink and George
Watson return from last year's
squad.
Sophomore Andy Strenk
placed in the AAU National
Championships last season. Throw
in newcomers Tom Ludwig and
Steve Frlekin, and behold the
deepest assortment of distance
freestylers in the nation.

Berk No Quirk
Stanford's Brent Berk beat
Charlton for an Olympic berth
last August, and will have his
hands full again. Berk hit 4:46 for
500 yards in Stanford's 80-30
romp over UCLA last week, and
will have to cut off another 3 or 4
seconds to knock off Charlton.
Bert Mason will be Berk's running
mate.
Mark Mader (6-9) set the Amer
ican record for 200 yards back
stroke as a USC freshman two
years ago. Stanford's Fred Hay
wood won the 100 backstroke at
the same national AAU Cham
pionships. Haywood and Mader
will take the opening gun in the
medley relay and later face off in
the 200 backstroke.
USC'S NCAA 200 butterfly

champion Phil Houser will bump
head on against Stanford's Olym
pic bronze medalist John Ferris.
Ferris Of Them All
Ferris could swim practically
any event in the lineup, a tricky
source of speculation in the tradi
tional pre-meet second guessing.
Ferris took third in both 200 fly
and 200 individual medley at
Mexico City, and will obviously
be hard to touch in either of those
events.
Stanford captain Pete Siebert
took second and third in two in
dividual medley races at the
NCAA's last year, and could team
with Ferris for a rocky 1-2 com
bination in the 200 IM. Siebert's
versatility makes him a threat in
any middle distance freestyle,
backstroke, or butterfly event.
Luis Nicolao, a former world
record butterflier and an Olympic
finalist freestyle sprinter, likewise
has a multitude of slots in the
Stanford lineup, much to the con
sternation of Mr. Daland.
Peter Daland is no slouch at the
guessing game, however. He has
kept most of his "big guns" es
sentially out of competition
through the first half of the sea
son, and will undoubtedly pop up
with more than a few surprises.
Sprints Can Hurt
Two years ago, USC sprinters
shut out Stanford in both 50 and
100 freestyles and tied the meet
by capturing the last event, the
400 free relay. Stanford sprinters
peaked later for the NCAA's and
ripped 2 seconds off the American
record, with little effect on the
dual meet score.
The sprints could very well tell
the tale again in races where two
tenths of a second can separate
first and fourth place.
USC's former national sprint
champion Don Havens has blazed
a 44.8 anchor leg on a USC relay.
Havens is unpredictable in a dual
meet, which probably means
dangerous.
More predictable and still dan
gerous Russ Kidder and sopho
more Dan Frawley give the Tro
jans at least two more 46 second
freestyle relay legs.

Stanford sprinters, going faster
than ever for mid season, will be
hard to tie down. Bob Jamison,
several times AAU finalist and
NCAA freshman record holder,
figures it will take at least a 46 to
win the 100 free.
Seniors Morgan Manning, Jeff
Hammett, and Nicolao and sopho
more Rich Eagleston give the
Cards a healthy choice of 46-sec
ond relay sprinters.
Diver Power
The results of two diving events
could be crucial. Ted Nichols,
diving with a taped knee, and
Norris Heckel, suffering from a
pulled ligament, bounce against
USC's Rick McDermott, Pac-8
runner-up.
Tag Leonard will have an uphill
fight to break into USC's breast
stroke lineup. Morgan Manning
may be pressed into foreign serv
ice to bolster the Indians' breast
stroke front.
It is virtually impossible to win
a dual meet without taking at
least one of the two relays. Both
teams will probably stack the
opening event, the medley relay,
for a psychological lift off and a
seven point buffer.
Predictions and place-picking
serve to whittle away nervousness
before the fact, but probably
haven't the least bearing on this
meet. Swimming has a notoriously
short memory for old records.
Both teams will accelerate with
each other right down to the last
relay, and nobody will remember
what the doormouse said.

that lanced seven NCAA freshman
records last year. Graduation and
attrition leave only four NCAA
veterans on the squad, three of
which have shared American
records.
Southern Cal's legendary
strength in distance freestyle is no
myth. NCAA champion and
former world record holder Greg
Charlton tops the list. NCAA
medalists Greg Fink and George
Watson return from last year's
squad.
Sophomore Andy Strenk
placed in the AAU National
Championships last season. Throw
in newcomers Tom Ludwig and
Steve Frlekin, and behold the
deepest assortment of distance
freestylers in the nation.

Berk No Quirk
Stanford's Brent Berk beat
Charlton for an Olympic berth
last August, and will have his
hands full again. Berk hit 4:46 for
500 yards in Stanford's 80-30
romp over UCLA last week, and
will have to cut off another 3 or 4
seconds to knock off Charlton.
Bert Mason will be Berk's running
mate.
Mark Mader (6-9) set the Amer
ican record for 200 yards back
stroke as a USC freshman two
years ago. Stanford's Fred Hay
wood won the 100 backstroke at
the same national AAU Cham
pionships. Haywood and Mader
will take the opening gun in the
medley relay and later face off in
the 200 backstroke.
USC'S NCAA 200 butterfly

champion Phil Houser will bump
head on against Stanford's Olym
pic bronze medalist John Ferris.
Ferris Of Them All
Ferris could swim practically
any event in the lineup, a tricky
source of speculation in the tradi
tional pre-meet second guessing.
Ferris took third in both 200 fly
and 200 individual medley at
Mexico City, and will obviously
be hard to touch in either of those
events.
Stanford captain Pete Siebert
took second and third in two in
dividual medley races at the
NCAA's last year, and could team
with Ferris for a rocky 1-2 com
bination in the 200 IM. Siebert's
versatility makes him a threat in
any middle distance freestyle,
backstroke, or butterfly event.
Luis Nicolao, a former world
record butterflier and an Olympic
finalist freestyle sprinter, likewise
has a multitude of slots in the
Stanford lineup, much to the con
sternation of Mr. Daland.
Peter Daland is no slouch at the
guessing game, however. He has
kept most of his "big guns" es
sentially out of competition
through the first half of the sea
son, and will undoubtedly pop up
with more than a few surprises.
Sprints Can Hurt
Two years ago, USC sprinters
shut out Stanford in both 50 and
100 freestyles and tied the meet
by capturing the last event, the
400 free relay. Stanford sprinters
peaked later for the NCAA's and
ripped 2 seconds off the American
record, with little effect on the
dual meet score.
The sprints could very well tell
the tale again in races where two
tenths of a second can separate
first and fourth place.
USC's former national sprint
champion Don Havens has blazed
a 44.8 anchor leg on a USC relay.
Havens is unpredictable in a dual
meet, which probably means
dangerous.
More predictable and still dan
gerous Russ Kidder and sopho
more Dan Frawley give the Tro
jans at least two more 46 second
freestyle relay legs.

Stanford sprinters, going faster
than ever for mid season, will be
hard to tie down. Bob Jamison,
several times AAU finalist and
NCAA freshman record holder,
figures it will take at least a 46 to
win the 100 free.
Seniors Morgan Manning, Jeff
Hammett, and Nicolao and sopho
more Rich Eagleston give the
Cards a healthy choice of 46-sec
ond relay sprinters.
Diver Power
The results of two diving events
could be crucial. Ted Nichols,
diving with a taped knee, and
Norris Heckel, suffering from a
pulled ligament, bounce against
USC's Rick McDermott, Pac-8
runner-up.
Tag Leonard will have an uphill
fight to break into USC's breast
stroke lineup. Morgan Manning
may be pressed into foreign serv
ice to bolster the Indians' breast
stroke front.
It is virtually impossible to win
a dual meet without taking at
least one of the two relays. Both
teams will probably stack the
opening event, the medley relay,
for a psychological lift off and a
seven point buffer.
Predictions and place-picking
serve to whittle away nervousness
before the fact, but probably
haven't the least bearing on this
meet. Swimming has a notoriously
short memory for old records.
Both teams will accelerate with
each other right down to the last
relay, and nobody will remember
what the doormouse said.
USC carries a decade's legacy of
undefeated swimming teams into
Stanford's Encina Pool, tomorrow
at 2 p.m. The Trojans, currently
ranked second in the country
ahead of Stanford and Yale, have
weathered 108 dual meets with
out a loss.
The meet figures to run as close
as the 52-52 spash-down two
years ago, a wild affair which saw
every seat, wall, and tree packed
to overflowing. The addition of a
second diving event eliminates the
chance for a tie this year.
Stanford went on from the dual
meet tie to edge the Trojans for
the 1967 NCAA championship in
spectacular team performance
that bagged Seven NCAA records.
Saturday's meet will be carried
on closed circuit TV to the Old
Pavilion to assure every ticket
holder a live view of the meet or a
dry seat in the event of rain.

USC to five NCAA titles since

wood won the 100 backstroke at
the same national AAU Cham
pionships. Haywood and Mader
will take the opening gun in the
medley relay and later face off in
the 200 backstroke.
USC'S NCAA 200 butterfly

champion Phil Houser will bump
head on against Stanford's Olym
pic bronze medalist John Ferris.
Ferris Of Them All
Ferris could swim practically
any event in the lineup, a tricky
source of speculation in the tradi
tional pre-meet second guessing.
Ferris took third in both 200 fly
and 200 individual medley at
Mexico City, and will obviously
be hard to touch in either of those
events.
Stanford captain Pete Siebert
took second and third in two in
dividual medley races at the
NCAA's last year, and could team
with Ferris for a rocky 1-2 com
bination in the 200 IM. Siebert's
versatility makes him a threat in
any middle distance freestyle,
backstroke, or butterfly event.
Luis Nicolao, a former world
record butterflier and an Olympic
finalist freestyle sprinter, likewise
has a multitude of slots in the
Stanford lineup, much to the con
sternation of Mr. Daland.
Peter Daland is no slouch at the
guessing game, however. He has
kept most of his "big guns" es
sentially out of competition
through the first half of the sea
son, and will undoubtedly pop up
with more than a few surprises.
Sprints Can Hurt
Two years ago, USC sprinters
shut out Stanford in both 50 and
100 freestyles and tied the meet
by capturing the last event, the
400 free relay. Stanford sprinters
peaked later for the NCAA's and
ripped 2 seconds off the American
record, with little effect on the
dual meet score.
The sprints could very well tell
the tale again in races where two
tenths of a second can separate
first and fourth place.
USC's former national sprint
champion Don Havens has blazed
a 44.8 anchor leg on a USC relay.
Havens is unpredictable in a dual
meet, which probably means
dangerous.
More predictable and still dan
gerous Russ Kidder and sopho
more Dan Frawley give the Tro
jans at least two more 46 second
freestyle relay legs.

Stanford sprinters, going faster
than ever for mid season, will be
hard to tie down. Bob Jamison,
several times AAU finalist and
NCAA freshman record holder,
figures it will take at least a 46 to
win the 100 free.
Seniors Morgan Manning, Jeff
Hammett, and Nicolao and sopho
more Rich Eagleston give the
Cards a healthy choice of 46-sec
ond relay sprinters.
Diver Power
The results of two diving events
could be crucial. Ted Nichols,
diving with a taped knee, and
Norris Heckel, suffering from a
pulled ligament, bounce against
USC's Rick McDermott, Pac-8
runner-up.
Tag Leonard will have an uphill
fight to break into USC's breast
stroke lineup. Morgan Manning
may be pressed into foreign serv
ice to bolster the Indians' breast
stroke front.
It is virtually impossible to win
a dual meet without taking at
least one of the two relays. Both
teams will probably stack the
opening event, the medley relay,
for a psychological lift off and a
seven point buffer.
Predictions and place-picking
serve to whittle away nervousness
before the fact, but probably
haven't the least bearing on this
meet. Swimming has a notoriously
short memory for old records.
Both teams will accelerate with
each other right down to the last
relay, and nobody will remember
what the doormouse said.
USC carries a decade's legacy of
undefeated swimming teams into
Stanford's Encina Pool, tomorrow
at 2 p.m. The Trojans, currently
ranked second in the country
ahead of Stanford and Yale, have
weathered 108 dual meets with
out a loss.
The meet figures to run as close
as the 52-52 spash-down two
years ago, a wild affair which saw
every seat, wall, and tree packed
to overflowing. The addition of a
second diving event eliminates the
chance for a tie this year.
Stanford went on from the dual
meet tie to edge the Trojans for
the 1967 NCAA championship in
spectacular team performance
that bagged Seven NCAA records.
Saturday's meet will be carried
on closed circuit TV to the Old
Pavilion to assure every ticket
holder a live view of the meet or a
dry seat in the event of rain.
Daland Wailin'
Peter Daland, who has coached
USC to five NCAA titles since
1961, returns with his perennially
deep bench and over-generous
speckling of outstanding individ
ual swimmers.
Stanford brings to bear a

predominantly sophomore team
that lanced seven NCAA freshman
records last year. Graduation and
attrition leave only four NCAA
veterans on the squad, three of
which have shared American
records.
Southern Cal's legendary
strength in distance freestyle is no
myth. NCAA champion and
former world record holder Greg
Charlton tops the list. NCAA
medalists Greg Fink and George
Watson return from last year's
squad.
Sophomore Andy Strenk
placed in the AAU National
Championships last season. Throw
in newcomers Tom Ludwig and
Steve Frlekin, and behold the
deepest assortment of distance
freestylers in the nation.

Berk No Quirk
Stanford's Brent Berk beat
Charlton for an Olympic berth
last August, and will have his
hands full again. Berk hit 4:46 for
500 yards in Stanford's 80-30
romp over UCLA last week, and
will have to cut off another 3 or 4
seconds to knock off Charlton.
Bert Mason will be Berk's running
mate.
Mark Mader (6-9) set the Amer
ican record for 200 yards back
stroke as a USC freshman two
years ago. Stanford's Fred Hay
wood won the 100 backstroke at
the same national AAU Cham
pionships. Haywood and Mader
will take the opening gun in the
