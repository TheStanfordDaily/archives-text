# Ruggers' Big Game
## 
### DAVE NOLAND 
Stanford's ruggers, fresh from a
weird 8-6 win last week at USC,
return home tomorrow to take on
the explosive UCLA Bruins at
1:30 p.m. in a battle of the un
beatens.
Stanford now has won five in a

row. UCLA has romped to four
straight wins, including a 28-3 pil
laging of Cal.
Tribe Coach Pete Kmetovic re
ports that the Bruins are loaded
with experienced foreign players,
in addition to the usual beefy
football contingent of footballers.
Grid star Rick Purdy leads the
slick Bruin attack.
USC's bruisers provided quite a
contrast to the skilled UCLAns.
The Trojans were big, strong, and
hard-nosed, but their rugby skills
and instincts needed a bit of pol
ishing.
Stanford was hampered by the
loss of Dick Ragsdale (slightly
pulled hamstring) and a rare bad
kicking day by Leon Hartvickson.
The rest of the fleet Tribe back
field was hemmed in but not by
the SC defense, but by the touch
lines. SC plays rugby on a football
field, which is considerably nar
rower than the standard rugby
pitch.
The Tribe will have to be both
good and tough tomorrow if
they're to maintain their perfect
record and top national ranking.
Kmetovic commented, "UCLA
is the really Big Game this year
for us."
