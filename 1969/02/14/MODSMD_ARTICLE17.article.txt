# Hard Luck Cagers Set To Try Again

### FRED MANN 
Thru 19 basketball games this season, Stanford has averaged 71.2
points per game. Their opponents have averaged 72.4. Thus, in 760
minutes of play, the enemy has scored only 21 more points than has
Stanford.
The Indians are now 6-13. They are 1-6 in league, and victims of
perhaps the worst luck since the Confederates decided to visit
Gettysburg.
Last weekend, the Tribe went to Oregon and dro'jped two games
by a total of three points. Faulty free throwing pushed them into the
Pac-8 cellar. Now, they seek revenge. OSU comes to Maples Pavilion
tonight, and Oregon tomorrow, giving the Indians a chance to, in the
American tradition, "save face."
In seven games this year, Stanford has been either-ahead or behind
by two points or less in the last minute of play. Stanford has lost all
of them
Some time the percentages are going to break for the Cards, and it
may be this weekend. If the varsity can again come back from sharp
disappointment, they will beat both Oregon teams. Stanford has the
talent, but has just missed the breaks.
However, it would not be unexpected for the Tribe to be down
after last week. No team no matter how good can be at their mental
peak after a season like the one the Tribe has faced.
Yet the squad has never given up. "They play their hearts out every
game," said Coach Howie Dallmar. "The only criticism I have of them
is that they sometimes try too hard ... and that's the type of
criticism I would like to have of every team I coach."
Maybe Stanford's day of getting all the bounces has come. For the
sake of Coach Dallmar's and the team's sanity, let's hope so.
