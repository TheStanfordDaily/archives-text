## A 						Moving Production 
### GAIL ANDERSON 
Despite its false start in the fall,
the Stanford Repertory Theater
promises an exciting dramatic
season, if its current production is
any indicator. I am referring to
Ugo Betti's The Queen and The
Rebels, which director Robert
Morgan has converted from a play
that is thought-provoking to a
production which is moving.
The Queen and The Rebels pre
sents a vision of the affirmation of
choice in a world of horror, seen
through a political mode of per
ception, with a sophisticated use
of dramatic ironies. Argia, a pros
titute, is mistaken for a Queen by
the idealistic bureaucrats of a
postwar revolution, and finds in
the last moments before her exe
cution the nobility to play the
role—the nobility the frightened,
helpless Elisabetta (the "real"
Queen) does not possess. The
Queen is no Queen, and the revo
lution of the "rebels" is no revolu
tion—and therein lies the irony.
Argia is both, and therein lies the
tragedy.
It is the irony which dominates
the intellectual appraisal: the
strikingly played contrasts be
tween Argia (Randi Douglas) and
Elisabetta (Sally Kemp), between
the dark, violent idealism of the
dying General Biante (Stephen
Newman) and the rational, subtle,
bureaucratic efficiency of his
successor, Commissar Amos
(Kurtwood Smith), between the
powerful, devasting nihilism of
Amos and Argia's affirmation of
choice that makes her no longer a
victim. Seen in threatrical terms,
the play seems to be teetering on
the brink of melodrama. But this
production, avoiding that pitfall,
makes the tragedy of the play
dominate the stage and the
theatrical experience, rather than
its intellectual forms.
Key Performance
Miss Douglas' performance is
key to that real, tragic, non
intellectual impact of the play. To
a difficult role she imparts a be
lievability —not a technical control
of subleties and nuances, but a
sense of understanding of her role
that commands the state far more
than technical perfection ever
could. For technically, the play is
uneven. The pacing in the first act
is too rapid—line follows line with
such precision that one has no il
lusion of thought preceding
speech, or of character inter
action; and the last act moves too
slowly although that is partially a
function of the play.
Elsewhere, some of the actors
seem not to quite to have ac
cepted their roles, and fall back

on occasion to playing their own
favorite style of characterization:
anyone who has seen Carrillo
Gantner in more than one pro
duction will know what I mean.
The only technically superb factor
in the production is Richard Hay's
wonderfully grotesque, almost
surrealistic set, in which no line
falls quite as expected, under
lining the sense of irony.
But technical inadequacies flaw
the production (read: reviewer's
concern) far more than the
theatrical experience (read: audi
ence response). And if only just
this once, I want to forget about
them. So this has been an unfor
tunately necessary preface to the
following brief confessions of a
penitent reviewer.
A Sense of Magic
The success of Miss Douglas'
performance has little to do with
skill, with technicalities. It has to
do with art. Where other actors in
the play seem to be performing,
she is acting: and the difference I
mean is the addition of something
magic, something deeply human,
something that makes us weep
even as our reason screams with
embarrassment that to weep at a
moment of affirmation on the

stage is sentimental naivete
something that somehow makes
us love a character brought to life.
It is in search of that magic that
we go to the theatre—not for the
intellectual pleasures of observing
a skillful performance.
So call me naive, emotional,
anti-intellectual, but today I do
not care for analysis and criticism
of technique. Theatre is a cele
bration, not a cerebration. To ex
perience a certain kind of the
atrical moment is to realize that,
and to be ashamed of the "criti
cal," interpretative, nit-picking
bullshit approach that narrows ex
perience and that we therefore
call "sophisticated."
That is what happened to me at
The Queen and The Rebels. So I
am not going to call the pro
duction good or bad or enjoyable
or mixed or anything else. I'm
only going to say that I had for
gotten the magic of the theatre,
forgotten the spirit of celebration
the theatre has always been, the
reason it fascinates me, the reason
I go. But Wednesday night, de
spite my grinding, analyzing, ob
serving, protesting mind, I was
deeply moved. And now I am be
ginning to remember.
