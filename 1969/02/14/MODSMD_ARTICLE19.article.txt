# Experimental Film Series To Present ‘The Brig’
## 
### TODD McCARTHY 
The Brig,the main feature at to
night's experimental film series in
Geology 320 at 11 pm, is an un
compromising and harrowing look
at prison brutality in the military.
Shot in a single evening by New
York film maker Jonas, Mekas, it
is actually a film record of the
play's production by the Living
Theater in an off-Broadway
theater.
Mekas, however, manages to
open up the drama, not by leaving
the setting, but by employing a
very fluid cinema verite style
which achieves more depth and
impact than perhaps would a live
performance.
Having no actual story line, The
Brig offers vignettes of daily life
in prison. From the instant the
ten inmates awaken in their 12 x

12 cage, they are on their feet,
either vigorously running in place,
jogging from one end of the room
to the other or standing erect,
eyes glued to a page of a pre
scribed book.
To keep the convicts busy,
sadistic guards repeatedly order
them to dress and undress, make
and unmake their beds or scrub
the floor. Prisoners are given one
cigarette a day but they must in
hale and exhale upon command.
Guards also jump at first oppor
tunities to slug prisoners, beat
them with clubs or throw them
into garbage cans.
Also chronicled is the induction
of a new prisoner. Within two
minutes, he is behaving like the
others, running places instead of
walking and shouting responses to
guards peering down his throat.

Prisoners in the brig are quickly
converted into veritable zombies
and are much more immediate
and horrifying than any fictional
men-of-no-minds created by
writers' imaginations.
The script was written by Ken
neth Brown, who lived under brig
conditions and reportedly experi
enced events too morbid to be in
cluded in the play. This presen
tation also sheds some light on the
living conditions of the several
soldiers now being tried for
mutiny at Presidio. One wonders
whether the prisoners' existences
could actually be as cruel and un
just as they are presented in The
Brig. I, for one, am not particu
larly anxious to find out.
Playing with The Brig tonight
will be Stan VanDerßreek's
Pastorale D'ETE and It's All Over
Now.


CHANCELLOR APPE ARS-Glen
Dundee, chancellor of the California
State Colleges, will address die Stan
ford Law Forum at 4 p.m. Monday in
room 161-J of the Law School.
Dumke, who has been in the midst of
much controversey as a result of his
stances on various issues will speak on
"The Turbulent Campus."

Pastorale D'ETE and It's All Over
Now.


CHANCELLOR APPE ARS-Glen
Dundee, chancellor of the California
State Colleges, will address die Stan
ford Law Forum at 4 p.m. Monday in
room 161-J of the Law School.
Dumke, who has been in the midst of
much controversey as a result of his
stances on various issues will speak on
"The Turbulent Campus."
The Brig,the main feature at to
night's experimental film series in
Geology 320 at 11 pm, is an un
compromising and harrowing look
at prison brutality in the military.
Shot in a single evening by New
York film maker Jonas, Mekas, it
is actually a film record of the
play's production by the Living
Theater in an off-Broadway
theater.
Mekas, however, manages to
open up the drama, not by leaving
the setting, but by employing a
very fluid cinema verite style
which achieves more depth and
impact than perhaps would a live
performance.
Having no actual story line, The
Brig offers vignettes of daily life
in prison. From the instant the
ten inmates awaken in their 12 x

12 cage, they are on their feet,
either vigorously running in place,
jogging from one end of the room
to the other or standing erect,
eyes glued to a page of a pre
scribed book.
To keep the convicts busy,
sadistic guards repeatedly order
them to dress and undress, make
and unmake their beds or scrub
the floor. Prisoners are given one
cigarette a day but they must in
hale and exhale upon command.
Guards also jump at first oppor
tunities to slug prisoners, beat
them with clubs or throw them
into garbage cans.
Also chronicled is the induction
of a new prisoner. Within two
minutes, he is behaving like the
others, running places instead of
walking and shouting responses to
guards peering down his throat.

Prisoners in the brig are quickly
converted into veritable zombies
and are much more immediate
and horrifying than any fictional
men-of-no-minds created by
writers' imaginations.
The script was written by Ken
neth Brown, who lived under brig
conditions and reportedly experi
enced events too morbid to be in
cluded in the play. This presen
tation also sheds some light on the
living conditions of the several
soldiers now being tried for
mutiny at Presidio. One wonders
whether the prisoners' existences
could actually be as cruel and un
just as they are presented in The
Brig. I, for one, am not particu
larly anxious to find out.
Playing with The Brig tonight
will be Stan VanDerßreek's
Pastorale D'ETE and It's All Over
Now.
