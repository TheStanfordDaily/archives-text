### ASSOCIATED PRESS 
Student demonstrators disrupted
campuses across the country Thursday,
with violence breaking out at three
schools. More than 30 persons were ar
rested at the University of California at
Berkeley after clashes between police
and student strikers and their sym
pathizers.
Tear gas and bared bayonets were
used by police and National Guardsmen
at the University of Wisconsin at Madi
son to control roving bands of demon
strators who ranged in number from
500 to 3,000.
And police fired tear gas cannisters at
Duke University students in Durham,
N.C., in a demonstration that followed
the 12-hour occupation of the adminis
tration building by about 30 to 40
Negro students. The students left the
building quietly after administration
officials warned them they would be
suspendedâ€”but they refused to leave
the area.
The trouble at Wisconsin marked the
fourth straight day of a boycott organ
ized by Negro students.
"Extreme Emergency"
The violence at Berkeley broke out
after police cleared a campus entrance

of demonstrators participating in the
student strike led by the Third World
Liberation Front. Because of the strike,
Gov. Ronald Reagan declared a "state
of extreme emergency" at the
28,000-student campus last week.
In New York, about 100 City College
students invaded the school's adminis
tration building and occupied two floors
of offices for 4'/2 hours to press de
mands of Negro and Puerto Rican stu
dents. One demand was for a separate
school of Negro and Puerto Rican
studies.
About 400 students at the University
of Chicago announced they had voted
against ending their occupation of the
administration building immediately.
The occupation was in its 15th day. The
university suspended 22 demonstrators,
bringing the total suspended to 80.
Picketing Resumed
Picketing resumed on the sprawling,
3 3 ,000-student Wisconsin campus
Thursday morning after Gov. Warren P.
Knowles told a news conference that
the disorders there, and on campuses
from coast to coast, were being run "by
someone who has different ideologies
than we have."
Knowles ordered 900 National
Guardsmen to the school Wednesday
night after three straight days of dis
turbances stemming from a classroom
boycott. The outbreak followed 13 de
mands by Negro students, among them
creation of a spearate black studies de
partment.
A Duke spokesman said rebellious
Negro students told officials they had
kerosene with them would would use it
to bum records unless their demands
were met.
The students say they want a black
studies program controlled by Negro
students, a Negro iormitory, reinstate
ment of Negro students who flunked
out last semester and a Negro adviser
elected by Negro students.
