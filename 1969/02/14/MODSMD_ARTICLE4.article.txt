Dean H. Thomas James of the Stan
ford School of Education yesterday an
nounced the appointment of Cecil
Shaw, a black graduate student, to co
ordinate recruitment and interviewing
for the Secondary Teacher Education
Program (STEP).
Shaw, a student in Foreign Lang
uages Urban Education, wis asked by
The Daily to comment on his appoint
ment.
"Regarding the program change,"
Shaw stated, "this will enable us to
better coordinate all aspects of STEP
recruitment and make our recruitment
of minority students and recruitment in
general more effective."
After studying the findings of the
campus Human Relations Commission
with STEP interviewers and the Edu
cational Policies Committee, Dean

James replied to the HRC recommen
dations yesterday in his letter to Presi
dent Pitzer.
With Koff's Approval
James noted that Shaw's appoint
ment was made with the approval of
Professor Robert Koff, director of
STEP. In response to the recommen
dations of the HRC, James said that
applicants to the program will be in
formed that interviewers are available
from several ethnic groups, and that stu
dents will be granted their requests
wherever practicable, including access to
the Director of the program.
James said that the HRC's second
recommendation of expanding the parti
cipation and utilization of minority
group persons in the School of Edu
cation endorses the school's existing
policy.
"We are and have been recruiting stu
dents and staff from minority groups."
James noted that the Commission re
ported no findings as to which minority
group persons are already involved in
the School of Education.
Minority Facu ity
"Had they inquired," James noted,
"they would have found that Frank
Hawkinshire was recommended for ap
pointment to this faculty prior to last
spring's confrontation, that two of our
six STEP interviewers are black and one
has a Mexican-American background."
James replied to the HRC's third
recommendation saying that "all
present interviewers for the Secondary
Teacher Program review this report of
the circumstances of Dr. Koff's inter
view with Miss Stevenson, in order to
prevent the recurrence of such unfor
tunate incidents," stating that several
suggestions have been made.
"Hereafter, the interviewers will be

more involved in the deliberations of
the Committee that acts on admissions.
Within the week I will appoint a new
committee of faculty and students to
review all procedures related to recruit
ment, interviewing, admission, and
orientation of students in the School,
including those entering STEP, with
special attention to the problem of
those students coming from minority
groups."
BSU Request
The Stanford Black Student Union
had requested that Koff be removed
from his post as director as a result of
the January 6 interview with Clarissa
Stevenson.
"Certainly no one can argue that this
interview turned out well," James said.
"Our faculty members and I are dis
tressed that Miss Stevenson should have
felt so bad about this interview.
"That Professor Koff shares fully in
this distress is evidenced by his letter of
apology to her and his invitation to her
to return to Stanford at our expense to
help correct the impression he left upon
her."
James stressed that this incident was
an isolated one. "Professor Koff has suc
cessfully conducted more than forty
interview since September.
"Moreover, we have substantial evi
dence drawn from his staff, from stu
dents in the program, and from faculty
and my own observations that STEP has
improved steadily since he assumed his
duties as director in the late fall of
1968, and we are seeking ways to en
courage the talented and innovative con
tributions he can make to our pro
grams."
President Pitzer received the School
of Education letter yesterday afternoon,
and has not as yet commented on it.

the circumstances of Dr. Koff's inter
view with Miss Stevenson, in order to
prevent the recurrence of such unfor
tunate incidents," stating that several
suggestions have been made.
"Hereafter, the interviewers will be

more involved in the deliberations of
the Committee that acts on admissions.
Within the week I will appoint a new
committee of faculty and students to
review all procedures related to recruit
ment, interviewing, admission, and
orientation of students in the School,
including those entering STEP, with
special attention to the problem of
those students coming from minority
groups."
BSU Request
The Stanford Black Student Union
had requested that Koff be removed
from his post as director as a result of
the January 6 interview with Clarissa
Stevenson.
"Certainly no one can argue that this
interview turned out well," James said.
"Our faculty members and I are dis
tressed that Miss Stevenson should have
felt so bad about this interview.
"That Professor Koff shares fully in
this distress is evidenced by his letter of
apology to her and his invitation to her
to return to Stanford at our expense to
help correct the impression he left upon
her."
James stressed that this incident was
an isolated one. "Professor Koff has suc
cessfully conducted more than forty
interview since September.
"Moreover, we have substantial evi
dence drawn from his staff, from stu
dents in the program, and from faculty
and my own observations that STEP has
improved steadily since he assumed his
duties as director in the late fall of
1968, and we are seeking ways to en
courage the talented and innovative con
tributions he can make to our pro
grams."

of Education letter yesterday afternoon,

Shaw, a black graduate student, to co
ordinate recruitment and interviewing
for the Secondary Teacher Education
Program (STEP).
Shaw, a student in Foreign Lang

ment.
"Regarding the program change,"
Shaw stated, "this will enable us to
better coordinate all aspects of STEP
recruitment and make our recruitment
of minority students and recruitment in
general more effective."
After studying the findings of the
campus Human Relations Commission
with STEP interviewers and the Edu
cational Policies Committee, Dean

James replied to the HRC recommen
dations yesterday in his letter to Presi
dent Pitzer.
With Koff's Approval
James noted that Shaw's appoint
ment was made with the approval of
Professor Robert Koff, director of
STEP. In response to the recommen
dations of the HRC, James said that
applicants to the program will be in
formed that interviewers are available
from several ethnic groups, and that stu
dents will be granted their requests
wherever practicable, including access to
the Director of the program.
James said that the HRC's second
recommendation of expanding the parti
cipation and utilization of minority
group persons in the School of Edu
cation endorses the school's existing
policy.
"We are and have been recruiting stu
dents and staff from minority groups."
James noted that the Commission re
ported no findings as to which minority
group persons are already involved in
the School of Education.

"Had they inquired," James noted,
"they would have found that Frank
Hawkinshire was recommended for ap
pointment to this faculty prior to last
spring's confrontation, that two of our
six STEP interviewers are black and one
has a Mexican-American background."
James replied to the HRC's third
recommendation saying that "all
present interviewers for the Secondary
Teacher Program review this report of
the circumstances of Dr. Koff's inter
view with Miss Stevenson, in order to
prevent the recurrence of such unfor
