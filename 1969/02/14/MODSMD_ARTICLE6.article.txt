# Faculty Senate Vote Ends ROTC Academic Credit
## 
### 
Faculty representatives Thursday
voted 25-8 to end academic credit for
military training and education at Stan
ford, starting with the 1970 freshman
class.
Their action follows similar votes by
faculty groups at Harvard, Yale, Cornell,
Pennsylvania, and Pomona. Reached
after a five-month student-faculty com
mittee study, the decision will not
affect 360 students now enrolled in
ROTC at Stanford.
The faculty representatives called for
a committee composed of students,
faculty, administrators and represen
tatives of the ROTC departments to
work out details of the transition.
In a report published Wednesday a
6-3 majority of the student-faculty
study committee found that ROTC de
partments are, by their nature, incom
patible with the University's primary
commitment to unrestricted creation
and dissemination of knowledge.
Minority Supported ROTC
The minority said that military sub
jects were worthy academic pursuits and
maintained that ROTC "cannot survive
as an extra-curricular activity, separated
from the academic structure of the Uni
versity."
In a statement delivered to faculty
representatives before their vote, Prof.
Robert Thomas, chairman of the Naval

Science Department, noted that "This
country has a long heritage of a military
force composed essentially of civiliansâ€”
of military leaders with civilian concerns
and outlooks.
"These civilian concerns and outlooks
cannot be wholly developed in the
cloistered environment of our service
academies. They are inculcated through
the graduates of our civilian universities
and colleges," who comprise between
40 and 65 percent of all those officers
in service (40 percent now, 65 percent
in peacetime).
Professional Army Undesirable
"I believe most of us familiar with
the history of purely professional
officer corps in Europe and South
America do not want a similar solution
for our officer needs here."
In a statement for the study commit
tee majority, Prof. Lyman P. Van Slyke,
history, said: "We are not passing judg
ment on the armed forces, nor is it our
purpose to obstruct the recruitment of
officers for the armed services.
"Whatever our feelings as individuals,
we are not passing judgment on the
Vietnam War.
"We do not seek to prevent any Stan
ford student from serving as an officer
in the armed forces. Our sole concern is
for the process through which this is ac
complished at Stanford.

"The majority sees as acceptable the
continuation of (ROTC) scholarships, of
voluntary on-campus activities, and of
off-campus and summer training."
The faculty vote called for the three
ROTC departments to be replaced by a
single armed forces officers program no
later than 1973 "for the purposes of ad
ministration, counseling, and recruiting
for reserve officer training and edu
cation."
It also called for individual contracts
between Stanford students and the
armed forces to be revised to reflect
actual practice, which permits students
to drop ROTC scholarships without
penalty during their first two years.
During the transition period, senior
officers in each service would carry the
academic title of "lecturer with rank of
professor." After the start of the
1973-74 academic year, armed forces
representatives would carry no academic
rank.
