# Resolution Passes 57-16
## LASSU Supports BSU Demands 
### DAVID DAVENPORT 
Endorsement of "the essence" of the
twelve Black Student Union demands,
$5000 loan to the Speech Association,
the formulation fo next week's election
ballot, and a brief walk-out by Speaker
Yale Braunstein, highlighted last night's

meeting of the student legislature.
LASSU was addressed by represen
tatives of the Black Student Union who
asked for endorsement of its twelve de
mands upon the University.
Some legislators attempted to avoid
LASSU consideration and have the issue
placed on next week's general election
ballot. However, representatives of the
BSU remained firm in their request for
LASSU to take action.
After lengthy consideration the legis
lature determined to amend the original
resolution. Deleting an endorsement of
the twelve demands, LASSU voted
5 7-16 to express "support of the
essence" of the BSU demands.
Braunstein Announces Veto
As required by the Constitution,
Speaker Yale Braunstein announced to
the legislature that Denis Hayes had
vetoed its transfer of $5000 from the
Professorial Commission to general con
tingency and its $4000 grant to the
Speech Association.
A motion was immediately intro
duced to override the Hayes vetoes.
However LASSU determined that this
issue should be tabled.
Later in the meeting Ken Philpot,
Speech Association President, intro
duced a bill to loan the Association
$5000 from ASSU operating reserve
funds.
Use of Loan Stipulated
The bill stipulated that the loan be
used "in a way which will, in the
opinion of the Speech Association's
Officers, best aid that organization's at
tempts to set up an endowment fund
for itself."
Philpot explained that the debate
team would travel to "financially advan
tageous tournaments," for the remain
der of the debate season. The debaters
will be participating in the tournaments
and also speaking to local alumni groups
to aid in the endowment drive.
The loan is to be returned to the
ASSU reserves in payments of $1000
during each of the academic years from
1970-'7O to 1974-'75.
Financial Status Questioned
Some legislators quesioned the
Speech Association's financial status
since the original bill called for a $4000
grant, and last night's measure provided
a $5000 loan.
Philpot noted that the School of
Humanities and Sciences had originally
agreed to match only LASSU grants.
However, since LASSU did pass the

Speech Association grant and it was
blocked by a Denis Hayes veto, H&S
agreed to provide funds anyway.
With the additional Humanities and
Science's funds guaranteed, Philpot and
the other Speech Association officers
determined that the $5000 loan would
be sufficient to complete the year's ac
tivities and begin work on the endow
ment.
Items For Ballot
The legislature considered nine items
to be placed on the ballot for the Febru
ary 18-19 general election.
Two matters, membership of the
Education Council and six referenda
concerning the SES report, had been
placed on the ballot at an earlier LASSU
meeting.
It was determined that seven other
items are to appear on the lengthy bal
lot.
One of the proposals, calling for the
collection of delinquent student loans,
was placed on the ballot by petition of
5% of the student body.
Pro-Pot Proposal
A referendum proposed by Denis
Hayes called upon the Stanford student
body to petition the State of Calfornia
to revoke all legal sanction against the
sale, possession, or use of marijuana. m
It further requested a petition for
more stringent penalties for persons
convicted of selling methedrine, and a
state-wide program to educate youth to
the hazards of "this dangerous drug."
The legislature also placed a question
regarding ROTC on the student ballot.
The referendum called for maintaining
credit for all ROTC courses.
Other Referenda
Other referenda include a Judicial
Charter revision and student approval of
the Education Council as the official
student voice on questions regarding
SES.
Each of these proposals is to appear
on the student ballot next Tuesday and
Wednesday.
The final spark of LASSU excitement
came from Speaker Yale Braunstein
himself. In the midst of a hassle oyer a
point of parliamentary procedure,
Braunstein packed up his gavel, ad
journed the meeting, and threatened to
walk out.
However, after some reconsideration,
Braunstein returned, called a new meet
ing, and completed the business.
A motion to impeach Braunstein at
the new meeting failed to be placed on
the agenda.
