BLOOD
We students have an ASSU blood bank reserve.
When one of us needs a transfusion, he gets it free.
From time to time we have blood drives on campus to
replenish the account.
The last one was six years ago.
The next one is next Tuesday, Feb. 25.
The blood we donate will become available to every
resident on the peninsula, from East Paly to Atherton.
And our account will be credited for each pint donated.
We are having sign ups today on White Plaza.
