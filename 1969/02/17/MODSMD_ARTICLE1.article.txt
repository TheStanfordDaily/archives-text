WASHINGTON —David Packard,
deputy secretary of defense and fermer
Stanford trustee, said Friday in a wide
ranging interview with The Daily that
Stanford should "keep ROTC on cam
pus and upgrade it to meet academic
standards."
He also revealed that efforts are un
derway to make ROTC more palatable
to the schools, including Stanford, that
have recently dropped academic credit
for the program.
He also discussed the new Anti-
Ballistic Missile (ABM) system, which
has recently been subject to public
scrutiny because Secretary of Defense
Melvin Laird called a halt to the project,
for review by the Nixon administration.
Packard emphasized that the review
was "part of a general review of the
budget" rather than of the substance of
the project itself. "The whole issue has
become thoroughly mixed up. When Mr.
Laird and I came in, we decided to re
view the total budget," said Packard.
Need For Defense System
He saw the necessity of a missile de
fense system because "the Chinese have

exploded nuclear weapons. One of the
purposes of the system is to supply
some defense against limited attack and
China's limited nuclear capability."
He felt that while some people think
a heavy defense against the Soviets is
necessary, "the thick system is not
realistic at this time.
In regard to future directions of U.S.
policies in this area, he predicted, "I'm
sure we'll be entering into arms-limiting
treaties with the Soviets in due course."
Concerning ROTC, Packard said "We
need some educated people as military
officers . . . We have to have men who
have had the benefit of a wide edu
cation."
Raise Curriculum Standards
He said that the "faculty has an
understandable position in denying aca
demic status to ROTC professors, but
something could be worked out to raise
the standards of its curriculum to keep
it on campus."
Last Thursday, the Academic Senate
voted 25-8 to drop credit for ROTC at
Stanford, capping off several years of
campus debate and dissent concerning
ROTC.

Packard revealed that "there is a
study underway" to develop a more
satisfactory program. He said "I think
an open program is not something you
couldn't overcome. You could have a
program that would meet the academic
standards of any other program."
He pointed out, "there's no shortage
of ROTC programs or colleges wanting
them. There's no hazard that ROTC as
an institution will be endangered with
Yale, Harvard, and other Ivy League
schools dropping out."
"Working A Lot Harder'
Packard in his third floor office at the
Pentagon overlooking the Potomac said
that he has been "working a lot harder"
than when at Hewlett-Packard. "I was
always worrying about your (Stan
ford's) problems there."
He was interviewed by Daily re
porters Thomas Dawson, Patrick
McMahon, and Brooke Shearer while
they were in Washington attending a
conference for college editors.
The Daily also learned Friday from
Navy Captain Philip Saylor, Director of
Reserve Personnel and Administration
at the Pentagon, that all three services

are presently experimenting with and re
vising their curricula and that Stanford
Army ROTC was scheduled to try a new
"Track C" plan next fall.
The "Track C" plan was part of three
different Army ROTC curricula that
were to be tried beginning next fall on
10 different campuses, according to
Saylor.
Plan May Be Scuttled
However, The Daily learned yester
day from Vice Provost E. Howard
Brooks that because of the number of
schools who are dropping credit for
ROTC, the Track C plan may be
scuttled. Instead the Army will develop
a plan for a non-credit approach, he pre
dicted.
Brooks was in Washington at the end
of last week for discussions concerning
these issues. The "Track C" plan would
have allowed University course substi
tutions for ROTC courses.
An aide of Saylor reported that Stan
ford, through Vice Provosts E. Howard
Brooks and Herbert L. Packer, had been
influential in bringing about the changes
that are being experimented with. He
said Stanford and, to some extent,
Princeton and Brown, have been the
only schools to contact the Defense De
partment concerning the issues of
ROTC academic viability.
Packer's involvement concerned al
lowing women and non-ROTC men to
enroll in classes, while Brooks has dealt
with curricular reform and other
arrangements.
Brooks was one of three dissenting
members of the Academic Senate ad
hoc committee on ROTC which recom
mended 6-3 that credit and on-campus
training be terminated at Stanford.

The "Track C" plan was part of three
different Army ROTC curricula that
were to be tried beginning next fall on
10 different campuses, according to
Saylor.
Plan May Be Scuttled
However, The Daily learned yester
day from Vice Provost E. Howard
Brooks that because of the number of
schools who are dropping credit for
ROTC, the Track C plan may be
scuttled. Instead the Army will develop
a plan for a non-credit approach, he pre
dicted.
Brooks was in Washington at the end
of last week for discussions concerning
these issues. The "Track C" plan would
have allowed University course substi
tutions for ROTC courses.
An aide of Saylor reported that Stan
ford, through Vice Provosts E. Howard
Brooks and Herbert L. Packer, had been
influential in bringing about the changes
that are being experimented with. He
said Stanford and, to some extent,
Princeton and Brown, have been the
only schools to contact the Defense De
partment concerning the issues of
ROTC academic viability.
Packer's involvement concerned al
lowing women and non-ROTC men to
enroll in classes, while Brooks has dealt
with curricular reform and other
arrangements.
Brooks was one of three dissenting
members of the Academic Senate ad
hoc committee on ROTC which recom
mended 6-3 that credit and on-campus
training be terminated at Stanford.

WASHINGTON —David Packard,
deputy secretary of defense and fermer
Stanford trustee, said Friday in a wide
ranging interview with The Daily that
Stanford should "keep ROTC on cam
pus and upgrade it to meet academic
standards."
He also revealed that efforts are un
derway to make ROTC more palatable
to the schools, including Stanford, that
have recently dropped academic credit
for the program.
He also discussed the new Anti-
Ballistic Missile (ABM) system, which
has recently been subject to public
scrutiny because Secretary of Defense
Melvin Laird called a halt to the project,
for review by the Nixon administration.
Packard emphasized that the review
was "part of a general review of the
budget" rather than of the substance of
the project itself. "The whole issue has
become thoroughly mixed up. When Mr.
Laird and I came in, we decided to re
view the total budget," said Packard.
Need For Defense System
He saw the necessity of a missile de
fense system because "the Chinese have

exploded nuclear weapons. One of the
purposes of the system is to supply
some defense against limited attack and
China's limited nuclear capability."
He felt that while some people think
a heavy defense against the Soviets is
necessary, "the thick system is not
realistic at this time.
In regard to future directions of U.S.
policies in this area, he predicted, "I'm
sure we'll be entering into arms-limiting
treaties with the Soviets in due course."
Concerning ROTC, Packard said "We
need some educated people as military
officers . . . We have to have men who
have had the benefit of a wide edu
cation."
Raise Curriculum Standards
He said that the "faculty has an
understandable position in denying aca
demic status to ROTC professors, but
something could be worked out to raise
the standards of its curriculum to keep
it on campus."
Last Thursday, the Academic Senate
voted 25-8 to drop credit for ROTC at
Stanford, capping off several years of
campus debate and dissent concerning
ROTC.

Packard revealed that "there is a
study underway" to develop a more
satisfactory program. He said "I think
an open program is not something you
couldn't overcome. You could have a
program that would meet the academic
standards of any other program."
He pointed out, "there's no shortage
of ROTC programs or colleges wanting
them. There's no hazard that ROTC as
an institution will be endangered with
Yale, Harvard, and other Ivy League
schools dropping out."
"Working A Lot Harder'
Packard in his third floor office at the
Pentagon overlooking the Potomac said
that he has been "working a lot harder"
than when at Hewlett-Packard. "I was
always worrying about your (Stan
ford's) problems there."
He was interviewed by Daily re
porters Thomas Dawson, Patrick
McMahon, and Brooke Shearer while
they were in Washington attending a
conference for college editors.
The Daily also learned Friday from
Navy Captain Philip Saylor, Director of
Reserve Personnel and Administration
at the Pentagon, that all three services

are presently experimenting with and re
vising their curricula and that Stanford
Army ROTC was scheduled to try a new
"Track C" plan next fall.

He said that the "faculty has an
understandable position in denying aca
demic status to ROTC professors, but
something could be worked out to raise
the standards of its curriculum to keep
it on campus."
Last Thursday, the Academic Senate
voted 25-8 to drop credit for ROTC at
Stanford, capping off several years of
campus debate and dissent concerning
ROTC.

Packard revealed that "there is a
study underway" to develop a more
satisfactory program. He said "I think
an open program is not something you
couldn't overcome. You could have a
program that would meet the academic
standards of any other program."
He pointed out, "there's no shortage
of ROTC programs or colleges wanting
them. There's no hazard that ROTC as
an institution will be endangered with
Yale, Harvard, and other Ivy League
schools dropping out."
"Working A Lot Harder'
Packard in his third floor office at the
Pentagon overlooking the Potomac said
that he has been "working a lot harder"
than when at Hewlett-Packard. "I was
always worrying about your (Stan
ford's) problems there."
He was interviewed by Daily re
porters Thomas Dawson, Patrick
McMahon, and Brooke Shearer while
they were in Washington attending a
conference for college editors.
The Daily also learned Friday from
Navy Captain Philip Saylor, Director of
Reserve Personnel and Administration
at the Pentagon, that all three services

are presently experimenting with and re
vising their curricula and that Stanford
Army ROTC was scheduled to try a new
"Track C" plan next fall.
The "Track C" plan was part of three
different Army ROTC curricula that
were to be tried beginning next fall on
10 different campuses, according to
Saylor.
Plan May Be Scuttled
However, The Daily learned yester
day from Vice Provost E. Howard
Brooks that because of the number of
schools who are dropping credit for
ROTC, the Track C plan may be
scuttled. Instead the Army will develop
a plan for a non-credit approach, he pre
dicted.
Brooks was in Washington at the end
of last week for discussions concerning
these issues. The "Track C" plan would
have allowed University course substi
tutions for ROTC courses.
An aide of Saylor reported that Stan
ford, through Vice Provosts E. Howard
Brooks and Herbert L. Packer, had been
influential in bringing about the changes
that are being experimented with. He
said Stanford and, to some extent,
Princeton and Brown, have been the
only schools to contact the Defense De
partment concerning the issues of
ROTC academic viability.
Packer's involvement concerned al
lowing women and non-ROTC men to
enroll in classes, while Brooks has dealt
with curricular reform and other
arrangements.
Brooks was one of three dissenting
members of the Academic Senate ad
hoc committee on ROTC which recom
mended 6-3 that credit and on-campus
training be terminated at Stanford.
