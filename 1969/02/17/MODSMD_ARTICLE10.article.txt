## 'Leftward Drift' Of A Prof 
### Paul Rupert 
"The poor in the world are
trying to develop. Obviously the
rich are involved. The question is
are the rich helping the poor or
not? I used to say yes. But now
I'd probably come down pretty
much on the other side."
Not an atypical statement for a
Stanford junior or senior de
scribing his political changes. But
John Gurley is a professor in our
own Department of Economics,
not a student. He is probably one
of the few professors here whose
views on the war and American
foreign policy have changed as
rapidly and as radically as those of
many students.
While every dim-wit and poli
tician in the world is analyzing the
angry skepticism of students and
pondering its origins, there is little
mention of the 'leftward drift* of
faculty, and how it happens.
Dr. Gurley is a monetary
theorist, a student of economic
development, a former govern
ment consultant. He severed his
ties with AID (Agency for Inter
national Development) and the
Treasury Department in the
Spring of 1966. He has been a
consultant to both, but resigned
as a protest against American
policy in Vietnam and elsewhere.
He now doubts that he will re
sume that work even if the war
ends.
These acts and much of his
present thinking about imperial
ism grew in part from a summer's
work in Korea in 1965. AID
payed him to go to Korea to ana
lyze the banking and currency
system, and to recommend
changes in its structure. He was
there during the early escalation
of the war in Vietnam, and saw
the U.S. putting the pressure on
the South Koreans to send as
many as 50,000 troops to Viet
nam.
Sorry For Koreans
"Of course, the pay-off was to
be more economic and military
aid." But he felt very sorry for the
South Koreans "who had already
been through hell." They were in
no shape to join our war effort,
but they had little, if any choice.

When Dr. Gurley came back to
Stanford, he remained an AID
consultant. But the growing feel
ing against the war, the teach-ins
and discussions, and his slow reali
zation that Vietnam was just a
small part of a general policy in
Asia designed for us and not the
Asians, led him to write AID and
explain why he couldn't continue
to directly support such a policy.
He quit the Treasury Depart
ment work because of its less di
rect, but important contribution.
In Jail
He has continued his work in
development, and has taught a
seminar on the question of U.S.
Imperialism. He spent ten days in
jail in October of 1967 after
taking part in the induction center
sit-in. And he is now thinking
about doing more work in the
Third World to try to figure out
exactly what American policy is
and how it operates.
As he says, he is neither a
liberal nor a Leninist. He is sure
that the liberal view that "the rich
are helping, although we are not
as generous as we might be" is
wrong. He is skeptical of the view

that the markets and investments
of the 'developing' countries are
essential to our economic health,
although he fears that business
men and policymakers may not
understand that.
Dr. Gurley said that our
foreign policy might be best ex
plained by a statement of Paul
Baran, a socialist economist and
former colleague: "A success for
socialism anywhere is a threat to
capitalism everywhere."
He is sure of one thing: he
needs to see and know more, and
with that knowledge may come
more changes in his understanding
of economics and politics.
Uses Of Work
The problem that troubles him
now is one of sponsorship and the
uses of his work. While there is no
overwhelming dilemma yet among
most social science faculty, in
creasingly a cruel problem is pre
sented to the would-be researcher:
how do you find out what you
want without contributing to the
further oppression of those people
and countries which you wish to
help? Perhaps you must accept

such work as the only way to find
out what is going on.
He has not yet resolved the
problem, and is not sure he ever
will. For me, it's nice to see some
one grasp and grapple with the
problem in such an honest and
open way, in a university where
those considerations seldom arise.
The consequences of a critical
look at what one is really involved
in as a teacher and a researcher
can be enormous. Eventually one
may face a variety of social, insti
tutional and political pressures if
he follows hi sense of what's true.
But. if a faculty is to maintain
its integrity and a university its
raison d'etre, it can settle for
nothing less. Much as students
need some form of sabbatical
from the palm-and-asphalt ghetto,
perhaps a hard look at a black
ghetto at home or a 'developing'
country abroad might restore
some sense to more insulated
faculty members, if they only
took the time.

rapidly and as radically as those of
many students.
While every dim-wit and poli
tician in the world is analyzing the
angry skepticism of students and
pondering its origins, there is little
mention of the 'leftward drift* of
faculty, and how it happens.
Dr. Gurley is a monetary
theorist, a student of economic
development, a former govern
ment consultant. He severed his
ties with AID (Agency for Inter
national Development) and the
Treasury Department in the
Spring of 1966. He has been a
consultant to both, but resigned
as a protest against American
policy in Vietnam and elsewhere.
He now doubts that he will re
sume that work even if the war
ends.
These acts and much of his
present thinking about imperial
ism grew in part from a summer's
work in Korea in 1965. AID
payed him to go to Korea to ana
lyze the banking and currency
system, and to recommend
changes in its structure. He was
there during the early escalation
of the war in Vietnam, and saw
the U.S. putting the pressure on
the South Koreans to send as
many as 50,000 troops to Viet
nam.
Sorry For Koreans
"Of course, the pay-off was to
be more economic and military
aid." But he felt very sorry for the
South Koreans "who had already
been through hell." They were in
no shape to join our war effort,
but they had little, if any choice.

When Dr. Gurley came back to
Stanford, he remained an AID
consultant. But the growing feel
ing against the war, the teach-ins
and discussions, and his slow reali
zation that Vietnam was just a
small part of a general policy in
Asia designed for us and not the
Asians, led him to write AID and
explain why he couldn't continue
to directly support such a policy.
He quit the Treasury Depart
ment work because of its less di
rect, but important contribution.
In Jail
He has continued his work in
development, and has taught a
seminar on the question of U.S.
Imperialism. He spent ten days in
jail in October of 1967 after
taking part in the induction center
sit-in. And he is now thinking
about doing more work in the
Third World to try to figure out
exactly what American policy is
and how it operates.
As he says, he is neither a
liberal nor a Leninist. He is sure
that the liberal view that "the rich
are helping, although we are not
as generous as we might be" is
wrong. He is skeptical of the view

that the markets and investments
of the 'developing' countries are
essential to our economic health,
although he fears that business
men and policymakers may not
understand that.
Dr. Gurley said that our
foreign policy might be best ex
plained by a statement of Paul
Baran, a socialist economist and
former colleague: "A success for
socialism anywhere is a threat to
capitalism everywhere."
He is sure of one thing: he
needs to see and know more, and
with that knowledge may come
more changes in his understanding
of economics and politics.
Uses Of Work
The problem that troubles him
now is one of sponsorship and the
uses of his work. While there is no
overwhelming dilemma yet among
most social science faculty, in
creasingly a cruel problem is pre
sented to the would-be researcher:
how do you find out what you
want without contributing to the
further oppression of those people
and countries which you wish to
help? Perhaps you must accept

such work as the only way to find
out what is going on.
He has not yet resolved the
problem, and is not sure he ever
will. For me, it's nice to see some
one grasp and grapple with the
problem in such an honest and
open way, in a university where
those considerations seldom arise.
The consequences of a critical
look at what one is really involved
in as a teacher and a researcher
can be enormous. Eventually one
may face a variety of social, insti
tutional and political pressures if
he follows hi sense of what's true.
But. if a faculty is to maintain
its integrity and a university its
raison d'etre, it can settle for
nothing less. Much as students
need some form of sabbatical
from the palm-and-asphalt ghetto,
perhaps a hard look at a black
ghetto at home or a 'developing'
country abroad might restore
some sense to more insulated
faculty members, if they only
took the time.

"The poor in the world are
trying to develop. Obviously the
rich are involved. The question is
are the rich helping the poor or
not? I used to say yes. But now
I'd probably come down pretty
much on the other side."
Not an atypical statement for a
Stanford junior or senior de
scribing his political changes. But
John Gurley is a professor in our
own Department of Economics,
not a student. He is probably one
of the few professors here whose

policy in Vietnam and elsewhere.
He now doubts that he will re
sume that work even if the war
ends.
These acts and much of his
present thinking about imperial
ism grew in part from a summer's
work in Korea in 1965. AID
payed him to go to Korea to ana
lyze the banking and currency
system, and to recommend
changes in its structure. He was
there during the early escalation
of the war in Vietnam, and saw
the U.S. putting the pressure on
the South Koreans to send as
many as 50,000 troops to Viet
nam.
Sorry For Koreans
"Of course, the pay-off was to
be more economic and military
aid." But he felt very sorry for the
South Koreans "who had already
been through hell." They were in
no shape to join our war effort,
but they had little, if any choice.

When Dr. Gurley came back to
Stanford, he remained an AID
consultant. But the growing feel
ing against the war, the teach-ins
and discussions, and his slow reali
zation that Vietnam was just a
small part of a general policy in
Asia designed for us and not the
Asians, led him to write AID and
explain why he couldn't continue
to directly support such a policy.
He quit the Treasury Depart
ment work because of its less di
rect, but important contribution.
In Jail
He has continued his work in
development, and has taught a
seminar on the question of U.S.
Imperialism. He spent ten days in
jail in October of 1967 after
taking part in the induction center
sit-in. And he is now thinking
about doing more work in the
Third World to try to figure out
exactly what American policy is
and how it operates.
As he says, he is neither a
liberal nor a Leninist. He is sure
that the liberal view that "the rich
are helping, although we are not
as generous as we might be" is
wrong. He is skeptical of the view

that the markets and investments
of the 'developing' countries are
essential to our economic health,
although he fears that business
men and policymakers may not
understand that.
Dr. Gurley said that our
foreign policy might be best ex
plained by a statement of Paul
Baran, a socialist economist and
former colleague: "A success for
socialism anywhere is a threat to
capitalism everywhere."
He is sure of one thing: he
needs to see and know more, and
with that knowledge may come
more changes in his understanding
of economics and politics.
Uses Of Work
The problem that troubles him
now is one of sponsorship and the
uses of his work. While there is no
overwhelming dilemma yet among
most social science faculty, in
creasingly a cruel problem is pre
sented to the would-be researcher:
how do you find out what you
want without contributing to the
further oppression of those people
and countries which you wish to
help? Perhaps you must accept

such work as the only way to find
out what is going on.
He has not yet resolved the
problem, and is not sure he ever
will. For me, it's nice to see some
one grasp and grapple with the
problem in such an honest and
open way, in a university where
those considerations seldom arise.
The consequences of a critical
look at what one is really involved
in as a teacher and a researcher
can be enormous. Eventually one
may face a variety of social, insti
tutional and political pressures if
he follows hi sense of what's true.
But. if a faculty is to maintain
its integrity and a university its
raison d'etre, it can settle for
nothing less. Much as students
need some form of sabbatical
from the palm-and-asphalt ghetto,
perhaps a hard look at a black
ghetto at home or a 'developing'
country abroad might restore
some sense to more insulated
faculty members, if they only
took the time.

"The poor in the world are
trying to develop. Obviously the
rich are involved. The question is
are the rich helping the poor or
not? I used to say yes. But now
I'd probably come down pretty
much on the other side."
Not an atypical statement for a
Stanford junior or senior de
scribing his political changes. But
John Gurley is a professor in our
own Department of Economics,
not a student. He is probably one
of the few professors here whose
views on the war and American
foreign policy have changed as
rapidly and as radically as those of
many students.
While every dim-wit and poli
tician in the world is analyzing the
angry skepticism of students and
pondering its origins, there is little
mention of the 'leftward drift* of
faculty, and how it happens.
Dr. Gurley is a monetary
theorist, a student of economic
development, a former govern
ment consultant. He severed his
ties with AID (Agency for Inter
national Development) and the
Treasury Department in the
Spring of 1966. He has been a
consultant to both, but resigned
as a protest against American
policy in Vietnam and elsewhere.
He now doubts that he will re
sume that work even if the war
ends.
