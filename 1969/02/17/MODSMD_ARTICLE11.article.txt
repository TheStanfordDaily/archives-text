## Why BSU Asked Students 
### Jack Booth 
Last Tuesday, the Black Stu
dent Union (BSU) held a rally at
which they presented, first to the
students and then to the adminis
tration, twelve demands.
My question is why did the
BSU turn first to the students.
The answer is simple: after
months of patient deliberation
with the administration over
much needed improvements in
Stanford's treatment of minority
students, the BSU realized they
were getting nowhere—not be
cause there was no place to go,
but because the administration
thought they could handle the
BSU with only making half
hearted attempts at solving their
problems—attempts which realis
tically did nothing more than put
the problem of understanding and
helping the black student off until
sometime in the future.
Such procrastination the BSU
and the school as a whole cannot
afford to accept. Having gone
through every possible diplomatic
channel open to them, the BSU
has realized that it is time to seek
the student support needed to
make the administration of Stan
ford University think more seri
ously about eradicating the ever
present mistreatment of minority
students.
And this the BSU has done—
they have appealed for student
support of their demands. They
are taking their case, one of mis
treatment by the administration
of this university, to the students.
There is one main explanation
of why the BSU demands are so
reasonable. The BSU has not pre
sented the administration with
non-negotiable and unrealistic de

mands. Rather, they have asked
for the much needed educational
reforms which would benefit not
only the Black Student Union,
but the student body as a whole.
Better Understanding
Their demands are oriented
around providing a better under
standing of the black culture for
the black man as well as the white
man—an understanding all of us
need to have if we are to deal with
racial problems now, and in the
future.
Noteworthy also is the ap
proach the BSU has used in trying
to achieve their goals. They are
willing to discuss their demands
but only on a factual basis. As one
member put it:
"We are going to begin when
the facts are presented and we are
going to stop when they (the ad
ministration) start handing us
bullshit."
No Run-Around
The BSU has made it quite
clear that they want realistic re
sponses—not the usual run-around
given by the administration. Take
for example demand number two:
"There be a black faculty mem
ber in every department by fall
'69."
The BSU doesn't want to hear
from the administration- w well it's
difficult to find black teachers;
they want to see the adminis
tration extending a sincere effort
to recruit black faculty. Granted
it may be difficult to recruit black
teachers, but that is no reason
why there shouldn't or couldn't
be a black teacher in every depart
ment.
The BSU is willing to talk, and
if the administration shows the

BSU that it would be impossible
(not just that it would be diffi
cult) to have a black faculty mem
ber in every department, the BSU
wouldn't raise any objection to
lowering their demand.
The BSU isn't trying to force
the administration to do impossi
ble tasks, the> merely want the
administration to do everything
within its power to try to alleviate
the problems minority students
have at Stanford.
By supporting the BSU de
mands, the students will show the
administration that its policy
towards minority students needs
re-evaluation and changes. The ad
ministration has more or less ig
nored the BSU's attempts to ex
plain that the university policy
towards minority students should
be changed, but they can't ignore
a student body. To do so would
prove disastrous.
With out help the BSU has a
definite bargaining power —
something they should have to at
least make the administration take
a second look at their present
policy on minority students.
There are three major ways to
express your support: write letters
to the administration explaining
your position; sign petitions in
support of the demands; hold for
mal, quiet, non-violent demon
strations outside the adminis
trative offices.
The BSU needs our support
let's show them that we won't
stand for administrative ignorance
and half-hearted responses.
