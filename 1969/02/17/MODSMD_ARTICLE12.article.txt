# Rough Draft
## Stanford's Graduate Draft Status 
### Bill Leland Alan Strain 
Since the elimination of the
II-S deferment for graduate stu
dents who began their second year
of graduate work after October
1967, there has been a great deal
of speculation concerning the im
pact of the draft on graduate
school enrollment.
We think much of this specu
lation has resulted in inflated
figures, and so, we will describe
the specific situation at Stanford
University in the national context.
We conclude that the impact will
be significant, but not of the mag
nitude predicted by most others.

Given the fact that oldest men
under the age of 26 are drafted
first, in order to estimate the
number of first and second year
graduate students who will receive
induction notices between July
1968 and June 1969, we should
be concerned only with men of
that age group and older.
In an oversimplified situation
we could estimate the impact of
the draft on Stanford graduate
students by establishing just three
figures: (1) the number of vulner
able men in the nation equal or
older in age to first and second

year graduate students, (2) the
size of the twelve month draft
call, and (3) the number of gradu
ate men at Stanford actually vul
nerable to induction.
Unfortunately, for the simple
explanation, the inefficiencies of
the Selective Service System and
the appeal process give a different
real result. While older men are in
the often lengthy process of re
classification, many younger men
are being drafted, thereby increas
ing the "effective" size of the
1968-69 draft pool.
Small Calls
As a matter of fact, of the men
called during the period from July
through October 1968 only 16%
were college graduates. That fact
along with the estimated number
of younger men who will be
drafted during the remaining part
of the fiscal year results in a total
number of 104,600 younger men
who must be added to the "effec
tive" 1968-69 draft pool.
The remaining older age draft
pool consists of 200,000 accept
able men who received their
baccalaureate degrees in June
1968, 89,000 acceptable men who
were first year graduate students
during the 1967-68 academic
year, and 30,000 acceptable men
who left graduate school at a
more advanced level.
Of these 319,000 men, about
40,000 will enlist or gain occu
pational deferments, leaving
279,000 men in the draft pool.
That 279,000 men is the net
figure after deducting men over
age, divinity students, medical stu
dents, veterans, exempt fathers,
volunteers, and men physically
unacceptable. About 126,000 of
these men were graduate students
in autumn 1968. The effective

1968-69 draft pool, then, consists
of 104,600 younger men and
279,000 older men, resulting in a
total of 383,000.
Estimates
Accepting the estimate of the
Department of Defense, 260,000
of these men or 68% will be
ordered to report for induction
before June 30, 1969. According
ly 68% of the eligible first and
second year graduate men will be
called.
Estimates of the national
picture indicate that a maximum
of 38%-46% of first and second
year graduate males will be eli
gible for the draft. An examin
ation of Stanford first and second
year graduate males indicates that
24% first year and 23% second
year graduates will be eligible.
This means that if 68% cf these
are called, 16% of total first and
second year graduate men will re
ceive induction notices before
June 1969.
Future Statu*
What about the 1969-70 aca
demic year? We will not offer esti
mates, but will mention three in
teresting factors.
First, according to the above es
timates there should be a signifi
cant number of older men still
vulnerable from the previous year.
Second, again some younger
men will be drafted while older
men are in the reclassification pro
cedure.
And, three, if the argument
that second year graduate stu
dents are eligible for the I-S defer
ment (see DAILY, 2/7/69) is up
held in the courts, the impact of
the draft on graduate students will
be further dissipated.

279,000 older men, resulting in a
total of 383,000.
Estimates
Accepting the estimate of the
Department of Defense, 260,000
of these men or 68% will be
ordered to report for induction
before June 30, 1969. According
ly 68% of the eligible first and
second year graduate men will be
called.
Estimates of the national
picture indicate that a maximum
of 38%-46% of first and second
year graduate males will be eli
gible for the draft. An examin
ation of Stanford first and second
year graduate males indicates that
24% first year and 23% second
year graduates will be eligible.
This means that if 68% cf these
are called, 16% of total first and
second year graduate men will re
ceive induction notices before
June 1969.
Future Statu*
What about the 1969-70 aca
demic year? We will not offer esti
mates, but will mention three in
teresting factors.
First, according to the above es
timates there should be a signifi
cant number of older men still
vulnerable from the previous year.
Second, again some younger
men will be drafted while older
men are in the reclassification pro
cedure.
And, three, if the argument
that second year graduate stu
dents are eligible for the I-S defer
ment (see DAILY, 2/7/69) is up
held in the courts, the impact of
the draft on graduate students will
be further dissipated.
(Hill Leland and Alan Strain arc

Since the elimination of the
II-S deferment for graduate stu
dents who began their second year
of graduate work after October
1967, there has been a great deal
of speculation concerning the im
pact of the draft on graduate
school enrollment.
We think much of this specu
lation has resulted in inflated
figures, and so, we will describe
the specific situation at Stanford
University in the national context.
We conclude that the impact will
be significant, but not of the mag
nitude predicted by most others.

Given the fact that oldest men
under the age of 26 are drafted
first, in order to estimate the
number of first and second year
graduate students who will receive
induction notices between July
1968 and June 1969, we should
be concerned only with men of
that age group and older.
In an oversimplified situation
we could estimate the impact of
the draft on Stanford graduate
students by establishing just three
figures: (1) the number of vulner
able men in the nation equal or
older in age to first and second

year graduate students, (2) the
size of the twelve month draft
call, and (3) the number of gradu
ate men at Stanford actually vul
nerable to induction.
Unfortunately, for the simple
explanation, the inefficiencies of
the Selective Service System and
the appeal process give a different
real result. While older men are in
the often lengthy process of re
classification, many younger men
are being drafted, thereby increas
ing the "effective" size of the
1968-69 draft pool.
Small Calls
As a matter of fact, of the men
called during the period from July
through October 1968 only 16%
were college graduates. That fact
along with the estimated number
of younger men who will be
drafted during the remaining part
of the fiscal year results in a total
number of 104,600 younger men
who must be added to the "effec
tive" 1968-69 draft pool.
The remaining older age draft
pool consists of 200,000 accept
able men who received their
baccalaureate degrees in June
1968, 89,000 acceptable men who
were first year graduate students
during the 1967-68 academic
year, and 30,000 acceptable men
who left graduate school at a
more advanced level.
Of these 319,000 men, about
40,000 will enlist or gain occu
pational deferments, leaving
279,000 men in the draft pool.
That 279,000 men is the net
figure after deducting men over
age, divinity students, medical stu
dents, veterans, exempt fathers,
volunteers, and men physically
unacceptable. About 126,000 of
these men were graduate students
in autumn 1968. The effective

1968-69 draft pool, then, consists
of 104,600 younger men and
279,000 older men, resulting in a
total of 383,000.

the appeal process give a different
real result. While older men are in
the often lengthy process of re
classification, many younger men
are being drafted, thereby increas
ing the "effective" size of the
1968-69 draft pool.
Small Calls
As a matter of fact, of the men
called during the period from July
through October 1968 only 16%
were college graduates. That fact
along with the estimated number
of younger men who will be
drafted during the remaining part
of the fiscal year results in a total
number of 104,600 younger men
who must be added to the "effec
tive" 1968-69 draft pool.
The remaining older age draft
pool consists of 200,000 accept
able men who received their
baccalaureate degrees in June
1968, 89,000 acceptable men who
were first year graduate students
during the 1967-68 academic
year, and 30,000 acceptable men
who left graduate school at a
more advanced level.
Of these 319,000 men, about
40,000 will enlist or gain occu
pational deferments, leaving
279,000 men in the draft pool.
That 279,000 men is the net
figure after deducting men over
age, divinity students, medical stu
dents, veterans, exempt fathers,
volunteers, and men physically
unacceptable. About 126,000 of
these men were graduate students
in autumn 1968. The effective

1968-69 draft pool, then, consists
of 104,600 younger men and
279,000 older men, resulting in a
total of 383,000.
Estimates
Accepting the estimate of the
Department of Defense, 260,000
of these men or 68% will be
ordered to report for induction
before June 30, 1969. According
ly 68% of the eligible first and
second year graduate men will be
called.
Estimates of the national
picture indicate that a maximum
of 38%-46% of first and second
year graduate males will be eli
gible for the draft. An examin
ation of Stanford first and second
year graduate males indicates that
24% first year and 23% second
year graduates will be eligible.
This means that if 68% cf these
are called, 16% of total first and
second year graduate men will re
ceive induction notices before
June 1969.
Future Statu*
What about the 1969-70 aca
demic year? We will not offer esti
mates, but will mention three in
teresting factors.
First, according to the above es
timates there should be a signifi
cant number of older men still
vulnerable from the previous year.
Second, again some younger
men will be drafted while older
men are in the reclassification pro
cedure.
And, three, if the argument
that second year graduate stu
dents are eligible for the I-S defer
ment (see DAILY, 2/7/69) is up
held in the courts, the impact of
the draft on graduate students will
be further dissipated.
