# Back To Childhood
## Stanford-Esalen Flourishes 
### SUSAN SWARD 
"The Esalen approach brings
you back to the things you knew
how to do when you were a
child," says Martine Boot, the
pretty, twenty-two year old red
head who co-ordinates the
Esalen-at-Stanford program.
"My thing is organizing," said
Miss Boot, wrinkling up her
freckled nose. "For two months I
,was a secretary in the mechanical
engineering department, but then
I split because I can't stand to
have a boss. I like organizing and
working for myself better than
being a secretary."
The proper title for the Esalen
group at Stanford is actually "Ex
periental Education." The group
is an outgrowth of the Esalen In
stitute at Big Sur, California. Stan
ford is the only school allowed to
maintain a branch that uses the
Esalen name.
Stanford Special
* Stanford has been allowed to
maintain an Esalen branch be
cause the Institute's founder,
Mike Murphy, is a former Stan
ford student. The program here is
non-profit and is in its sixth quar
ter.
"I find the program here sells
under the title of Esalen," Martine
observed. "Esalen is a big draw.
The program attracts 600 to 650
people a quarter."
When questioned about
Esalen-at-Stanford's goals, Martine
replied, "We're trying to get the
Esalen approach into the Stanford
curriculum, so Stanford students
will get a unit of credit for a
weekend Esalen session.
Make People Aware
"Actually, we're trying to
make people more aware of every
thing that's going on. We want to
make people less like machines
and given them more enthusiasm.
We want people to communicate
better and more honestly."
The Esalen-at-Stanford pro
gram offers three different pro

grams per weekend for students,
faculty and staff to attend. Each
program offered costs ten dollars
for students. Approxin tely four
sessions are held over ie week
end.
Some of the most popu.ar ses
sions offered are gestalt therapy,
bio-energetics, psycho-drama
marathons and general encounter
groups.
Understanding and Bodies
Martine speculated that people
have numerous motives for be
coming involved in Esalen pro
grams. "People are looking for
personal growth, new experiences,
new people, understanding of
themselves and others, rediscovery
of where their bodies and senses
are.
"Where do most people live?"
Martine asked laughingly. "Most
people feel with their heads and
not with their senses when they
stub their toe, which is really
strange."
Speaking about Esalen-at-
Stanford's orientation on drugs
and politics, Martine said, "Esalen
emphasizes no drug use and no
politics. It gets people naturally
stoned."
According to Martine, most of
the group leaders who run the
weekend sessions have experi
mented with "psychedelic drugs"
and have realized they "can reach
this state of ecstasy by becoming
more aware."
"Many of them have their
Ph.D's, and all of them have
studied and done what they're
doing here for at least eight
years," noted Martine.
Enjoys Her Work
As co-ordinator of the Esalen
program here, Martine enjoys
what she is doing very much. This
is her second quarter managing
the program alone. Before that,
she managed the program for two
quarters with David Mastrandrea,
a junior who is presently in the
Stanford-in-Italy program.

Martine was born and raised in
Rotterdam, Holland. She came to
the United States three years ago
because she "realized Holland was
too small, and I was curious." In
Holland, Martine broke with tra
dition to enter an all-male eating
club for one year to serve as five
boys' secretary. The boys were
organizing a commemoration
party for the founding of Leiden
University—one of Holland's old
est universities.
Stanford's Gsalen co-ordinator
can also tell the story of how she
took it upon herself to humanize
the math department at Harvard
over the last Christmas vacation.
Formerly a secretary at the
Harvard department, Martine at
tended a Christmas party there
"where all the faculty were fairly
drunk. They asked me to explain
what I did in California—the East
coast being square and not know
ing what Esalen was."
Sensory Awareness
"I led them through a series of
sensory awareness exercises which
got them very high on people and
on each other. They said jokingly
that Harvard definitely needed
something like this, and why
didn't I come back to Harvard and
teach them how to be human."
When asked about her future
plans, Martine laughed. "I have
two years to decide whether or
not I want to apply for citizen
ship," she said. "What I decide de
pends on whom I marry. I'm
searching for a man that hasn't
been divorced. Single men that
aren't divorced are hard to find."
According to Martine, the
Stanford Esalen people are nicer
than those people attending Big
Sur sessions. Because the Stanford
program costs considerably less,
the age level attending here is
lower. And since the people are
younger, most group leaders ap
parently feel the participants are
more open to the techniques of
"experiential education."


ESALEN ENCOUNTER—Two participants in an Esalen encounter group talk it
over. The groups try to "make people more aware of evcery thing that's going
on." Through varied techniques such as Gestalt therapy, bio-energetics
psychodrama marathons and general encounter gorups.

dition to enter an all-male eating
club for one year to serve as five
boys' secretary. The boys were
organizing a commemoration
party for the founding of Leiden
University—one of Holland's old
est universities.
Stanford's Gsalen co-ordinator
can also tell the story of how she
took it upon herself to humanize
the math department at Harvard
over the last Christmas vacation.
Formerly a secretary at the
Harvard department, Martine at
tended a Christmas party there
"where all the faculty were fairly
drunk. They asked me to explain
what I did in California—the East
coast being square and not know
ing what Esalen was."
Sensory Awareness
"I led them through a series of
sensory awareness exercises which
got them very high on people and
on each other. They said jokingly
that Harvard definitely needed
something like this, and why
didn't I come back to Harvard and
teach them how to be human."
When asked about her future
plans, Martine laughed. "I have
two years to decide whether or
not I want to apply for citizen
ship," she said. "What I decide de
pends on whom I marry. I'm
searching for a man that hasn't
been divorced. Single men that
aren't divorced are hard to find."
According to Martine, the
Stanford Esalen people are nicer
than those people attending Big
Sur sessions. Because the Stanford
program costs considerably less,
the age level attending here is
lower. And since the people are
younger, most group leaders ap
parently feel the participants are
more open to the techniques of
"experiential education."


ESALEN ENCOUNTER—Two participants in an Esalen encounter group talk it
over. The groups try to "make people more aware of evcery thing that's going
on." Through varied techniques such as Gestalt therapy, bio-energetics
psychodrama marathons and general encounter gorups.
"The Esalen approach brings
you back to the things you knew
how to do when you were a
child," says Martine Boot, the
pretty, twenty-two year old red
head who co-ordinates the
Esalen-at-Stanford program.
"My thing is organizing," said
Miss Boot, wrinkling up her
freckled nose. "For two months I
,was a secretary in the mechanical
engineering department, but then
I split because I can't stand to
have a boss. I like organizing and
working for myself better than
being a secretary."
The proper title for the Esalen
group at Stanford is actually "Ex
periental Education." The group
is an outgrowth of the Esalen In
stitute at Big Sur, California. Stan
ford is the only school allowed to
maintain a branch that uses the
Esalen name.
Stanford Special
* Stanford has been allowed to
maintain an Esalen branch be
cause the Institute's founder,
Mike Murphy, is a former Stan
ford student. The program here is
non-profit and is in its sixth quar
ter.
"I find the program here sells
under the title of Esalen," Martine
observed. "Esalen is a big draw.
The program attracts 600 to 650
people a quarter."
When questioned about
Esalen-at-Stanford's goals, Martine
replied, "We're trying to get the
Esalen approach into the Stanford
curriculum, so Stanford students
will get a unit of credit for a
weekend Esalen session.
Make People Aware
"Actually, we're trying to
make people more aware of every
thing that's going on. We want to
make people less like machines
and given them more enthusiasm.
We want people to communicate
better and more honestly."
The Esalen-at-Stanford pro
gram offers three different pro

grams per weekend for students,
faculty and staff to attend. Each
program offered costs ten dollars
for students. Approxin tely four
sessions are held over ie week
end.
Some of the most popu.ar ses
sions offered are gestalt therapy,
bio-energetics, psycho-drama
marathons and general encounter
groups.
Understanding and Bodies
Martine speculated that people
have numerous motives for be
coming involved in Esalen pro
grams. "People are looking for
personal growth, new experiences,
new people, understanding of
themselves and others, rediscovery
of where their bodies and senses
are.
"Where do most people live?"
Martine asked laughingly. "Most
people feel with their heads and
not with their senses when they
stub their toe, which is really
strange."
Speaking about Esalen-at-
Stanford's orientation on drugs
and politics, Martine said, "Esalen
emphasizes no drug use and no
politics. It gets people naturally
stoned."
According to Martine, most of
the group leaders who run the
weekend sessions have experi
mented with "psychedelic drugs"
and have realized they "can reach
this state of ecstasy by becoming
more aware."
"Many of them have their
Ph.D's, and all of them have
studied and done what they're
doing here for at least eight
years," noted Martine.
Enjoys Her Work
As co-ordinator of the Esalen
program here, Martine enjoys
what she is doing very much. This
is her second quarter managing
the program alone. Before that,
she managed the program for two
quarters with David Mastrandrea,
a junior who is presently in the
Stanford-in-Italy program.

faculty and staff to attend. Each
program offered costs ten dollars
for students. Approxin tely four
sessions are held over ie week
end.
Some of the most popu.ar ses
sions offered are gestalt therapy,
bio-energetics, psycho-drama
marathons and general encounter
groups.
Understanding and Bodies
Martine speculated that people
have numerous motives for be
coming involved in Esalen pro
grams. "People are looking for
personal growth, new experiences,
new people, understanding of
themselves and others, rediscovery
of where their bodies and senses
are.
"Where do most people live?"
Martine asked laughingly. "Most
people feel with their heads and
not with their senses when they
stub their toe, which is really
strange."
Speaking about Esalen-at-
Stanford's orientation on drugs
and politics, Martine said, "Esalen
emphasizes no drug use and no
politics. It gets people naturally
stoned."
According to Martine, most of
the group leaders who run the
weekend sessions have experi
mented with "psychedelic drugs"
and have realized they "can reach
this state of ecstasy by becoming
more aware."
"Many of them have their
Ph.D's, and all of them have
studied and done what they're
doing here for at least eight
years," noted Martine.
Enjoys Her Work
As co-ordinator of the Esalen
program here, Martine enjoys
what she is doing very much. This
is her second quarter managing
the program alone. Before that,
she managed the program for two
quarters with David Mastrandrea,
a junior who is presently in the
Stanford-in-Italy program.

Martine was born and raised in
Rotterdam, Holland. She came to
the United States three years ago
because she "realized Holland was
too small, and I was curious." In
Holland, Martine broke with tra
dition to enter an all-male eating
club for one year to serve as five
boys' secretary. The boys were
organizing a commemoration
party for the founding of Leiden
University—one of Holland's old
est universities.
Stanford's Gsalen co-ordinator
can also tell the story of how she
took it upon herself to humanize
the math department at Harvard
over the last Christmas vacation.
Formerly a secretary at the
Harvard department, Martine at
tended a Christmas party there
"where all the faculty were fairly
drunk. They asked me to explain
what I did in California—the East
coast being square and not know
ing what Esalen was."
Sensory Awareness
"I led them through a series of
sensory awareness exercises which
got them very high on people and
on each other. They said jokingly
that Harvard definitely needed
something like this, and why
didn't I come back to Harvard and
teach them how to be human."
When asked about her future
plans, Martine laughed. "I have
two years to decide whether or
not I want to apply for citizen
ship," she said. "What I decide de
pends on whom I marry. I'm
searching for a man that hasn't
been divorced. Single men that
aren't divorced are hard to find."
According to Martine, the
Stanford Esalen people are nicer
than those people attending Big
Sur sessions. Because the Stanford
program costs considerably less,
the age level attending here is
lower. And since the people are
younger, most group leaders ap
parently feel the participants are
more open to the techniques of
"experiential education."


ESALEN ENCOUNTER—Two participants in an Esalen encounter group talk it
over. The groups try to "make people more aware of evcery thing that's going
on." Through varied techniques such as Gestalt therapy, bio-energetics
psychodrama marathons and general encounter gorups.
"The Esalen approach brings
you back to the things you knew
how to do when you were a
child," says Martine Boot, the
pretty, twenty-two year old red
head who co-ordinates the
Esalen-at-Stanford program.
"My thing is organizing," said
Miss Boot, wrinkling up her
freckled nose. "For two months I
,was a secretary in the mechanical
engineering department, but then
I split because I can't stand to
have a boss. I like organizing and
working for myself better than
being a secretary."
The proper title for the Esalen
group at Stanford is actually "Ex
periental Education." The group
is an outgrowth of the Esalen In
stitute at Big Sur, California. Stan
ford is the only school allowed to
maintain a branch that uses the
Esalen name.
Stanford Special
* Stanford has been allowed to
maintain an Esalen branch be
cause the Institute's founder,
Mike Murphy, is a former Stan
ford student. The program here is
non-profit and is in its sixth quar
ter.
"I find the program here sells
under the title of Esalen," Martine
observed. "Esalen is a big draw.
The program attracts 600 to 650
people a quarter."
When questioned about
Esalen-at-Stanford's goals, Martine
replied, "We're trying to get the
Esalen approach into the Stanford
curriculum, so Stanford students
will get a unit of credit for a
weekend Esalen session.
Make People Aware
"Actually, we're trying to
make people more aware of every
thing that's going on. We want to
make people less like machines
and given them more enthusiasm.
We want people to communicate
better and more honestly."
