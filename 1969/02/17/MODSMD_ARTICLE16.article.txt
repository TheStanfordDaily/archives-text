# US Investments In Third World Nations Criticized As Capitalist Exploitation
## 
### MARGARET McGAUGHEY 
"The free world is not receptive
to freedom, but it is always re
ceptive to capitalism." Prof. John
Gurley of the Economics Depart
ment said Thursday night that
'Communism is not threatening
the freedom of the "Free World";
'it is challenging its capitalism.
Before a nearly full audience at
Bishop Auditorium of the Busi
ness School, Prof. Gurley and
Weissman, a former grad
uate student in Latin American
Studies spoke on the economics
of U.S. foreign investment and the
"Third World".
Prof. Gurley, speaking in the
second of five lectures in a series
sponsored by the United Christian
Ministry (UCM) and the Resis- r
tance, discussed two widely held
theories of the economics of un-'
derdeveloped nations.
The first theory, the Economic
Development view, sees Com
munism as a real danger to econ
omic growth and the cause of
freedom. It holds that underdevel
oped nations can only gain from
the investment of foreign capital
in their economies. It says that
even when profits are withdrawn
to the investing country, the un
derdeveloped nation has gained
through the wages paid local
workers, equipment invested in
the country, and the employment
of surplus labor.
Second Theory
The second theory, that of
Economic Imperialism, sees this
same kind of foreign investment
as what Prof. Gurley called "the
imposing by the rich of unfavor
able circumstances on the poor to
the detriment of the poor".
Through an alliance of the U.S.
corporation with the military,
political, and university elites in
the underdeveloped nation, the
Economic Imperialism theory sees
foreign investment as perpetuating
not the freedom of the masses,
but this oligarchy, and subjuca
tion.
In the sense that Communism
attacks this alliance between inter

national elites, Prof. Gurley said,
it is attacking the "Free World".
But he questioned whether this
was challenging freedom.
"Raking In The Profits"
"What are little nations made
of? Sugar, and spice and every
thing nice". Prof. Gurley, a pro
ponent of the Imperialism view of
economic development went on
to show how rich nations take the
natural resources from poor na
tions, then go about what he
called "the white man's burden of
raking in the profits".
He said, however, that this
milking of poor nations can go on
only so long before the under
developed countries will become

conscious of what they are allow
ing to happen through foreign in
vestments in their economies,
i "When they do develop con
sciousness there will be hope for
better things and they will be
free", he said.
Speaking second, Steve Weiss
man went on to take what he
called "a more moderate posi
tion" on economic development.
"Sabotaging" By Corporations
He discussed international cor
porations, and other institutions
such as the U.S. government, and
the universities which are, he
feels, "sabotaging" the economies
of underdeveloped countries by
"economic investment which is ef
ficient for the corporation, but

not for a well developed econ
omy".
For example, Weissman sited
the case of a graduate school of
business set up in Peru by the
Stanford Business School. It is
true, he said, that it is the only
school of its kind in Peru, but its
graduates are immediately em
ployed in the Peruvian branches
of American corporations, not
local firms.
Weissman felt that American
corporations, universities, and
even government leaders who are
ostensbly "anti big Business"
unite to make the exploitation of
poor nations, their raw materials,
and their economies inevitable.

"What are little nations made
of? Sugar, and spice and every
thing nice". Prof. Gurley, a pro
ponent of the Imperialism view of
economic development went on
to show how rich nations take the
natural resources from poor na
tions, then go about what he
called "the white man's burden of
raking in the profits".
He said, however, that this
milking of poor nations can go on
only so long before the under
developed countries will become

conscious of what they are allow
ing to happen through foreign in
vestments in their economies,
i "When they do develop con
sciousness there will be hope for
better things and they will be
free", he said.
Speaking second, Steve Weiss
man went on to take what he
called "a more moderate posi
tion" on economic development.
"Sabotaging" By Corporations
He discussed international cor
porations, and other institutions
such as the U.S. government, and
the universities which are, he
feels, "sabotaging" the economies
of underdeveloped countries by
"economic investment which is ef
ficient for the corporation, but

not for a well developed econ
omy".
For example, Weissman sited
the case of a graduate school of
business set up in Peru by the
Stanford Business School. It is
true, he said, that it is the only
school of its kind in Peru, but its
graduates are immediately em
ployed in the Peruvian branches
of American corporations, not
local firms.
Weissman felt that American
corporations, universities, and
even government leaders who are
ostensbly "anti big Business"
unite to make the exploitation of
poor nations, their raw materials,
and their economies inevitable.
"The free world is not receptive
to freedom, but it is always re
ceptive to capitalism." Prof. John
Gurley of the Economics Depart
ment said Thursday night that
'Communism is not threatening
the freedom of the "Free World";
'it is challenging its capitalism.
Before a nearly full audience at
Bishop Auditorium of the Busi
ness School, Prof. Gurley and
Weissman, a former grad
uate student in Latin American
Studies spoke on the economics
of U.S. foreign investment and the
"Third World".
Prof. Gurley, speaking in the
second of five lectures in a series
sponsored by the United Christian
Ministry (UCM) and the Resis- r
tance, discussed two widely held
theories of the economics of un-'
derdeveloped nations.
The first theory, the Economic
Development view, sees Com
munism as a real danger to econ
omic growth and the cause of
freedom. It holds that underdevel
oped nations can only gain from
the investment of foreign capital
in their economies. It says that
even when profits are withdrawn
to the investing country, the un
derdeveloped nation has gained
through the wages paid local
workers, equipment invested in
the country, and the employment
of surplus labor.
Second Theory
The second theory, that of
Economic Imperialism, sees this
same kind of foreign investment
as what Prof. Gurley called "the
imposing by the rich of unfavor
able circumstances on the poor to
the detriment of the poor".
Through an alliance of the U.S.
corporation with the military,
political, and university elites in
the underdeveloped nation, the
Economic Imperialism theory sees
foreign investment as perpetuating
not the freedom of the masses,
but this oligarchy, and subjuca
tion.
In the sense that Communism
attacks this alliance between inter

national elites, Prof. Gurley said,
it is attacking the "Free World".
But he questioned whether this
was challenging freedom.
