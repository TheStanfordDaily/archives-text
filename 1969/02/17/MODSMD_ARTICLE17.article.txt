## 
### LINDA WINTHROP 
The independant Stanford
woman is alive and griping. She
met with 40 sympathizing broth
ers and sisters last Thursday after
noon in Tresidder's Large Lounge
to hear a panel presentation by
Professor Carl Degler and Mrs.
Marjorie Lozoff on "Changing Sex
Roles in the '705."
"We are wrestling with the
problem of minorities in our day
and we can relate women to the
historical minority position of
blacks," reported Degler, a histor
ian from Vassar. He began with
this analogy and supported it by
pointing out that both women
and blacks are minorities in a
socially weak sense.
He cited visible "differentness",
similar emancipation movements,
stereotyping into "Uncle Toms"
and "Clinging Vines", consider
ation as inferiors in the areas of
jobs and education, and the wide
ly held supposition that both
blacks and women should "know
their place." Degler concluded the
comparison by stating that "Both
see themselves as inferior since
they're made to see themselves
this way by the majority power."

Is there a solution? Degler sees
one in the "separation of the
social role from the sex role". In
dications that this is happening in
clude the movement away from
sexually segregated education, in
creasing day care centers for chil
dren of working mothers, and
maternity leaves.
Mrs. Rosemary Lozoff, Re
search Associate at the Institute
for the Study of Human Prob
lems, began her presentation by
defining feminine autonomb as
the "feeling a woman has about
herself as an individual in contrast
to fitting herself into a role as
daughter, wife or mother."
