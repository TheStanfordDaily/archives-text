# Rep. Conyers
## 'White Supremacy' Must End 
### JENNY MATTHEWS 
John Conyers is a black who
would never allow himself to be
subjugated by the "insidious per
version of racism that colors our
society."
And his record in Congress
proves it.
In a speech given at Stanford
last Friday, Representative
Conyers from the first district in
Michigan denounced the "White

Supremacy Doctrine" and stated
that the centuries-old bondage of
the black man must be quickly
ended.
Currently serving in his third
term in the House, Conyers is the
first black congressman to serve
on the House Judiciary Com
mittee.
During last year's Democratic
convention, Conyers gave a
seconding speech for Rev.
Channing Phillips nomination for
[ president. He was the first to help
I organize the first black caucus in
! history, and he also spoke in favor
| of the minority plank against the
war in Vietnam.
Conyers is currently national
' chairman of the National Com
j mittee of Inquiry, an all-black
political organization similar to
the ADA.
Conyer's visit to Stanford
marked another in a series of trips
to U.S. college campuses. During
the day, he met with various cam
pus groups, sponsored by the
Stern Guest-in-Residence pro
gram, Tresidder Union, and Uni
versity Relations.
In an address given at Tresidder
Union, Conyers spoke of the cur
rent status of the black man in
congress and in American society.
Conyers was very critical of
Congress saying that "It has an
amazing ability to protect itself
from the new moods" that are
pervading the spirit of the
j country.
"Many talk of the current

Black unrest as a rebellion or a re
volution, but it will probably take
Congress longer than any group to
become firmly aware of the impli
cations of what the demands of
Black and concerned White youth
are all about.
Regarding black power,
Conyers commented that perhaps
it "overcompensates for the post
slavery syndrome to which many
men and women still cling to.
"Many thoughtful citizens have
raised the question of 'How in our
overall and increasing wealth is it
that the basic economic and social
conditions of the Black are not
really improving?'"
In a subtle attack of the Nixon
administration, Conyers warned
that unless there is significant pro
gress made toward closing this in
come gap, many blacks might be
new beneficiaries of the anti
poverty programs; it the new ad
ministration will, in fact, let the
programs exist."
Regarding the spirit of the
country, Conyers complained that
"we still have a fantastic residue
of racism which is part of the fab
ric of this country . . .This racism
has done more to impair progress
than anything else."
The Congressman pointed out
that racial problems were em
bedded in the original deliber
ations of this country's founding
constitution. The question of
"What shall we do with the
Blacks?". Conyers feels is an in
herent querie of American
society.

Congress longer than any group to
become firmly aware of the impli
cations of what the demands of
Black and concerned White youth
are all about.
Regarding black power,
Conyers commented that perhaps
it "overcompensates for the post
slavery syndrome to which many
men and women still cling to.
"Many thoughtful citizens have
raised the question of 'How in our
overall and increasing wealth is it
that the basic economic and social
conditions of the Black are not
really improving?'"
In a subtle attack of the Nixon
administration, Conyers warned
that unless there is significant pro
gress made toward closing this in
come gap, many blacks might be
new beneficiaries of the anti
poverty programs; it the new ad
ministration will, in fact, let the
programs exist."
Regarding the spirit of the
country, Conyers complained that
"we still have a fantastic residue
of racism which is part of the fab
ric of this country . . .This racism
has done more to impair progress
than anything else."
The Congressman pointed out
that racial problems were em
bedded in the original deliber
ations of this country's founding
constitution. The question of
"What shall we do with the
Blacks?". Conyers feels is an in
herent querie of American
society.
John Conyers is a black who
would never allow himself to be
subjugated by the "insidious per
version of racism that colors our
society."
And his record in Congress
proves it.
In a speech given at Stanford
last Friday, Representative
Conyers from the first district in
Michigan denounced the "White

Supremacy Doctrine" and stated
that the centuries-old bondage of
the black man must be quickly
ended.
Currently serving in his third
term in the House, Conyers is the
first black congressman to serve
on the House Judiciary Com
mittee.
During last year's Democratic
convention, Conyers gave a
seconding speech for Rev.
Channing Phillips nomination for
[ president. He was the first to help
I organize the first black caucus in
! history, and he also spoke in favor
| of the minority plank against the
war in Vietnam.
Conyers is currently national
' chairman of the National Com
j mittee of Inquiry, an all-black
political organization similar to
the ADA.
Conyer's visit to Stanford
marked another in a series of trips
to U.S. college campuses. During
the day, he met with various cam
pus groups, sponsored by the
Stern Guest-in-Residence pro
gram, Tresidder Union, and Uni
versity Relations.
In an address given at Tresidder
Union, Conyers spoke of the cur
rent status of the black man in
congress and in American society.
Conyers was very critical of
Congress saying that "It has an
amazing ability to protect itself
from the new moods" that are
pervading the spirit of the
j country.
"Many talk of the current

Black unrest as a rebellion or a re
volution, but it will probably take
Congress longer than any group to
become firmly aware of the impli
cations of what the demands of
Black and concerned White youth
are all about.
