# Police Nab Nazis In Bombing Case
## 
### LANG ATWOOD 
Nine members of a ring of Nazi ad
mirers were arrested in police raids
Friday night as a result of an intensive
investigation which police hope will put
an end to the terrorist bombings that
have plagued the Peninsula for the past
several months.
An undercover Menlo Park policeman
obtained information which led to the
raids by 40 officers from five depart
ments.
Officers from Menlo Park, Palo Alto,
Redwood City, Mountain View and Los
Altos led raiding teams which hit the
homes of the nine named in arrest war
rants.
The warrants listed eight separate
charges, including possession of ex
plosives, destructive devices, a sawed-off
rifle and tear gas. A rarely used 1953
law against using "terrorism as a means
of effecting political change" was also
invoked.
Basis For Charges
The basis for the conspiracy and
terrorism charges stems from an aborted
raid allegedly planned against a meeting
on Red China and Mao Tse-Tung at the
Palo Alto Unitarian Church.
According to police, the group
planned to use tear gas grenades
"stolen" from the Menlo Park Police
Dept. by Officer Armand Lareau, who
posing as a "Birch cop" who hated his
"communist pinko" police chief, won
the confidence of the group.
Lareau said he convinced the group
that they should call off the raid if there
were police present at the church, and
then made sure that police were highly
visible there the day of the conference.
Several members of the group al
legedly donned false beards and drove
to the scene—all elements of a con
spiracy to commit an act of terrorism
according to police.
Weapons Seized
Items seized in the police raids in
cluded a dozen rifles and shotguns, two
sawed off automatic rifles (one with an
illegally short barrel), numerous pistols,
75 pounds of black powder, cases of
ammunition, Nazi emblems and flags,
photos of Hitler and George Lincoln
Rockwell (deceased American Nazi
leader) and boxes of Nazi literature.
The arrests were aimed at solving a
months-long series of bombings and acts
of vandalism directed against the Con
cerned Citizens for Peace, an anti-war
group; the Midpeninsula Free Uni

versity; Kepler's Bookstores, owned by
Roy Kepler, a pacifist and teacher at the
Free U; and other liberal institutions in
cluding the house of Palo Alto City
Councilman Kirke Comstock.
No one was injured in any of the
blasts, but police officials had been ap
prehensive in the past few weeks as the
attackers broadened the scope of their
targets.
No charges regarding the bombings
have been filed against those in custody,
but according to a Menlo Police Dept.
spokesman the investigation is continu
ing and further charges may be filed.
Officer Praised
Officer Lareau, who is to receive a
special commendation from Menlo Park
Police Chief Victor Cizanckas for his
work in breaking the case, has been sent
out of town with his family until he is
needed to appear in court.
Only one of the nine taken into cus
tody, John R. Mirto, 24, a Palo Alto
laboratory technician, has been released.
He paid a $12,500 bond. The remaining
eight, seven men and one woman, are
lodged in the San Mateo County Jail.
Friday afternoon, a Stanford student
turned an unexploded pipe bomb over
to Stanford Police.
Rolling Around Floor
Terry Fotre, a junior in psychology,
told police that the bomb had been roll
ing around the floor of his sports car for
about a week. He said he had no idea
how it got there.
The bomb was comprised of a carbon
dioxide cartridge, black powder and BB
pellets.
Stanford Police Chief Thomas Bell
commented that the bomb, if ignited,
"would have destroyed the car or killed
anyone inside it."
He said he had no idea if the bomb
was related to the group arrested Friday
night or to the other incidents in the
Peninsula. The bomb was turned over to
the Santa Clara County Sheriff's Dept.
for investigation.
Fotre is vice-president of Delta Up
silon fraternity but otherwise is not in
volved in campus politics.
Police Alerted
Police were alerted to the right-wing
group by a letter from Joseph P. Dobiss
Jr. of Sunnyvale that named names,
dates, places and license numbers of per
sons alleged to be involved in the terror
ist attacks.

CONFISCATED ARMS-Menlo Park Police Chief Victor Cizanckas with guns, ammunition,
black powder and Nazi flags and emblems seized in raids Friday night. Police arrested nine
persons in connection with an attempted terrorist attack on a church in Palo Alto.
Some of the data proved to be
erroneous, but it was enough to
provide police with leads which
lead to the ring's infiltration by
Officer Lareau.
In his letter, Dobiss wrote, "if
there is no constructive change in
the left through the bombings,
more drastic brutal attacks are
planned; this is the reason for the
sniper rifles and there will be as
sassinations."
Voicing the feelings of many
people, Palo Alto Mayor Edward
S. Arnold said, "These arrests will
prove reassuring to many worried
people."
