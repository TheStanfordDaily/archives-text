# This Week's Films
## 
### TODD McCARTHY 
This week's collection of films,
while not quite on a par with the
past few weeks, does include some
excellent pictures of a highly spe
cialized nature.
On Tuesday and Wednesday in
Geology 320, Clive Miller is show
ing one of the classics of screen
suspense which, unfortunately, is
not wide known or seen. Dead of
Night, made in 1915 in England,
is an "omnibus of ghost stories,"
with episodes directed by four dif
ferent directors. Watch especially

for the sequence about a deranged
ventriloquist, starring Michael
Redgrave. Showing with Dead of
Night is M-G-M's color production
of National Velvet. The Western
Civ film (liis week is Le Bourgeois
Gentilhonime (The Wou Id-He
Gentleman). This picture, in the
vein of thellamlet and Othello of
a couple of years ago, is basically
a recording of a stage perform
ance. It will be shown in Cubber
ley on both Tuesday and Wednes
day at 4:15 and 7:30. A Girl in
II lack, the I-Center film on
Thursday at Cubberley, is a Greek
picture made in 1956 by Michael
Cacoyannis (Zorba the Greek). It
concerns the tortured life of a
young girl who lives is the shame
of her mother's active sexual life.
Shot on the Greek island of Hydra
with a single camera, the film is a
strong statement by the individ
ualistic Cacoyannis.
The Mistress, Friday's Japanese
film at Cubberley, examines a sim
ilar situation from a different
angle. In this film, directed by
Shiro Toyada, a shy young daugh
ter must sell herself sexually in
order to support her aging father.
The comparison between this and
A Girl in Mack should be inter
esting.
Friday night's comedy flick at
Tresidder is I'm No Angel with
Mae West. This is one of the two
films the great Mae made without
any censoring by the Catholic Of
fice and was the biggest box-office
hit of 1933. Six short experi
mental films will be screened on
Friday night at 11 pm in Geology
320. House of Cards, made by
West Coast painter Joseph Vogel
in 1947, is a stylized psycho
drama, a 196 5 's Schneerguntz
satirizes the modern woman and
Lost in Cuddahy has emerged as
one of the more important contri
butions to the underground cin
ema. Also being shown are In
eluctable Modality of the Visible
and Montage 11. More on these
later in the week.
Esteemed French director
Robert Bresson has made just six
films, one of which is Diary of a
Country I'riest (Le Journal d'un
Cure de Campagne), being pre
sented at Tresidder on Saturday.
A Man anrd a Woman is the Sun
day flick at Mem Aud. Filled with
sunsets, sand dunes and racing
cars, Pauline Kael described it as
"the perfect make-out movie."
Pretty apt, I'd say, but in Mem
Aud?

cialized nature.
On Tuesday and Wednesday in
Geology 320, Clive Miller is show
ing one of the classics of screen
suspense which, unfortunately, is
not wide known or seen. Dead of
Night, made in 1915 in England,
is an "omnibus of ghost stories,"
with episodes directed by four dif
ferent directors. Watch especially

for the sequence about a deranged
ventriloquist, starring Michael
Redgrave. Showing with Dead of
Night is M-G-M's color production
of National Velvet. The Western
Civ film (liis week is Le Bourgeois
Gentilhonime (The Wou Id-He
Gentleman). This picture, in the
vein of thellamlet and Othello of
a couple of years ago, is basically
a recording of a stage perform
ance. It will be shown in Cubber
ley on both Tuesday and Wednes
day at 4:15 and 7:30. A Girl in
II lack, the I-Center film on
Thursday at Cubberley, is a Greek
picture made in 1956 by Michael
Cacoyannis (Zorba the Greek). It
concerns the tortured life of a
young girl who lives is the shame
of her mother's active sexual life.
Shot on the Greek island of Hydra
with a single camera, the film is a
strong statement by the individ
ualistic Cacoyannis.
The Mistress, Friday's Japanese
film at Cubberley, examines a sim
ilar situation from a different
angle. In this film, directed by
Shiro Toyada, a shy young daugh
ter must sell herself sexually in
order to support her aging father.
The comparison between this and
A Girl in Mack should be inter
esting.
Friday night's comedy flick at
Tresidder is I'm No Angel with
Mae West. This is one of the two
films the great Mae made without
any censoring by the Catholic Of
fice and was the biggest box-office
hit of 1933. Six short experi
mental films will be screened on
Friday night at 11 pm in Geology
320. House of Cards, made by
West Coast painter Joseph Vogel
in 1947, is a stylized psycho
drama, a 196 5 's Schneerguntz
satirizes the modern woman and
Lost in Cuddahy has emerged as
one of the more important contri
butions to the underground cin
ema. Also being shown are In
eluctable Modality of the Visible
and Montage 11. More on these
later in the week.
Esteemed French director
Robert Bresson has made just six
films, one of which is Diary of a
Country I'riest (Le Journal d'un
Cure de Campagne), being pre
sented at Tresidder on Saturday.
A Man anrd a Woman is the Sun
day flick at Mem Aud. Filled with
sunsets, sand dunes and racing
cars, Pauline Kael described it as
"the perfect make-out movie."
Pretty apt, I'd say, but in Mem
Aud?
This week's collection of films,
while not quite on a par with the
past few weeks, does include some
excellent pictures of a highly spe
cialized nature.
