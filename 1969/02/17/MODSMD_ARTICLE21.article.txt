# IFC Starts Blood Drive
## 
### 
Sign-ups are being held on
White Plaza today and tomorrow
for the ASSU Blood Drive which
will be held on campus next Tues
day, Feb. 25. The drive will bene
fit the Associated Students' blood
reserve account. If for any reason
a student needs a transfusion, he
is given one free of charge, and
the number of pints of blood used
is deducted from the ASSU ac
count. Although individuals using
the reserve are urged to have
friends make donations to replen
ish the blood they've used, this is
often impossible, and hence the
account gradually diminishes.
Periodically, a blood drive is
held on campus to build up the
reserve to adequate proportions.
The last time the ASSU sponsored
such a drive was six years ago, and
the account has now dwindled to
dangerously low proportions. In
light of this fact, the Inter-Frater
nity Council (IFC) offered to
sponsor the drive as one of its
Greek Weeks projects, a proposal
which met with the immediate
and enthusiastic support of Dr.
James McClenehan, Director of
Cowell Health Center, who
pointed out that the recent flu
epidemic made the need for blood
even more crucial.
The IFC will be manning a
table near the Post Office where
students may receive more in
formation and sign up to donate.
Individuals will indicate the spe
cific time that they wish to give
blood, so that there will be no
waiting next Tuesday when dona
tions are made. Any person be
tween 18 and 61 may donate
blood, and parental permission for
those under 21, previously a re
quirement, is no longer necessary.
