SAN FRANCISCO (AP)-
Explosions rocked the adminis
tration building and injured a
campus security officer at tense
San Francisco State College early
yesterday setting the stage for to
day's opening of spring semester.
Police Chief Thomas Cahill said
the early-morning bombing
demonstrates the need for posting
of police on campus during off
hours.
"Well-coached criminals de
signed the bomb," the chief said,
adding "they had good infor
mation about the construction of
a bomb."
The explosions blew out 14
large plate glass windows and
touched off two small fires at the

administration building, the target
of earlier arson attempts.
Derek Pitts, a campus security
officer, was passing within a few
yards of the explosions in a patrol
car. He suffered a mild concussion
but was still able to put out the
fires on the outside wall.
Investigators found pieces of
two bottles, traces of kerosene,
pieces of wire and metal pipe and
remains of a clock timing device
and battery-wrapper. The evi
dence indicated there were two
separate explosions, police said.
It was not known how many of
the 199 ousted faculty members
of the striking American Feder
ation of Teachers would accept
Hayakawa's offer to rehire them
