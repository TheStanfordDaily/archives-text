### 
The following is a copy of the "Leg
islative and Judicial Charter of 1968," in
cluding the recommendations for amend
ment made to the three constituencies by
the Committee of Fifteen. These appear in
bold type.
The recommendation?- for amendment
will be on the ballot in the election to be
held Tuesday and Wednesday, February
18 and 19.
I. STUDENT CONDUCT LEGISLATIVE
COUNCIL
A. JURISDICTION
1. The jurisdiction of the Student Conduct
Legislative Council to promulgate legis
lation shall extend to matters of student
conduct involving the Honor Code and
to such non-academic conduct as may
warrant disciplinary sanctions against in
dividual students or against membership
organizations of students. This author
ity shall include the promulgation of
statements declaring that specified
forms of non-academic conduct are not
the proper subject of University control
whether because the conduct is deemed
to be proper in a University or because
the conduct, though illegal, should con
cern only non-University authorities.
2. The SCLC is empowered to establish an
array of disciplinary sanctions for use
by the Stanford Judicial Council and to
prescribe specific maximum penalties
for first violations of individual regula

disciplinary sanction at the time of the
violation. In no event shall the SCLC
establish minimum penalties.
3. Legislation promulgated by the SCLC
shall prevail over inconsistent regula
tions developed by other groups or indi
viduals in the University except as pro
vided in Article IV. These groups or in
dividuals that in the past have been
authorized to develop specialized stu
dent conduct regulations shall continue
to have such authority unless and until
the SCLC explicitly asserts its jurisdic
tion over such matters and legislates in
the specific area. The SCLC shall be em
powered to delegate authority to issue
regulations controlling such specialized
conduct to other groups or individuals
under such conditions and for such per
iods of time as the SCLC may deem ap
propriate.
4. Regulations of the SCLC shall remain in
effect during vacations and through the

ate agency of the Academic Council.
[In order to eliminate the requirement that
the President of the University shall appoint the

ted by the Academic Senate, we recommend that
Article I, section 13.1 a be amended to read as
follows: Six faculty members appointed by the

members. In the event the SCLC finds that a
faculty vacancy exists, the Academic Senate will
appoint an alternate.]

ulation, including change or repeal of an
existing regulation, in less time than is
required under the procedure set forth
in section D.l, the President of the Uni
versity may promulgate an interim regu
lation to become effective immediately
upon publication, provided the Presi

members of the SCLC as practicable
and, if time permits, shall first afford
the SCLC an opportunity to act under
section D.2a.
c. Interim regulations promulgated under
section D.2a shall expire 90 days after
publication unless within that period

til SCLC acts on it. He shall inform the
SCLC of each promulgation.
112. Whenever the SCLC promulgates an in
terim regulation under section D.2a or

rently conflicts of law.

pealable except in the sense that all its
decisions must be recommendations to
the President of the University.

2. The SJC shall not have jurisdiction over
offenses committed outside the Univer
sity campus except during participation
in a University activity, unless such con
duct is a violation of a specific Univer
sity regulation.
However, if a student's conduct on or
off the campus calls into question the
student's membership in the educational
community, either because he has gross
ly violated elemental standards of be
havior requisite to the maintenance of
an educational community or because
his continued presence would adversely
affect the ability of others to pursue
their educational goals, he may be
found ineligible to continue as a mem
ber of the University community only

by the University; if one of the parties
fails to contribute its full share, he may
be paid entirely by either party.

prive the SJC of the right to hold hear

be inequitable to the defendant when
imposed in addition to civil or criminal
penalties. This limitation shall not apply
when SJC proceedings are deemed
necessary by the SJC to protect the
University community from risk of
harm. Nothing in this paragraph, how
ever, shall be interpreted as barring or
delaying action by the SJC on a case

fore a civil court.

Council has absolute authority to con
trol the conduct of persons in the Coun

signatures of at least 5% of the registered matric
ulated students and setting forth the proposition
presented above, are delivered to the Committee

further request from any constituency
adopt the problem of establishing an
acceptable judiciary body as its first or
der of business.
b. The SJC shall continue to operate under
the then current legislation governing its

has been approved by the three con
stituencies, or for a period of 150 days,
whichever provides the shorter period.
IV RESIDUAL AUTHORITY OF THE PRESI
DENT
Although nothing in these articles shall be
deemed to contravene or limit the authority

primary responsibility for promulgating such reg
ulations and adjudicating violations thereof.

posals are approved by LASSU, the Aca
demic Council, and the President, ex
cept that no amendment changing the
membership of either Council shall go
into effect until the time of the next
regular selection of members.
[In order to make it easier for the student
body to initiate amendments of the Charter, we
recommend that Article 111, section A.la be
amended to read as follows: A request by the
students shall occur either (i) when a majority of
those voting, provided at least 10% of the regis
tered matriculated students vote on the issue,
cast affirmative votes in a special referendum
organized by LASSU, to the following proposi

SCLC and the SJC and to recommend such
amendments as may be agreed upon by the Com
mittee in order to achieve the following pur
poses: ..." or (ii) when petitions, including the
signatures of at least 5% of the registered matric
ulated students and setting forth the proposition
presented above, are delivered to the Committee
of Fifteen.)

shall occur when a majority of those
voting, but not less than 20% of the
membership of the Academic Council,
cast affirmative votes to the proposition
presented above.
c. A request by the administration shall
s occur when the President informs the
Chairman of the Committee of Fifteen
in writing that he desires action toward
amendment.
d. A request by the SCLC shall occur when

September 1 of the following academic
year.
b. That termination shall not nullify or
otherwise affect regulations previously
adopted by SCLC under its regular pro
cedures.
3. If amendment by the procedure de
scribed in Article 111, section A.l should
result in termination of the SJC:
a. The Committee of Fifteen shall without
further request from any constituency
adopt the problem of establishing an
acceptable judiciary body as its first or
der of business.
b. The SJC shall continue to operate under
the then current legislation governing its
existence until a substitute judicial law
has been approved by the three con
stituencies, or for a period of 150 days,
whichever provides the shorter period.
IV RESIDUAL AUTHORITY OF THE PRESI
DENT
Although nothing in these articles shall be
deemed to contravene or limit the authority
and power of the President to promulgate and
enforce regulations governing student conduct at
Stanford University, except in extraordinary cir
cumstances the SCLC and the SJC shall have
primary responsibility for promulgating such reg
ulations and adjudicating violations thereof.
The following is a copy of the "Leg
islative and Judicial Charter of 1968," in
cluding the recommendations for amend
ment made to the three constituencies by
the Committee of Fifteen. These appear in
bold type.
The recommendation?- for amendment
will be on the ballot in the election to be
held Tuesday and Wednesday, February
18 and 19.
I. STUDENT CONDUCT LEGISLATIVE
COUNCIL
A. JURISDICTION
1. The jurisdiction of the Student Conduct
Legislative Council to promulgate legis
lation shall extend to matters of student
conduct involving the Honor Code and
to such non-academic conduct as may
warrant disciplinary sanctions against in
dividual students or against membership
organizations of students. This author
ity shall include the promulgation of
statements declaring that specified
forms of non-academic conduct are not
the proper subject of University control
whether because the conduct is deemed
to be proper in a University or because
the conduct, though illegal, should con
cern only non-University authorities.
2. The SCLC is empowered to establish an
array of disciplinary sanctions for use
by the Stanford Judicial Council and to
prescribe specific maximum penalties
for first violations of individual regula
tions by students who were not under
disciplinary sanction at the time of the
violation. In no event shall the SCLC
establish minimum penalties.
3. Legislation promulgated by the SCLC
shall prevail over inconsistent regula
tions developed by other groups or indi
viduals in the University except as pro
vided in Article IV. These groups or in
dividuals that in the past have been
authorized to develop specialized stu
dent conduct regulations shall continue
to have such authority unless and until
the SCLC explicitly asserts its jurisdic
tion over such matters and legislates in
the specific area. The SCLC shall be em
powered to delegate authority to issue
regulations controlling such specialized
conduct to other groups or individuals
under such conditions and for such per
iods of time as the SCLC may deem ap
propriate.
4. Regulations of the SCLC shall remain in
effect during vacations and through the
summer.

from among the appointed faculty
members. In the event the SCLC finds
that a faculty vacancy exists, the Presi
dent shall choose an alternate from
nominations submitted by the appropri
ate agency of the Academic Council.
[In order to eliminate the requirement that
the President of the University shall appoint the
faculty members (other than the Chairman) of
the two councils from lists of nominees submit
ted by the Academic Senate, we recommend that
Article I, section 13.1 a be amended to read as
follows: Six faculty members appointed by the
Academic Senate. The President will select a
Chairman from among the appointed faculty
members. In the event the SCLC finds that a
faculty vacancy exists, the Academic Senate will
appoint an alternate.]

and shall go into effect when such pro
posals are approved by LASSU, the Aca
demic Council, and the President, ex
cept that no amendment changing the
membership of either Council shall go
into effect until the time of the next
regular selection of members.
[In order to make it easier for the student
body to initiate amendments of the Charter, we
recommend that Article 111, section A.la be
amended to read as follows: A request by the
students shall occur either (i) when a majority of
those voting, provided at least 10% of the regis
tered matriculated students vote on the issue,
cast affirmative votes in a special referendum
organized by LASSU, to the following proposi

examine the prior legislation concerning the
SCLC and the SJC and to recommend such
amendments as may be agreed upon by the Com
mittee in order to achieve the following pur
poses: ..." or (ii) when petitions, including the
signatures of at least 5% of the registered matric
ulated students and setting forth the proposition
presented above, are delivered to the Committee
of Fifteen.)
b. A request by the Academic Council
shall occur when a majority of those
voting, but not less than 20% of the
membership of the Academic Council,
cast affirmative votes to the proposition
presented above.
c. A request by the administration shall
s occur when the President informs the
Chairman of the Committee of Fifteen
in writing that he desires action toward
amendment.
d. A request by the SCLC shall occur when
its members cast seven affirmative votes
to the proposition presented above.
e. A request by the SJC shall occur when
its members case a majority of affirma

scribed in Article 111, section A.l should
result in termination of the SCLC:
a. That termination shall take effect on
September 1 of the following academic
year.
b. That termination shall not nullify or
otherwise affect regulations previously
adopted by SCLC under its regular pro
cedures.
3. If amendment by the procedure de
scribed in Article 111, section A.l should
result in termination of the SJC:
a. The Committee of Fifteen shall without
further request from any constituency
adopt the problem of establishing an
acceptable judiciary body as its first or
der of business.
b. The SJC shall continue to operate under
the then current legislation governing its
existence until a substitute judicial law
has been approved by the three con
stituencies, or for a period of 150 days,
whichever provides the shorter period.
IV RESIDUAL AUTHORITY OF THE PRESI
DENT
Although nothing in these articles shall be
deemed to contravene or limit the authority
and power of the President to promulgate and
enforce regulations governing student conduct at
Stanford University, except in extraordinary cir
cumstances the SCLC and the SJC shall have
primary responsibility for promulgating such reg
ulations and adjudicating violations thereof.
The following is a copy of the "Leg
islative and Judicial Charter of 1968," in
cluding the recommendations for amend
ment made to the three constituencies by
the Committee of Fifteen. These appear in
bold type.
The recommendation?- for amendment
will be on the ballot in the election to be
held Tuesday and Wednesday, February
18 and 19.
I. STUDENT CONDUCT LEGISLATIVE
COUNCIL
A. JURISDICTION
1. The jurisdiction of the Student Conduct
Legislative Council to promulgate legis
lation shall extend to matters of student
conduct involving the Honor Code and
to such non-academic conduct as may
warrant disciplinary sanctions against in
dividual students or against membership
organizations of students. This author
ity shall include the promulgation of
statements declaring that specified
forms of non-academic conduct are not
the proper subject of University control
whether because the conduct is deemed
to be proper in a University or because
the conduct, though illegal, should con
cern only non-University authorities.
2. The SCLC is empowered to establish an
array of disciplinary sanctions for use
by the Stanford Judicial Council and to
prescribe specific maximum penalties
for first violations of individual regula
tions by students who were not under
disciplinary sanction at the time of the
violation. In no event shall the SCLC
establish minimum penalties.
3. Legislation promulgated by the SCLC
shall prevail over inconsistent regula
tions developed by other groups or indi
viduals in the University except as pro
vided in Article IV. These groups or in
dividuals that in the past have been
authorized to develop specialized stu
dent conduct regulations shall continue
to have such authority unless and until
the SCLC explicitly asserts its jurisdic
tion over such matters and legislates in
the specific area. The SCLC shall be em
powered to delegate authority to issue
regulations controlling such specialized
conduct to other groups or individuals
under such conditions and for such per
iods of time as the SCLC may deem ap
propriate.
4. Regulations of the SCLC shall remain in
effect during vacations and through the
summer.
B. COMPOSITION

from among the appointed faculty
members. In the event the SCLC finds
that a faculty vacancy exists, the Presi
dent shall choose an alternate from
nominations submitted by the appropri
ate agency of the Academic Council.
[In order to eliminate the requirement that
the President of the University shall appoint the
faculty members (other than the Chairman) of
the two councils from lists of nominees submit
ted by the Academic Senate, we recommend that
Article I, section 13.1 a be amended to read as
follows: Six faculty members appointed by the
Academic Senate. The President will select a
Chairman from among the appointed faculty
members. In the event the SCLC finds that a
faculty vacancy exists, the Academic Senate will
appoint an alternate.]

drafts of proposed legislation. Such
draft presentations shall be transmitted
to the President of the University, the

appropriate agency of the Academic
Council and the Legislature of the Asso

range that such draft presentations be
published so as to be made available to
all members of the Stanford commu

original presentation. It shall then trans
mit and publish such adopted text in
the manner provided in paragraph b.
Such publication shall be accompanied

be considered second passage and the
rule shall become effective 10 days after
transmittal and publication in the man
ner provided in paragraph b.
If, however, the text is not identical to
that approved on first reading, passage
shall be considered a first passage and
the 14 day notice period provided in
paragraph d. shall again apply. Such 14
day periods shall continue to apply until
SCLC, after a 14 day notice, passes a
bill that is identical to that passed at the
outset of the 14 day period. In such

tened with the written concurrence of
the President of the University.

falls on a Saturday, Sunday or holiday
the period shall be deemed to extend to
the next working day.

Legislation
a. When in its opinion an emergency exists
that requires promulgation of a regula
tion, including change or repeal of an
existing regulation, in less time than is
required under the procedure set forth
in section D.l, the SCLC, with the writ
ten consent of the President of the Uni
versity, may promulgate an interim rule

b. When in his opinion an emergency exists
that requires the promulgation of a reg
ulation, including change or repeal of an
existing regulation, in less time than is
required under the procedure set forth
in section D.l, the President of the Uni
versity may promulgate an interim regu
lation to become effective immediately
upon publication, provided the Presi
dent shall first consult with as many
members of the SCLC as practicable
and, if time permits, shall first afford
the SCLC an opportunity to act under
section D.2a.
c. Interim regulations promulgated under
section D.2a shall expire 90 days after
publication unless within that period
the SCLC has taken steps to promulgate
a regulation in the same area under the

the President under section D.2b shall
remain in effect for 90 days or until it is
repealed or amended by the SCLC,

SCLC of each promulgation.
112. Whenever the SCLC promulgates an in
terim regulation under section D.2a or
the President promulgates an interim
regulation under D.2b or D.2e, copies

IV RESIDUAL AUTHORITY OF THE PRESI
DENT
Although nothing in these articles shall be
deemed to contravene or limit the authority
and power of the President to promulgate and
enforce regulations governing student conduct at
Stanford University, except in extraordinary cir
cumstances the SCLC and the SJC shall have
primary responsibility for promulgating such reg
ulations and adjudicating violations thereof.
The following is a copy of the "Leg
islative and Judicial Charter of 1968," in
cluding the recommendations for amend
ment made to the three constituencies by
the Committee of Fifteen. These appear in
bold type.
The recommendation?- for amendment
will be on the ballot in the election to be
held Tuesday and Wednesday, February
18 and 19.
I. STUDENT CONDUCT LEGISLATIVE
COUNCIL
A. JURISDICTION
1. The jurisdiction of the Student Conduct
Legislative Council to promulgate legis
lation shall extend to matters of student
conduct involving the Honor Code and
to such non-academic conduct as may
warrant disciplinary sanctions against in
dividual students or against membership
organizations of students. This author
ity shall include the promulgation of
statements declaring that specified
forms of non-academic conduct are not
the proper subject of University control
whether because the conduct is deemed
to be proper in a University or because
the conduct, though illegal, should con
cern only non-University authorities.
2. The SCLC is empowered to establish an
array of disciplinary sanctions for use
by the Stanford Judicial Council and to
prescribe specific maximum penalties
for first violations of individual regula

disciplinary sanction at the time of the
violation. In no event shall the SCLC
establish minimum penalties.
3. Legislation promulgated by the SCLC
shall prevail over inconsistent regula
tions developed by other groups or indi
viduals in the University except as pro
vided in Article IV. These groups or in
dividuals that in the past have been
authorized to develop specialized stu
dent conduct regulations shall continue
to have such authority unless and until
the SCLC explicitly asserts its jurisdic
tion over such matters and legislates in
the specific area. The SCLC shall be em
powered to delegate authority to issue
regulations controlling such specialized
conduct to other groups or individuals
under such conditions and for such per
iods of time as the SCLC may deem ap
propriate.
4. Regulations of the SCLC shall remain in
effect during vacations and through the
summer.
B. COMPOSITION

from among the appointed faculty
members. In the event the SCLC finds
that a faculty vacancy exists, the Presi
dent shall choose an alternate from
nominations submitted by the appropri
ate agency of the Academic Council.
[In order to eliminate the requirement that
the President of the University shall appoint the
faculty members (other than the Chairman) of
the two councils from lists of nominees submit
ted by the Academic Senate, we recommend that
Article I, section 13.1 a be amended to read as
follows: Six faculty members appointed by the
Academic Senate. The President will select a
Chairman from among the appointed faculty
members. In the event the SCLC finds that a
faculty vacancy exists, the Academic Senate will
appoint an alternate.]

Stanford University. Runners-up in
elections for student members shall
be declared alternates, to fill any stu

D. Procedure for Enactment of Legislation by
the Student Conduct Legislative Council

munication or on its own initiative the
SCLC may present a draft or alternative
drafts of proposed legislation. Such
draft presentations shall be transmitted
to the President of the University, the

appropriate agency of the Academic
Council and the Legislature of the Asso
ciated Students. SCLC shall further ar
range that such draft presentations be
published so as to be made available to
all members of the Stanford commu
nity.
c. In addition to the text of the proposed
draft or drafts, the presentations shall
set a deadline at least 21 days from the
date of publication within which any
interested party may communicate in
writing his views on the drafts as well as
any suggested revisions. In its discretion,
the SCLC may hold hearings.
d. After the passage of at least 21, but not
more than 60, days from the publica
tion of the proposed draft or drafts, the
SCLC may vote first passage of a rule
germane to the subject covered in the
original presentation. It shall then trans
mit and publish such adopted text in
the manner provided in paragraph b.
Such publication shall be accompanied
by a notice giving all interested parties
at least 14 days to file written views
with SCLC. In its discretion SCLC may
also hold hearings.
e. If, after the passage of at least 14, but
not more than 60, days from publica
tion of notice of first passage, the SCLC
adopts a measure that is identical to
that passed at the first reading, this shall
be considered second passage and the
rule shall become effective 10 days after
transmittal and publication in the man
ner provided in paragraph b.
If, however, the text is not identical to
that approved on first reading, passage
shall be considered a first passage and
the 14 day notice period provided in
paragraph d. shall again apply. Such 14
day periods shall continue to apply until
SCLC, after a 14 day notice, passes a
bill that is identical to that passed at the
outset of the 14 day period. In such
event that bill shall be deemed to have
had second passage and will become ef
fective 10 days after transmittal and
publication in the manner provided in
paragraph b. The ten day period re
ferred to in this paragraph may be shor
tened with the written concurrence of
the President of the University.
112. Although the SCLC is empowered to
hold open meetings and hearings on gen
eral subjects without prior submission
of proposed drafts, such meetings shall
not constitute a presentation setting in
motion the procedure specified in this
section D.lb.
g. All time periods referred to in section

sity is in regular session and shall not
apply during Summer Quarter nor dur
ing recesses during the academic year.

time periods referred to above except
that when the final day of such period
falls on a Saturday, Sunday or holiday
the period shall be deemed to extend to
the next working day.
2. Procedures for Enactment of Interim
Legislation
a. When in its opinion an emergency exists
that requires promulgation of a regula
tion, including change or repeal of an
existing regulation, in less time than is
required under the procedure set forth
in section D.l, the SCLC, with the writ
ten consent of the President of the Uni
versity, may promulgate an interim rule
to. become effective immediately upon
publication though requirements of sec
tion D.l have not been fulfilled.
b. When in his opinion an emergency exists
that requires the promulgation of a reg
ulation, including change or repeal of an
existing regulation, in less time than is
required under the procedure set forth
in section D.l, the President of the Uni
versity may promulgate an interim regu
lation to become effective immediately
upon publication, provided the Presi
dent shall first consult with as many
members of the SCLC as practicable
and, if time permits, shall first afford
the SCLC an opportunity to act under
section D.2a.
c. Interim regulations promulgated under
section D.2a shall expire 90 days after
publication unless within that period
the SCLC has taken steps to promulgate
a regulation in the same area under the
procedure specified in section D.l, in
which case the interim regulation may
remain in effect until the conclusion of
the section D.l procedure.
d. An interim regulation promulgated by
the President under section D.2b shall
remain in effect for 90 days or until it is
repealed or amended by the SCLC,
whichever occurs first.

in section D.l or, with the written con
currence of the President, SCLC may
proceed under section D.2a.
e. If in the case of an interim regulation
promulgated under section D.2b, 90
days expire with no action by the
SCLC, the President may repromulgate
the interim regulation every 30 days un
til SCLC acts on it. He shall inform the
SCLC of each promulgation.
112. Whenever the SCLC promulgates an in
terim regulation under section D.2a or
the President promulgates an interim
regulation under D.2b or D.2e, copies
shall be sent to the appropriate agency
of the Academic Council and the Legis
lature of the Associated Students and
the regulation shall be published as gen
erally and as quickly as practicable. As
soon thereafter as practicable the regula
tion shall be published as provided in

sideration of areas in which there are cur
rently conflicts of law.

the President of the University.

2. The SJC shall not have jurisdiction over
offenses committed outside the Univer
sity campus except during participation
in a University activity, unless such con
duct is a violation of a specific Univer
sity regulation.
However, if a student's conduct on or
off the campus calls into question the
student's membership in the educational
community, either because he has gross
ly violated elemental standards of be
havior requisite to the maintenance of
an educational community or because
his continued presence would adversely
affect the ability of others to pursue
their educational goals, he may be
found ineligible to continue as a mem
ber of the University community only

imposed in addition to civil or criminal
penalties. This limitation shall not apply
when SJC proceedings are deemed
necessary by the SJC to protect the
University community from risk of
harm. Nothing in this paragraph, how
ever, shall be interpreted as barring or

However, if a student's conduct on or
off the campus calls into question the
student's membership in the educational
community, either because he has gross
ly violated elemental standards of be
havior requisite to the maintenance of
an educational community or because
his continued presence would adversely
affect the ability of others to pursue
their educational goals, he may be
found ineligible to continue as a mem
ber of the University community only

mittee in order to achieve the following pur
poses: ..." or (ii) when petitions, including the
signatures of at least 5% of the registered matric
ulated students and setting forth the proposition
presented above, are delivered to the Committee

IV RESIDUAL AUTHORITY OF THE PRESI
DENT
Although nothing in these articles shall be
deemed to contravene or limit the authority
and power of the President to promulgate and
enforce regulations governing student conduct at
Stanford University, except in extraordinary cir
cumstances the SCLC and the SJC shall have
primary responsibility for promulgating such reg
ulations and adjudicating violations thereof.
The following is a copy of the "Leg
islative and Judicial Charter of 1968," in
cluding the recommendations for amend
ment made to the three constituencies by
the Committee of Fifteen. These appear in
bold type.
The recommendation?- for amendment
will be on the ballot in the election to be

COUNCIL
A. JURISDICTION
1. The jurisdiction of the Student Conduct
Legislative Council to promulgate legis

warrant disciplinary sanctions against in
dividual students or against membership
organizations of students. This author
ity shall include the promulgation of
statements declaring that specified
forms of non-academic conduct are not
the proper subject of University control
whether because the conduct is deemed
to be proper in a University or because
the conduct, though illegal, should con
cern only non-University authorities.
2. The SCLC is empowered to establish an
array of disciplinary sanctions for use
by the Stanford Judicial Council and to
prescribe specific maximum penalties

establish minimum penalties.
3. Legislation promulgated by the SCLC
shall prevail over inconsistent regula
tions developed by other groups or indi

dent conduct regulations shall continue
to have such authority unless and until
the SCLC explicitly asserts its jurisdic
tion over such matters and legislates in
the specific area. The SCLC shall be em
powered to delegate authority to issue
regulations controlling such specialized
conduct to other groups or individuals
under such conditions and for such per
iods of time as the SCLC may deem ap
propriate.

effect during vacations and through the
summer.

1. Amendments of these articles shall be
proposed by a majority vote of the
Committee of Fifteen, acting on the
matter at the request of any one of the
three constituencies, student, faculty, or

and shall go into effect when such pro
posals are approved by LASSU, the Aca
demic Council, and the President, ex
cept that no amendment changing the
membership of either Council shall go
into effect until the time of the next
regular selection of members.
[In order to make it easier for the student
body to initiate amendments of the Charter, we
recommend that Article 111, section A.la be
amended to read as follows: A request by the
students shall occur either (i) when a majority of
those voting, provided at least 10% of the regis
tered matriculated students vote on the issue,
cast affirmative votes in a special referendum
organized by LASSU, to the following proposi
tion: "The Committee of Fifteen is requested to
examine the prior legislation concerning the
SCLC and the SJC and to recommend such
amendments as may be agreed upon by the Com
mittee in order to achieve the following pur
poses: ..." or (ii) when petitions, including the
signatures of at least 5% of the registered matric
ulated students and setting forth the proposition
presented above, are delivered to the Committee
of Fifteen.)
b. A request by the Academic Council
shall occur when a majority of those
voting, but not less than 20% of the
membership of the Academic Council,
cast affirmative votes to the proposition
presented above.
c. A request by the administration shall
s occur when the President informs the
Chairman of the Committee of Fifteen
in writing that he desires action toward
amendment.
d. A request by the SCLC shall occur when
its members cast seven affirmative votes
to the proposition presented above.
e. A request by the SJC shall occur when
its members case a majority of affirma
tive votes to the proposition presented

2. If amendment by the procedure de
scribed in Article 111, section A.l should
result in termination of the SCLC:
a. That termination shall take effect on
September 1 of the following academic
year.
b. That termination shall not nullify or
otherwise affect regulations previously
adopted by SCLC under its regular pro
cedures.
3. If amendment by the procedure de
scribed in Article 111, section A.l should
result in termination of the SJC:
a. The Committee of Fifteen shall without
further request from any constituency
adopt the problem of establishing an
acceptable judiciary body as its first or
der of business.
b. The SJC shall continue to operate under
the then current legislation governing its
existence until a substitute judicial law
has been approved by the three con
stituencies, or for a period of 150 days,
whichever provides the shorter period.
IV RESIDUAL AUTHORITY OF THE PRESI
DENT
Although nothing in these articles shall be
deemed to contravene or limit the authority
and power of the President to promulgate and
enforce regulations governing student conduct at
Stanford University, except in extraordinary cir
cumstances the SCLC and the SJC shall have
primary responsibility for promulgating such reg
ulations and adjudicating violations thereof.
The following is a copy of the "Leg
islative and Judicial Charter of 1968," in
cluding the recommendations for amend
ment made to the three constituencies by
the Committee of Fifteen. These appear in
bold type.
The recommendation?- for amendment
will be on the ballot in the election to be
held Tuesday and Wednesday, February
18 and 19.
I. STUDENT CONDUCT LEGISLATIVE
COUNCIL
A. JURISDICTION
1. The jurisdiction of the Student Conduct
Legislative Council to promulgate legis
lation shall extend to matters of student
conduct involving the Honor Code and
to such non-academic conduct as may
warrant disciplinary sanctions against in
dividual students or against membership
organizations of students. This author
ity shall include the promulgation of
statements declaring that specified
forms of non-academic conduct are not
the proper subject of University control
whether because the conduct is deemed
to be proper in a University or because
the conduct, though illegal, should con
cern only non-University authorities.
2. The SCLC is empowered to establish an
array of disciplinary sanctions for use
by the Stanford Judicial Council and to
prescribe specific maximum penalties
for first violations of individual regula
tions by students who were not under
disciplinary sanction at the time of the
violation. In no event shall the SCLC
establish minimum penalties.
3. Legislation promulgated by the SCLC
shall prevail over inconsistent regula
tions developed by other groups or indi
viduals in the University except as pro
vided in Article IV. These groups or in
dividuals that in the past have been
authorized to develop specialized stu
dent conduct regulations shall continue
to have such authority unless and until
the SCLC explicitly asserts its jurisdic
tion over such matters and legislates in
the specific area. The SCLC shall be em
powered to delegate authority to issue
regulations controlling such specialized
conduct to other groups or individuals
under such conditions and for such per
iods of time as the SCLC may deem ap
propriate.
4. Regulations of the SCLC shall remain in
effect during vacations and through the
summer.

from among the appointed faculty
members. In the event the SCLC finds
that a faculty vacancy exists, the Presi
dent shall choose an alternate from
nominations submitted by the appropri
ate agency of the Academic Council.
[In order to eliminate the requirement that
the President of the University shall appoint the
faculty members (other than the Chairman) of
the two councils from lists of nominees submit
ted by the Academic Senate, we recommend that
Article I, section 13.1 a be amended to read as
follows: Six faculty members appointed by the
Academic Senate. The President will select a
Chairman from among the appointed faculty
members. In the event the SCLC finds that a
faculty vacancy exists, the Academic Senate will
appoint an alternate.]

appropriate place a complete enumera
tion of all rules governing student con
duct then in effect.
D. Procedure for Enactment of Legislation by
the Student Conduct Legislative Council

munication or on its own initiative the
SCLC may present a draft or alternative
drafts of proposed legislation. Such
draft presentations shall be transmitted
to the President of the University, the

appropriate agency of the Academic
Council and the Legislature of the Asso

range that such draft presentations be
published so as to be made available to
all members of the Stanford commu

original presentation. It shall then trans
mit and publish such adopted text in
the manner provided in paragraph b.
Such publication shall be accompanied
by a notice giving all interested parties
at least 14 days to file written views

be considered second passage and the
rule shall become effective 10 days after
transmittal and publication in the man
ner provided in paragraph b.
If, however, the text is not identical to
that approved on first reading, passage
shall be considered a first passage and
the 14 day notice period provided in
paragraph d. shall again apply. Such 14
day periods shall continue to apply until
SCLC, after a 14 day notice, passes a
bill that is identical to that passed at the
outset of the 14 day period. In such
event that bill shall be deemed to have
had second passage and will become ef
fective 10 days after transmittal and
publication in the manner provided in
paragraph b. The ten day period re
ferred to in this paragraph may be shor
tened with the written concurrence of
the President of the University.

apply during Summer Quarter nor dur
ing recesses during the academic year.

that when the final day of such period
falls on a Saturday, Sunday or holiday
the period shall be deemed to extend to
the next working day.
2. Procedures for Enactment of Interim
Legislation
a. When in its opinion an emergency exists
that requires promulgation of a regula
tion, including change or repeal of an
existing regulation, in less time than is
required under the procedure set forth
in section D.l, the SCLC, with the writ
ten consent of the President of the Uni
versity, may promulgate an interim rule
to. become effective immediately upon

b. When in his opinion an emergency exists
that requires the promulgation of a reg
ulation, including change or repeal of an
existing regulation, in less time than is
required under the procedure set forth
in section D.l, the President of the Uni
versity may promulgate an interim regu
lation to become effective immediately
upon publication, provided the Presi
dent shall first consult with as many
members of the SCLC as practicable
and, if time permits, shall first afford
the SCLC an opportunity to act under
section D.2a.
c. Interim regulations promulgated under
section D.2a shall expire 90 days after
publication unless within that period
the SCLC has taken steps to promulgate
a regulation in the same area under the

the interim regulation every 30 days un
til SCLC acts on it. He shall inform the
SCLC of each promulgation.
112. Whenever the SCLC promulgates an in
terim regulation under section D.2a or
the President promulgates an interim
regulation under D.2b or D.2e, copies

posals are approved by LASSU, the Aca
demic Council, and the President, ex
cept that no amendment changing the

students shall occur either (i) when a majority of
those voting, provided at least 10% of the regis
tered matriculated students vote on the issue,

IV RESIDUAL AUTHORITY OF THE PRESI
DENT
Although nothing in these articles shall be
deemed to contravene or limit the authority
and power of the President to promulgate and
enforce regulations governing student conduct at
Stanford University, except in extraordinary cir
cumstances the SCLC and the SJC shall have
primary responsibility for promulgating such reg
ulations and adjudicating violations thereof.
The following is a copy of the "Leg
islative and Judicial Charter of 1968," in
cluding the recommendations for amend
ment made to the three constituencies by
the Committee of Fifteen. These appear in
bold type.
The recommendation?- for amendment
will be on the ballot in the election to be
held Tuesday and Wednesday, February
18 and 19.
I. STUDENT CONDUCT LEGISLATIVE
COUNCIL
A. JURISDICTION
1. The jurisdiction of the Student Conduct
Legislative Council to promulgate legis
lation shall extend to matters of student
conduct involving the Honor Code and
to such non-academic conduct as may
warrant disciplinary sanctions against in
dividual students or against membership
organizations of students. This author
ity shall include the promulgation of
statements declaring that specified
forms of non-academic conduct are not
the proper subject of University control
whether because the conduct is deemed
to be proper in a University or because
the conduct, though illegal, should con
cern only non-University authorities.
2. The SCLC is empowered to establish an
array of disciplinary sanctions for use
by the Stanford Judicial Council and to
prescribe specific maximum penalties
for first violations of individual regula
tions by students who were not under
disciplinary sanction at the time of the
violation. In no event shall the SCLC
establish minimum penalties.
3. Legislation promulgated by the SCLC
shall prevail over inconsistent regula
tions developed by other groups or indi
viduals in the University except as pro
vided in Article IV. These groups or in
dividuals that in the past have been
authorized to develop specialized stu
dent conduct regulations shall continue
to have such authority unless and until
the SCLC explicitly asserts its jurisdic
tion over such matters and legislates in
the specific area. The SCLC shall be em
powered to delegate authority to issue
regulations controlling such specialized
conduct to other groups or individuals
under such conditions and for such per
iods of time as the SCLC may deem ap
propriate.
4. Regulations of the SCLC shall remain in
effect during vacations and through the
summer.
B. COMPOSITION
1. Composition of the Student Conduct
Legislative Council shall be:
a. Six faculty members chosen by the Pres
ident from a panel of 12 nominees sub

from among the appointed faculty
members. In the event the SCLC finds
that a faculty vacancy exists, the Presi
dent shall choose an alternate from
nominations submitted by the appropri
ate agency of the Academic Council.
[In order to eliminate the requirement that
the President of the University shall appoint the
faculty members (other than the Chairman) of
the two councils from lists of nominees submit
ted by the Academic Senate, we recommend that
Article I, section 13.1 a be amended to read as
follows: Six faculty members appointed by the
Academic Senate. The President will select a
Chairman from among the appointed faculty
members. In the event the SCLC finds that a
faculty vacancy exists, the Academic Senate will
appoint an alternate.]

Stanford University. Runners-up in
elections for student members shall
be declared alternates, to fill any stu
dent vacancy.

munication or on its own initiative the
SCLC may present a draft or alternative
drafts of proposed legislation. Such
draft presentations shall be transmitted
to the President of the University, the

appropriate agency of the Academic
Council and the Legislature of the Asso
ciated Students. SCLC shall further ar
range that such draft presentations be
published so as to be made available to
all members of the Stanford commu
nity.
c. In addition to the text of the proposed
draft or drafts, the presentations shall
set a deadline at least 21 days from the
date of publication within which any
interested party may communicate in
writing his views on the drafts as well as
any suggested revisions. In its discretion,
the SCLC may hold hearings.
d. After the passage of at least 21, but not
more than 60, days from the publica
tion of the proposed draft or drafts, the
SCLC may vote first passage of a rule
germane to the subject covered in the
original presentation. It shall then trans
mit and publish such adopted text in
the manner provided in paragraph b.
Such publication shall be accompanied
by a notice giving all interested parties
at least 14 days to file written views
with SCLC. In its discretion SCLC may
also hold hearings.
e. If, after the passage of at least 14, but
not more than 60, days from publica
tion of notice of first passage, the SCLC
adopts a measure that is identical to
that passed at the first reading, this shall
be considered second passage and the
rule shall become effective 10 days after
transmittal and publication in the man
ner provided in paragraph b.
If, however, the text is not identical to
that approved on first reading, passage
shall be considered a first passage and
the 14 day notice period provided in
paragraph d. shall again apply. Such 14
day periods shall continue to apply until
SCLC, after a 14 day notice, passes a
bill that is identical to that passed at the
outset of the 14 day period. In such
event that bill shall be deemed to have
had second passage and will become ef
fective 10 days after transmittal and
publication in the manner provided in
paragraph b. The ten day period re
ferred to in this paragraph may be shor
tened with the written concurrence of
the President of the University.
112. Although the SCLC is empowered to
hold open meetings and hearings on gen
eral subjects without prior submission
of proposed drafts, such meetings shall
not constitute a presentation setting in

that when the final day of such period
falls on a Saturday, Sunday or holiday
the period shall be deemed to extend to
the next working day.
2. Procedures for Enactment of Interim
Legislation
a. When in its opinion an emergency exists
that requires promulgation of a regula
tion, including change or repeal of an
existing regulation, in less time than is
required under the procedure set forth
in section D.l, the SCLC, with the writ
ten consent of the President of the Uni
versity, may promulgate an interim rule
to. become effective immediately upon

tion D.l have not been fulfilled.
b. When in his opinion an emergency exists
that requires the promulgation of a reg
ulation, including change or repeal of an
existing regulation, in less time than is
required under the procedure set forth
in section D.l, the President of the Uni
versity may promulgate an interim regu
lation to become effective immediately
upon publication, provided the Presi
dent shall first consult with as many
members of the SCLC as practicable
and, if time permits, shall first afford
the SCLC an opportunity to act under
section D.2a.
c. Interim regulations promulgated under
section D.2a shall expire 90 days after
publication unless within that period
the SCLC has taken steps to promulgate
a regulation in the same area under the

remain in effect until the conclusion of
the section D.l procedure.
d. An interim regulation promulgated by
the President under section D.2b shall
remain in effect for 90 days or until it is
repealed or amended by the SCLC,

the interim regulation every 30 days un
til SCLC acts on it. He shall inform the
SCLC of each promulgation.
112. Whenever the SCLC promulgates an in
terim regulation under section D.2a or
the President promulgates an interim
regulation under D.2b or D.2e, copies
shall be sent to the appropriate agency
of the Academic Council and the Legis
lature of the Associated Students and

The following is a copy of the "Leg

cluding the recommendations for amend
ment made to the three constituencies by
the Committee of Fifteen. These appear in
bold type.
The recommendation?- for amendment
will be on the ballot in the election to be

18 and 19.
I. STUDENT CONDUCT LEGISLATIVE
COUNCIL
A. JURISDICTION
1. The jurisdiction of the Student Conduct
Legislative Council to promulgate legis
lation shall extend to matters of student
conduct involving the Honor Code and
to such non-academic conduct as may
warrant disciplinary sanctions against in
dividual students or against membership
organizations of students. This author
ity shall include the promulgation of
statements declaring that specified
forms of non-academic conduct are not
the proper subject of University control
whether because the conduct is deemed
to be proper in a University or because
the conduct, though illegal, should con
cern only non-University authorities.

establish minimum penalties.
3. Legislation promulgated by the SCLC

dent conduct regulations shall continue
to have such authority unless and until
the SCLC explicitly asserts its jurisdic
tion over such matters and legislates in
the specific area. The SCLC shall be em

tened with the written concurrence of
the President of the University.

ulation, including change or repeal of an
existing regulation, in less time than is
required under the procedure set forth
in section D.l, the President of the Uni
versity may promulgate an interim regu
lation to become effective immediately
upon publication, provided the Presi

offenses committed outside the Univer
sity campus except during participation
in a University activity, unless such con

However, if a student's conduct on or
off the campus calls into question the
student's membership in the educational
community, either because he has gross
ly violated elemental standards of be

published so as to be made available to
all members of the Stanford commu

be considered second passage and the
rule shall become effective 10 days after
transmittal and publication in the man
ner provided in paragraph b.
If, however, the text is not identical to
that approved on first reading, passage
shall be considered a first passage and
the 14 day notice period provided in
paragraph d. shall again apply. Such 14
day periods shall continue to apply until
SCLC, after a 14 day notice, passes a
bill that is identical to that passed at the
outset of the 14 day period. In such
event that bill shall be deemed to have
had second passage and will become ef
fective 10 days after transmittal and
publication in the manner provided in
paragraph b. The ten day period re
ferred to in this paragraph may be shor
tened with the written concurrence of
the President of the University.

falls on a Saturday, Sunday or holiday
the period shall be deemed to extend to
the next working day.

However, if a student's conduct on or
off the campus calls into question the
student's membership in the educational
community, either because he has gross
ly violated elemental standards of be

choose and rank at least four alternates,
who shall become members in the event
the SJC finds that a student vacancy

imposed in addition to civil or criminal
penalties. This limitation shall not apply
when SJC proceedings are deemed
necessary by the SJC to protect the
University community from risk of
harm. Nothing in this paragraph, how
ever, shall be interpreted as barring or

and shall go into effect when such pro
posals are approved by LASSU, the Aca
demic Council, and the President, ex
cept that no amendment changing the
membership of either Council shall go
into effect until the time of the next
regular selection of members.
[In order to make it easier for the student
body to initiate amendments of the Charter, we
recommend that Article 111, section A.la be
amended to read as follows: A request by the
students shall occur either (i) when a majority of
those voting, provided at least 10% of the regis
tered matriculated students vote on the issue,
cast affirmative votes in a special referendum
organized by LASSU, to the following proposi
tion: "The Committee of Fifteen is requested to
examine the prior legislation concerning the
SCLC and the SJC and to recommend such
amendments as may be agreed upon by the Com
mittee in order to achieve the following pur
poses: ..." or (ii) when petitions, including the
signatures of at least 5% of the registered matric
ulated students and setting forth the proposition
presented above, are delivered to the Committee
of Fifteen.)

shall occur when a majority of those
voting, but not less than 20% of the
membership of the Academic Council,
cast affirmative votes to the proposition
presented above.
c. A request by the administration shall
s occur when the President informs the
Chairman of the Committee of Fifteen
in writing that he desires action toward
amendment.
d. A request by the SCLC shall occur when
its members cast seven affirmative votes
to the proposition presented above.
e. A request by the SJC shall occur when
its members case a majority of affirma

2. If amendment by the procedure de
scribed in Article 111, section A.l should
result in termination of the SCLC:
a. That termination shall take effect on
September 1 of the following academic
year.
b. That termination shall not nullify or
otherwise affect regulations previously
adopted by SCLC under its regular pro
cedures.
3. If amendment by the procedure de
scribed in Article 111, section A.l should
result in termination of the SJC:
a. The Committee of Fifteen shall without
further request from any constituency
adopt the problem of establishing an
acceptable judiciary body as its first or
der of business.
b. The SJC shall continue to operate under
the then current legislation governing its
existence until a substitute judicial law
has been approved by the three con
stituencies, or for a period of 150 days,
whichever provides the shorter period.
IV RESIDUAL AUTHORITY OF THE PRESI
DENT
Although nothing in these articles shall be
deemed to contravene or limit the authority
and power of the President to promulgate and
enforce regulations governing student conduct at
Stanford University, except in extraordinary cir
cumstances the SCLC and the SJC shall have
primary responsibility for promulgating such reg
ulations and adjudicating violations thereof.
The following is a copy of the "Leg
islative and Judicial Charter of 1968," in
cluding the recommendations for amend
ment made to the three constituencies by
the Committee of Fifteen. These appear in
bold type.
The recommendation?- for amendment
will be on the ballot in the election to be
held Tuesday and Wednesday, February
18 and 19.
I. STUDENT CONDUCT LEGISLATIVE
COUNCIL
A. JURISDICTION
1. The jurisdiction of the Student Conduct
Legislative Council to promulgate legis
lation shall extend to matters of student
conduct involving the Honor Code and
to such non-academic conduct as may
warrant disciplinary sanctions against in
dividual students or against membership
organizations of students. This author
ity shall include the promulgation of
statements declaring that specified
forms of non-academic conduct are not
the proper subject of University control
whether because the conduct is deemed
to be proper in a University or because
the conduct, though illegal, should con
cern only non-University authorities.
2. The SCLC is empowered to establish an
array of disciplinary sanctions for use
by the Stanford Judicial Council and to
prescribe specific maximum penalties
for first violations of individual regula
tions by students who were not under
disciplinary sanction at the time of the
violation. In no event shall the SCLC
establish minimum penalties.
3. Legislation promulgated by the SCLC
shall prevail over inconsistent regula
tions developed by other groups or indi
viduals in the University except as pro
vided in Article IV. These groups or in
dividuals that in the past have been
authorized to develop specialized stu
dent conduct regulations shall continue
to have such authority unless and until
the SCLC explicitly asserts its jurisdic
tion over such matters and legislates in
the specific area. The SCLC shall be em
powered to delegate authority to issue
regulations controlling such specialized
conduct to other groups or individuals
under such conditions and for such per
iods of time as the SCLC may deem ap
propriate.
4. Regulations of the SCLC shall remain in
effect during vacations and through the
summer.
B. COMPOSITION

from among the appointed faculty
members. In the event the SCLC finds
that a faculty vacancy exists, the Presi
dent shall choose an alternate from
nominations submitted by the appropri
ate agency of the Academic Council.
[In order to eliminate the requirement that
the President of the University shall appoint the
faculty members (other than the Chairman) of
the two councils from lists of nominees submit
ted by the Academic Senate, we recommend that
Article I, section 13.1 a be amended to read as
follows: Six faculty members appointed by the
Academic Senate. The President will select a
Chairman from among the appointed faculty
members. In the event the SCLC finds that a
faculty vacancy exists, the Academic Senate will
appoint an alternate.]

and shall go into effect when such pro
posals are approved by LASSU, the Aca
demic Council, and the President, ex
cept that no amendment changing the
membership of either Council shall go
into effect until the time of the next
regular selection of members.
[In order to make it easier for the student
body to initiate amendments of the Charter, we
recommend that Article 111, section A.la be
amended to read as follows: A request by the
students shall occur either (i) when a majority of
those voting, provided at least 10% of the regis
tered matriculated students vote on the issue,
cast affirmative votes in a special referendum
organized by LASSU, to the following proposi

examine the prior legislation concerning the
SCLC and the SJC and to recommend such
amendments as may be agreed upon by the Com
mittee in order to achieve the following pur
poses: ..." or (ii) when petitions, including the
signatures of at least 5% of the registered matric
ulated students and setting forth the proposition
presented above, are delivered to the Committee
of Fifteen.)

shall occur when a majority of those
voting, but not less than 20% of the
membership of the Academic Council,
cast affirmative votes to the proposition
presented above.
c. A request by the administration shall
s occur when the President informs the
Chairman of the Committee of Fifteen
in writing that he desires action toward
amendment.
d. A request by the SCLC shall occur when
its members cast seven affirmative votes
to the proposition presented above.
e. A request by the SJC shall occur when
its members case a majority of affirma
tive votes to the proposition presented

2. If amendment by the procedure de
scribed in Article 111, section A.l should
result in termination of the SCLC:
a. That termination shall take effect on
September 1 of the following academic
year.
b. That termination shall not nullify or
otherwise affect regulations previously
adopted by SCLC under its regular pro
cedures.
3. If amendment by the procedure de
scribed in Article 111, section A.l should
result in termination of the SJC:
a. The Committee of Fifteen shall without
further request from any constituency
adopt the problem of establishing an
acceptable judiciary body as its first or
der of business.
b. The SJC shall continue to operate under
the then current legislation governing its
existence until a substitute judicial law
has been approved by the three con
stituencies, or for a period of 150 days,
whichever provides the shorter period.
IV RESIDUAL AUTHORITY OF THE PRESI
DENT
Although nothing in these articles shall be
deemed to contravene or limit the authority
and power of the President to promulgate and
enforce regulations governing student conduct at
Stanford University, except in extraordinary cir
cumstances the SCLC and the SJC shall have
primary responsibility for promulgating such reg
ulations and adjudicating violations thereof.
The following is a copy of the "Leg
islative and Judicial Charter of 1968," in
cluding the recommendations for amend
ment made to the three constituencies by
the Committee of Fifteen. These appear in
bold type.
The recommendation?- for amendment
will be on the ballot in the election to be
held Tuesday and Wednesday, February
18 and 19.
I. STUDENT CONDUCT LEGISLATIVE
COUNCIL
A. JURISDICTION
1. The jurisdiction of the Student Conduct
Legislative Council to promulgate legis
lation shall extend to matters of student
conduct involving the Honor Code and
to such non-academic conduct as may
warrant disciplinary sanctions against in
dividual students or against membership
organizations of students. This author
ity shall include the promulgation of
statements declaring that specified
forms of non-academic conduct are not
the proper subject of University control
whether because the conduct is deemed
to be proper in a University or because
the conduct, though illegal, should con
cern only non-University authorities.
2. The SCLC is empowered to establish an
array of disciplinary sanctions for use
by the Stanford Judicial Council and to
prescribe specific maximum penalties
for first violations of individual regula
tions by students who were not under
disciplinary sanction at the time of the
violation. In no event shall the SCLC
establish minimum penalties.
3. Legislation promulgated by the SCLC
shall prevail over inconsistent regula
tions developed by other groups or indi
viduals in the University except as pro
vided in Article IV. These groups or in
dividuals that in the past have been
authorized to develop specialized stu
dent conduct regulations shall continue
to have such authority unless and until
the SCLC explicitly asserts its jurisdic
tion over such matters and legislates in
the specific area. The SCLC shall be em
powered to delegate authority to issue
regulations controlling such specialized
conduct to other groups or individuals
under such conditions and for such per
iods of time as the SCLC may deem ap
propriate.
4. Regulations of the SCLC shall remain in
effect during vacations and through the
summer.
B. COMPOSITION

from among the appointed faculty
members. In the event the SCLC finds
that a faculty vacancy exists, the Presi
dent shall choose an alternate from
nominations submitted by the appropri
ate agency of the Academic Council.
[In order to eliminate the requirement that
the President of the University shall appoint the
faculty members (other than the Chairman) of
the two councils from lists of nominees submit
ted by the Academic Senate, we recommend that
Article I, section 13.1 a be amended to read as
follows: Six faculty members appointed by the
Academic Senate. The President will select a
Chairman from among the appointed faculty
members. In the event the SCLC finds that a
faculty vacancy exists, the Academic Senate will
appoint an alternate.]

SCLC may present a draft or alternative
drafts of proposed legislation. Such
draft presentations shall be transmitted
to the President of the University, the

appropriate agency of the Academic
Council and the Legislature of the Asso

range that such draft presentations be
published so as to be made available to
all members of the Stanford commu

more than 60, days from the publica
tion of the proposed draft or drafts, the
SCLC may vote first passage of a rule
germane to the subject covered in the
original presentation. It shall then trans
mit and publish such adopted text in
the manner provided in paragraph b.
Such publication shall be accompanied
by a notice giving all interested parties
at least 14 days to file written views
with SCLC. In its discretion SCLC may
also hold hearings.
e. If, after the passage of at least 14, but
not more than 60, days from publica
tion of notice of first passage, the SCLC
adopts a measure that is identical to

be considered second passage and the
rule shall become effective 10 days after
transmittal and publication in the man
ner provided in paragraph b.
If, however, the text is not identical to
that approved on first reading, passage
shall be considered a first passage and
the 14 day notice period provided in
paragraph d. shall again apply. Such 14
day periods shall continue to apply until
SCLC, after a 14 day notice, passes a
bill that is identical to that passed at the
outset of the 14 day period. In such
event that bill shall be deemed to have
had second passage and will become ef
fective 10 days after transmittal and
publication in the manner provided in
paragraph b. The ten day period re
ferred to in this paragraph may be shor
tened with the written concurrence of
the President of the University.

eral subjects without prior submission
of proposed drafts, such meetings shall
not constitute a presentation setting in

falls on a Saturday, Sunday or holiday
the period shall be deemed to extend to
the next working day.
2. Procedures for Enactment of Interim
Legislation
a. When in its opinion an emergency exists
that requires promulgation of a regula
tion, including change or repeal of an
existing regulation, in less time than is
required under the procedure set forth
in section D.l, the SCLC, with the writ
ten consent of the President of the Uni
versity, may promulgate an interim rule
to. become effective immediately upon

tion D.l have not been fulfilled.
b. When in his opinion an emergency exists
that requires the promulgation of a reg
ulation, including change or repeal of an
existing regulation, in less time than is
required under the procedure set forth
in section D.l, the President of the Uni
versity may promulgate an interim regu
lation to become effective immediately
upon publication, provided the Presi
dent shall first consult with as many
members of the SCLC as practicable
and, if time permits, shall first afford
the SCLC an opportunity to act under
section D.2a.
c. Interim regulations promulgated under
section D.2a shall expire 90 days after
publication unless within that period
the SCLC has taken steps to promulgate
a regulation in the same area under the
procedure specified in section D.l, in
which case the interim regulation may
remain in effect until the conclusion of
the section D.l procedure.
d. An interim regulation promulgated by
the President under section D.2b shall
remain in effect for 90 days or until it is
repealed or amended by the SCLC,
whichever occurs first.

in section D.l or, with the written con
currence of the President, SCLC may
proceed under section D.2a.

promulgated under section D.2b, 90
days expire with no action by the
SCLC, the President may repromulgate
the interim regulation every 30 days un
til SCLC acts on it. He shall inform the
SCLC of each promulgation.
112. Whenever the SCLC promulgates an in
terim regulation under section D.2a or
the President promulgates an interim
regulation under D.2b or D.2e, copies
shall be sent to the appropriate agency
of the Academic Council and the Legis
lature of the Associated Students and
the regulation shall be published as gen
erally and as quickly as practicable. As

penalties. This limitation shall not apply
when SJC proceedings are deemed
necessary by the SJC to protect the
University community from risk of

IV RESIDUAL AUTHORITY OF THE PRESI
DENT
Although nothing in these articles shall be
deemed to contravene or limit the authority
and power of the President to promulgate and
enforce regulations governing student conduct at
Stanford University, except in extraordinary cir
cumstances the SCLC and the SJC shall have
primary responsibility for promulgating such reg
ulations and adjudicating violations thereof.
The following is a copy of the "Leg
islative and Judicial Charter of 1968," in
cluding the recommendations for amend
ment made to the three constituencies by
the Committee of Fifteen. These appear in
bold type.
The recommendation?- for amendment
will be on the ballot in the election to be
held Tuesday and Wednesday, February
18 and 19.
I. STUDENT CONDUCT LEGISLATIVE
COUNCIL
A. JURISDICTION
1. The jurisdiction of the Student Conduct
Legislative Council to promulgate legis
lation shall extend to matters of student
conduct involving the Honor Code and
to such non-academic conduct as may
warrant disciplinary sanctions against in
dividual students or against membership
organizations of students. This author
ity shall include the promulgation of
statements declaring that specified
forms of non-academic conduct are not
the proper subject of University control
whether because the conduct is deemed
to be proper in a University or because
the conduct, though illegal, should con
cern only non-University authorities.
2. The SCLC is empowered to establish an
array of disciplinary sanctions for use
by the Stanford Judicial Council and to
prescribe specific maximum penalties
for first violations of individual regula
tions by students who were not under
disciplinary sanction at the time of the
violation. In no event shall the SCLC
establish minimum penalties.
3. Legislation promulgated by the SCLC
shall prevail over inconsistent regula
tions developed by other groups or indi
viduals in the University except as pro
vided in Article IV. These groups or in
dividuals that in the past have been
authorized to develop specialized stu
dent conduct regulations shall continue
to have such authority unless and until
the SCLC explicitly asserts its jurisdic
tion over such matters and legislates in
the specific area. The SCLC shall be em
powered to delegate authority to issue
regulations controlling such specialized
conduct to other groups or individuals
under such conditions and for such per
iods of time as the SCLC may deem ap
propriate.
4. Regulations of the SCLC shall remain in
effect during vacations and through the
summer.
B. COMPOSITION
1. Composition of the Student Conduct
Legislative Council shall be:
a. Six faculty members chosen by the Pres
ident from a panel of 12 nominees sub
mitted by the appropriate agency of the

The President will select a Chairman
from among the appointed faculty
members. In the event the SCLC finds
that a faculty vacancy exists, the Presi
dent shall choose an alternate from
nominations submitted by the appropri
ate agency of the Academic Council.
[In order to eliminate the requirement that
the President of the University shall appoint the
faculty members (other than the Chairman) of
the two councils from lists of nominees submit
ted by the Academic Senate, we recommend that
Article I, section 13.1 a be amended to read as
follows: Six faculty members appointed by the
Academic Senate. The President will select a
Chairman from among the appointed faculty
members. In the event the SCLC finds that a
faculty vacancy exists, the Academic Senate will
appoint an alternate.]
b. Five student members chosen as fol

dent body at large by a system of
proportional representation from a
slate of nominees who have qualified
by filing petitions signed by 25 stu

registered, matriculated students at
Stanford University. Runners-up in
elections for student members shall
be declared alternates, to fill any stu
dent vacancy.
c. The Dean of Students or his designee
(cjc officio with no vote).
2. The term of office for all voting mem

duct then in effect.
D. Procedure for Enactment of Legislation by
the Student Conduct Legislative Council

munication or on its own initiative the
SCLC may present a draft or alternative
drafts of proposed legislation. Such
draft presentations shall be transmitted
to the President of the University, the

appropriate agency of the Academic
Council and the Legislature of the Asso
ciated Students. SCLC shall further ar
range that such draft presentations be
published so as to be made available to
all members of the Stanford commu
nity.
c. In addition to the text of the proposed
draft or drafts, the presentations shall
set a deadline at least 21 days from the
date of publication within which any
interested party may communicate in
writing his views on the drafts as well as
any suggested revisions. In its discretion,
the SCLC may hold hearings.
d. After the passage of at least 21, but not
more than 60, days from the publica
tion of the proposed draft or drafts, the
SCLC may vote first passage of a rule
germane to the subject covered in the
original presentation. It shall then trans
mit and publish such adopted text in
the manner provided in paragraph b.
Such publication shall be accompanied
by a notice giving all interested parties
at least 14 days to file written views
with SCLC. In its discretion SCLC may
also hold hearings.
e. If, after the passage of at least 14, but
not more than 60, days from publica
tion of notice of first passage, the SCLC
adopts a measure that is identical to
that passed at the first reading, this shall
be considered second passage and the
rule shall become effective 10 days after
transmittal and publication in the man
ner provided in paragraph b.
If, however, the text is not identical to
that approved on first reading, passage
shall be considered a first passage and
the 14 day notice period provided in
paragraph d. shall again apply. Such 14
day periods shall continue to apply until
SCLC, after a 14 day notice, passes a
bill that is identical to that passed at the
outset of the 14 day period. In such
event that bill shall be deemed to have
had second passage and will become ef
fective 10 days after transmittal and
publication in the manner provided in
paragraph b. The ten day period re
ferred to in this paragraph may be shor
tened with the written concurrence of
the President of the University.
112. Although the SCLC is empowered to
hold open meetings and hearings on gen
eral subjects without prior submission
of proposed drafts, such meetings shall
not constitute a presentation setting in
motion the procedure specified in this
section D.lb.
g. All time periods referred to in section
D.lb.shall apply only when the Univer
sity is in regular session and shall not
apply during Summer Quarter nor dur
ing recesses during the academic year.

time periods referred to above except
that when the final day of such period
falls on a Saturday, Sunday or holiday
the period shall be deemed to extend to
the next working day.
2. Procedures for Enactment of Interim
Legislation
a. When in its opinion an emergency exists
that requires promulgation of a regula
tion, including change or repeal of an
existing regulation, in less time than is
required under the procedure set forth
in section D.l, the SCLC, with the writ
ten consent of the President of the Uni
versity, may promulgate an interim rule
to. become effective immediately upon
publication though requirements of sec
tion D.l have not been fulfilled.
b. When in his opinion an emergency exists
that requires the promulgation of a reg
ulation, including change or repeal of an
existing regulation, in less time than is
required under the procedure set forth
in section D.l, the President of the Uni
versity may promulgate an interim regu
lation to become effective immediately
upon publication, provided the Presi
dent shall first consult with as many
members of the SCLC as practicable
and, if time permits, shall first afford
the SCLC an opportunity to act under
section D.2a.
c. Interim regulations promulgated under
section D.2a shall expire 90 days after
publication unless within that period
the SCLC has taken steps to promulgate
a regulation in the same area under the
procedure specified in section D.l, in
which case the interim regulation may
remain in effect until the conclusion of
the section D.l procedure.
d. An interim regulation promulgated by
the President under section D.2b shall
remain in effect for 90 days or until it is
repealed or amended by the SCLC,
whichever occurs first.

in section D.l or, with the written con
currence of the President, SCLC may
proceed under section D.2a.
e. If in the case of an interim regulation
promulgated under section D.2b, 90
days expire with no action by the
SCLC, the President may repromulgate
the interim regulation every 30 days un
til SCLC acts on it. He shall inform the
SCLC of each promulgation.
112. Whenever the SCLC promulgates an in
terim regulation under section D.2a or
the President promulgates an interim
regulation under D.2b or D.2e, copies
shall be sent to the appropriate agency
of the Academic Council and the Legis
lature of the Associated Students and
the regulation shall be published as gen
erally and as quickly as practicable. As
soon thereafter as practicable the regula
tion shall be published as provided in

sideration of areas in which there are cur
rently conflicts of law.

2. The SJC shall not have jurisdiction over
offenses committed outside the Univer
sity campus except during participation
in a University activity, unless such con
duct is a violation of a specific Univer
sity regulation.
However, if a student's conduct on or
off the campus calls into question the
student's membership in the educational
community, either because he has gross
ly violated elemental standards of be
havior requisite to the maintenance of

his continued presence would adversely
affect the ability of others to pursue
their educational goals, he may be
found ineligible to continue as a mem
ber of the University community only
