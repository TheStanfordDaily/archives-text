# The 						Dream Fulfilled: Tribe 57, SC 56
## 
### WELLS SHOEMAKER 
Stanford swimmers derailed an
undefeated USC aquatic express
that ran twelve years and covered
108 dual meets. Southern Cal
fell, 57-56, at Stanford's Encina
Pool last Saturday.
John Ferris and Ted Nichols
each won a pair of events for
Stanford, but this was a meet
where losing a single third place
would have turned Saturday into
a cold and dismal rainy after
noon . . .number 109.
Preseason rankings placed
Indiana number one and USC
second ahead of Stanford. Stan
ford travels to meet fourth-ranked
Yale at New Haven this Friday
night.
Say See Saw
Stanford took the opening
event, the medley relay, but an
onslaught of Trojan distance free
stylers put USC out in front,
18-16. The Indians took over and
barged out to a 42-28 lead before
Troy again closed the gap.
Stanford clinging to a bare
49-48 lead, Nichols and Norris
Heckel went 1-2 in the 3-meter
diving to clinch the meet before
the freestyle relay.
The medley relay was a key
note event for Stanford. Fred
Haywood outpaced USC's lanky
Mark Mader with a 53.8 back
stroke leg. Converted sprinter
Morgan Manning held his own
with a hot 1:01 breaststroke, and
then John Ferris dropped the
bomb.
The sophomore butterflier
screamed his leg in 49.9 to move
two body lengths out in front and
Bob Jamison iced it with a 46.9

freestyle anchor leg. The Indians'
3:31.6 is the fastest time so far in
the country by a modest three
seconds.
Trojans Tie It Up
The Trojans promptly neutral
ized the Indian advantage as Andy
Strenk and Greg Fink went 1-2 in
the 1000 freestyle in 9:51, push
ing Stanford's Brent Berk back to
third in 9:54. All three times
bettered the fastest recorded var
sity time this season.
USC's NCAA champion Greg
Charlton carried the 200 freestyle
as expected, but Luis Nicolao and
Jamie Knorr nailed down the next
two places. Knorr hit his lifetime
best by a second to out-touch
USC's second man on a judges' de
cision.
USC's Dan Frawley took the 50
free in 21.6, finally breaking a
pool record set by Steve Clark
nine years ago. Once again, the
Indians picked up the all im
portant next two places as Rick
Eagleston and Jeff Hammett
turned in season's best perform
ances.
Trailing by two points, Ferris
and team captain Pete Siebert
broke Stanford into the lead to
stay with a no-questions-asked 1-2
sweep of the 200 individual med
ley.
Divers Like McDermott
All eyes switched to the
1-meter diving. Nichols, diving
with one knee taped, and Heckel,
performing with torn shoulder lig
aments, squeezed USC's Pac-8
runner-up Dick McDermott into
third place.
Olympic bronze medalist Ferris
and Trojan NCAA champion Phil

Houser then locked horns in one
of several critical individual duels
of the meet, the 200 butterfly.
Ferris took out his 100 well ahead
of his Trojan opponent, but
Houser turned it on to catch Fer
ris with 25 yards to go.
Ferris burned the whole last
length to clip the Trojan and un
couple most of 2000 Encina Pool
fans.
The next race turned into
another thriller as Jamison held
off a last ditch challenge by Pan
Am champ Don Havens to register
a first for Stanford in the 100
freestyle.
Counter Offensive
The Stanford holiday was
short-lived as USC's American
record holder Mark Mader caught
Haywood from behind in the 200
backstroke, and the Trojan second
man, Roger Lyon, beat Siebert for
third place.
Charlton pickad up his second
first of the afternoon with a
4:44.0 effort in the 500 free. Few
people watched the leader, how
ever, as the real battle was for
second place between Berk and
USC's Fink.
After pacing nearly evenly
through the first half of the race,
Fink made his move and put near

ly a body length between himself
and the trailing Indian. Berk nar
rowed the gap slowly, and with 50
yards to go burst all-out to over
haul Fink with less than 10 yards
to go.
USC turned the tables in the
next event, the 200 breaststroke.
John Derr overtook Stanford's
Tag Leonard in the last few
seconds to complete a 1-2 Trojan
sweep.
Stanford freshman Dave Schill
ing, owner of the nation's fastest
time of 2:12.1, watched from the
stands as SC's John Ludwig won
the race in 2:16.0.
Nitty Gritty
USC's breaststroke rally
brought the Trojans up to 49-48,
a telling point behind with diving
and the free relay to come.
Nichols and Heckel dove like
170 pound angels. Nichols, after a
disappointing 2% gainer, laced
every optional for sevens, eights,
and nines. Nichols climaxed his
meet with a near-perfect triple
twisting IVi somersault and a pool
record score of 313 points.
Heckel, seemingly unbothered
by torn shoulder ligaments suf
fered last week against UCLA,
clicked on every single dive and
tucked his lifetime best perform

ance under the few thin ripples he
left on the pool.
Long before the official results
were announced, five dozen eager
pencils confirmed a 1-2 Stanford
finish, and waves of ecstasy spread
like mercury to every corner of a
reverberating pool deck. Every
corner save one.
In a proud USC tradition,
Havens barreled home on the
anchor leg of the freestyle relay to
touch out Jamison and close the
final score to 57-56.
Club
Stanford coach Jim Gaughran
took his first assisted bath since
the NCAA finals in 1967, and was
promptly joined in Lane 2 by
most of a jubilant Stanford swim
ming team and one innocent
bystander.
A soggy but eminently elated
Gaughran bubbled, "This is one of
the greatest bunch of guys I've
ever known. They came through
when we needed it, right down
the line. The divers were fantas
tic."
Peter Daland, who started the
Trojan's twelve year undefeated
reign over West Coast swimming
and built five NCAA champion
ship swimming teams since 1961,
said, "Well, this has relieved a lot

of tension on our team and our
campus."
The Season Isn't Over
"Stanford earned their victory.
We'll meet the Indians twice again
this year, and I think we're
headed toward a fine NCAA
meet." Daland may be un
accustomed to losing dual meets,
but that should have little effect
on his familiar role as premier

apple cart upsetter at collegiate
championships.
Before bumping into USC at
the Pac-8 championships in Long
Beach and the NCAA's at Indiana,
the Tribe is going to have to con
tend with a fourth-ranked,
shaved-down, psyched-up, indis
cretely optimistic, quite potential
ly dangerous bunch of Yalies this
Friday in the Eli's famed ex
hibition pool.

with a hot 1:01 breaststroke, and
then John Ferris dropped the
bomb.
The sophomore butterflier
screamed his leg in 49.9 to move
two body lengths out in front and
Bob Jamison iced it with a 46.9

freestyle anchor leg. The Indians'
3:31.6 is the fastest time so far in
the country by a modest three
seconds.
Trojans Tie It Up
The Trojans promptly neutral
ized the Indian advantage as Andy
Strenk and Greg Fink went 1-2 in
the 1000 freestyle in 9:51, push
ing Stanford's Brent Berk back to
third in 9:54. All three times
bettered the fastest recorded var
sity time this season.
USC's NCAA champion Greg
Charlton carried the 200 freestyle
as expected, but Luis Nicolao and
Jamie Knorr nailed down the next
two places. Knorr hit his lifetime
best by a second to out-touch
USC's second man on a judges' de
cision.
USC's Dan Frawley took the 50
free in 21.6, finally breaking a
pool record set by Steve Clark
nine years ago. Once again, the
Indians picked up the all im
portant next two places as Rick
Eagleston and Jeff Hammett
turned in season's best perform
ances.
Trailing by two points, Ferris
and team captain Pete Siebert
broke Stanford into the lead to
stay with a no-questions-asked 1-2
sweep of the 200 individual med
ley.
Divers Like McDermott
All eyes switched to the
1-meter diving. Nichols, diving
with one knee taped, and Heckel,
performing with torn shoulder lig
aments, squeezed USC's Pac-8
runner-up Dick McDermott into
third place.
Olympic bronze medalist Ferris
and Trojan NCAA champion Phil

Houser then locked horns in one
of several critical individual duels
of the meet, the 200 butterfly.
Ferris took out his 100 well ahead
of his Trojan opponent, but
Houser turned it on to catch Fer
ris with 25 yards to go.
Ferris burned the whole last
length to clip the Trojan and un
couple most of 2000 Encina Pool
fans.
The next race turned into
another thriller as Jamison held
off a last ditch challenge by Pan
Am champ Don Havens to register
a first for Stanford in the 100
freestyle.
Counter Offensive
The Stanford holiday was
short-lived as USC's American
record holder Mark Mader caught
Haywood from behind in the 200
backstroke, and the Trojan second
man, Roger Lyon, beat Siebert for
third place.
Charlton pickad up his second
first of the afternoon with a
4:44.0 effort in the 500 free. Few
people watched the leader, how
ever, as the real battle was for
second place between Berk and
USC's Fink.
After pacing nearly evenly
through the first half of the race,
Fink made his move and put near

ly a body length between himself
and the trailing Indian. Berk nar
rowed the gap slowly, and with 50
yards to go burst all-out to over
haul Fink with less than 10 yards
to go.
USC turned the tables in the
next event, the 200 breaststroke.
John Derr overtook Stanford's
Tag Leonard in the last few
seconds to complete a 1-2 Trojan
sweep.
Stanford freshman Dave Schill
ing, owner of the nation's fastest
time of 2:12.1, watched from the
stands as SC's John Ludwig won
the race in 2:16.0.
Nitty Gritty
USC's breaststroke rally
brought the Trojans up to 49-48,
a telling point behind with diving
and the free relay to come.
Nichols and Heckel dove like
170 pound angels. Nichols, after a
disappointing 2% gainer, laced
every optional for sevens, eights,
and nines. Nichols climaxed his
meet with a near-perfect triple
twisting IVi somersault and a pool
record score of 313 points.
Heckel, seemingly unbothered
by torn shoulder ligaments suf
fered last week against UCLA,
clicked on every single dive and
tucked his lifetime best perform

ance under the few thin ripples he
left on the pool.
Long before the official results
were announced, five dozen eager
pencils confirmed a 1-2 Stanford
finish, and waves of ecstasy spread
like mercury to every corner of a
reverberating pool deck. Every
corner save one.
In a proud USC tradition,
Havens barreled home on the
anchor leg of the freestyle relay to
touch out Jamison and close the
final score to 57-56.

Stanford coach Jim Gaughran
took his first assisted bath since
the NCAA finals in 1967, and was

A soggy but eminently elated
Gaughran bubbled, "This is one of
the greatest bunch of guys I've

Stanford swimmers derailed an
undefeated USC aquatic express
that ran twelve years and covered
108 dual meets. Southern Cal
fell, 57-56, at Stanford's Encina

John Ferris and Ted Nichols

Say See Saw
Stanford took the opening
event, the medley relay, but an
onslaught of Trojan distance free
stylers put USC out in front,
18-16. The Indians took over and
barged out to a 42-28 lead before
Troy again closed the gap.
Stanford clinging to a bare
49-48 lead, Nichols and Norris
Heckel went 1-2 in the 3-meter
diving to clinch the meet before
the freestyle relay.
The medley relay was a key

Trailing by two points, Ferris
and team captain Pete Siebert
broke Stanford into the lead to
stay with a no-questions-asked 1-2
sweep of the 200 individual med
ley.
Divers Like McDermott
All eyes switched to the
1-meter diving. Nichols, diving
with one knee taped, and Heckel,
performing with torn shoulder lig
aments, squeezed USC's Pac-8
runner-up Dick McDermott into
third place.
Olympic bronze medalist Ferris
and Trojan NCAA champion Phil

Houser then locked horns in one
of several critical individual duels
of the meet, the 200 butterfly.
Ferris took out his 100 well ahead
of his Trojan opponent, but
Houser turned it on to catch Fer
ris with 25 yards to go.
Ferris burned the whole last
length to clip the Trojan and un
couple most of 2000 Encina Pool
fans.
The next race turned into
another thriller as Jamison held
off a last ditch challenge by Pan
Am champ Don Havens to register
a first for Stanford in the 100
freestyle.
Counter Offensive
The Stanford holiday was
short-lived as USC's American
record holder Mark Mader caught
Haywood from behind in the 200
backstroke, and the Trojan second
man, Roger Lyon, beat Siebert for
third place.
Charlton pickad up his second
first of the afternoon with a
4:44.0 effort in the 500 free. Few
people watched the leader, how
ever, as the real battle was for
second place between Berk and
USC's Fink.
After pacing nearly evenly
through the first half of the race,
Fink made his move and put near

ly a body length between himself
and the trailing Indian. Berk nar
rowed the gap slowly, and with 50
yards to go burst all-out to over
haul Fink with less than 10 yards
to go.
USC turned the tables in the
next event, the 200 breaststroke.
John Derr overtook Stanford's
Tag Leonard in the last few
seconds to complete a 1-2 Trojan
sweep.
Stanford freshman Dave Schill
ing, owner of the nation's fastest
time of 2:12.1, watched from the
stands as SC's John Ludwig won
the race in 2:16.0.
Nitty Gritty
USC's breaststroke rally
brought the Trojans up to 49-48,
a telling point behind with diving
and the free relay to come.
Nichols and Heckel dove like
170 pound angels. Nichols, after a
disappointing 2% gainer, laced
every optional for sevens, eights,
and nines. Nichols climaxed his
meet with a near-perfect triple
twisting IVi somersault and a pool
record score of 313 points.
Heckel, seemingly unbothered
by torn shoulder ligaments suf
fered last week against UCLA,
clicked on every single dive and
tucked his lifetime best perform

ance under the few thin ripples he
left on the pool.
Long before the official results
were announced, five dozen eager
pencils confirmed a 1-2 Stanford
finish, and waves of ecstasy spread
like mercury to every corner of a
reverberating pool deck. Every
corner save one.
In a proud USC tradition,
Havens barreled home on the
anchor leg of the freestyle relay to
touch out Jamison and close the
final score to 57-56.
Club
Stanford coach Jim Gaughran
took his first assisted bath since
the NCAA finals in 1967, and was
promptly joined in Lane 2 by
most of a jubilant Stanford swim
ming team and one innocent
bystander.
A soggy but eminently elated
Gaughran bubbled, "This is one of
the greatest bunch of guys I've
ever known. They came through
when we needed it, right down
the line. The divers were fantas

Peter Daland, who started the
Trojan's twelve year undefeated
reign over West Coast swimming
and built five NCAA champion
ship swimming teams since 1961,
said, "Well, this has relieved a lot

of tension on our team and our

The Season Isn't Over
"Stanford earned their victory.
We'll meet the Indians twice again
this year, and I think we're

but that should have little effect
on his familiar role as premier

apple cart upsetter at collegiate

Stanford swimmers derailed an
undefeated USC aquatic express
that ran twelve years and covered
108 dual meets. Southern Cal
fell, 57-56, at Stanford's Encina
Pool last Saturday.
John Ferris and Ted Nichols
each won a pair of events for
Stanford, but this was a meet
where losing a single third place
would have turned Saturday into
a cold and dismal rainy after
noon . . .number 109.
Preseason rankings placed
Indiana number one and USC

Say See Saw
Stanford took the opening
event, the medley relay, but an
onslaught of Trojan distance free
stylers put USC out in front,
18-16. The Indians took over and
barged out to a 42-28 lead before
Troy again closed the gap.
Stanford clinging to a bare
49-48 lead, Nichols and Norris
Heckel went 1-2 in the 3-meter
diving to clinch the meet before
the freestyle relay.
The medley relay was a key
note event for Stanford. Fred
Haywood outpaced USC's lanky
Mark Mader with a 53.8 back
stroke leg. Converted sprinter
Morgan Manning held his own
with a hot 1:01 breaststroke, and
then John Ferris dropped the
bomb.
The sophomore butterflier
screamed his leg in 49.9 to move
two body lengths out in front and
Bob Jamison iced it with a 46.9

freestyle anchor leg. The Indians'
3:31.6 is the fastest time so far in
the country by a modest three
seconds.
Trojans Tie It Up
The Trojans promptly neutral
ized the Indian advantage as Andy
Strenk and Greg Fink went 1-2 in
the 1000 freestyle in 9:51, push
ing Stanford's Brent Berk back to
third in 9:54. All three times
bettered the fastest recorded var
sity time this season.
USC's NCAA champion Greg
Charlton carried the 200 freestyle
as expected, but Luis Nicolao and
Jamie Knorr nailed down the next
two places. Knorr hit his lifetime
best by a second to out-touch
USC's second man on a judges' de
cision.
USC's Dan Frawley took the 50
free in 21.6, finally breaking a
pool record set by Steve Clark
nine years ago. Once again, the
Indians picked up the all im
portant next two places as Rick
Eagleston and Jeff Hammett
turned in season's best perform

first of the afternoon with a
4:44.0 effort in the 500 free. Few
people watched the leader, how
ever, as the real battle was for
second place between Berk and
USC's Fink.
After pacing nearly evenly
through the first half of the race,
Fink made his move and put near

ly a body length between himself
and the trailing Indian. Berk nar
rowed the gap slowly, and with 50
yards to go burst all-out to over
haul Fink with less than 10 yards
to go.
USC turned the tables in the
next event, the 200 breaststroke.
John Derr overtook Stanford's
Tag Leonard in the last few
seconds to complete a 1-2 Trojan
sweep.
Stanford freshman Dave Schill
ing, owner of the nation's fastest
time of 2:12.1, watched from the
stands as SC's John Ludwig won
the race in 2:16.0.
Nitty Gritty
USC's breaststroke rally
brought the Trojans up to 49-48,
a telling point behind with diving
and the free relay to come.
Nichols and Heckel dove like
170 pound angels. Nichols, after a
disappointing 2% gainer, laced
every optional for sevens, eights,
and nines. Nichols climaxed his
meet with a near-perfect triple
twisting IVi somersault and a pool
record score of 313 points.
Heckel, seemingly unbothered
by torn shoulder ligaments suf
fered last week against UCLA,
clicked on every single dive and
tucked his lifetime best perform

ance under the few thin ripples he
left on the pool.
Long before the official results
were announced, five dozen eager
pencils confirmed a 1-2 Stanford
finish, and waves of ecstasy spread
like mercury to every corner of a
reverberating pool deck. Every
corner save one.
In a proud USC tradition,
Havens barreled home on the
anchor leg of the freestyle relay to
touch out Jamison and close the
final score to 57-56.
Club
Stanford coach Jim Gaughran
took his first assisted bath since
the NCAA finals in 1967, and was
promptly joined in Lane 2 by
most of a jubilant Stanford swim
ming team and one innocent
bystander.
A soggy but eminently elated
Gaughran bubbled, "This is one of
the greatest bunch of guys I've
ever known. They came through
when we needed it, right down
the line. The divers were fantas
tic."
Peter Daland, who started the
Trojan's twelve year undefeated
reign over West Coast swimming
and built five NCAA champion
ship swimming teams since 1961,
said, "Well, this has relieved a lot

of tension on our team and our
campus."
The Season Isn't Over
"Stanford earned their victory.
We'll meet the Indians twice again
this year, and I think we're
headed toward a fine NCAA
meet." Daland may be un
accustomed to losing dual meets,
but that should have little effect
on his familiar role as premier

apple cart upsetter at collegiate
championships.
Before bumping into USC at
the Pac-8 championships in Long
Beach and the NCAA's at Indiana,
the Tribe is going to have to con
tend with a fourth-ranked,
shaved-down, psyched-up, indis
cretely optimistic, quite potential
ly dangerous bunch of Yalies this
Friday in the Eli's famed ex
hibition pool.
Stanford swimmers derailed an
undefeated USC aquatic express
that ran twelve years and covered
108 dual meets. Southern Cal
fell, 57-56, at Stanford's Encina
Pool last Saturday.
John Ferris and Ted Nichols
each won a pair of events for
Stanford, but this was a meet
where losing a single third place
would have turned Saturday into
a cold and dismal rainy after
noon . . .number 109.
Preseason rankings placed
Indiana number one and USC
second ahead of Stanford. Stan
ford travels to meet fourth-ranked
Yale at New Haven this Friday
night.
Say See Saw
Stanford took the opening
event, the medley relay, but an
onslaught of Trojan distance free
stylers put USC out in front,
18-16. The Indians took over and
barged out to a 42-28 lead before
Troy again closed the gap.
Stanford clinging to a bare
49-48 lead, Nichols and Norris
Heckel went 1-2 in the 3-meter
diving to clinch the meet before
the freestyle relay.
The medley relay was a key
note event for Stanford. Fred
Haywood outpaced USC's lanky
Mark Mader with a 53.8 back
stroke leg. Converted sprinter
Morgan Manning held his own
with a hot 1:01 breaststroke, and
then John Ferris dropped the
bomb.
The sophomore butterflier
screamed his leg in 49.9 to move
two body lengths out in front and
Bob Jamison iced it with a 46.9

freestyle anchor leg. The Indians'
3:31.6 is the fastest time so far in
the country by a modest three
seconds.
Trojans Tie It Up
The Trojans promptly neutral
ized the Indian advantage as Andy
Strenk and Greg Fink went 1-2 in
the 1000 freestyle in 9:51, push
ing Stanford's Brent Berk back to
third in 9:54. All three times
bettered the fastest recorded var
sity time this season.
USC's NCAA champion Greg
Charlton carried the 200 freestyle
as expected, but Luis Nicolao and
Jamie Knorr nailed down the next
two places. Knorr hit his lifetime
best by a second to out-touch
USC's second man on a judges' de
cision.
USC's Dan Frawley took the 50
free in 21.6, finally breaking a
pool record set by Steve Clark
nine years ago. Once again, the
Indians picked up the all im
portant next two places as Rick
Eagleston and Jeff Hammett
turned in season's best perform
ances.
Trailing by two points, Ferris
and team captain Pete Siebert
broke Stanford into the lead to
stay with a no-questions-asked 1-2
sweep of the 200 individual med
ley.
Divers Like McDermott
All eyes switched to the
1-meter diving. Nichols, diving
with one knee taped, and Heckel,
performing with torn shoulder lig
aments, squeezed USC's Pac-8
runner-up Dick McDermott into
third place.
Olympic bronze medalist Ferris
and Trojan NCAA champion Phil

Houser then locked horns in one
of several critical individual duels
of the meet, the 200 butterfly.
Ferris took out his 100 well ahead
of his Trojan opponent, but
Houser turned it on to catch Fer
ris with 25 yards to go.
Ferris burned the whole last
length to clip the Trojan and un
couple most of 2000 Encina Pool
fans.
The next race turned into
another thriller as Jamison held
off a last ditch challenge by Pan
Am champ Don Havens to register
a first for Stanford in the 100
freestyle.
Counter Offensive
The Stanford holiday was
short-lived as USC's American
record holder Mark Mader caught
Haywood from behind in the 200
backstroke, and the Trojan second
man, Roger Lyon, beat Siebert for
third place.
Charlton pickad up his second
first of the afternoon with a
4:44.0 effort in the 500 free. Few
