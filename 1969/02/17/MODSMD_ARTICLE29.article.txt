# Indians Finally Win, Slip Past Oregons
## 
### GARY CAVALLI 
It was long time coming, but the close one 6 have finally started to
even themselves out for the Stanford basketball team.
Victimized by poor free throw shooting and abandoned by Lady
Luck in seven previous down-to-the-wire contests this year, the
Indians outfought Oregon State and Oregon for two satisfying
victories Friday and Saturday nights in Maples Pavilion.
Friday night the Indians exploded for 11 points in the final three
minutes while holding OSU to 2, for a thrilling 70-61 triumph. The
following evening the Tribe grabbed the lead after two minutes of
play and never relinquished it, en route to a right 81-76 decision over
Oregon.
The twin victories brought the seventh-place Indians' Pacific-8
ledger to an unsensational 3-6, but there is still time to make a run at
the conference's first division. If Coach Howie Dallmar can coax the
same type of team effort out of his charges in the upcoming contests
with Washington, WSU, USC and California, the Stanford five will
continue to climb the rungs of the Pac-8 ladder.
Stanford trailed throughout the first four minutes of play Friday
and the opening two minutes Saturday, but the Indians were never
headed in either game after that.
After holding a slim one-point edge at halftime over OSU, the Tribe
had built up an eight-point lead midway through the second stanza.
But the Beavers rallied to tie it at 55-all with just 4:38 to go.
Sweeping hooks from the baseline by 6-9 forward Gary Freeman and
20-foot jumpers from the top of the key by 6-5 Tim Perkins did the
most damage for the visitors. The game was tied twice more, at
57-57 and 59-59, before Stanford's decisive surge. Co-captain Don
Griffin, who paced the Tribe attack with 20 points in both games,
banked in a driving one-hander over Perkins. Then Stanford's other
co-captain, 6-5 forward Mai McElwain, sank two free throws to make
it 63-59.
But it was sophomore guard Dennis O'Neill who came up with the
clincher, making a clean steal from Perkins just over the 10-second
line and driving for a layin to give the Tribe a six-point bulge with
only 90 seconds to play. Free throws by Griffin and junior center Bill
Palmer, plus a layin by Palmer on a nice assist from O'Neill, were just
icing on the cake.
Palmer, who at 6-7 is the smallest pivotman in the league, had the
unenviable task of containing 7-0 Vic Bartolome Friday night. But Bill
turned in a great all-around effort, pulling down 10 rebounds, hitting
5 of 9 shots from the floor and scoring 12 points. Bartolome, with a 5
inch advantage in height and probably twice that in reach, managed
only 8 rebounds and hit only 6 of 16 shots.
Saturday night Palmer came back with another clutch performance,
this time against Oregon's 6-9 Stan Love. Love scored 29 points, but
they didn't come easy. The blond sophomore canned 10 of 24
attempts from the field, 9 of 10 from the line, and had 10 rebounds.
But Palmer was just as effective, with 17 points (including 7 of 9 from
the floor) and 11 caroms.
Several long jumpers by former Del Mar High School star Bill
Drozdiak and three short jumpers by Love enabled the Ducks to pull
within one, at 69-68, after Stanford had led by a half dozen
throughout most of the second half.
But Palmer muscled in a shot underneath on a fine pass from
McElwain and O'Neill followed suit on a feed from Griffin, to keep
Stanford in control. A pair of inside buckets by Love were nullfied by
two perimieter jumpers by the nonchalant Griffin, and Stanford
managed to stay in command the rest of the way.
Griffin was covered tightly outside in both games, but responded
by going to the hoop effectively. It's been said that if Don's outside
jumper is shut off, he will not look for shots inside, but Grif's
performance last weekend showed he can do it all offensively. The
6-5, Oakland product hit a wide assortment of drives, drew several
fouls underneath, and passed brilliantly.
McElwain, in addition to doing a fine board job at both ends of the
court, was particularly effective from the left corner Friday night and
in the first half Saturday. Playing very agressive defense, Mai
contributed 15 points against OSU and 11 in the Oregon win.
The performances of sophomores O'Neill and Mike Michel were
very instrumental in Stanford's double win. O'Neill scored in double
figures both nights (12 Friday, 11 Saturday), and was 9 for 14 from
the floor for the weekend.
The 6-7 Michel, gaining in experience and poise, has begun to hit
consistently with a turnaround jumper from the 15-20 foot range.
Mike rebounded well in both games, plus scoring 8 points Friday and
9 Saturday.
Last weekend tH*Â» tr| dians lost two ballgames by a total of three
points, missing 28 the foul line and making only 26. The
Tribe looked like a completely different team at the line against the
Oregon quintets, hitting 41 or 57 charity attempts. Saturday night
Stanford was deadly from all over, hitting 50 percent from the field
and a fine 79 percent (23 of 29) from the foul line.
A team that shoots that well is going to win the close ones.
