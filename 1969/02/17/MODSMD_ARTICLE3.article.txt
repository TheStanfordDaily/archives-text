# Quiet Demonstration
## Proposals Will Be Presented 
### 
Campus conservatives will present a
list of "proposals" this afternoon to the
university administration.
Members of the Young Americans for
Freedom (YAF) and Young Republi
cans (YR) have not yet revealed the
content of the proposals but will an
nounce them at 2:15 in Associate Dean
Willard Wyman's office.
Harvey Hukari, president of the con
servstive YAF group, promises that
there will be no pickets or signs; "in fact

we are trying to keep it subdued." It is
the intention of the group that the pro
posals be in contrast to the manner of
non-negotiable demands which have
been presented lately on many cam
puses, according to Hukari.
Although the exact nature of the pro
posals were not disclosed, he hinted
they will pertain to academic and disci
plinary questions. Hukari announced
plans for the quiet demonstration at last
Thursday's YR meeting.
At the meeting YR president Bill
Boyd revealed that there has been con
siderable response to the YR-Young
Americans for Freedom counter demon
stration at a recent SDS gathering.
Letters from all over the country have
been received supporting the action. A
message from a 1960 Stanford graduate,
who wrote that he wishes that he was
"back in college so I could do it all
myself," was accompanied by a $300
donation.
Poor Turnout
A failure to get a newsletter out to its
310 members resulted in the failure of
300 members to attend last Wednes
day's Young Republicans meeting. As a
result, the meeting was limited to an
nouncements of several events pertinent
to YR members.

Michael Kuhl announced the need for
about thirty YR members to work in a
special election Feb. 25 in Contra Costa
County. The election, to filJ a position
in the State Senate, is a hotly contested
one. There are now eleven Democrats
and two Republicans running.
Boyd expressed concern that he saw
no one but "student radicals on com
mittees here at Stanford." Conservative
and moderate students should become
involved in campus political activities.
"Our voice should be heard," he stated.
Harvey Hukari, editor of the Arena,
mentioned that the conservative
oriented paper is going to be distributed
weekly. But the paper is not without its
problems. There have been incidents
where bundles of the journal have been
stolen, torn up, or thrown away.
Unexpected Guest
An unexpected guest at the meeting
was Dr. Fleming, an ex-state senator
from Maui Hawaii. Dr. Fleming ex
pressed his support for the organization
and then joined, including with his
membership an $18.00 donation.
The next Young Republicans meeting
will be this Wednesday, Feb. 19. Dis
cussion will center around the group's
direction and policy for the remainder
of the quarter.

Boyd revealed that there has been con
siderable response to the YR-Young
Americans for Freedom counter demon
stration at a recent SDS gathering.
Letters from all over the country have
been received supporting the action. A
message from a 1960 Stanford graduate,
who wrote that he wishes that he was
"back in college so I could do it all
myself," was accompanied by a $300
donation.
Poor Turnout
A failure to get a newsletter out to its
310 members resulted in the failure of
300 members to attend last Wednes
day's Young Republicans meeting. As a
result, the meeting was limited to an
nouncements of several events pertinent
to YR members.

Michael Kuhl announced the need for
about thirty YR members to work in a
special election Feb. 25 in Contra Costa
County. The election, to filJ a position
in the State Senate, is a hotly contested
one. There are now eleven Democrats
and two Republicans running.
Boyd expressed concern that he saw
no one but "student radicals on com
mittees here at Stanford." Conservative
and moderate students should become
involved in campus political activities.
"Our voice should be heard," he stated.
Harvey Hukari, editor of the Arena,
mentioned that the conservative
oriented paper is going to be distributed
weekly. But the paper is not without its
problems. There have been incidents
where bundles of the journal have been
stolen, torn up, or thrown away.
Unexpected Guest
An unexpected guest at the meeting
was Dr. Fleming, an ex-state senator
from Maui Hawaii. Dr. Fleming ex
pressed his support for the organization
and then joined, including with his
membership an $18.00 donation.
The next Young Republicans meeting
will be this Wednesday, Feb. 19. Dis
cussion will center around the group's
direction and policy for the remainder
of the quarter.
Campus conservatives will present a
list of "proposals" this afternoon to the
university administration.
Members of the Young Americans for
Freedom (YAF) and Young Republi
cans (YR) have not yet revealed the
content of the proposals but will an
nounce them at 2:15 in Associate Dean
Willard Wyman's office.
Harvey Hukari, president of the con
servstive YAF group, promises that
there will be no pickets or signs; "in fact

we are trying to keep it subdued." It is
the intention of the group that the pro
posals be in contrast to the manner of
non-negotiable demands which have
been presented lately on many cam
puses, according to Hukari.
Although the exact nature of the pro
posals were not disclosed, he hinted
they will pertain to academic and disci
plinary questions. Hukari announced
plans for the quiet demonstration at last
Thursday's YR meeting.
