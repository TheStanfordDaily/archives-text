# Draw Studied
## Housing Crisis Looming 
### JENNY MATHEWS 
What does a student do when the
University can't find him housing and
every off-campus landlord tells him,
"Sorry, son, but there are twenty
people ahead of you?"
The possibility of inadequate campus
space depends on variables such as the
size of the new freshmen class admitted
this spring, the percentages of students
presently in the residence system who
wish to remain next fall, and the possi
bility that there will be additional Uni
versity housing ready for occupancy
next September.
According to Assistant Dean of Stu
dents, Bob Rosch, in a memorandum
published this week, "to evict anybody
seems to be a lamentable step; however,
it seems necessary to make some contin
gency plans to provide for evictions.
Meanwhile, we will do everything possi
ble to prevent the need for evictions."
Last year, because of an overflow of
about 160 entering freshmen, 25 stu
dents in the residence system were still
unassigned to fall housing by last June.
Space Found
Over the summer, however, space was
found for them because of a number of
students dropping out of the residence
system. This spring, the housing draw

will be computerized in order to create
greater efficiency and a better response
to students needs.
Last year's draw involved a compli
cated list of preferences for the student
to fill out. He was allowed to draw in
groups of up to three, and on-campus
students had preference over off-campus
students or fraternity men.
Redraw
If dissatisfied with a first round draw
number, a student could redraw.
In an attempt to bring about the
most fair eviction policies if such a
move becomes necessary, the ASSU
Draw Committee has suggested that ran
dom evictions take place in one of the
following groups:
Freshman men living in houses of all
freshmen men
Freshman men regardless of resi
dence
All Freshman students regardless of
sex or residence
All men in the residence system re
gardless of class
All students in the residence system
regardless of class or sex
Only upperclassmen (sophomores,
juniors, and seniors), regardless of
sex or residence (guaranteeing space
to all current freshmen who wish it).
Campus Meeting
In order to obtain student views on
the problem, the ASSU Draw Com
mittee called a campus-wide meeting
last Thursday. The Committee consists
of ASSU Vice President Victor Von
Schlegell; Robert Rosch, Assistant Dean
of Students; Sally Mahoney, Associate
Dean of Students; Margaret Burk, Di
rector of Lagunita; Alan Cummings; and
two systems analysts, Joan Burkhead
and Vince Vargas.
Most of the students who attended
were either transfer students who had
gone through the experience of not
finding housing or students directly af
fected by last year's temporary evic
tions.
When asked about the possibility of
the University building temporary
housing such as a trailer camp, Von
Schlegel stated that a committee initi
ated by President Pitzer is looking into
this type of construction.
Trailer Camp
"No trailer camp can realistically be
financed on campus," he explained.
"The problem of finding a suitable site
and to install utilities, etc., is immense.
"The cost would be choking, and
where would the money for such a defi
cit come from?"
The acute need for temporary
housing in the fall was emphasized by a
transfer student who had gone through
the "no vacancy hassle" last fall.
No Housing
"We got here last fall," she com
plained, "forewarned that there might
not be housing on campus.

"But most transfer students are so
desparate to find some place to live,
they'll take anything off campus which
is usually leased on a nine month basis.
"Two weeks or so after school starts,
the University found housing space for
us, but we were stuck with nine month
or year leases we didn't want.
"Temporary housing could prevent
this."
Undergrads Affected
A representative from Magnolia be
lieved that "If only about 30 under
graduates will be affected by eviction,
why not give them the space that gradu
ate RA's and tutors occupy?"
He added that graduate students are
better able to find housing off campus.
The possibility of finding new Uni
versity residences by next fall was con
sidered.
"A segment of Escondido Village,"
explained Rosch, "may be converted for
student occupancy."
Although this plan has already been
financed partially by federal funds, it
may not be completed before 1970 or
later.
The SES committee was originally re
quested to study the housing crisis, and
