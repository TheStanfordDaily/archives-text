# Draw Studied
## Housing Crisis Looming 
### JENNY MATHEWS 
What does a student do when the
University can't find him housing and
every off-campus landlord tells him,
"Sorry, son, but there are twenty
people ahead of you?"
The possibility of inadequate campus
space depends on variables such as the
size of the new freshmen class admitted
this spring, the percentages of students
presently in the residence system who
wish to remain next fall, and the possi
bility that there will be additional Uni
versity housing ready for occupancy
next September.
According to Assistant Dean of Stu
dents, Bob Rosch, in a memorandum
published this week, "to evict anybody
seems to be a lamentable step; however,
it seems necessary to make some contin
gency plans to provide for evictions.
Meanwhile, we will do everything possi
ble to prevent the need for evictions."
Last year, because of an overflow of
about 160 entering freshmen, 25 stu
dents in the residence system were still
unassigned to fall housing by last June.
Space Found
Over the summer, however, space was
found for them because of a number of
students dropping out of the residence
system. This spring, the housing draw

will be computerized in order to create
greater efficiency and a better response
to students needs.
Last year's draw involved a compli
cated list of preferences for the student
to fill out. He was allowed to draw in
groups of up to three, and on-campus
students had preference over off-campus
students or fraternity men.
Redraw
If dissatisfied with a first round draw
number, a student could redraw.
In an attempt to bring about the
most fair eviction policies if such a
move becomes necessary, the ASSU
Draw Committee has suggested that ran
dom evictions take place in one of the
following groups:
Freshman men living in houses of all
freshmen men
Freshman men regardless of resi
dence
All Freshman students regardless of
sex or residence
All men in the residence system re
gardless of class
All students in the residence system
regardless of class or sex
Only upperclassmen (sophomores,
juniors, and seniors), regardless of
sex or residence (guaranteeing space
to all current freshmen who wish it).
Campus Meeting
In order to obtain student views on
the problem, the ASSU Draw Com
mittee called a campus-wide meeting
last Thursday. The Committee consists
of ASSU Vice President Victor Von
Schlegell; Robert Rosch, Assistant Dean
of Students; Sally Mahoney, Associate
Dean of Students; Margaret Burk, Di
rector of Lagunita; Alan Cummings; and
two systems analysts, Joan Burkhead
and Vince Vargas.
Most of the students who attended
were either transfer students who had
gone through the experience of not
finding housing or students directly af
fected by last year's temporary evic
tions.
When asked about the possibility of
the University building temporary
housing such as a trailer camp, Von
Schlegel stated that a committee initi
ated by President Pitzer is looking into
this type of construction.
Trailer Camp
"No trailer camp can realistically be
financed on campus," he explained.
"The problem of finding a suitable site
and to install utilities, etc., is immense.
"The cost would be choking, and
where would the money for such a defi
cit come from?"
The acute need for temporary
housing in the fall was emphasized by a
transfer student who had gone through
the "no vacancy hassle" last fall.
No Housing
"We got here last fall," she com
plained, "forewarned that there might
not be housing on campus.

"But most transfer students are so
desparate to find some place to live,
they'll take anything off campus which
is usually leased on a nine month basis.
"Two weeks or so after school starts,
the University found housing space for
us, but we were stuck with nine month
or year leases we didn't want.
"Temporary housing could prevent
this."
Undergrads Affected
A representative from Magnolia be
lieved that "If only about 30 under
graduates will be affected by eviction,
why not give them the space that gradu
ate RA's and tutors occupy?"
He added that graduate students are
better able to find housing off campus.
The possibility of finding new Uni
versity residences by next fall was con
sidered.
"A segment of Escondido Village,"
explained Rosch, "may be converted for
student occupancy."
Although this plan has already been
financed partially by federal funds, it
may not be completed before 1970 or
later.
The SES committee was originally re
quested to study the housing crisis, and
according to Rosch, "the finished
report is supposed to give us di
rection."
Over-enrollment
When asked why the University
is accepting more students than it
can find housing for, Rosch ex
plained that "this year over
enrollment was out of our hands.
The usual criteria for acceptance
were used, but the expected re
jection and attrition didn't pan
out. About 160 more freshmen
came than was expected."
One aggravated transfer student
then asked, "Why were there so
many transfer students accepted?
I didn't get my acceptance letter

until July, and by then you
should have known that there
were going to be too many fresh
men."
She contended that if the Uni
versity can not guarantee housing
for-a new student, he should not
be admitted.
Housing Priority
"Or else," she added, "you
should give both freshmen and
transfer students top housing
priority.
"A new student comes here not
knowing the area, a stranger with
no way of finding housing, and
what's he supposed to do?"
Rosch pointed out that if all
transfer students were guaranteed

housing, about 300 campus resi
dents already in the system would
be evicted.
As to whether men and women
should have the same chance for
eviction, one coed griped, "Stan
ford's supposed to have the great
reputation of being a 'residence
university'—what's it going to
look like when girl students have
to hitchhike to class every morn
ing?"
Cars First
She contended that students
who have cars should be the first
to be forced off campus.
Von Schlegell contended that
this was "too finite a judgment"
to make on students.
"My committee is trying to
formulate sound guidelines for the
overall housing problem rather
than concern ourselves with
making specific judgments as to
which individuals should be
evicted."
"Why is the University building
all kinds of pavilions and
libraries," demanded another stu
dent, "when they should be build
ing dorms?"
Rosch pointed out that many
contributions to the University
are directed toward a specific pur
pose by the donor. A lot of "un
tagged contributions" go toward
operational costs.
He did emphasize, however,
that the University is "looking
into the possibilities of low-cost
housing plans."
"Why doesn't the University,"
demanded the representative from
Magnolia, "give increased financial
aid to those forced off campus—
and I mean in the form of scholar
ships, not loans."
Commings stated that the Com
mittee is looking into the possi-

blity of reserving an apartment
building for students.
"The Palo Alto area, however,"
he explained has one of the lowest
vacancy levels in the country.
Space is hard to come by."
One representative suggested
that there be a call in the spring
for volunteers to move off campus
since "a lot of people are un
decided if they want to live here
anyway, and if they're aware of
the serious problem, maybe
they'll be more willing to move."
A number of students pointed
out that residents move out of
dorms in the middle of a quarter
leaving many vacancies that could
have been filled in the beginning
by permanent residents.

published this week, "to evict anybody
seems to be a lamentable step; however,
it seems necessary to make some contin
gency plans to provide for evictions.
Meanwhile, we will do everything possi
ble to prevent the need for evictions."
Last year, because of an overflow of
about 160 entering freshmen, 25 stu
dents in the residence system were still
unassigned to fall housing by last June.
Space Found
Over the summer, however, space was
found for them because of a number of
students dropping out of the residence
system. This spring, the housing draw

will be computerized in order to create
greater efficiency and a better response
to students needs.
Last year's draw involved a compli
cated list of preferences for the student
to fill out. He was allowed to draw in
groups of up to three, and on-campus
students had preference over off-campus
students or fraternity men.
Redraw
If dissatisfied with a first round draw
number, a student could redraw.
In an attempt to bring about the
most fair eviction policies if such a
move becomes necessary, the ASSU
Draw Committee has suggested that ran
dom evictions take place in one of the
following groups:
Freshman men living in houses of all
freshmen men
Freshman men regardless of resi
dence
All Freshman students regardless of
sex or residence
All men in the residence system re
gardless of class
All students in the residence system
regardless of class or sex
Only upperclassmen (sophomores,
juniors, and seniors), regardless of
sex or residence (guaranteeing space
to all current freshmen who wish it).
Campus Meeting
In order to obtain student views on
the problem, the ASSU Draw Com
mittee called a campus-wide meeting
last Thursday. The Committee consists
of ASSU Vice President Victor Von
Schlegell; Robert Rosch, Assistant Dean
of Students; Sally Mahoney, Associate
Dean of Students; Margaret Burk, Di
rector of Lagunita; Alan Cummings; and
two systems analysts, Joan Burkhead
and Vince Vargas.
Most of the students who attended
were either transfer students who had
gone through the experience of not
finding housing or students directly af
fected by last year's temporary evic
tions.
When asked about the possibility of
the University building temporary
housing such as a trailer camp, Von
Schlegel stated that a committee initi
ated by President Pitzer is looking into
this type of construction.
Trailer Camp
"No trailer camp can realistically be
financed on campus," he explained.
"The problem of finding a suitable site
and to install utilities, etc., is immense.
"The cost would be choking, and
where would the money for such a defi
cit come from?"
The acute need for temporary
housing in the fall was emphasized by a
transfer student who had gone through
the "no vacancy hassle" last fall.
No Housing
"We got here last fall," she com
plained, "forewarned that there might
not be housing on campus.

"But most transfer students are so
desparate to find some place to live,
they'll take anything off campus which
is usually leased on a nine month basis.
"Two weeks or so after school starts,
the University found housing space for
us, but we were stuck with nine month
or year leases we didn't want.
"Temporary housing could prevent
this."
Undergrads Affected
A representative from Magnolia be
lieved that "If only about 30 under
graduates will be affected by eviction,
why not give them the space that gradu
ate RA's and tutors occupy?"
He added that graduate students are
better able to find housing off campus.
The possibility of finding new Uni
versity residences by next fall was con
sidered.
"A segment of Escondido Village,"
explained Rosch, "may be converted for
student occupancy."
Although this plan has already been
financed partially by federal funds, it
may not be completed before 1970 or
later.
The SES committee was originally re
quested to study the housing crisis, and
according to Rosch, "the finished
report is supposed to give us di
rection."
Over-enrollment
When asked why the University
is accepting more students than it
can find housing for, Rosch ex
plained that "this year over
enrollment was out of our hands.
The usual criteria for acceptance
were used, but the expected re
jection and attrition didn't pan
out. About 160 more freshmen
came than was expected."
One aggravated transfer student
then asked, "Why were there so
many transfer students accepted?
I didn't get my acceptance letter

until July, and by then you
should have known that there
were going to be too many fresh
men."
She contended that if the Uni
versity can not guarantee housing
for-a new student, he should not
be admitted.
Housing Priority
"Or else," she added, "you
should give both freshmen and
transfer students top housing
priority.
"A new student comes here not
knowing the area, a stranger with
no way of finding housing, and
what's he supposed to do?"
Rosch pointed out that if all
transfer students were guaranteed

housing, about 300 campus resi
dents already in the system would
be evicted.
As to whether men and women
should have the same chance for
eviction, one coed griped, "Stan
ford's supposed to have the great
reputation of being a 'residence
university'—what's it going to
look like when girl students have
to hitchhike to class every morn
ing?"
Cars First
She contended that students
who have cars should be the first
to be forced off campus.
Von Schlegell contended that
this was "too finite a judgment"
to make on students.
"My committee is trying to
formulate sound guidelines for the
overall housing problem rather
than concern ourselves with
making specific judgments as to
which individuals should be
evicted."
"Why is the University building
all kinds of pavilions and
libraries," demanded another stu
dent, "when they should be build
ing dorms?"
Rosch pointed out that many
contributions to the University
are directed toward a specific pur
pose by the donor. A lot of "un
tagged contributions" go toward
operational costs.
He did emphasize, however,
that the University is "looking
into the possibilities of low-cost
housing plans."
"Why doesn't the University,"
demanded the representative from
Magnolia, "give increased financial
aid to those forced off campus—
and I mean in the form of scholar
ships, not loans."
Commings stated that the Com
mittee is looking into the possi-

blity of reserving an apartment
building for students.
"The Palo Alto area, however,"
he explained has one of the lowest
vacancy levels in the country.
Space is hard to come by."
One representative suggested
that there be a call in the spring
for volunteers to move off campus
since "a lot of people are un
decided if they want to live here
anyway, and if they're aware of
the serious problem, maybe
they'll be more willing to move."
A number of students pointed
out that residents move out of
dorms in the middle of a quarter
leaving many vacancies that could
have been filled in the beginning
by permanent residents.
What does a student do when the
University can't find him housing and
every off-campus landlord tells him,
"Sorry, son, but there are twenty
people ahead of you?"
The possibility of inadequate campus
space depends on variables such as the
size of the new freshmen class admitted
this spring, the percentages of students
presently in the residence system who
wish to remain next fall, and the possi
bility that there will be additional Uni
versity housing ready for occupancy
next September.

system. This spring, the housing draw

will be computerized in order to create
greater efficiency and a better response
to students needs.
Last year's draw involved a compli
cated list of preferences for the student
to fill out. He was allowed to draw in
groups of up to three, and on-campus
students had preference over off-campus
students or fraternity men.
Redraw
If dissatisfied with a first round draw
number, a student could redraw.
In an attempt to bring about the
most fair eviction policies if such a
move becomes necessary, the ASSU
Draw Committee has suggested that ran
dom evictions take place in one of the
following groups:
Freshman men living in houses of all
freshmen men
Freshman men regardless of resi
dence
All Freshman students regardless of
sex or residence
All men in the residence system re
gardless of class
All students in the residence system
regardless of class or sex
Only upperclassmen (sophomores,
juniors, and seniors), regardless of
sex or residence (guaranteeing space
to all current freshmen who wish it).
Campus Meeting
In order to obtain student views on
the problem, the ASSU Draw Com
mittee called a campus-wide meeting
last Thursday. The Committee consists
of ASSU Vice President Victor Von
Schlegell; Robert Rosch, Assistant Dean
of Students; Sally Mahoney, Associate
Dean of Students; Margaret Burk, Di
rector of Lagunita; Alan Cummings; and
two systems analysts, Joan Burkhead
and Vince Vargas.
Most of the students who attended
were either transfer students who had
gone through the experience of not
finding housing or students directly af
fected by last year's temporary evic
tions.
When asked about the possibility of
the University building temporary
housing such as a trailer camp, Von
Schlegel stated that a committee initi
ated by President Pitzer is looking into
this type of construction.
Trailer Camp
"No trailer camp can realistically be
financed on campus," he explained.
"The problem of finding a suitable site
and to install utilities, etc., is immense.
"The cost would be choking, and
where would the money for such a defi
cit come from?"
The acute need for temporary
housing in the fall was emphasized by a
transfer student who had gone through
the "no vacancy hassle" last fall.
No Housing
"We got here last fall," she com
plained, "forewarned that there might
not be housing on campus.

"But most transfer students are so
desparate to find some place to live,
they'll take anything off campus which
is usually leased on a nine month basis.
"Two weeks or so after school starts,
the University found housing space for
us, but we were stuck with nine month
or year leases we didn't want.
"Temporary housing could prevent
this."
Undergrads Affected
A representative from Magnolia be
lieved that "If only about 30 under
graduates will be affected by eviction,
why not give them the space that gradu
ate RA's and tutors occupy?"
He added that graduate students are
better able to find housing off campus.
The possibility of finding new Uni
versity residences by next fall was con
sidered.
"A segment of Escondido Village,"
explained Rosch, "may be converted for
student occupancy."
Although this plan has already been
financed partially by federal funds, it
may not be completed before 1970 or
later.
The SES committee was originally re
quested to study the housing crisis, and
according to Rosch, "the finished
report is supposed to give us di
rection."
Over-enrollment
When asked why the University
is accepting more students than it
can find housing for, Rosch ex
plained that "this year over
enrollment was out of our hands.
The usual criteria for acceptance
were used, but the expected re
jection and attrition didn't pan
out. About 160 more freshmen
came than was expected."
One aggravated transfer student
then asked, "Why were there so
many transfer students accepted?
I didn't get my acceptance letter

until July, and by then you
should have known that there
were going to be too many fresh
men."
She contended that if the Uni
versity can not guarantee housing
for-a new student, he should not
be admitted.
Housing Priority
"Or else," she added, "you
should give both freshmen and
transfer students top housing
priority.
"A new student comes here not
knowing the area, a stranger with
no way of finding housing, and
what's he supposed to do?"
Rosch pointed out that if all
transfer students were guaranteed

housing, about 300 campus resi
dents already in the system would
be evicted.
As to whether men and women
should have the same chance for
eviction, one coed griped, "Stan
ford's supposed to have the great
reputation of being a 'residence
university'—what's it going to
look like when girl students have
to hitchhike to class every morn
ing?"
Cars First
She contended that students
who have cars should be the first
to be forced off campus.
Von Schlegell contended that
this was "too finite a judgment"
to make on students.
"My committee is trying to
formulate sound guidelines for the
overall housing problem rather
than concern ourselves with
making specific judgments as to
which individuals should be
evicted."
"Why is the University building
all kinds of pavilions and
libraries," demanded another stu
dent, "when they should be build
ing dorms?"
Rosch pointed out that many
contributions to the University
are directed toward a specific pur
pose by the donor. A lot of "un
tagged contributions" go toward
operational costs.
He did emphasize, however,
that the University is "looking
into the possibilities of low-cost
housing plans."
"Why doesn't the University,"
demanded the representative from
Magnolia, "give increased financial
aid to those forced off campus—
and I mean in the form of scholar
ships, not loans."
Commings stated that the Com
mittee is looking into the possi-

blity of reserving an apartment
building for students.
"The Palo Alto area, however,"
he explained has one of the lowest
vacancy levels in the country.
Space is hard to come by."
One representative suggested
that there be a call in the spring
for volunteers to move off campus
since "a lot of people are un
decided if they want to live here
anyway, and if they're aware of
the serious problem, maybe
they'll be more willing to move."
A number of students pointed
out that residents move out of
dorms in the middle of a quarter
leaving many vacancies that could
have been filled in the beginning
by permanent residents.
What does a student do when the
University can't find him housing and
every off-campus landlord tells him,
"Sorry, son, but there are twenty
people ahead of you?"
The possibility of inadequate campus
space depends on variables such as the
size of the new freshmen class admitted
this spring, the percentages of students
presently in the residence system who
wish to remain next fall, and the possi
bility that there will be additional Uni
versity housing ready for occupancy
next September.
According to Assistant Dean of Stu
dents, Bob Rosch, in a memorandum
published this week, "to evict anybody
seems to be a lamentable step; however,
it seems necessary to make some contin
gency plans to provide for evictions.
Meanwhile, we will do everything possi
ble to prevent the need for evictions."
Last year, because of an overflow of
about 160 entering freshmen, 25 stu
dents in the residence system were still
unassigned to fall housing by last June.
Space Found
Over the summer, however, space was
found for them because of a number of
students dropping out of the residence
system. This spring, the housing draw

will be computerized in order to create
greater efficiency and a better response

Draw Committee has suggested that ran
dom evictions take place in one of the
following groups:
Freshman men living in houses of all
freshmen men
Freshman men regardless of resi
dence
All Freshman students regardless of
sex or residence
All men in the residence system re
gardless of class
All students in the residence system
regardless of class or sex
Only upperclassmen (sophomores,
juniors, and seniors), regardless of
sex or residence (guaranteeing space
to all current freshmen who wish it).
Campus Meeting
In order to obtain student views on
the problem, the ASSU Draw Com
mittee called a campus-wide meeting
last Thursday. The Committee consists
of ASSU Vice President Victor Von
Schlegell; Robert Rosch, Assistant Dean
of Students; Sally Mahoney, Associate
Dean of Students; Margaret Burk, Di
rector of Lagunita; Alan Cummings; and
two systems analysts, Joan Burkhead
and Vince Vargas.
Most of the students who attended
were either transfer students who had
gone through the experience of not
finding housing or students directly af
fected by last year's temporary evic
tions.
When asked about the possibility of
the University building temporary
housing such as a trailer camp, Von
Schlegel stated that a committee initi
ated by President Pitzer is looking into
this type of construction.
Trailer Camp
"No trailer camp can realistically be
financed on campus," he explained.
"The problem of finding a suitable site
and to install utilities, etc., is immense.
"The cost would be choking, and
where would the money for such a defi
cit come from?"
The acute need for temporary
housing in the fall was emphasized by a
transfer student who had gone through
the "no vacancy hassle" last fall.
No Housing
"We got here last fall," she com
plained, "forewarned that there might
not be housing on campus.

"But most transfer students are so
desparate to find some place to live,
they'll take anything off campus which
is usually leased on a nine month basis.
"Two weeks or so after school starts,
the University found housing space for
us, but we were stuck with nine month
or year leases we didn't want.
"Temporary housing could prevent
this."
Undergrads Affected
A representative from Magnolia be
lieved that "If only about 30 under
graduates will be affected by eviction,
why not give them the space that gradu
ate RA's and tutors occupy?"
He added that graduate students are
better able to find housing off campus.
The possibility of finding new Uni
versity residences by next fall was con
sidered.
"A segment of Escondido Village,"
explained Rosch, "may be converted for
student occupancy."
Although this plan has already been
financed partially by federal funds, it
may not be completed before 1970 or
later.
The SES committee was originally re
quested to study the housing crisis, and
according to Rosch, "the finished
report is supposed to give us di
rection."
Over-enrollment
When asked why the University
is accepting more students than it
can find housing for, Rosch ex
plained that "this year over
enrollment was out of our hands.
The usual criteria for acceptance
were used, but the expected re
jection and attrition didn't pan
out. About 160 more freshmen
came than was expected."
One aggravated transfer student
then asked, "Why were there so
many transfer students accepted?
I didn't get my acceptance letter

until July, and by then you
should have known that there
were going to be too many fresh
men."
She contended that if the Uni
versity can not guarantee housing
for-a new student, he should not
be admitted.
Housing Priority
"Or else," she added, "you
should give both freshmen and
transfer students top housing
priority.
"A new student comes here not
knowing the area, a stranger with
no way of finding housing, and
what's he supposed to do?"
Rosch pointed out that if all
transfer students were guaranteed

housing, about 300 campus resi
dents already in the system would
be evicted.
As to whether men and women
should have the same chance for
eviction, one coed griped, "Stan
ford's supposed to have the great
reputation of being a 'residence
university'—what's it going to
look like when girl students have
to hitchhike to class every morn
ing?"
Cars First
She contended that students
who have cars should be the first
to be forced off campus.
Von Schlegell contended that
this was "too finite a judgment"
to make on students.
"My committee is trying to
formulate sound guidelines for the
overall housing problem rather
than concern ourselves with
making specific judgments as to
which individuals should be
evicted."
"Why is the University building
all kinds of pavilions and
libraries," demanded another stu
dent, "when they should be build
ing dorms?"
Rosch pointed out that many
contributions to the University
are directed toward a specific pur
pose by the donor. A lot of "un
tagged contributions" go toward
operational costs.
He did emphasize, however,
that the University is "looking
into the possibilities of low-cost
housing plans."
"Why doesn't the University,"
demanded the representative from
Magnolia, "give increased financial
aid to those forced off campus—
and I mean in the form of scholar
ships, not loans."
Commings stated that the Com
mittee is looking into the possi-

blity of reserving an apartment
building for students.
"The Palo Alto area, however,"
he explained has one of the lowest
vacancy levels in the country.
Space is hard to come by."
One representative suggested
that there be a call in the spring
for volunteers to move off campus
since "a lot of people are un
decided if they want to live here
anyway, and if they're aware of
the serious problem, maybe
they'll be more willing to move."
A number of students pointed
out that residents move out of
dorms in the middle of a quarter
leaving many vacancies that could
have been filled in the beginning
by permanent residents.
What does a student do when the
University can't find him housing and
every off-campus landlord tells him,
"Sorry, son, but there are twenty
people ahead of you?"
The possibility of inadequate campus
space depends on variables such as the
size of the new freshmen class admitted
this spring, the percentages of students
presently in the residence system who
wish to remain next fall, and the possi
bility that there will be additional Uni
versity housing ready for occupancy
next September.
According to Assistant Dean of Stu
dents, Bob Rosch, in a memorandum
published this week, "to evict anybody
seems to be a lamentable step; however,
it seems necessary to make some contin
gency plans to provide for evictions.
Meanwhile, we will do everything possi
ble to prevent the need for evictions."
Last year, because of an overflow of
about 160 entering freshmen, 25 stu
dents in the residence system were still
unassigned to fall housing by last June.
Space Found
Over the summer, however, space was
found for them because of a number of
students dropping out of the residence
system. This spring, the housing draw

will be computerized in order to create
greater efficiency and a better response
to students needs.
Last year's draw involved a compli
cated list of preferences for the student
to fill out. He was allowed to draw in
groups of up to three, and on-campus
students had preference over off-campus
students or fraternity men.
Redraw
If dissatisfied with a first round draw
number, a student could redraw.
In an attempt to bring about the
most fair eviction policies if such a
move becomes necessary, the ASSU
Draw Committee has suggested that ran
dom evictions take place in one of the
following groups:
Freshman men living in houses of all
freshmen men
Freshman men regardless of resi
dence
All Freshman students regardless of
sex or residence
All men in the residence system re
gardless of class
All students in the residence system
regardless of class or sex
Only upperclassmen (sophomores,
juniors, and seniors), regardless of
sex or residence (guaranteeing space
to all current freshmen who wish it).
