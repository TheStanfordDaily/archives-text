## 
### DAVID DAVENPORT 
Eight referendum issues and seven
slates of Education Council candidates
will confront students on the ballot for
the general election to be held tomor
row and Wednesday.
Polling will be conducted at the Post
Office and at Engineering Corner from
9:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. and at the Physics
Tank from 9 a.m. until noon both Tues
day and Wednesday. Polls will also be
located at the Medical School from
noon to 4 p.m. on Tuesday and at the
Business School at the same hours
Wednesday.
Election of the students to serve on
the Education Council will be con

ducted according to the Hare system of
proportional representation.
List of Candidates
Voters will be provided a list of all
candidates for the Council. The students
will vote for those candidates who are
listed in their academic discipline:
Humanities and Sciences undergraduate,
Business graduate, Engineering under
graduate, Engineering graduate, Medical
graduate, Humanities and Sciences
graduate, and General Studies under
graduates.
Specific instructions on the ballot call
for voters to rank, in order of prefer
ence, those candidates whom they wish
to select. The maximum number of
votes cast will depend on the academic
discipline, and will be clearly stated on
the ballot.
The Education Council will hold joint
deliberations with the Academic Senate
in considering the SES reports, and will
vote on the SES proposals as well.
Strength Student Role
One of the referenda on the ballot
seeks to strengthen the role of the Stu
dent Education Council in these joint
deliberations.
Specifically it calls for students to
concur that the ASSU Education Coun
cil "is the representative voice of Stan
ford students" on SES deliberations.
The referendum further states that
"no University action on those pro
posals shall be valid unless it meets with
the concurrence of the ASSU Education
Council."
Voters will also be given the oppor
tunity to voice opinions on six indi
vidual SES proposals, including the
semester or quarter question, the desir
ability of a reading period, and the
future status of General Studies require
ments.
Controversial Issue
One of the most controversial issues
on the ballot is designed to probe stu
dent opinion regarding credit for ROTC
courses at Stanford.
Urging support of ROTC as a "volun
tary program for those students wishing
to fulfill in this way their military obli
gation," the resolution favors University
support and credit for "those parts of
the program that are of genuine aca
demic interest."
Petitions signed by five percent
of Stanford students placed a de
linquent loans question on the
ballot. Recognizing the existence
of $300,000 in delinquent loans,
the resolution expresses support
to the University in its efforts to
collect.
Suggested By Hayes
Denis Hayes suggested two pro
positions regarding drugs, both of
which will appear on the ballot.
Each issue is worded to ask Stan
ford students to petition the State
of California regarding the matter.
The first resolution calls for
petition to revoke all legal
sanctions against the sale, posses
sion, or use of marijuana.
Dealing with methedrine, the
second resolution calls for more
stringent penalties for persons
convicted of selling it, and also re
quests a "serious state-wide pro

gram to educate youth to the
hazards of this dangerous drug."
Final Item
The final referendum issues
both concern changes in the Stan
ford judicial system. Briefly the
resolutions suggest changes in the
operation of the Judicial Council,
including a student chairman in
the case of a faculty defendant
and a faculty chairman in the case
of a student defendant. The chair
man, however, would not be per
mitted to vote.
Eight referendum issues and
seven slates of Education Council
candidates make one of the long
est ballots ever used in a student
body election at Stanford.
However, according to Election
Commissioner Bob Debs, "In
structions are clearly printed on
each ballot, and student assistants

Tank from 9 a.m. until noon both Tues
day and Wednesday. Polls will also be
located at the Medical School from
noon to 4 p.m. on Tuesday and at the
Business School at the same hours
Wednesday.
Election of the students to serve on
the Education Council will be con

ducted according to the Hare system of
proportional representation.
List of Candidates
Voters will be provided a list of all
candidates for the Council. The students
will vote for those candidates who are
listed in their academic discipline:
Humanities and Sciences undergraduate,
Business graduate, Engineering under
graduate, Engineering graduate, Medical
graduate, Humanities and Sciences
graduate, and General Studies under
graduates.
Specific instructions on the ballot call
for voters to rank, in order of prefer
ence, those candidates whom they wish
to select. The maximum number of
votes cast will depend on the academic
discipline, and will be clearly stated on
the ballot.
The Education Council will hold joint
deliberations with the Academic Senate
in considering the SES reports, and will
vote on the SES proposals as well.
Strength Student Role
One of the referenda on the ballot
seeks to strengthen the role of the Stu
dent Education Council in these joint
deliberations.
Specifically it calls for students to
concur that the ASSU Education Coun
cil "is the representative voice of Stan
ford students" on SES deliberations.
The referendum further states that
"no University action on those pro
posals shall be valid unless it meets with
the concurrence of the ASSU Education
Council."
Voters will also be given the oppor
tunity to voice opinions on six indi
vidual SES proposals, including the
semester or quarter question, the desir
ability of a reading period, and the
future status of General Studies require
ments.
Controversial Issue
One of the most controversial issues
on the ballot is designed to probe stu
dent opinion regarding credit for ROTC
courses at Stanford.
Urging support of ROTC as a "volun
tary program for those students wishing
to fulfill in this way their military obli
gation," the resolution favors University
support and credit for "those parts of
the program that are of genuine aca
demic interest."
Petitions signed by five percent
of Stanford students placed a de
linquent loans question on the
ballot. Recognizing the existence
of $300,000 in delinquent loans,
the resolution expresses support
to the University in its efforts to
collect.
Suggested By Hayes
Denis Hayes suggested two pro
positions regarding drugs, both of
which will appear on the ballot.
Each issue is worded to ask Stan
ford students to petition the State
of California regarding the matter.
The first resolution calls for
petition to revoke all legal
sanctions against the sale, posses
sion, or use of marijuana.
Dealing with methedrine, the
second resolution calls for more
stringent penalties for persons
convicted of selling it, and also re
quests a "serious state-wide pro

gram to educate youth to the
hazards of this dangerous drug."
Final Item
The final referendum issues
both concern changes in the Stan
ford judicial system. Briefly the
resolutions suggest changes in the
operation of the Judicial Council,
including a student chairman in
the case of a faculty defendant
and a faculty chairman in the case
of a student defendant. The chair
man, however, would not be per
mitted to vote.
Eight referendum issues and
seven slates of Education Council
candidates make one of the long
est ballots ever used in a student
body election at Stanford.
However, according to Election
Commissioner Bob Debs, "In
structions are clearly printed on
each ballot, and student assistants
will also be available to answer all
questions."
Eight referendum issues and seven
