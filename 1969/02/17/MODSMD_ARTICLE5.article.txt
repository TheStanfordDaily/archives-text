Voters will be provided a list of all

listed in their academic discipline:
Humanities and Sciences undergraduate,
Business graduate, Engineering under
graduate, Engineering graduate, Medical
graduate, Humanities and Sciences
graduate, and General Studies under
graduates.
Specific instructions on the ballot call
for voters to rank, in order of prefer
ence, those candidates whom they wish
to select. The maximum number of
votes cast will depend on the academic
discipline, and will be clearly stated on
the ballot.
The Education Council will hold joint
deliberations with the Academic Senate
in considering the SES reports, and will
vote on the SES proposals as well.
Strength Student Role
One of the referenda on the ballot
seeks to strengthen the role of the Stu
dent Education Council in these joint
deliberations.
Specifically it calls for students to
concur that the ASSU Education Coun
cil "is the representative voice of Stan
ford students" on SES deliberations.
The referendum further states that
"no University action on those pro
posals shall be valid unless it meets with
the concurrence of the ASSU Education
Council."
Voters will also be given the oppor
tunity to voice opinions on six indi
vidual SES proposals, including the
semester or quarter question, the desir
ability of a reading period, and the
future status of General Studies require
ments.
Controversial Issue
One of the most controversial issues
on the ballot is designed to probe stu
dent opinion regarding credit for ROTC
courses at Stanford.
Urging support of ROTC as a "volun
tary program for those students wishing
to fulfill in this way their military obli
gation," the resolution favors University
support and credit for "those parts of
the program that are of genuine aca
demic interest."
