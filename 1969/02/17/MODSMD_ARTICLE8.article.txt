# Rush To Relevance?
## 
### 
Meal exchanges for freshmen rushing
fraternities begin today, and formal rush
begins March 3.
Here are some questions for participating
freshmen to ask of fraternity members:
To what extent do the alumni or the
national organization control the local
chapter? What kind of potential power do
they have?
In the initiation ceremonies might one
have to swear to act in ways which might
violate his conscience?
Are maintenance jobs in the house
assigned equally among all or to the new
members?
Are the hell week practices brutal or
humiliating? What are the customary
practices specifically?
Does social pressure within the
fraternity depersonalize the fraternity man's
view of Stanford women?
Here are some questions for
participating freshmen to ask themselves
during rush:
Do you want diversity in your living
group? To what extent do you think that
the present rushing process encourages
having a heterogeneous group?
Listen to what the fraternity man talks
about in rush. Is it you? Can you see
yourself saying similar things?

Is the fraternity a context in which you
can develop as a person now and will it still
be an environment in which you can be
evolving two years from now?
Would the group environment of the
fraternity inhibit scholarship?
Do you think the rush situation is a
good way to judge you as a person?
Are you willing to be rejected or
accepted on the basis of this situation?
Are you prepared if accepted into the
fraternity to reject others on the same basis?
At the present time, there appears to be a
standoff at Stanford between the
fraternities' members, who do not want
drastic change in rush procedures, and the
SES recommendation, which called for
major reforms. Matters seem to rest at an
uneasy equilibrium.
This quarter a proposal has been initiated
within the fraternities which moved
significantly in the direction of having
students choose the house which best
represented what they wanted. But this
scheme has suffered defeat in several
fraternities. It is still under consideration in
a few others.
As rush begins, we urge that participating
freshmen demand that the fraternities prove
their relevance. They have failed to
demonstrate it adequately thus far. If you
go, go skeptically and with open eyes.
