## About 'That Dirty Capitalist Company' 
### 
Editor, THE DAILY:
Yes, Mr. Pugh, you marshall im
pressive facts when it comes to at
tacking an oil company. Indeed,
you must own stock to have ac
cess to that confidential $500 mil
lion profit listed on their annual
report. Why don't you examine
the real facts?
Yes, the workers are sorely
abused by Standard Oil. They just
want to get back to work and feed
their poor families. Then why, Mr.
Pugh, did they turn down an offer
valued at over 60c an hour, as
compared to the 49c to 63c an
hour that workers in the other oil
companies have already settled
for? Or don't you expect the
Standard Oil workers to accept a
settlement which will "only"
leave them on a par with their
peers in other companies?
Yes, the workers are horrend
ously exploited by that dirty cap
italist company. In fact, the work
ers are so down-trodden that a
greater proportion of them re
mained on the job at Richmond
than in any other refinery during
the strike. Conditions must be so
bad that they like them.
Yes, Standard Oil does control
the courts. In fact, they were so
successful that they could not get
a single court injunction limiting
the number of pickets. The in
junction that you referred to per
tained only to Contra Costa
County and was a result of pres
sure by Shell Oil. Also for your
information, the "injunction," is,
by order of the court, not being
enforced.
Yes, Mr. Pugh, innocent people
were beaten and maimed. Only it
happens that the innocent people
were those who decided that they
didn't want to leave their jobs.
There are records of assaults by
striking workers on those who
wished to remain on the job.
We're as concerned about the
protection of innocent people as
you are.
Yes, Mr. Pugh, an 18-month-old
child was maced—with the mace
that the Richmond haven't carried
and haven't used. It is kind of
strange that you claimed that this
child had been maced, when in
fact no mace has been used at all
at Richmond.
Things positive that Standard
has done: A training program for
blacks which extends from Rich
mond to their Pascagoula refinery
in Southern Mississippi. This par
ticular program has cost the com
pany literally thousands of dol
lars. Standard offers disadvan

taged blacks some of the highest
paying jobs in the Richmond area.
Also, Standard has the record
of the fewest strikes in the oil in
dustry, a fact which is in itself a
fine testemonial to the fairness of
Standard management.
One might think that Mr. Pugh,
as the beneficiary of a "liberal"
education, would always examine
both sides of a question before
forming a position. On the basis
of what he has written, we don't
think it would be presumptuous
to suggest that not only has he
looked at just one side of this is
sue, but that he has formed his
judgment on the basis of facts
which are untrue.
What more can be said? This
SDS garbage about "power to the
people" is just that—garbage.

• End Stanford Support
Editor, THE DAILY:
It appears that the forces of the
far Left have intimidated the
liberals, and that the Academic
Senate will soon attempt to expel
ROTC from the Stanford campus.
However, it should be realized
that this action will amount to a
statement on the part of the uni
versity that Stanford does not
support the United States govern
ment.
The logical response to Stan
ford's impending action should be
apparent. The citizens and govern
ment of the United States should
bring an immediate halt to their
support, financial and otherwise,
of Stanford University.

• Legal Action Defended
Editor, THE DAILY:
I cannot agree with Barbara
Hy land's statement (Feb. 14):
"When one's concern is the
Trustees and their involvement in
Southeast Asia, to be tried for
breaking a campus policy on
demonstrations is ludicrous."
One can support the action of
the SDS students at the Trustees'
meeting and at the same time
recognize the need for legal ad
judication of this action. It has to
be decided somewhere in a society
whether the motives and circum
stances of an act which by all ap
pearances is an invasion of others'
rights make that act an acceptable
one, and one which can be al
lowed to be repeated, or do not
justify the act and require its pre
vention.
The single alternative to the
"farce" of the legal system is to
grant that at the least one private
party in the society can freely un
dertake against others any act he
feels is justified by his personal
beliefs. I, for one, would feel con

siderably insecure in such a situ
ation.
What about the Trustees (the
other "private party" in this case),
you might ask. If the actions of
some of these gentlemen in South
east Asia are interpreted as contri
bution to an invasion of the rights
of others, and their involvement
might well amount to just that,
their actions deserve to be adjudi
cated as well by my argument.
Their actions, plainly, are not
being examined or judged by the
system.
For some this might be a fatal
flaw in my argument as applied to
this case. But I cannot see that we
are mo r e right (or that the war is
closer to an end) and that our
society and world are any safer or
sanei —I think they are more dan
gerous and less sane—if we just
throw in the towel and grant an
archy to all takers.

• Ethics Questioned
Editor, THE DAILY:
It is very noble of Craig Wilson,
News Editor for The Daily, to re
fuse to testify at the SJC meeting
Tuesday "on the grounds that a
journalist has ethical codes and
confidences that he cannot vio
late."
It is difficult for me to under
stand how he can violate his ethics
by reporting what he saw at a
meeting at which he was present,
apparently, in his capacity as a
reporter.
Wilson was an Assistant Editor
when the alleged incident occur
red and when Thomas Dawson,
the News Editor, resigned that

position because of Dawson's dis
agreement with The Daily editor
ial defending the SDS action and
the news article "in which the
scuffles between demonstrators
and administrators were not des
cribed in detail." Dawson also
"objected to the failure to men
tion names of demonstrators."
(The Daily, Jan. 16, 1969).
While I am inclined to inter
prete Wilson's refusal to testify to
be on the grounds that his testi
mony may incriminate some of
his friends, I question his "ethics"
as a news reporter and restate my
belief that this campus need a
second student supported news
paper.

Editor, THE DAILY:
It appears that the forces of the
far Left have intimidated the
liberals, and that the Academic
Senate will soon attempt to expel
ROTC from the Stanford campus.
However, it should be realized
that this action will amount to a
statement on the part of the uni

The logical response to Stan

• Legal Action Defended
Editor, THE DAILY:
I cannot agree with Barbara
Hy land's statement (Feb. 14):
"When one's concern is the
Trustees and their involvement in
Southeast Asia, to be tried for
breaking a campus policy on
demonstrations is ludicrous."
One can support the action of
the SDS students at the Trustees'
meeting and at the same time
recognize the need for legal ad
judication of this action. It has to
be decided somewhere in a society
whether the motives and circum
stances of an act which by all ap
pearances is an invasion of others'
rights make that act an acceptable
one, and one which can be al
lowed to be repeated, or do not
justify the act and require its pre
vention.
The single alternative to the
"farce" of the legal system is to
grant that at the least one private
party in the society can freely un
dertake against others any act he
feels is justified by his personal
beliefs. I, for one, would feel con

siderably insecure in such a situ
ation.
What about the Trustees (the
other "private party" in this case),
you might ask. If the actions of
some of these gentlemen in South
east Asia are interpreted as contri
bution to an invasion of the rights
of others, and their involvement
might well amount to just that,
their actions deserve to be adjudi
cated as well by my argument.
Their actions, plainly, are not
being examined or judged by the
system.
For some this might be a fatal
flaw in my argument as applied to
this case. But I cannot see that we
are mo r e right (or that the war is
closer to an end) and that our
society and world are any safer or
sanei —I think they are more dan
gerous and less sane—if we just
throw in the towel and grant an
archy to all takers.

• Ethics Questioned
Editor, THE DAILY:
It is very noble of Craig Wilson,
News Editor for The Daily, to re
fuse to testify at the SJC meeting
Tuesday "on the grounds that a
journalist has ethical codes and
confidences that he cannot vio
late."
It is difficult for me to under
stand how he can violate his ethics
by reporting what he saw at a
meeting at which he was present,
apparently, in his capacity as a
reporter.
Wilson was an Assistant Editor
when the alleged incident occur
red and when Thomas Dawson,
the News Editor, resigned that

position because of Dawson's dis
agreement with The Daily editor
ial defending the SDS action and
the news article "in which the
scuffles between demonstrators
and administrators were not des
cribed in detail." Dawson also
"objected to the failure to men
tion names of demonstrators."
(The Daily, Jan. 16, 1969).
While I am inclined to inter
prete Wilson's refusal to testify to
be on the grounds that his testi
mony may incriminate some of
his friends, I question his "ethics"
as a news reporter and restate my
belief that this campus need a
second student supported news
paper.
CLIFFORD FOUNTAIN
Graduate, Engineering
Editor, THE DAILY:
Yes, Mr. Pugh, you marshall im
pressive facts when it comes to at
tacking an oil company. Indeed,
you must own stock to have ac
cess to that confidential $500 mil
lion profit listed on their annual
report. Why don't you examine
the real facts?
Yes, the workers are sorely
abused by Standard Oil. They just
want to get back to work and feed
their poor families. Then why, Mr.
Pugh, did they turn down an offer
valued at over 60c an hour, as
compared to the 49c to 63c an
hour that workers in the other oil
companies have already settled
for? Or don't you expect the
Standard Oil workers to accept a
settlement which will "only"
leave them on a par with their
peers in other companies?
Yes, the workers are horrend
ously exploited by that dirty cap
italist company. In fact, the work
ers are so down-trodden that a
greater proportion of them re
mained on the job at Richmond
than in any other refinery during
the strike. Conditions must be so
bad that they like them.
Yes, Standard Oil does control
the courts. In fact, they were so
successful that they could not get
a single court injunction limiting
the number of pickets. The in
junction that you referred to per
tained only to Contra Costa
County and was a result of pres
sure by Shell Oil. Also for your
information, the "injunction," is,
by order of the court, not being
enforced.
Yes, Mr. Pugh, innocent people
were beaten and maimed. Only it
happens that the innocent people
were those who decided that they
didn't want to leave their jobs.
There are records of assaults by
striking workers on those who
wished to remain on the job.
We're as concerned about the
protection of innocent people as
you are.
Yes, Mr. Pugh, an 18-month-old
child was maced—with the mace
that the Richmond haven't carried
and haven't used. It is kind of
strange that you claimed that this
child had been maced, when in
fact no mace has been used at all
at Richmond.
Things positive that Standard
has done: A training program for
blacks which extends from Rich
mond to their Pascagoula refinery
in Southern Mississippi. This par
ticular program has cost the com
pany literally thousands of dol
lars. Standard offers disadvan

taged blacks some of the highest
paying jobs in the Richmond area.
Also, Standard has the record
of the fewest strikes in the oil in
dustry, a fact which is in itself a
fine testemonial to the fairness of
Standard management.
One might think that Mr. Pugh,
as the beneficiary of a "liberal"
education, would always examine
both sides of a question before
forming a position. On the basis
of what he has written, we don't
think it would be presumptuous
to suggest that not only has he
looked at just one side of this is
sue, but that he has formed his
judgment on the basis of facts
which are untrue.

stand how he can violate his ethics
by reporting what he saw at a
meeting at which he was present,
apparently, in his capacity as a
reporter.
Wilson was an Assistant Editor
when the alleged incident occur
red and when Thomas Dawson,
the News Editor, resigned that

position because of Dawson's dis
agreement with The Daily editor
ial defending the SDS action and
the news article "in which the
scuffles between demonstrators
and administrators were not des
cribed in detail." Dawson also
"objected to the failure to men
tion names of demonstrators."
(The Daily, Jan. 16, 1969).
While I am inclined to inter
prete Wilson's refusal to testify to
be on the grounds that his testi
mony may incriminate some of
his friends, I question his "ethics"
as a news reporter and restate my
belief that this campus need a
second student supported news

CLIFFORD FOUNTAIN

Editor, THE DAILY:
Yes, Mr. Pugh, you marshall im
pressive facts when it comes to at
tacking an oil company. Indeed,
you must own stock to have ac
cess to that confidential $500 mil
lion profit listed on their annual
report. Why don't you examine
the real facts?
Yes, the workers are sorely
abused by Standard Oil. They just
want to get back to work and feed
their poor families. Then why, Mr.
Pugh, did they turn down an offer
valued at over 60c an hour, as
compared to the 49c to 63c an
hour that workers in the other oil
companies have already settled
for? Or don't you expect the
Standard Oil workers to accept a
settlement which will "only"
leave them on a par with their
peers in other companies?
Yes, the workers are horrend
ously exploited by that dirty cap
italist company. In fact, the work
ers are so down-trodden that a
greater proportion of them re
mained on the job at Richmond
than in any other refinery during
the strike. Conditions must be so
bad that they like them.
Yes, Standard Oil does control
the courts. In fact, they were so
successful that they could not get
a single court injunction limiting
the number of pickets. The in
junction that you referred to per
tained only to Contra Costa
County and was a result of pres
sure by Shell Oil. Also for your
information, the "injunction," is,
by order of the court, not being
enforced.
Yes, Mr. Pugh, innocent people
were beaten and maimed. Only it
happens that the innocent people
were those who decided that they
didn't want to leave their jobs.
There are records of assaults by
striking workers on those who
wished to remain on the job.
We're as concerned about the
protection of innocent people as
you are.
Yes, Mr. Pugh, an 18-month-old
child was maced—with the mace
that the Richmond haven't carried
and haven't used. It is kind of
strange that you claimed that this
child had been maced, when in
fact no mace has been used at all
at Richmond.
Things positive that Standard
has done: A training program for
blacks which extends from Rich
mond to their Pascagoula refinery
in Southern Mississippi. This par
ticular program has cost the com
pany literally thousands of dol
lars. Standard offers disadvan

taged blacks some of the highest
paying jobs in the Richmond area.
Also, Standard has the record
of the fewest strikes in the oil in
dustry, a fact which is in itself a
fine testemonial to the fairness of
Standard management.
One might think that Mr. Pugh,
as the beneficiary of a "liberal"
education, would always examine
both sides of a question before
forming a position. On the basis
of what he has written, we don't
think it would be presumptuous
to suggest that not only has he
looked at just one side of this is
sue, but that he has formed his
judgment on the basis of facts
which are untrue.
What more can be said? This
SDS garbage about "power to the
people" is just that—garbage.

It appears that the forces of the

Senate will soon attempt to expel
ROTC from the Stanford campus.
However, it should be realized
that this action will amount to a

The logical response to Stan

• Legal Action Defended
Editor, THE DAILY:
I cannot agree with Barbara
Hy land's statement (Feb. 14):
"When one's concern is the
Trustees and their involvement in
Southeast Asia, to be tried for
breaking a campus policy on
demonstrations is ludicrous."
One can support the action of
the SDS students at the Trustees'
meeting and at the same time
recognize the need for legal ad
judication of this action. It has to
be decided somewhere in a society
whether the motives and circum
stances of an act which by all ap
pearances is an invasion of others'
rights make that act an acceptable
one, and one which can be al
lowed to be repeated, or do not
justify the act and require its pre
vention.
The single alternative to the
"farce" of the legal system is to
grant that at the least one private
party in the society can freely un
dertake against others any act he
feels is justified by his personal
beliefs. I, for one, would feel con

siderably insecure in such a situ
ation.
What about the Trustees (the
other "private party" in this case),
you might ask. If the actions of
some of these gentlemen in South
east Asia are interpreted as contri
bution to an invasion of the rights
of others, and their involvement
might well amount to just that,
their actions deserve to be adjudi
cated as well by my argument.
Their actions, plainly, are not
being examined or judged by the
system.
For some this might be a fatal
flaw in my argument as applied to
this case. But I cannot see that we
are mo r e right (or that the war is
closer to an end) and that our
society and world are any safer or
sanei —I think they are more dan
gerous and less sane—if we just
throw in the towel and grant an
archy to all takers.

fact no mace has been used at all
at Richmond.
Things positive that Standard
has done: A training program for
blacks which extends from Rich
mond to their Pascagoula refinery
in Southern Mississippi. This par
ticular program has cost the com
pany literally thousands of dol
lars. Standard offers disadvan

taged blacks some of the highest
paying jobs in the Richmond area.
Also, Standard has the record
of the fewest strikes in the oil in
dustry, a fact which is in itself a
fine testemonial to the fairness of
Standard management.
One might think that Mr. Pugh,
as the beneficiary of a "liberal"
education, would always examine
both sides of a question before
forming a position. On the basis
of what he has written, we don't
think it would be presumptuous
to suggest that not only has he
looked at just one side of this is
sue, but that he has formed his
judgment on the basis of facts
which are untrue.
What more can be said? This
SDS garbage about "power to the
people" is just that—garbage.

• End Stanford Support
Editor, THE DAILY:
It appears that the forces of the
far Left have intimidated the
liberals, and that the Academic
Senate will soon attempt to expel
ROTC from the Stanford campus.
However, it should be realized
that this action will amount to a
statement on the part of the uni
versity that Stanford does not
support the United States govern
ment.
The logical response to Stan
ford's impending action should be
apparent. The citizens and govern
ment of the United States should
bring an immediate halt to their
support, financial and otherwise,
of Stanford University.

• Legal Action Defended
Editor, THE DAILY:
I cannot agree with Barbara
Hy land's statement (Feb. 14):
"When one's concern is the
Trustees and their involvement in
Southeast Asia, to be tried for
breaking a campus policy on
demonstrations is ludicrous."
One can support the action of
the SDS students at the Trustees'
meeting and at the same time
recognize the need for legal ad
judication of this action. It has to
be decided somewhere in a society
whether the motives and circum
stances of an act which by all ap
pearances is an invasion of others'
rights make that act an acceptable
one, and one which can be al
lowed to be repeated, or do not
justify the act and require its pre
vention.
The single alternative to the
"farce" of the legal system is to
grant that at the least one private
party in the society can freely un
dertake against others any act he
feels is justified by his personal
beliefs. I, for one, would feel con

siderably insecure in such a situ
ation.
What about the Trustees (the
other "private party" in this case),
you might ask. If the actions of
some of these gentlemen in South
east Asia are interpreted as contri
bution to an invasion of the rights
of others, and their involvement
might well amount to just that,
their actions deserve to be adjudi
cated as well by my argument.
Their actions, plainly, are not
being examined or judged by the
system.
For some this might be a fatal
flaw in my argument as applied to
this case. But I cannot see that we
are mo r e right (or that the war is
closer to an end) and that our
society and world are any safer or
sanei —I think they are more dan
gerous and less sane—if we just
throw in the towel and grant an
archy to all takers.

• Ethics Questioned
Editor, THE DAILY:
It is very noble of Craig Wilson,
News Editor for The Daily, to re
fuse to testify at the SJC meeting
Tuesday "on the grounds that a
journalist has ethical codes and
confidences that he cannot vio
late."
It is difficult for me to under
stand how he can violate his ethics
by reporting what he saw at a
meeting at which he was present,
apparently, in his capacity as a
reporter.
Wilson was an Assistant Editor
when the alleged incident occur
red and when Thomas Dawson,
the News Editor, resigned that

position because of Dawson's dis
agreement with The Daily editor
ial defending the SDS action and
the news article "in which the
scuffles between demonstrators
and administrators were not des
cribed in detail." Dawson also
"objected to the failure to men
tion names of demonstrators."
(The Daily, Jan. 16, 1969).
While I am inclined to inter
prete Wilson's refusal to testify to
be on the grounds that his testi
mony may incriminate some of
his friends, I question his "ethics"
as a news reporter and restate my
belief that this campus need a
second student supported news
paper.
