Some decisions are relatively unimportant.
Where you put your engineering
talent to work is not.
As you contemplate one of the most important decisions of your life, we invite you to consider a
career at Pratt & Whitney Aircraft. Here, you will find wide-open opportunities for professional growth
with a company that enjoys an enviable record of stability in the dynamic atmosphere of aerospace
technology.
We select our engineers and scientists carefully. Motivate them well. Give them the equipment and
facilities only a leader can provide. Offer them company-paid, graduate-education opportunities.
Encourage them to push into fields that have not been explored before. Keep them reaching for a
little bit more responsibility than they can manage. Reward them well when they do manage it.
And your decision is made easier, thanks to the wide range of talents required. Your degree can be a
8.5., M.S., or Ph.D. in: MECHANICAL • AERONAUTICAL • ELECTRICAL • CHEMICAL • CIVIL •
MARINE • INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING • PHYSICS • CHEMISTRY • METALLURGY • MATERIALS
SCIENCE • CERAMICS • MATHEMATICS • STATISTICS • COMPUTER SCIENCE • ENGINEERING
SCIENCE • ENGINEERING MECHANICS.
Consult your college placement officer—or write Mr. William L. Stoner, Engineering Department,
Pratt & Whitney Aircraft, East Hartford, Connecticut 06108.
