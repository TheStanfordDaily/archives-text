rotational or "haphazard" assignments but, instead, formal classroom training geared exactly to your future responsibilities.
start to function, in a few weeks, with independence of action and decision-making authority, with the opportunity to present your decisions to
individuals in all walks of life, including business and civic leaders? Not spend months or years in the back office under close supervision before being
allowed to strike out on your own initiative.
