The Better
Mousetrap
IF you want something more than just a
stereo console, and something less than
a houseful of electronic equipment, see
the KLH : Model Twenty-Four.
The Model Twenty-Four is a complete
stereo music system that plays records, FM
broadcasts, AM too if you wish, plus any
thing (such as a tape recorder) you care to
plug into it. Instead of looking like a
Victorian hope chest or an electrician's
nightmare, it comes in three compact and
unobtrusive walnut cabinets that slip
gracefully into a living room. It won't take
up much of your valuable living space, and
it doesn't take a pilot's license to operate.
But what sets it even further apart from
other stereo equipment is the level of per
formance it delivers. It sounds—believe us
— like twice the price. That's why it's the
best-selling, most-talked-about stereo sys
tem on the market.
Ask anyone who owns KLH stereo equip
ment about its performance and value.
Then seek out the Model Twenty-Four
and judge it critically for yourself.
You won't have trouble finding one in a
store. Just follow that well-beaten path.
