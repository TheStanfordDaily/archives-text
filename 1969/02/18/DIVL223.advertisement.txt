11/ What is the Bethlehem Loop Course? It is our management development program for graduates
v8 with bachelors' or advanced degrees.
V The course starts early in July with four weeks of orientation at our home offices in Bethlehem,
Pa. Loopers attend lectures on every phase of the corporation's activities, and make almost daily
visits to a steel plant.
Steel Plant Loopers, who comprise a majority of the average loop class of 150 to 200 graduates,
proceed to various plants where they go through a brief orientation program before beginning
their on-the-job training assignments. Within a short time after joining the course, most loopers
are ready for assignments aimed toward higher levels of management.
How about other loopers? Our Sales Department loopers (30 or so) remain at the home office for
about a year of training. Most are then assigned to district offices where they take over established
accounts.
Fabricated Steel Construction loopers are trained in a drafting room, on a field erection project,
in a fabricating shop, and in an engineering office. A looper's first work assignment is based on
interests and aptitudes disclosed during this program.
Loopers in Accounting, Shipbuilding, Mining, Research, Traffic, Purchasing, Finance and Law,
General Services, and Industrial and Public Relations go through training programs tailored to
their types of work.

11/ What is the Bethlehem Loop Course? It is our management development program for graduates
v8 with bachelors' or advanced degrees.
V The course starts early in July with four weeks of orientation at our home offices in Bethlehem,
Pa. Loopers attend lectures on every phase of the corporation's activities, and make almost daily
visits to a steel plant.
Steel Plant Loopers, who comprise a majority of the average loop class of 150 to 200 graduates,
proceed to various plants where they go through a brief orientation program before beginning
their on-the-job training assignments. Within a short time after joining the course, most loopers
are ready for assignments aimed toward higher levels of management.
How about other loopers? Our Sales Department loopers (30 or so) remain at the home office for
about a year of training. Most are then assigned to district offices where they take over established
accounts.
Fabricated Steel Construction loopers are trained in a drafting room, on a field erection project,
in a fabricating shop, and in an engineering office. A looper's first work assignment is based on
interests and aptitudes disclosed during this program.
Loopers in Accounting, Shipbuilding, Mining, Research, Traffic, Purchasing, Finance and Law,
General Services, and Industrial and Public Relations go through training programs tailored to
their types of work.
