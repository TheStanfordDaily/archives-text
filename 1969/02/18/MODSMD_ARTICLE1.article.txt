# Research Funds Switches Pressed

### FELICITY BARRINGER 
Four scientists, in the hope of divert
ing federal funds from military research
to more pressing environmental research,
have formed a group called Scientists
for Social and Political Action (SSPA).
Dr. Martin Perl, a physicist at the
Stanford Linear Accelerator Center
(SLAC), and one of the four founders
of the SSPA, outlined the purposes of
the group as falling into three cate
gories.
The first idea is that a large amount
of the federal budget should finance the
research, development and subsidy
needed for solving environmental prob
lems. Perl cited pollution, especially pol
lution caused by farming and industrial
techniques, as a major problem in this
area.
"A tremendous amount of money
will be needed for this research. This
money must come out of the military
budget," Perl added.
Super Weapons Technology
Perl went on to explain the second
purpose of the SSPA, which relates di
rectly to the budget for military re
search. "The military in both the United
States and Russia are building a super
weapons technology," he stated. "There
is a continuous effort to build a new
and larger system.
"As the systems develop, we are get
ting less and less secure. The research
for this goes on irrespective of the
wishes of the people."
The second purpose of the SSPA is,
therefore, to divert some of the money
which finances these escalating arms
programs, into research on environ
mental problems.
The third idea behind the formation
of the SSPA, as described by Perl, is

that research in the natural sciences
should be separated from military com
mitment.
The SSPA was organized four weeks
ago. There have been other groups
organized along these lines in the past,
but these, according to Perl, "didn't get
far." By contrast, the SSPA, despite its
relatively short existence, already in
cludes more than 100 members from all
over the country.
Many of these members joined the
group during a convention of the Ameri
can Physical Society in New York.
Buttons were distributed at the con
vention reading "STOP ABM." A meet
ing of interested people was called and
was attended by 300 people. Of these,
about 100 joined the organization.
Perl stressed that the organization of
the group is concentrated at the local
level, "an attempt to return to grass
roots politics." The local groups are
virtually autonomous, as the national
