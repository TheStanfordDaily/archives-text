## Parents And A Middle Political Void 
### David Frank 
If one examines the distri
bution of students on the political
spectrum at Stanford, what is
most noticeable is the void be
tween conservatism and reaction
on (he right and radicalism on the
left. I will propose a few expla
nations for the lack of liberal in
clinations on campus.
Many students who function as
radicals or fellow travellers at
Stanford are the offspring of con
servative, upper-middle class home
environments. Through high
school education, they were pre
sented with the image of America
as a beneficent giant spreading
idealism to less fortunate cultures.
The dosage of superpatriotism
from the textbook was success
fully reinforced by parental
opinions. Their parents are tradi
tionalists, materialistic, mildly in
tolerant, unwilling to question
many dubious conservative as
sumptions of the superiority of
white America, and generally sus
picious of reforms and reformers.
From this atmosphere of colos
sal indifference to social problems
the students are thrust into a col
lege political scene where most
non-apathetic persons align them
selves with the goals and strategies
of the Left.
They are indeed prone to radi
cal stereotyping of the infamous,
if ambiguous, "Establishment," to
assertions of the total ignorance
of middle-aged white Americans
to the plight of the blacks and the
poor, and to the proposition that
America, as presently structured,
is morally bankrupt.
Susceptability
Their susceptability to these ar
guments can be traced directly to
their former simplistic, anti
intellectual assumptions. Their
only contact with traditional
modes of "American Establish
ment" thought being with status
quo or retrogressive thinking, they
can easily adhere to the stereo
type applied by SDS and others.
After the initial bombardment
of leftist dogma, usually un
adulterated by specifics, a reverse
reaction occurs, especially since
students are only too willing to
make violent turns away from
their parents.

Subscribing to the theory of
moral bankruptcy, of the sheer in
efficacy of reform in a corrupt
system is but one component of
the anti-Establishment bag.
Adopting political attitudes dia
metrically opposed to those of
one's parents is an assertion of
independence and maturity.
Putty
The consequences of this
phenomenon are significant. The
ex-Boys' Scouts and Boys' Staters
are to a great extent putty in the
hands of militants and malcon
tents. Evidence of this predilec
tion for being led anywhere is
available on all fronts.
The political system and its
"entrenched elite" can be faulted
as unrepresentative because of the
convention defeat of everybody's
hero, Gene McCarthy, while the
fact that McCarthy lost 8 of the
11 primaries he contested against
others (including 4 of 5 to
Kennedy) is conveniently ignored.
Eldridge Cleaver can evoke
mass hysteria with his references
to "Meathead Me-too Humphrey"
(who is categorized with Reagan
and Rafferty as equally buffoon
ish), though Humphrey has proba
bly done more in Congress for the
American black than has any
other white man anywhere.
Shifted Stance
From the position of their
parents that a King of a Kennedy
sought too much too soon, they
have shifted to the stance that
King was a Tom and Kennedy a
sellout. (Example of treatment of
elected officials: Pavlovian re
sponse to LBJ as a war criminal
and a racist, overlooking appoint
ments of Clark, Clifford, Cohen,
Fortas, Marshall, and others.)
From not being concerned at
all with human rights problems
and American hegemony, they
have taken the view of a racist,
imperialistic society able to do no
right. They themselves had been
indoctrinated into racism and
materialism, ergo all those who
try to work within the system are
naive. Level of commitment to
the disenfranchised and spat upon
is thought to increase in pro
portion to the degree of radical
persuasion.

It was an interesting experience
to observe the reactions of various
students to Cleaver at Mem Aud.
The more he cursed whites and
cast us as a breed of devils, the
more vigorously a few individuals
applauded.
Catharsis Sought
They sought a catharsis, a
purging of guilt for their former
indifference toward blacks. They
were unsparing in their
masochism, which served to
brutally condemn their parents,
and indirectly their former selves.
In my Racism and Prejudice
section, the TA and most of the
white students were prepared to
accept as gospel any comment
offered by a black student. The
imparting of a perfect perspective
to blacks does them, society, and
oneself a great disservice. It is to
be sure a somewhat more justifi
able idiocy than discrimination,
yet it is still a cop-out to solving
the problem.
Causally Related
I maintain that these two ex
treme positions are causally re
lated. A person raised in a liberal,
tolerant atmosphere and urged to
critically consider the stinking
conditions in the ghettoes and the
reflections of a Malcolm X is
much less likely to revere a black
for his blackness than are the
people being described.
(This is not to argue against the
need for lowering employment
and college admissions standards
to help compensate for 400 years
of degradation, but rather to
recognize that just as being black
is not prima facie evidence of in
feriority, neither is it an auto
matic inculcation of morality or
enlightenment.)
I submit then that many
Leftist-oriented students give no
credence to liberal solutions be
cause they have only been ex
posed to forces on either side of
liberalism. A lack of knowledge
about the system meant graceful
assimilation into the radical move
ment.
The new vantage point looks
out on a mysterious, gray Es
tablishment which cannot and will
not exert a moral force in society,
at a system in which all politicians

are curiously similar, cynical, and
selfish. (Appeal of McCarthy: A
novel concept, a "non-President";
Crime of Kennedy: Wanting to be
President too badly.)
The old vantage point looked
out on a mysterious, gray Es
tablishment unable to stem the
tide of corruption and irresponsi
bility in a too permissive society,
at vices sanctioned by self-serving
politicians. The "uncritical
lovers," rhetoric intact, have be
come "unloving critics."

lovers," rhetoric intact, have be
come "unloving critics."
(David Frank is a sophomore

If one examines the distri
bution of students on the political
spectrum at Stanford, what is
most noticeable is the void be
tween conservatism and reaction
on (he right and radicalism on the
left. I will propose a few expla
nations for the lack of liberal in
clinations on campus.
Many students who function as
radicals or fellow travellers at
Stanford are the offspring of con
servative, upper-middle class home
environments. Through high
school education, they were pre
sented with the image of America
as a beneficent giant spreading
idealism to less fortunate cultures.
The dosage of superpatriotism
from the textbook was success
fully reinforced by parental
opinions. Their parents are tradi
tionalists, materialistic, mildly in
tolerant, unwilling to question
many dubious conservative as
sumptions of the superiority of
white America, and generally sus
picious of reforms and reformers.
From this atmosphere of colos
sal indifference to social problems
the students are thrust into a col
lege political scene where most
non-apathetic persons align them
selves with the goals and strategies
of the Left.
They are indeed prone to radi
cal stereotyping of the infamous,
if ambiguous, "Establishment," to
assertions of the total ignorance
of middle-aged white Americans
to the plight of the blacks and the
poor, and to the proposition that
America, as presently structured,
is morally bankrupt.
Susceptability
Their susceptability to these ar
guments can be traced directly to
their former simplistic, anti
intellectual assumptions. Their
only contact with traditional
modes of "American Establish
ment" thought being with status
quo or retrogressive thinking, they
can easily adhere to the stereo
type applied by SDS and others.
After the initial bombardment
of leftist dogma, usually un
adulterated by specifics, a reverse
reaction occurs, especially since
students are only too willing to
make violent turns away from
their parents.

Subscribing to the theory of
moral bankruptcy, of the sheer in
efficacy of reform in a corrupt
system is but one component of
the anti-Establishment bag.
Adopting political attitudes dia
metrically opposed to those of
one's parents is an assertion of
independence and maturity.
Putty
The consequences of this
phenomenon are significant. The
ex-Boys' Scouts and Boys' Staters
are to a great extent putty in the
hands of militants and malcon
tents. Evidence of this predilec
tion for being led anywhere is
available on all fronts.
The political system and its
"entrenched elite" can be faulted
as unrepresentative because of the
convention defeat of everybody's
hero, Gene McCarthy, while the
fact that McCarthy lost 8 of the
11 primaries he contested against
others (including 4 of 5 to
Kennedy) is conveniently ignored.
Eldridge Cleaver can evoke
mass hysteria with his references
to "Meathead Me-too Humphrey"
(who is categorized with Reagan
and Rafferty as equally buffoon
ish), though Humphrey has proba
bly done more in Congress for the
American black than has any
other white man anywhere.
Shifted Stance
From the position of their
parents that a King of a Kennedy
sought too much too soon, they
have shifted to the stance that
King was a Tom and Kennedy a
sellout. (Example of treatment of
elected officials: Pavlovian re
sponse to LBJ as a war criminal
and a racist, overlooking appoint
ments of Clark, Clifford, Cohen,
Fortas, Marshall, and others.)
From not being concerned at
all with human rights problems
and American hegemony, they
have taken the view of a racist,
imperialistic society able to do no
right. They themselves had been
indoctrinated into racism and
materialism, ergo all those who
try to work within the system are
naive. Level of commitment to
the disenfranchised and spat upon
is thought to increase in pro
portion to the degree of radical
persuasion.

It was an interesting experience
to observe the reactions of various
students to Cleaver at Mem Aud.
The more he cursed whites and
cast us as a breed of devils, the
more vigorously a few individuals
applauded.
Catharsis Sought
They sought a catharsis, a
purging of guilt for their former
indifference toward blacks. They
were unsparing in their
masochism, which served to
brutally condemn their parents,
and indirectly their former selves.
In my Racism and Prejudice
section, the TA and most of the
white students were prepared to
accept as gospel any comment
offered by a black student. The
imparting of a perfect perspective
to blacks does them, society, and
oneself a great disservice. It is to
be sure a somewhat more justifi
able idiocy than discrimination,
yet it is still a cop-out to solving
the problem.
Causally Related
I maintain that these two ex
treme positions are causally re
lated. A person raised in a liberal,
tolerant atmosphere and urged to
critically consider the stinking
conditions in the ghettoes and the
reflections of a Malcolm X is
much less likely to revere a black
for his blackness than are the
people being described.
(This is not to argue against the
need for lowering employment
and college admissions standards
to help compensate for 400 years
of degradation, but rather to
recognize that just as being black
is not prima facie evidence of in
feriority, neither is it an auto
matic inculcation of morality or
enlightenment.)
I submit then that many
Leftist-oriented students give no
credence to liberal solutions be
cause they have only been ex
posed to forces on either side of
liberalism. A lack of knowledge
about the system meant graceful
assimilation into the radical move
ment.
The new vantage point looks
out on a mysterious, gray Es
tablishment which cannot and will
not exert a moral force in society,
at a system in which all politicians

are curiously similar, cynical, and
selfish. (Appeal of McCarthy: A
novel concept, a "non-President";
Crime of Kennedy: Wanting to be
President too badly.)
The old vantage point looked
out on a mysterious, gray Es
tablishment unable to stem the
tide of corruption and irresponsi
bility in a too permissive society,
at vices sanctioned by self-serving
politicians. The "uncritical
lovers," rhetoric intact, have be
come "unloving critics."

If one examines the distri
bution of students on the political
spectrum at Stanford, what is
most noticeable is the void be
tween conservatism and reaction
on (he right and radicalism on the
left. I will propose a few expla
nations for the lack of liberal in
clinations on campus.
Many students who function as
radicals or fellow travellers at
Stanford are the offspring of con
servative, upper-middle class home
environments. Through high
school education, they were pre
sented with the image of America
as a beneficent giant spreading
idealism to less fortunate cultures.
The dosage of superpatriotism
from the textbook was success
fully reinforced by parental
opinions. Their parents are tradi
tionalists, materialistic, mildly in
tolerant, unwilling to question
many dubious conservative as
sumptions of the superiority of
white America, and generally sus
picious of reforms and reformers.
From this atmosphere of colos
sal indifference to social problems
the students are thrust into a col
lege political scene where most
non-apathetic persons align them
selves with the goals and strategies
of the Left.
They are indeed prone to radi
cal stereotyping of the infamous,
if ambiguous, "Establishment," to
assertions of the total ignorance
of middle-aged white Americans
to the plight of the blacks and the
poor, and to the proposition that
America, as presently structured,
is morally bankrupt.
Susceptability
Their susceptability to these ar
guments can be traced directly to
their former simplistic, anti
intellectual assumptions. Their
only contact with traditional
modes of "American Establish
ment" thought being with status
quo or retrogressive thinking, they
can easily adhere to the stereo
type applied by SDS and others.
After the initial bombardment
of leftist dogma, usually un
adulterated by specifics, a reverse
reaction occurs, especially since
students are only too willing to
make violent turns away from
their parents.

Subscribing to the theory of
moral bankruptcy, of the sheer in
efficacy of reform in a corrupt
system is but one component of
the anti-Establishment bag.
Adopting political attitudes dia
metrically opposed to those of
one's parents is an assertion of
independence and maturity.
Putty
The consequences of this
phenomenon are significant. The
ex-Boys' Scouts and Boys' Staters
are to a great extent putty in the
hands of militants and malcon
tents. Evidence of this predilec
tion for being led anywhere is
available on all fronts.
The political system and its
"entrenched elite" can be faulted
as unrepresentative because of the
convention defeat of everybody's
hero, Gene McCarthy, while the
fact that McCarthy lost 8 of the
11 primaries he contested against
others (including 4 of 5 to
Kennedy) is conveniently ignored.
Eldridge Cleaver can evoke
mass hysteria with his references
to "Meathead Me-too Humphrey"
(who is categorized with Reagan
and Rafferty as equally buffoon
ish), though Humphrey has proba
bly done more in Congress for the
American black than has any
other white man anywhere.
Shifted Stance
From the position of their
parents that a King of a Kennedy
sought too much too soon, they
have shifted to the stance that
King was a Tom and Kennedy a
sellout. (Example of treatment of
elected officials: Pavlovian re
sponse to LBJ as a war criminal
and a racist, overlooking appoint
ments of Clark, Clifford, Cohen,
Fortas, Marshall, and others.)
From not being concerned at
all with human rights problems
and American hegemony, they
have taken the view of a racist,
imperialistic society able to do no
right. They themselves had been
indoctrinated into racism and
materialism, ergo all those who
try to work within the system are
naive. Level of commitment to
the disenfranchised and spat upon
is thought to increase in pro
portion to the degree of radical
persuasion.

It was an interesting experience
to observe the reactions of various
students to Cleaver at Mem Aud.
The more he cursed whites and
cast us as a breed of devils, the
more vigorously a few individuals
applauded.
Catharsis Sought
They sought a catharsis, a
purging of guilt for their former
indifference toward blacks. They
were unsparing in their
masochism, which served to
brutally condemn their parents,
and indirectly their former selves.
In my Racism and Prejudice
section, the TA and most of the
white students were prepared to
accept as gospel any comment
offered by a black student. The
imparting of a perfect perspective
to blacks does them, society, and
oneself a great disservice. It is to
be sure a somewhat more justifi
able idiocy than discrimination,
yet it is still a cop-out to solving
the problem.
Causally Related
I maintain that these two ex
treme positions are causally re
lated. A person raised in a liberal,
tolerant atmosphere and urged to
critically consider the stinking
conditions in the ghettoes and the
reflections of a Malcolm X is
much less likely to revere a black
for his blackness than are the
people being described.
(This is not to argue against the
need for lowering employment
and college admissions standards
to help compensate for 400 years
of degradation, but rather to
recognize that just as being black
is not prima facie evidence of in
feriority, neither is it an auto
matic inculcation of morality or
enlightenment.)
I submit then that many
Leftist-oriented students give no
credence to liberal solutions be
cause they have only been ex
posed to forces on either side of
liberalism. A lack of knowledge
about the system meant graceful
assimilation into the radical move
ment.
The new vantage point looks
out on a mysterious, gray Es
tablishment which cannot and will
not exert a moral force in society,
at a system in which all politicians

are curiously similar, cynical, and
selfish. (Appeal of McCarthy: A
novel concept, a "non-President";
Crime of Kennedy: Wanting to be
President too badly.)
The old vantage point looked
out on a mysterious, gray Es
tablishment unable to stem the
tide of corruption and irresponsi
bility in a too permissive society,
