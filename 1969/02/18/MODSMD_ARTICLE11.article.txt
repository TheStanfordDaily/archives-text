# Two Minutes Of Haight
## Illegal Pot 'Spreads Wealth' 
### Tim Haight 
According to CBS News last
fall, somewhere between six and
12 million people in the United
States have turned on with mari
juana. That's a sizeable block of
votes. Compare it to the five
million workers in aerospace and
related defense industries. We
know that they do.
Put this together with a rising
level of research about pot, and it
becomes puzzling why the
sporadic movements to legalize
the drug haven't gathered more
steam.
One of the reasons, of course, is
that pot has become a symbol not
only to those who have turned on,
but to those who haven't. "Pot
smoking" now ranks with
"crazed, pinko, irresponsible, radi
cal, anarchist, Commie, and un-
American." A straight (rigid) per
son would see legalizing grass as
giving in to THEM (us), thereby
threatening his values to the core.
Another reason is equally ob
vious. Most of the people who
would advocate legalizing grass
smoke it. To smoke it, you must
usually possess it. Possession is il
legal. Therefore, a person standing
out for legalizing pot is inviting
arrest, Q.E.D.
This leaves a leadership vacuum
in the movement, into which little
old ladies, ministers, and other
somewhat-above-reproach types
flow.
Underground
Which is fine, except that they
are somewhat compromise
minded, preferring to stress the
inhumaneness of current punish
ments than the basic issue of
man's right to put his head where
he wants. Furthermore, these
people are also the ones busy
about Vietnam, racism, and other
worthy chores. Those who would
specialize in legalizing pot are un
derground.
But the strongest explanation
for the lack of fervor to legalize
marijuana may be that saner heads
have decided it would be a bad
idea. Not so? Does the fact that

American cigarette companies
have purchased large tracts of
grass land in Mexico and patented
the names "Acapulco Gold" and
"Panama Red" let in a bit of
light?
Right. If we legalize grass, we
would not only get regulation and
taxation that would boost the
price sky-high, but we would soon
get corporate-liberal control of
the market. Insurance companies
would include U.S. Highs in their
portfolios. A Stanford trustee
would sit on the board of Ameri
can Trips. God knows what
Howard Hughes would do.
Tax To Defense
And where would all that pot
tax money go? If it is just general
government income, the majority
of it would go for the Defense
(what a funny way to spell "war")
Department. Or perhaps it would
pay for more narcs, to card
minors or issue licenses, which
would have fees.
Of course, this is just the
American way. Exactly. Further
we'd wipe out one of the chief
financial supports of that noble
experiment in social change, the
hip movement. Take its art: The
Grateful Dead was a struggling
local rock group. Along came
Owsley Stanley 111 (is that "the
third" or "three eyes?"), the self
proclaimed, and consequentially,
often-busted "LSD millionaire."
Owsley supported the Dead for
months, allowing their talents to
flower. Other groups have also
profited from groupie dealers.
What a fortunate coincidence
when the avant-garde can find
patrons. It's unknown since the
Borgias and Medicis.

Lots of dealers put their money
into the hip community, either by
directly supporting people, em
ploying a semi-familial group of
people for occasional work, or by
spending a lot of bread for hip art,
clothes, or other crafts. And what
pot user isn't a little dealer at
some time or other? What Ameri
can straight corporation spreads
the wealth so decently?
Now this may sound like ultra
conservative economics—no regu
lation, etc. In a way it is. But
really the nature of the pot and
acid business gives it advantages
for democracy most industries
lack. Most American business is
more like pushing smack.
While it is relatively easy to
smuggle a few kilos across the
border, by far the most usual way
to get grass, it is difficult to do
extremely large bundles. This
means that (1) there is a point of
diminishing returns for the large
smuggler, in terms of risk, and (2)
it doesn't take much to become a
smuggler/high-level dealer on a
small to middle level. These limit
ing factors make a loose network
of moderately large connections
more successul than a corporate
monopoly.
LSD Locals
LSD could be a better mono
poly crop, but it is fairly easy to
make, given the necessary chemi
cals. And we live in an area
blessed by a research-and
development economy, with all
the equipment, information, and
chemicals that implies. Although
syndicate monopolies have re
portedly been tried, they have
been limited by the vast number
of small acid chemists that do

their local thing, plus competition
from other three-letter drugs (e.g.
MDA, PCP, TMA) which are easier
to make than acid, plus all kinds
of legal drugs on the black
market.
By contrast, heroin (smack) re
quires smuggling and a large, if
not too complicated, refining pro
cess, and boasts a concentration
promising decent capital return.
Furthermore, it is habit-forming, a
marketing advantage envied by
many straight American business
men, if we can extrapolate from
Madison Avenue. Finally, most of
the big smack dealers are estab
lished firms on the other side of
generation gap, while most suc
cessful grass and acid dealers are
under thirty.
In response to the conservative
economist, therefore, we might
say, "If all corporate executives
ran their business like psychedelic
drug dealers, we might be able to
do away with government regu
lation. But they keep pushing
smack."
And as long as they go on doing
that, we should keep psychedelics
illegal, so that a lot of people can
get a lid for the price of a good
fifth of Scotch and discounts for
volume, while a lot of marginal
creative people get a piece of the
profits.
On the other hand, it would be
nice if everybody turned on, but
does legalization really have much
to do with that? Can anyone sug
gest an experiment?

cessful grass and acid dealers are
under thirty.
In response to the conservative
economist, therefore, we might
say, "If all corporate executives
ran their business like psychedelic
drug dealers, we might be able to
do away with government regu
lation. But they keep pushing
smack."
And as long as they go on doing
that, we should keep psychedelics
illegal, so that a lot of people can
get a lid for the price of a good
fifth of Scotch and discounts for
volume, while a lot of marginal
creative people get a piece of the
profits.
On the other hand, it would be
nice if everybody turned on, but
does legalization really have much
to do with that? Can anyone sug
gest an experiment?

According to CBS News last
fall, somewhere between six and
12 million people in the United
States have turned on with mari
juana. That's a sizeable block of
votes. Compare it to the five
million workers in aerospace and
related defense industries. We
know that they do.
Put this together with a rising
level of research about pot, and it
becomes puzzling why the
sporadic movements to legalize
the drug haven't gathered more
steam.
One of the reasons, of course, is
that pot has become a symbol not
only to those who have turned on,
but to those who haven't. "Pot
smoking" now ranks with
"crazed, pinko, irresponsible, radi
cal, anarchist, Commie, and un-
American." A straight (rigid) per
son would see legalizing grass as
giving in to THEM (us), thereby
threatening his values to the core.
Another reason is equally ob
vious. Most of the people who
would advocate legalizing grass
smoke it. To smoke it, you must
usually possess it. Possession is il
legal. Therefore, a person standing
out for legalizing pot is inviting
arrest, Q.E.D.
This leaves a leadership vacuum
in the movement, into which little
old ladies, ministers, and other
somewhat-above-reproach types
flow.
Underground
Which is fine, except that they
are somewhat compromise
minded, preferring to stress the
inhumaneness of current punish
ments than the basic issue of
man's right to put his head where
he wants. Furthermore, these
people are also the ones busy
about Vietnam, racism, and other
worthy chores. Those who would
specialize in legalizing pot are un
derground.
But the strongest explanation
for the lack of fervor to legalize
marijuana may be that saner heads
have decided it would be a bad
idea. Not so? Does the fact that

American cigarette companies
have purchased large tracts of
grass land in Mexico and patented
the names "Acapulco Gold" and
"Panama Red" let in a bit of
light?
Right. If we legalize grass, we
would not only get regulation and
taxation that would boost the
price sky-high, but we would soon
get corporate-liberal control of
the market. Insurance companies
would include U.S. Highs in their
portfolios. A Stanford trustee
would sit on the board of Ameri
can Trips. God knows what
Howard Hughes would do.
Tax To Defense
And where would all that pot
tax money go? If it is just general
government income, the majority
of it would go for the Defense
(what a funny way to spell "war")
Department. Or perhaps it would
pay for more narcs, to card
minors or issue licenses, which
would have fees.
Of course, this is just the
American way. Exactly. Further
we'd wipe out one of the chief
financial supports of that noble
experiment in social change, the
hip movement. Take its art: The
Grateful Dead was a struggling
local rock group. Along came
Owsley Stanley 111 (is that "the
third" or "three eyes?"), the self
proclaimed, and consequentially,
often-busted "LSD millionaire."
Owsley supported the Dead for
months, allowing their talents to
flower. Other groups have also
profited from groupie dealers.
What a fortunate coincidence
when the avant-garde can find
patrons. It's unknown since the
Borgias and Medicis.

Lots of dealers put their money
into the hip community, either by
directly supporting people, em
ploying a semi-familial group of
people for occasional work, or by
spending a lot of bread for hip art,
clothes, or other crafts. And what
pot user isn't a little dealer at
some time or other? What Ameri
can straight corporation spreads
the wealth so decently?
Now this may sound like ultra
conservative economics—no regu
lation, etc. In a way it is. But
really the nature of the pot and
acid business gives it advantages
for democracy most industries
lack. Most American business is
more like pushing smack.
While it is relatively easy to
smuggle a few kilos across the
border, by far the most usual way
to get grass, it is difficult to do
extremely large bundles. This
means that (1) there is a point of
diminishing returns for the large
smuggler, in terms of risk, and (2)
it doesn't take much to become a
smuggler/high-level dealer on a
small to middle level. These limit
ing factors make a loose network
of moderately large connections
more successul than a corporate
monopoly.
LSD Locals
LSD could be a better mono
poly crop, but it is fairly easy to
make, given the necessary chemi
cals. And we live in an area
blessed by a research-and
development economy, with all
the equipment, information, and
chemicals that implies. Although
syndicate monopolies have re
portedly been tried, they have
been limited by the vast number
of small acid chemists that do

their local thing, plus competition
from other three-letter drugs (e.g.
MDA, PCP, TMA) which are easier
to make than acid, plus all kinds
of legal drugs on the black
market.
By contrast, heroin (smack) re
quires smuggling and a large, if
not too complicated, refining pro
cess, and boasts a concentration
promising decent capital return.
Furthermore, it is habit-forming, a
marketing advantage envied by
many straight American business
men, if we can extrapolate from
Madison Avenue. Finally, most of
the big smack dealers are estab
lished firms on the other side of
generation gap, while most suc
cessful grass and acid dealers are
under thirty.
In response to the conservative
economist, therefore, we might
say, "If all corporate executives

chemicals that implies. Although
syndicate monopolies have re
portedly been tried, they have
been limited by the vast number
of small acid chemists that do

their local thing, plus competition
from other three-letter drugs (e.g.
MDA, PCP, TMA) which are easier
to make than acid, plus all kinds
of legal drugs on the black
market.
By contrast, heroin (smack) re
quires smuggling and a large, if
not too complicated, refining pro
cess, and boasts a concentration
promising decent capital return.
Furthermore, it is habit-forming, a
marketing advantage envied by
many straight American business
men, if we can extrapolate from
Madison Avenue. Finally, most of
the big smack dealers are estab
lished firms on the other side of
generation gap, while most suc
cessful grass and acid dealers are
under thirty.
In response to the conservative
economist, therefore, we might
say, "If all corporate executives
ran their business like psychedelic
drug dealers, we might be able to
do away with government regu
lation. But they keep pushing
smack."
And as long as they go on doing
that, we should keep psychedelics
illegal, so that a lot of people can
get a lid for the price of a good
fifth of Scotch and discounts for
volume, while a lot of marginal
creative people get a piece of the
profits.
On the other hand, it would be
nice if everybody turned on, but
does legalization really have much
to do with that? Can anyone sug
gest an experiment?

According to CBS News last
fall, somewhere between six and
12 million people in the United
States have turned on with mari
juana. That's a sizeable block of
votes. Compare it to the five
million workers in aerospace and
related defense industries. We
know that they do.
Put this together with a rising
level of research about pot, and it
becomes puzzling why the
sporadic movements to legalize
the drug haven't gathered more
steam.
One of the reasons, of course, is
that pot has become a symbol not
only to those who have turned on,
but to those who haven't. "Pot
smoking" now ranks with
"crazed, pinko, irresponsible, radi
cal, anarchist, Commie, and un-
American." A straight (rigid) per
son would see legalizing grass as
giving in to THEM (us), thereby
threatening his values to the core.
Another reason is equally ob
vious. Most of the people who
would advocate legalizing grass
smoke it. To smoke it, you must
usually possess it. Possession is il
legal. Therefore, a person standing
out for legalizing pot is inviting
arrest, Q.E.D.
This leaves a leadership vacuum
in the movement, into which little
old ladies, ministers, and other
somewhat-above-reproach types
flow.
Underground
Which is fine, except that they
are somewhat compromise
minded, preferring to stress the
inhumaneness of current punish
ments than the basic issue of
man's right to put his head where
he wants. Furthermore, these
people are also the ones busy
about Vietnam, racism, and other
worthy chores. Those who would
specialize in legalizing pot are un
derground.
But the strongest explanation
for the lack of fervor to legalize
marijuana may be that saner heads
have decided it would be a bad
idea. Not so? Does the fact that

American cigarette companies
have purchased large tracts of
grass land in Mexico and patented
the names "Acapulco Gold" and
"Panama Red" let in a bit of
light?
Right. If we legalize grass, we
would not only get regulation and
taxation that would boost the
price sky-high, but we would soon
get corporate-liberal control of
the market. Insurance companies
would include U.S. Highs in their
portfolios. A Stanford trustee
would sit on the board of Ameri
can Trips. God knows what
Howard Hughes would do.
Tax To Defense
And where would all that pot
tax money go? If it is just general
government income, the majority
of it would go for the Defense
(what a funny way to spell "war")
Department. Or perhaps it would
pay for more narcs, to card
minors or issue licenses, which
would have fees.
Of course, this is just the
American way. Exactly. Further
we'd wipe out one of the chief
financial supports of that noble
experiment in social change, the
hip movement. Take its art: The
Grateful Dead was a struggling
local rock group. Along came
Owsley Stanley 111 (is that "the
third" or "three eyes?"), the self
proclaimed, and consequentially,
often-busted "LSD millionaire."
Owsley supported the Dead for
months, allowing their talents to
flower. Other groups have also
profited from groupie dealers.
What a fortunate coincidence
when the avant-garde can find
patrons. It's unknown since the
Borgias and Medicis.

Lots of dealers put their money
into the hip community, either by
directly supporting people, em
ploying a semi-familial group of
people for occasional work, or by
spending a lot of bread for hip art,
clothes, or other crafts. And what
pot user isn't a little dealer at
some time or other? What Ameri
can straight corporation spreads
the wealth so decently?
Now this may sound like ultra
conservative economics—no regu
lation, etc. In a way it is. But
really the nature of the pot and
acid business gives it advantages
for democracy most industries
lack. Most American business is
more like pushing smack.
While it is relatively easy to
smuggle a few kilos across the
border, by far the most usual way
to get grass, it is difficult to do
extremely large bundles. This
means that (1) there is a point of
diminishing returns for the large
smuggler, in terms of risk, and (2)
it doesn't take much to become a
smuggler/high-level dealer on a
small to middle level. These limit
ing factors make a loose network
of moderately large connections
more successul than a corporate
monopoly.
LSD Locals
LSD could be a better mono
poly crop, but it is fairly easy to
make, given the necessary chemi
cals. And we live in an area
blessed by a research-and
development economy, with all
the equipment, information, and
chemicals that implies. Although
syndicate monopolies have re
portedly been tried, they have
been limited by the vast number
