# Letters To The Editor
## Reply To The Oil People 
### 
Editor, THE DAILY:
I read yesterday's letter written
by the Brothers Grey with a great
deal of interest. Since their father
is a vice-president of Standard Oil
of California it's entirely proper
that they should present manage
ment's view of the situation to the
Stanford community.
I don't pretend to know every
thing that's gone on during the oil
strike. In fact, I was mistaken
when I wrote that an 18-month
old child was maced at Richmond.
An 18-month old child was maced
on the picket line at the Martinez
Shell refinery. But last week the
Richmond cops used tear gas on
strikers who were attempting to
prevent trucks from running
through their picket lines. Striking
workers expect other working
men to honor their picket lines.
The Greys have indeed got their
facts straight when they write that
the Richmond workers have
turned down a 60c an hour offer.
You see, they went out on strike
for a 72c raise, a wage increase
which will be outstripped by in
flation before the next two year
contract runs out. And most of
the strikers have been dipping
deeply into their life savings
during the strike.
But much more important than
the financial end is a thing called
collective pride, something most
management siblings, myself
included, have trouble under
standing.
But let's hit the central issue.
Cal Standard made over $500
million in profits last year on sales
of $2 billion. These profits de
pend in large part on the mainten
ance of oligarchies "friendly" to
the US in the oil-producing
countries of the Third World.
Since the profits Standard Oil
pulls back to the US could very
conceivably be used to build
housing, schools, and hospitals for
workers and peasants in under
developed countries, it wouldn't
be quite correct to say that the
Richmond workers are bearing the

brunt of Cal Standard's business
operations. But they have seen
their real wages decline over the
last few war-inflated years.
Cal Standard's profits also de
pend on the 21Vi% oil depletion
allowance which allowed it to get
off with a 1.2% federal tax rate in
1967. The Richmond workers pay
considerably more than this,
especially if you take into account
our regressive tax system and the
surtax.
A final point about Standard's
"progressive" policies. The Greys
forgot to mention that Cal Stand
ard has a profit-sharing plan for
older workers as well as the
highly-publicized training program
for "disadvantaged blacks." I'm
not arguing that the Standard
board room is a den of cigar
smoking ogres. I would point out
that Standard knows it's good
business to tie the workers as
closely to the company as possi
ble.
Standard Oil must know by
now that strikes which bring stu
dents and workers together on the
picket line clearly have the poten
tial for generating more radical
and just demands in the future.
Imagine the social improvements
the Venezuelan and American
working classes could make with
Cal Standard's yearly profit haul
of $500 million. You might even
find the Stanford Graduate
School of Business training
workers to make the pricing, pro
duction, and investment decisions
that Father Grey now makes.

• ROTC Supporters Named
Editor, THE DAILY:
Concerning resolution nine
which will appear on the ballot on
Tuesday and Wednesday of this
week, about the status of ROTC
on campus, I would like to say
that it is very ambiguous. In my
eyes it could be used to support

either the majority or minority re
ports about the recommended
status of ROTC on campus, de
pending on how one looks at it
and wants to twist the words.
Unsure of what the result
would be if the resolution were
passed, I did a bit of sleuthing and
found out? that the resolution is
supported by ROTC, YAF, and
the Young Republicans.
On the assumption that support
of the resolution will not be used
in support of the majority report,
I now know which way I shall
vote.

• Liberty & Fraternity
Editor, THE DAILY:
Four years ago today, four
persons were arrested in New
York on charges of plotting to
blow up the Statue of Liberty, the
Liberty Bell and the Washington
Monument. Today is Tuesday,
February 18, 1969. Tomorrow is
Wednesday. This is relevant.
Needless to say, I found your
editorial 'Rush to Relevance'
stifling. I am disappointed and
weary. The university itself is like
an island, isolated from society's
pressing problems. Students here
are typically apathetic. They
don't want to know one another,
they don't want to initiate or ex
change ideas, but they enjoy
screaming at each other. That's
relevant.
When you get tired of scream
ing, you might attempt to partici
pate in a fraternity meal exchange
and discuss it there, or sign up for
a residence seminar in one of the
houses. That is, if you have the
courage to strip your cloak of in
sensitivity and ignorance.
Communication is sorely
needed at this university. I urge
students to demand that this
paper prove its relevance. It has
failed to do it adequately thus far.
I write this letter "skeptically but
with open eyes."
Theme: You and I need to
communicate and dispel common
ly perpetuated myths. I accept
any news at 328-6538.
