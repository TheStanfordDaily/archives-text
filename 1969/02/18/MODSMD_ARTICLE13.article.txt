## Out Of Touch 
### Tom Goodhue 
Somewhere in my past I lost all
contact with my body. My mind
became separate from my body
and better than it. The body be
came simply a thing which carried
my mouth, eyes, ears and brain
around from place to place to en
gage in detached discourse with
other mouths, eyes, ears and
brains.
I was proud of its height, but
vaguely ashamed of the muscles
that weren't quite strong enough
and the limbs that weren't quite
co-ordinated enough.
And somewhere in my past I
learned that the part of my head
that produced thoughts was better
than the part of it which had feel
ings. Therefore my thoughts
should control my emotions, de
ciding which feelings were "con
structive" and therefore accept
able and which were "destructive"
and therefore invalid.
Emotions should be expressed
only if they were nice, construc
tive, and logical. To become
mature was to become more and
more isolated from my emotions,
letting them influence my de
cisions less and less. In order to
succeed, I learned, it was neces
sary to hide non-functional feel
ings.
In high school debate, admit
ting fear meant failure; I had to
keep my emotions under tight
rein to win. Honesty reveals weak
ness and weakness means un
worthiness.
And somewhere in my past I
stopped knowing what my feel
ings were. When I stopped ex
pressing anger—because, after all,
anger is not very nice—l started to
tell myself that I really wasn't
angry.
After I condemned jealousy for
being irrational I stopped admit
ting that I ever felt jealous. And a
few nights ago as I reached out in
the darkness to touch a girl I
realized that I didn't even know
what I wanted from her.
My head was so filled with
questions like—what will she
think, what will she do, what will
happen then, what will be the

consequences—that I didn't even
know what desires I had.
Analysis prevented knowledge:
afraid of how my drives and de
sires might explode if I admitted
them, I found analysis much safer
than feeling. No wonder I'm lost.
What I say may be true of you.
It may be true of everyone in this
academic ghetto. Maybe it's true
of everyone in the Great Ameri
can Middle Class. Maybe these
problems all trace back to my
childhood or maybe I just ac
quired them recently. What mat
ters much more, however, is
where I'm going to go from here.
I've gotten through the mind
body dichetomy with sensory
awareness training and by trying
to communicate by touching. And
it feels very good to be back in
touch with my body and to be
able to touch and be touched.
I've learned to express a lot of
feelings I used to hide through
role-playing (like psychodrama,
only a little more gentle) and a
little help from my friends. And
this feels good.
But uncovering the wants and
desires I'm not even aware of is
much more difficult. I know, for
example, that there are big gaps of
loneliness and isolation in my life
and that I want very desperately
to be close to others mentally,
emotionally and physically.
Yet whenever I'm with any one
particular person, this gets ob
scured. Too often when I'm with
a girl I respond to her problems
with intellectual constructs and to
her feelings with detached
analysis.
What I want is lost in a deluge
of thoughts. I don't allow myself
to feel my drives until I have
made a judgment as to what is
possible. It is not that I want to
blindly follow my drives, but I
must at least know what they are.
I feel helplessly trapped in a
whirling brain, unable to stop the
rush of excess analysis. I want to
know what I want—maybe just
saying that is a beginning.
But still, where do I go from
here?

blindly follow my drives, but I
must at least know what they are.
I feel helplessly trapped in a
whirling brain, unable to stop the
rush of excess analysis. I want to

saying that is a beginning.
But still, where do I go from
here?
(Tom Goodhue is a sopho

Somewhere in my past I lost all
contact with my body. My mind
became separate from my body
and better than it. The body be
came simply a thing which carried
my mouth, eyes, ears and brain
around from place to place to en
gage in detached discourse with
other mouths, eyes, ears and
brains.
I was proud of its height, but
vaguely ashamed of the muscles
that weren't quite strong enough
and the limbs that weren't quite
co-ordinated enough.
And somewhere in my past I
learned that the part of my head
that produced thoughts was better
than the part of it which had feel
ings. Therefore my thoughts
should control my emotions, de
ciding which feelings were "con
structive" and therefore accept
able and which were "destructive"
and therefore invalid.
Emotions should be expressed
only if they were nice, construc
tive, and logical. To become
mature was to become more and
more isolated from my emotions,
letting them influence my de
cisions less and less. In order to
succeed, I learned, it was neces
sary to hide non-functional feel
ings.
In high school debate, admit
ting fear meant failure; I had to
keep my emotions under tight
rein to win. Honesty reveals weak
ness and weakness means un
worthiness.
And somewhere in my past I
stopped knowing what my feel
ings were. When I stopped ex
pressing anger—because, after all,
anger is not very nice—l started to
tell myself that I really wasn't
angry.
After I condemned jealousy for
being irrational I stopped admit
ting that I ever felt jealous. And a
few nights ago as I reached out in
the darkness to touch a girl I
realized that I didn't even know
what I wanted from her.
My head was so filled with
questions like—what will she
think, what will she do, what will
happen then, what will be the

consequences—that I didn't even
know what desires I had.
Analysis prevented knowledge:
afraid of how my drives and de
sires might explode if I admitted
them, I found analysis much safer
than feeling. No wonder I'm lost.
What I say may be true of you.
It may be true of everyone in this
academic ghetto. Maybe it's true
of everyone in the Great Ameri
can Middle Class. Maybe these
problems all trace back to my
childhood or maybe I just ac
quired them recently. What mat
ters much more, however, is
where I'm going to go from here.
I've gotten through the mind
body dichetomy with sensory
awareness training and by trying
to communicate by touching. And
it feels very good to be back in
touch with my body and to be
able to touch and be touched.
I've learned to express a lot of
feelings I used to hide through
role-playing (like psychodrama,
only a little more gentle) and a
little help from my friends. And
this feels good.
But uncovering the wants and
desires I'm not even aware of is
much more difficult. I know, for
example, that there are big gaps of
loneliness and isolation in my life
and that I want very desperately
to be close to others mentally,
emotionally and physically.
Yet whenever I'm with any one
particular person, this gets ob
scured. Too often when I'm with
a girl I respond to her problems
with intellectual constructs and to
her feelings with detached
analysis.
What I want is lost in a deluge
of thoughts. I don't allow myself
to feel my drives until I have
made a judgment as to what is
possible. It is not that I want to
blindly follow my drives, but I
must at least know what they are.
I feel helplessly trapped in a
whirling brain, unable to stop the
rush of excess analysis. I want to
