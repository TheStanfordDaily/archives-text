# SCLC Considers Proposals For Campus Disruption Policy
## 
### KIM THORBURN 
The Student Conduct Legisla
tive Council (SCLC) continued its
consideration of proposals for a
campus disruption policy Sunday
night. In an open meeting mem
bers of the audience were able to
contribute their ideas on three
proposals which had previously
been presented to the Council or
to introduce their own ideas.
Chairman Gene Yates opened
the meeting by explaining SCLC
and its purpose. It was formed
under the 1968 Judicial Charter.
Its purpose is to make new laws,
interpret existing laws, set maxi
mum penalties for violations of its
laws, and initiate amendments
to the Legislative and Judicial
Charters.
Tim Logan, member of the
Campus Committee Against Police
Harassment, challenged the juris
diction of the Council in areas
covered by a disruption policy
such as demonstrations and build
ings' destruction. His contention
was that the University is not a
sanctuary and is under the juris
diction of state and federal laws.
Therefore, a student convicted
under an SCLC disruption policy
could challenge it in a state or
federal court.
Braunstein Disagrees
Logan's opponents, led by
LASSU speaker Yale Braunstein,
contended that SCLC should
make a rule on campus disrup
tions in order to protect student
rights. It was argued that it would
be better to have the University
handle its problems than outside
police.
Other members of the Council

disagree with Logan because state
and federal courts could not expel
or suspend a student from the
University. Professor Robert
Gerhard of the Law School argued
that the threat of expulsion or
suspension would be a greater
deterrent to a student than any
penalty a state or federal court
might impose.
The concluding discussion cen
tered on the three versions of pro
posals now being considered by
SCLC. These are:
Version One
It is the obligation of all mem
bers of the University community
not to:
1. Cause physical harm or a
substantial risk of physical harm
to any person;
2. Destroy or damage the prop
erty of any person or of the Uni
versity;
3. Prevent the use by any per
son of any necessary means of ac
cess to any place to which such a
person has a legal right of access;
4. Prevent the effective enjoy
ment of private residential prop
erty ; or
5. Prevent the effective con
duct of any activity by any person
or group which such person or
group has a legal right to conduct.
Any intentional or reckless
breach of such obligations by any
person is a violation of the rules
of the SCLC, for which such per
son may be subject to a disciplin
ary hearing before the Stanford
Judicial Council and to a disciplin
ary action prescribed by the said
Council.
Version Two
It is the obligation of all mem
bers of the University community
not to:
1. Cause a harmful or substan
tially offensive physical contact,
or a substantial risk of harmful
contact with any person;
Items 2 through 5 are as in Ver
sion One.
Version Three
It is the obligation of all mem

bers of the University community
not to:
1. Cause a harmful or substan
tially offensive physical contact,
or a substantial risk or reasonable
apprehension of immediate harm
ful contact with any person;
2. Seize, occupy for the pur
poses of disruption, destroy or
damage the property of any per
son or of the University;
3. Interfere with the use by
any person of the ordinary means
of access to any place to which
such a person has a legal right of
access;
4. Interfere with the effective
enjoyment of private residential
property; or
5. Interfere with the effective
conduct of any activity by any
person or group which such per
son or group has a legal right to
conduct.
Any intentional or reckless
breach of such obligations by any
person is a violation of the rules
of the SCLC, for which such per
son may be subject to a disciplin
ary hearing before the Stanford
Judicial Council and to a disciplin
ary action prescribed by the said
Council.
Prefer Version 3
The majority of those present
in the audience preferred Version
111 because it most clearly defines
the violations. Opponents of Ver
sion 111 argued that it limited a
student's freedom too much.
Braunstein emphasized that its
language was too technical.
It was suggested that a clause
concerning inflammatory speech
be added to the proposals.
SCLC will hold its next meeting
Wednesday night from 7:30 to
10:30.

Braunstein emphasized that its
language was too technical.
It was suggested that a clause
concerning inflammatory speech
be added to the proposals.
SCLC will hold its next meeting
Wednesday night from 7:30 to
10:30.
The Student Conduct Legisla
tive Council (SCLC) continued its
consideration of proposals for a
campus disruption policy Sunday
night. In an open meeting mem
bers of the audience were able to
contribute their ideas on three
proposals which had previously
been presented to the Council or
to introduce their own ideas.
Chairman Gene Yates opened
the meeting by explaining SCLC
and its purpose. It was formed
under the 1968 Judicial Charter.
Its purpose is to make new laws,
interpret existing laws, set maxi
mum penalties for violations of its
laws, and initiate amendments
to the Legislative and Judicial
Charters.
Tim Logan, member of the
Campus Committee Against Police
Harassment, challenged the juris
diction of the Council in areas
covered by a disruption policy
such as demonstrations and build
ings' destruction. His contention
was that the University is not a
sanctuary and is under the juris
diction of state and federal laws.
Therefore, a student convicted
under an SCLC disruption policy
could challenge it in a state or
federal court.
Braunstein Disagrees
Logan's opponents, led by
LASSU speaker Yale Braunstein,
contended that SCLC should
make a rule on campus disrup
tions in order to protect student
rights. It was argued that it would
be better to have the University
handle its problems than outside
police.
Other members of the Council

disagree with Logan because state
and federal courts could not expel
or suspend a student from the
University. Professor Robert
Gerhard of the Law School argued
that the threat of expulsion or
suspension would be a greater
deterrent to a student than any
penalty a state or federal court
might impose.
The concluding discussion cen
tered on the three versions of pro
posals now being considered by
SCLC. These are:
Version One
It is the obligation of all mem
bers of the University community
not to:
1. Cause physical harm or a
substantial risk of physical harm
to any person;
2. Destroy or damage the prop
erty of any person or of the Uni
versity;
3. Prevent the use by any per
son of any necessary means of ac
cess to any place to which such a
person has a legal right of access;
4. Prevent the effective enjoy
ment of private residential prop
erty ; or
5. Prevent the effective con
duct of any activity by any person
or group which such person or
group has a legal right to conduct.
Any intentional or reckless
breach of such obligations by any
person is a violation of the rules
of the SCLC, for which such per
son may be subject to a disciplin
ary hearing before the Stanford
Judicial Council and to a disciplin
ary action prescribed by the said
Council.
Version Two
It is the obligation of all mem
bers of the University community
not to:
1. Cause a harmful or substan
tially offensive physical contact,
or a substantial risk of harmful
contact with any person;
Items 2 through 5 are as in Ver
sion One.
Version Three
It is the obligation of all mem

bers of the University community
not to:
1. Cause a harmful or substan
tially offensive physical contact,
or a substantial risk or reasonable
apprehension of immediate harm
ful contact with any person;
2. Seize, occupy for the pur
poses of disruption, destroy or
damage the property of any per
son or of the University;
3. Interfere with the use by
any person of the ordinary means
of access to any place to which
such a person has a legal right of
access;
4. Interfere with the effective
enjoyment of private residential
property; or
5. Interfere with the effective
conduct of any activity by any
person or group which such per
son or group has a legal right to
conduct.
Any intentional or reckless
breach of such obligations by any
person is a violation of the rules
of the SCLC, for which such per
son may be subject to a disciplin
ary hearing before the Stanford
Judicial Council and to a disciplin
ary action prescribed by the said
Council.
Prefer Version 3
The majority of those present
in the audience preferred Version
111 because it most clearly defines
the violations. Opponents of Ver
sion 111 argued that it limited a
student's freedom too much.
Braunstein emphasized that its
