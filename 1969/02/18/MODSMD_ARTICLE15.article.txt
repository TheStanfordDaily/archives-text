# Students Will Help Recruit
## 
### 
As a result of the SES Report
on Undergraduate Admissions and
Aid and talks with the Admissions
Office, Stanford Student-Alumni
association will assume an in
creased part of the University's
contact with high school students,
counselors, and administrators
throughout the country, and
especially within northern Cali
fornia.
High School Contact
To achieve their objectives
Christopher Murlas, President of
the Association, announced their
plans to:
Travel to high schools within
and outside of the Bay Area both
during the academic year and over
the interims.
Contact other high schools by
mail to achieve similar aims.
Communicate and work with
Stanford Alumni Clubs on im
portant responsibilities they could
ftssume in the recruitment process.
Draft a new Undergraduate at
Stanford (as called for in the SES
Report) which could then be dis
tributed to applicants.
This move comes after sub
stantial consideration of the ex
tremely important contributions
that individual Stanford students
have made to the University's re
cruitment process to date. "In the
past few years we have become
increasingly concerned and inter
ested in extending t u University
to a larger and substantially more
diverse population of secondary
school students," Murlas stated.
"The fruition of the 'Associ
ates' small attempts in large part
has been due to our familiarity
with their problems and interests
as well as our endeavors not to
proselytize, but rather to expose
the problems and the challenges in
addition to the opportunities that
exist at Stanford."
Student Associates
Murlas also announced plans to
slightly expand the size, represen
tation, and capabilities of his or
ganization to "some 75-100 stu
dents such that there be at least a
few 'Associates' for every section
of the country."
"In order to be effectively rep
resentative we trust more mem
bers from the minority groups will
continue to join with us. In the
near future we shall also begin a
series of informational and dis
cussion sessions, similar to the
Special Seminar series we are co
sponsoring at Lambda Nu Fra
ternity this quarter, such that the
active membership of the Associ
ation be well informed."
Applications for membership in
the Stanford Student-Alumni
Association will be available at
Bowman Alumni House, February
18-25 th.
