## ACT Presents A Potpourri Of Old Cliches On Slavery 
### GAIL ANDERSON 
I'm glad I went to see the
American Conservatory Theatre's
production of Martin Duberman's
In White America, instead of send
ing another reviewer. It might
have ruined ACT for him, and
that would be a shame.
The play is a white liberal's
history of the black man in Amer
ica, aborted into a pseudo-vaude
ville form. Songs, short scenes and
quotations from notables from
Thomas Jefferson to Eldridge
Cleaver compose this episodic
documentary in (white) wolf's
clothing, which creeps onto stage
flagellating itself and roars out
with all the fury of Richard Nixon
quoting Martin Luther King.
ACT's production is, among
other things, uneven. Time after
time we see the longsuffering

black man gossiping about slavery,
weeping over it, occasionally re
belling against the outrageous
bigotry of the white; then sud
denly smiling faces mouth Cleaver
and Dick Gregory and proceed to
tell us, in that sweet way that
makes us all feel comfortable, that
the struggle is not over, and end in
a rousing song about soldiers
marching valiantly on.
Blatant Stereotypes
It doesn't come off. One knows
the play is trying to slip in black
power in an effort to contempor
ize itself, but one doesn't believe a
word of it. Somehow the blatant
stereotypes (from slave dialect to
KKK rhetoric) serve to obscure
rather than point up racial con
flict; and I doubt very much that
this was either the author's or
director Nagle Jackson's inten
tion.
Characterization in the play is
also uneven. One is unable to tell
whether the director meant his
actors to form a troupe playing
different roles, or simply to repre
sent Black and White and deliver
their speeches from behind a face
less mask of race. Whichever it is,
he does not succeed. The actors
all young, mostly new to ACT—
instead play their respective roles
with uncertain differentiations
which can only be called ama
teurish: one has a sense that not
even they are sure whether they
are supposed to be characters or
orators. And even if one supposed
that such a median was the direc
tor's intent, the fact that one
notices the unevenness and un
certainty shows that it simply
does not work.
When Kenneth Gray comes on
as Thomas Jefferson (are you suit
ably shocked to discover he was a
racist?) his manner and speech
tone seem quite right for that
characterization; then he changes
character and one sees that he
plays all his roles almost the same
way, and one is disappointed.

John Hancock rolls his eyes and
laughs characteristically as he
plays a slave; but he uses almost
the same caricature as Nat Turner
and Martin Luther King. It is al
most the character of the "col
ored" servant in a 1940's movie;
and one is offended by its pre
dominance.
Eileen Ramsey is amusing but
unconvincing as Sojourner Truth;
although she overacts as the girl
trying to enroll in Central High,
one is more inclined to believe her
as a hysterical 15-year-old girl
than as a sharp and lively old
woman. But this may be more due
to lack of experience than to un
clear direction.
The play's basic fault, however,
is anachronistic sentimentality to
the point of being insulting. In
1963, say, it might have been per
fect for white liberals seeking to
soothe their consciences by whip
ping themselves. But a good deal
has happened since 1963.
Sense of Anarchronism
The bulk of the play is about
slavery, with all the old cliches:
black "I'd rather be free with
worries than a slave with none."
(??); and white—"Why should we,
who are capable of better things,
work with our hands while there
are niggahs around who cain't do
anything else?" One has a con
stant sense of viewing an anach
ronism, and a predictably senti
mental one. Martin Luther King
speaks: "Let freedom ring . . ."
and a shot rings out over the
theatre. But you knew that was
coming, didn't you?

And even as the play mocks the
white view of the black, it pre
sents it: the black man is always
long suffering but passionate,
fervently religious and given to
singing spirituals and old freedom
songs. The roles of black and
white are so stereotyped that one
cannot believe, cannot sense the
injustices and horrors perpetrated
by racial hatred. One only sees it,
with an intellectual distance set
up to produce self-righteous intel
lectual masochism.
And of course, the middle-aged
audience loved it. They wish it
were still 1963; one almost ex
pects them to rise and sing "We
Shall Overcome." They weep
when the black soldiers sing
"America"and suitably hate the
white woman (Phyllis Rice) in her
supercilious bigotry (or attempts
thereat).
Suppositions . . .
One wonders how the students
at Ravenswood High School will
react to the play when ACT brings
it to them next month.
Or am I just trying my damned
est not to be a "white liberal"?
Two comments from the aud
ience to encapsulate the play:
"Wasn't it wonderful!" effused a
large white-haired San Francisco
matron emerging from the the
atre.
I tended more to agree with an
anonymous student sitting behind
me in the audience when he said,
"The last time I came here I
thought I was sitting in a dead
spot, but now I know the dead
spot is the stage."

1963, say, it might have been per
fect for white liberals seeking to
soothe their consciences by whip
ping themselves. But a good deal
has happened since 1963.
Sense of Anarchronism
The bulk of the play is about
slavery, with all the old cliches:
black "I'd rather be free with
worries than a slave with none."
(??); and white—"Why should we,
who are capable of better things,
work with our hands while there
are niggahs around who cain't do
anything else?" One has a con
stant sense of viewing an anach
ronism, and a predictably senti
mental one. Martin Luther King
speaks: "Let freedom ring . . ."
and a shot rings out over the
theatre. But you knew that was
coming, didn't you?

And even as the play mocks the
white view of the black, it pre
sents it: the black man is always
long suffering but passionate,
fervently religious and given to
singing spirituals and old freedom
songs. The roles of black and
white are so stereotyped that one
cannot believe, cannot sense the
injustices and horrors perpetrated
by racial hatred. One only sees it,
with an intellectual distance set
up to produce self-righteous intel
lectual masochism.
And of course, the middle-aged
audience loved it. They wish it
were still 1963; one almost ex
pects them to rise and sing "We
Shall Overcome." They weep
when the black soldiers sing
"America"and suitably hate the
white woman (Phyllis Rice) in her
supercilious bigotry (or attempts
thereat).
Suppositions . . .
One wonders how the students
at Ravenswood High School will
react to the play when ACT brings
it to them next month.
Or am I just trying my damned
est not to be a "white liberal"?
Two comments from the aud
ience to encapsulate the play:
"Wasn't it wonderful!" effused a
large white-haired San Francisco
matron emerging from the the
atre.
I tended more to agree with an
anonymous student sitting behind
me in the audience when he said,
"The last time I came here I
thought I was sitting in a dead
spot, but now I know the dead
spot is the stage."
I'm glad I went to see the
American Conservatory Theatre's
production of Martin Duberman's
In White America, instead of send
ing another reviewer. It might
have ruined ACT for him, and
that would be a shame.
The play is a white liberal's
history of the black man in Amer
ica, aborted into a pseudo-vaude
ville form. Songs, short scenes and
quotations from notables from
Thomas Jefferson to Eldridge
Cleaver compose this episodic
documentary in (white) wolf's
clothing, which creeps onto stage
flagellating itself and roars out
with all the fury of Richard Nixon
quoting Martin Luther King.
ACT's production is, among
other things, uneven. Time after
time we see the longsuffering

black man gossiping about slavery,
weeping over it, occasionally re
belling against the outrageous
bigotry of the white; then sud
denly smiling faces mouth Cleaver
and Dick Gregory and proceed to
tell us, in that sweet way that
makes us all feel comfortable, that
the struggle is not over, and end in
a rousing song about soldiers
marching valiantly on.
Blatant Stereotypes
It doesn't come off. One knows
the play is trying to slip in black
power in an effort to contempor
ize itself, but one doesn't believe a
word of it. Somehow the blatant
stereotypes (from slave dialect to
KKK rhetoric) serve to obscure
rather than point up racial con
flict; and I doubt very much that
this was either the author's or
director Nagle Jackson's inten
tion.
Characterization in the play is
also uneven. One is unable to tell
whether the director meant his
actors to form a troupe playing
different roles, or simply to repre
sent Black and White and deliver
their speeches from behind a face
less mask of race. Whichever it is,
he does not succeed. The actors
all young, mostly new to ACT—
instead play their respective roles
with uncertain differentiations
which can only be called ama
teurish: one has a sense that not
even they are sure whether they
are supposed to be characters or
orators. And even if one supposed
that such a median was the direc
tor's intent, the fact that one
notices the unevenness and un
certainty shows that it simply
does not work.
When Kenneth Gray comes on
as Thomas Jefferson (are you suit
ably shocked to discover he was a
racist?) his manner and speech
tone seem quite right for that
characterization; then he changes
character and one sees that he
plays all his roles almost the same
way, and one is disappointed.

John Hancock rolls his eyes and
laughs characteristically as he
plays a slave; but he uses almost
the same caricature as Nat Turner
and Martin Luther King. It is al
most the character of the "col
ored" servant in a 1940's movie;
and one is offended by its pre
dominance.
Eileen Ramsey is amusing but
unconvincing as Sojourner Truth;
although she overacts as the girl
trying to enroll in Central High,
one is more inclined to believe her
as a hysterical 15-year-old girl
than as a sharp and lively old
woman. But this may be more due
to lack of experience than to un
clear direction.
The play's basic fault, however,
is anachronistic sentimentality to
the point of being insulting. In

Blatant Stereotypes
It doesn't come off. One knows
the play is trying to slip in black
power in an effort to contempor
ize itself, but one doesn't believe a
word of it. Somehow the blatant
stereotypes (from slave dialect to
KKK rhetoric) serve to obscure
rather than point up racial con
flict; and I doubt very much that
this was either the author's or
director Nagle Jackson's inten
tion.
Characterization in the play is
also uneven. One is unable to tell
whether the director meant his
actors to form a troupe playing
different roles, or simply to repre
sent Black and White and deliver
their speeches from behind a face
less mask of race. Whichever it is,
he does not succeed. The actors
all young, mostly new to ACT—
instead play their respective roles
with uncertain differentiations
which can only be called ama
teurish: one has a sense that not
even they are sure whether they
are supposed to be characters or
orators. And even if one supposed
that such a median was the direc
tor's intent, the fact that one
notices the unevenness and un
certainty shows that it simply
does not work.
When Kenneth Gray comes on
as Thomas Jefferson (are you suit
ably shocked to discover he was a
racist?) his manner and speech
tone seem quite right for that
characterization; then he changes
character and one sees that he
plays all his roles almost the same
way, and one is disappointed.

John Hancock rolls his eyes and
laughs characteristically as he
plays a slave; but he uses almost
the same caricature as Nat Turner
and Martin Luther King. It is al
most the character of the "col
ored" servant in a 1940's movie;
and one is offended by its pre
dominance.
Eileen Ramsey is amusing but
unconvincing as Sojourner Truth;
although she overacts as the girl
trying to enroll in Central High,
one is more inclined to believe her
as a hysterical 15-year-old girl
than as a sharp and lively old
woman. But this may be more due
to lack of experience than to un
clear direction.
The play's basic fault, however,
is anachronistic sentimentality to
the point of being insulting. In
1963, say, it might have been per
fect for white liberals seeking to
soothe their consciences by whip
ping themselves. But a good deal
has happened since 1963.
Sense of Anarchronism
The bulk of the play is about
slavery, with all the old cliches:
black "I'd rather be free with
worries than a slave with none."
(??); and white—"Why should we,
who are capable of better things,
work with our hands while there
are niggahs around who cain't do
anything else?" One has a con
stant sense of viewing an anach
ronism, and a predictably senti
mental one. Martin Luther King
speaks: "Let freedom ring . . ."
and a shot rings out over the
theatre. But you knew that was
coming, didn't you?

And even as the play mocks the
white view of the black, it pre
sents it: the black man is always
long suffering but passionate,
fervently religious and given to
singing spirituals and old freedom
songs. The roles of black and
white are so stereotyped that one
cannot believe, cannot sense the
injustices and horrors perpetrated
by racial hatred. One only sees it,
with an intellectual distance set
up to produce self-righteous intel
lectual masochism.
And of course, the middle-aged
audience loved it. They wish it
were still 1963; one almost ex
pects them to rise and sing "We
Shall Overcome." They weep
when the black soldiers sing
"America"and suitably hate the
white woman (Phyllis Rice) in her
supercilious bigotry (or attempts
thereat).
Suppositions . . .
One wonders how the students
at Ravenswood High School will
react to the play when ACT brings
it to them next month.
Or am I just trying my damned
est not to be a "white liberal"?
Two comments from the aud
ience to encapsulate the play:
"Wasn't it wonderful!" effused a
large white-haired San Francisco
matron emerging from the the
atre.
I tended more to agree with an
anonymous student sitting behind
me in the audience when he said,
"The last time I came here I
thought I was sitting in a dead
spot, but now I know the dead
spot is the stage."
I'm glad I went to see the
American Conservatory Theatre's
production of Martin Duberman's
In White America, instead of send
ing another reviewer. It might
have ruined ACT for him, and
that would be a shame.
The play is a white liberal's
history of the black man in Amer
ica, aborted into a pseudo-vaude
ville form. Songs, short scenes and
quotations from notables from
Thomas Jefferson to Eldridge
Cleaver compose this episodic
documentary in (white) wolf's
clothing, which creeps onto stage
flagellating itself and roars out
with all the fury of Richard Nixon
quoting Martin Luther King.
ACT's production is, among
other things, uneven. Time after
time we see the longsuffering

black man gossiping about slavery,
weeping over it, occasionally re
belling against the outrageous
bigotry of the white; then sud
denly smiling faces mouth Cleaver
and Dick Gregory and proceed to
tell us, in that sweet way that
makes us all feel comfortable, that
the struggle is not over, and end in
a rousing song about soldiers
marching valiantly on.
