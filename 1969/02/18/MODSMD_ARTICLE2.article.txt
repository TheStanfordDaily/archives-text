# State Chancellor Raps Disruptions
## 
### CICELY BATES 
In a rapidly read Law School speech
that was punctuated by audience heck
ling, California State College Chancellor
Glen Dumke yesterday outlined the
problems faced by the 19-college net
work he commands.
The present disturbances at San Fran
cisco State and other colleges are due to
a crisis that has developed from the
"problems of man in governing him
self," began Dumke to about 100
people at an afternoon Law Forum
meeting.
The problem of government in the
academic community stems from the
dual purpose of the state colleges.
"State colleges are instruments of
society created and supported by
people," Dumke said. "The board of
trustees was created to keep this con
nection." But at the same time, the col
lege system is a "society of scholars"
that should "serve the ends of intellect
and learning."
Colleges have these two ends of
service, and the people in them "have
the obligation to live within their rules
or to change them through peaceful and
legal channels" emphasized the Chancel
lor. "No one has the right to be a citizen
of the academic community. It is a
"privilege" accorded those who "meet
admission standards" and who live
"within its rules," continued Dumke.
SF State Explained
Examining the current disturbances
at San Francisco State, Dumke felt that
the students were deciding which laws
to obey and which to ignore. When the
law is not recognized, "we move toward
anarchy," he said.
"I don't think the public is sympa
thetic to the teacher's plight," declared
Dumke in connection to the AFT-CIO

teacher strike. "It is unlawful . . . ill
timed . . . injurious to the academic pro
fession . . . and a failure," he stated.
Because these teachers fail to obey
the "law of the land," they have "alien
ated the public and have encouraged
punitive legislation" to come before the
state legislature.
"Legal Mumble Jumble"
Another effect of the riots has been
the creation of much "legal mumble
jumble" Dumke stated. He felt that the
students were using legal trappings in
their demand for "due process" to bring
about a breakdown in the campus judi
cial system.
Stanford's SDS was included in this
accusation. Dumke contended that they
"wanted massive confrontation" with
the Trustees and were concerned about
due process for themselves but that no
one thought of according it to the
Board of Trustees.
In defense of San Francisco State's
previous quality of education, Dumke
stated that it has always been "a free
market for ideas." It has always toler
ated non-conformity and experiments
but now it has been "taken over by
dissidents and radicals who are intoler
ant of the ideas of others" he said.
"Face Discussion"
Dumke said that "free discussion"
had always been a right of students but
that "filthy words" are not a part of
free discussion because they are not of
"decency and good taste." Students are
making "impossible demands with no
alternative."
He concluded his prepared speech by
emphasizing that the 19-college network
"must remain responsible to the citizens
of the state and not to the transitory
ideas of student government.

nounced settlement with Negro
students of a dispute which set off
disorders last week.

building after a 15-day student
sit-in.
At Notre Dame University in
South Bend, Ind., which has been
relatively free of protests, the
president announced he would ex

students who try forcible dis
ruption. The president, the Rev.

would give demonstrators 15
minutes for "meditation" before
mounting against them.
The new confrontation at Wis
consin apparently delayed im
mediate withdrawal of the 1,900
National Guardsmen assigned to
the Madison campus by Gov.
Warren P. Knowles.
Several hundred students
surged through an administration
and class building chanting, "sup
port the black demands, support

the black demands."
At San Francisco, the return to
class was a new tactic by the dissi
dent teachers and students. Mem

Foundation of Teachers handed
out leaflets explaining that the
new classes might be canceled if
nobody showed up.

at San Francisco State, Dumke felt that
the students were deciding which laws
to obey and which to ignore. When the
law is not recognized, "we move toward
anarchy," he said.
"I don't think the public is sympa

Dumke in connection to the AFT-CIO

teacher strike. "It is unlawful . . . ill
timed . . . injurious to the academic pro
fession . . . and a failure," he stated.
Because these teachers fail to obey
the "law of the land," they have "alien
ated the public and have encouraged
punitive legislation" to come before the
state legislature.
"Legal Mumble Jumble"
Another effect of the riots has been
the creation of much "legal mumble
jumble" Dumke stated. He felt that the
students were using legal trappings in
their demand for "due process" to bring
about a breakdown in the campus judi
cial system.
Stanford's SDS was included in this
accusation. Dumke contended that they
"wanted massive confrontation" with
the Trustees and were concerned about
due process for themselves but that no
one thought of according it to the
Board of Trustees.
In defense of San Francisco State's
previous quality of education, Dumke
stated that it has always been "a free
market for ideas." It has always toler
ated non-conformity and experiments
but now it has been "taken over by
dissidents and radicals who are intoler
ant of the ideas of others" he said.
"Face Discussion"
Dumke said that "free discussion"
had always been a right of students but
that "filthy words" are not a part of
free discussion because they are not of
"decency and good taste." Students are
making "impossible demands with no
alternative."
He concluded his prepared speech by
emphasizing that the 19-college network
"must remain responsible to the citizens
of the state and not to the transitory
ideas of student government.

In a rapidly read Law School speech
that was punctuated by audience heck
ling, California State College Chancellor
Glen Dumke yesterday outlined the
problems faced by the 19-college net
work he commands.
The present disturbances at San Fran
cisco State and other colleges are due to
a crisis that has developed from the
"problems of man in governing him
self," began Dumke to about 100
people at an afternoon Law Forum
meeting.
The problem of government in the
academic community stems from the
dual purpose of the state colleges.
"State colleges are instruments of
society created and supported by
people," Dumke said. "The board of
trustees was created to keep this con
nection." But at the same time, the col
lege system is a "society of scholars"
that should "serve the ends of intellect
and learning."
Colleges have these two ends of
service, and the people in them "have
the obligation to live within their rules
or to change them through peaceful and
legal channels" emphasized the Chancel
lor. "No one has the right to be a citizen
of the academic community. It is a
"privilege" accorded those who "meet
admission standards" and who live
"within its rules," continued Dumke.
