# Campus-wide Election Referenda To Cover Wide Range of Issues
## 
### 
Stanford students will face a seven
page ballot including eight referendum
issues and seven slates of Education
Council candidates when they go to the
polls today and Wednesday.
Polls will be open at: the Post Office
and at Engineering Corner from 9:30
a.m. to 4 p.m. and at the Physics Tank
from 9 a.m. until noon today and
Wednesday, at the Medical School from
noon to 4 p.m. today, and at the Busi
ness School during the same hours on
Wednesday.
The election to the Education Coun
cil will be conducted under the Hare
System of Preferential Proportional
Representation.
This system is designed to assure that
minority interests are represented ac
cording to strength.
Each voter has only one vote; but he
marks, in order of preference, as many
candidates as are to be elected in his
constituency. The vote is then used
when it is needed for the election of a
candidate.
Computer Tabulation
A computer will be used to make the
somewhat complicated tabulations for
the final results. A formula determines
the number of votes needed to be
elected. When a candidate receives that

number of first choice votes, ne is
elected and the other preferences on
those ballots are ignored.
If a candidate receives more votes
than he needs, the extra ballots are dis
tributed according to second (or
third . . .) choices.
The computer also distributes the
votes on ballots of first choice candi
dates with no possibility of election to
the second (or third) choice candidate.
This process assures that nobody's
vote is "wasted" by being cast for a
losing candidate.
Ballot Corrections
A number of changes should be made
in the Education Council candidates
where the ballot is in error.
The changes include: from the slate
of candidates from General Studies the
name of Stephen Tipps should be
dropped and the names of Marci Kahn,
Anthony Lambert, Margaret Carol
Lewis, Anne Tuttle, Douglas R. Willard,
and Martti Vallila should be added;
from the slate of Undergraduate
Humanities and Science candidates the
names of Douglas R. Willard, Anthony
Lambert, and Anne Tuttle should be
dropped and Stephen Tipps should be
added.
In addition, the Schools of Law and

Education have chosen to exercise the
option given to all professional schools
to hold independent elections for their
members on the Education Council.
Loan Collection Vote
The student loan resolution is seen by
sponsor Jim Schneider as an expression
of student concern for the collection of
over $300,000 in long-standing delin
quent loans. According to Schneider,
"If we can get back $20,000 of these
funds then this resolution will have been
a success."
Schneider suggested that the figure of
$300,000 in delinquent funds is to be
contrasted with a total of just $600,000
available at present for student loans.
Joseph Jedd of the Students Ac
counts Office stresses that the money is
for the exclusive use of students and
that students will gain from a vigorous
effort to recover the delinquent funds.
"If we had this kind of support (the
resolution)" said Jedd, "we could have
this resolution inserted in our collection
letters to show that the student body is
behind us in this."
Schneider stressed that this is an area
of student responsibility since only stu
dents are hurt by the large outstanding
debts.

in the Education Council candidates
where the ballot is in error.
The changes include: from the slate
of candidates from General Studies the
name of Stephen Tipps should be
dropped and the names of Marci Kahn,
Anthony Lambert, Margaret Carol
Lewis, Anne Tuttle, Douglas R. Willard,
and Martti Vallila should be added;
from the slate of Undergraduate
Humanities and Science candidates the
names of Douglas R. Willard, Anthony
Lambert, and Anne Tuttle should be
dropped and Stephen Tipps should be
added.
In addition, the Schools of Law and

Education have chosen to exercise the
option given to all professional schools
to hold independent elections for their
members on the Education Council.
Loan Collection Vote
The student loan resolution is seen by
sponsor Jim Schneider as an expression
of student concern for the collection of
over $300,000 in long-standing delin
quent loans. According to Schneider,
"If we can get back $20,000 of these
funds then this resolution will have been
a success."
Schneider suggested that the figure of
$300,000 in delinquent funds is to be
contrasted with a total of just $600,000
available at present for student loans.
Joseph Jedd of the Students Ac
counts Office stresses that the money is
for the exclusive use of students and
that students will gain from a vigorous
effort to recover the delinquent funds.
"If we had this kind of support (the
resolution)" said Jedd, "we could have
this resolution inserted in our collection
letters to show that the student body is
behind us in this."
Schneider stressed that this is an area
of student responsibility since only stu
dents are hurt by the large outstanding
debts.
Stanford students will face a seven
page ballot including eight referendum
issues and seven slates of Education
Council candidates when they go to the
polls today and Wednesday.
Polls will be open at: the Post Office
and at Engineering Corner from 9:30
a.m. to 4 p.m. and at the Physics Tank
from 9 a.m. until noon today and
Wednesday, at the Medical School from
noon to 4 p.m. today, and at the Busi
ness School during the same hours on
Wednesday.
The election to the Education Coun
cil will be conducted under the Hare
System of Preferential Proportional
Representation.
This system is designed to assure that
minority interests are represented ac
cording to strength.
Each voter has only one vote; but he
marks, in order of preference, as many
candidates as are to be elected in his
constituency. The vote is then used
when it is needed for the election of a
candidate.
Computer Tabulation
A computer will be used to make the
somewhat complicated tabulations for
the final results. A formula determines
the number of votes needed to be
elected. When a candidate receives that

number of first choice votes, ne is
elected and the other preferences on
those ballots are ignored.
If a candidate receives more votes
than he needs, the extra ballots are dis
tributed according to second (or
third . . .) choices.
The computer also distributes the
votes on ballots of first choice candi
dates with no possibility of election to
the second (or third) choice candidate.
This process assures that nobody's
vote is "wasted" by being cast for a
losing candidate.
Ballot Corrections
A number of changes should be made
in the Education Council candidates
where the ballot is in error.
