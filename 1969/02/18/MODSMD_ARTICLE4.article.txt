# Student Opinion
## ROTC Referendum Today 
### 
Refusing to let ROTC die at Stan
ford, a number of students are sponsor
ing a referendum in today's election
defending ROTC.
A petition was circulated last Thurs
day asking students to support ROTC.
Bu receiving over 600 signatures in one
afternoon, the petition qualified to
be put on the ballot of the current

election as a student referendum.
Chris Beattie, a senior in history and
battalion commander of the Navy
ROTC unit, is the unofficial leader of
the group that is try ing to get the refer
endum passed. He emphasized that the
purpose of the referendum "is to make
Stanford aware of the issues involved
in the ROTC question.
"We feel that the majority and
minority reports should be studied in
depth and considered by all the faculty
and students and not just the Aca
demic Senate."
The petition was written and circu
lated by the Ad Hoc Committee on
ROTC of the Campus Committee for
Communications (CCC). This is a loose
knit group drawing from all segments
of the university that attempts to
study alternative means of getting
change within the university without
resorting to violence.
Wants ROTC Kepi
The ad hoc committee of the CCC
decided that in the interests of aca

demic freedom ROTC should be al
lowed on campus with less restrictions
than the majority report recommends.
The students actively supporting the
proposal are evidently not associated
with the CCC. Beattie did not even
know who had written the proposal or
had circulated the petition.
Beattie emphasized that since his
group is interested in "trying to get
students and faculty to discuss ROTC
and to consider the issue less hastily"
he was 'not particularly happy with the
wording of the proposal' because it
asks for direct support of ROTC.
Will Gauge Student View
The referendum has no tangible
effect except to give student opinion.
Supporters of the proposal feel that
a mandate for ROTC might give the
faculty incentive to get 50 signatures
on a petition requesting that the ROTC
question be sent to the entire Aca
demic Council.
