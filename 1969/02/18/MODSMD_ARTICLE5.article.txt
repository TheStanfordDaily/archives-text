# Stanford's Right Makes Requests
## 
### MICHAEL KUHL 
Twenty-five students, representing
the Community of the Right, yesterday
urged the University to intensify recruit
ment of conservative professors, grant
academic credit for ROTC courses, and
suspend any student who disrupts Stu
dent Judicial Council proceedings.
The requests are "negotiable," ac
cording to Jack Stevens of the Young
Americans for Freedom (YAF) who
read the "recommendations" to Associ
ate Dean of Students Willard Wyman
yesterday afternoon.
This is the latest show of conser
vative and moderate strength since a
group of about 50 members of YAF and
Young Republicans (YR) chanted and
booed speakers at an SDS rally January
29.
Concurrent with the YAF and YR
proposals at Stanford, YAF began a
state-wide campaign yesterday to distri
bute 100,000 plain blue buttons.
Buttons Symbolic
According to YR treasurer Dan
Bennett, a senior in statistics who of
fered Wyman a button, the buttons
symbolize support for academic free
dom and the principle of an open cam
pus.
Wyman said that he "believed whole
heartedly" in the purposes, but declined
to wear one. He insisted that he will
"try to fight coercion everywhere I
can," adding that he also supported
groups, such as Americans for Demo
cratic Action, which are "in opposition
to the sorts of things you stand for."
The Community of the Right, which
includes members of YAF, YR's, and
the Arena, a conservatively-oriented
underground paper, called on President
Pitzer to adopt a "firm policy" against
campus disruptions.
Discussion Expected
Wyman assured the group that "the
President and important members of the
administration will discuss these pro
posals and there will be a response."
Some of the proposals have already
been considered by the University,
while others, such as the one asking for
more conservatively-oriented professors,
will probably not be acted on.
Harvey H. Hukari, Jr., chairman of
YAF and editor of the Arena, told
Wyman, "We're not coming here to
demonstrate or disrupt the University."
Lawyer Retained
"We'd like very much to see action in

the next three weeks," Hukari said. Bill
Hallman, a Graduate School of Business
student from Dallas and a member of
the bar in Texas, has been retained by
the group to take legal action against
the University, if necessary.
"We want to have students free to
attend classes they have signed up for
and go places where they want without
interference from other student
groups," Hallman indicated.
Conservative and moderate students
should assist in the recruitment of con
servative professors for the Humanities
and Sciences department, where a "de
plorable imbalance of political and
philosophic perspectives" exists, the
proposals said.
Increase Anticipated
"We fully anticipate that by fall
quarter of this year there will be a sub
stantial increase in the number of con
servative faculty members at Stanford,"
the group added.
Acting Dean Halsey L. Royden, re
jected last night any proposal which
would use "political views as any sort of
criterion for appointing professors.
"We really try to bend over back
wards to appoint faculty with expertise
in teaching ability and research skills,"
he added. "And political beliefs have
very little to do with that selection."
Royden noted that selection is really
a departmental concern, with the Presi
dent's office serving as a review mechan
ism over the recommendations.
Review Of Sponsor Selection
Pitzer was also asked to appoint a
committee of students and adminis
trators to revise the selection system for
freshmen sponsors.
Associate Dean of Students Sally
Mahoney said that the "request is very
much in line with what we are talking
about" in considering the role of the
sponsors in her office.
Office Space Sought
The group is also seeking office space
on campus for the YR's and YAF, Pro
ject Help, a tutorial project sponsored
by the YR's in Mountain View, and the
editorial staff of Arena.
Alan Grundmann, Assistant to the
Provost who deals with block assign
ment of office space, said yesterday,"I
have never rejected any one on policy."
But in dealing with student requests,
which he gets about once a month,
Grundmann was "never given any policy
to follow."

demonstrate or disrupt the University."
Lawyer Retained
"We'd like very much to see action in

the next three weeks," Hukari said. Bill
Hallman, a Graduate School of Business
student from Dallas and a member of
the bar in Texas, has been retained by
the group to take legal action against
the University, if necessary.
"We want to have students free to
attend classes they have signed up for
and go places where they want without
interference from other student
groups," Hallman indicated.
Conservative and moderate students
should assist in the recruitment of con
servative professors for the Humanities
and Sciences department, where a "de
plorable imbalance of political and
philosophic perspectives" exists, the
proposals said.
Increase Anticipated
"We fully anticipate that by fall
quarter of this year there will be a sub
stantial increase in the number of con
servative faculty members at Stanford,"
the group added.
Acting Dean Halsey L. Royden, re
jected last night any proposal which
would use "political views as any sort of
criterion for appointing professors.
"We really try to bend over back
wards to appoint faculty with expertise
in teaching ability and research skills,"
he added. "And political beliefs have
very little to do with that selection."
Royden noted that selection is really
a departmental concern, with the Presi
dent's office serving as a review mechan
ism over the recommendations.
Review Of Sponsor Selection
Pitzer was also asked to appoint a
committee of students and adminis
trators to revise the selection system for
freshmen sponsors.
Associate Dean of Students Sally
Mahoney said that the "request is very
much in line with what we are talking
about" in considering the role of the
sponsors in her office.
Office Space Sought
The group is also seeking office space
on campus for the YR's and YAF, Pro
ject Help, a tutorial project sponsored
by the YR's in Mountain View, and the
editorial staff of Arena.
Alan Grundmann, Assistant to the
Provost who deals with block assign
ment of office space, said yesterday,"I
have never rejected any one on policy."
But in dealing with student requests,
which he gets about once a month,
Grundmann was "never given any policy
to follow."
Twenty-five students, representing
the Community of the Right, yesterday
urged the University to intensify recruit
ment of conservative professors, grant
academic credit for ROTC courses, and
suspend any student who disrupts Stu
dent Judicial Council proceedings.
The requests are "negotiable," ac
cording to Jack Stevens of the Young
Americans for Freedom (YAF) who
read the "recommendations" to Associ
ate Dean of Students Willard Wyman
yesterday afternoon.
This is the latest show of conser
vative and moderate strength since a
group of about 50 members of YAF and
Young Republicans (YR) chanted and
booed speakers at an SDS rally January
29.
Concurrent with the YAF and YR
proposals at Stanford, YAF began a
state-wide campaign yesterday to distri
bute 100,000 plain blue buttons.
Buttons Symbolic
According to YR treasurer Dan
Bennett, a senior in statistics who of
fered Wyman a button, the buttons
symbolize support for academic free
dom and the principle of an open cam
pus.
Wyman said that he "believed whole
heartedly" in the purposes, but declined
to wear one. He insisted that he will
"try to fight coercion everywhere I
can," adding that he also supported
groups, such as Americans for Demo
cratic Action, which are "in opposition
to the sorts of things you stand for."
The Community of the Right, which
includes members of YAF, YR's, and
the Arena, a conservatively-oriented
underground paper, called on President
Pitzer to adopt a "firm policy" against
campus disruptions.
Discussion Expected
Wyman assured the group that "the
President and important members of the
administration will discuss these pro
posals and there will be a response."
Some of the proposals have already
been considered by the University,
while others, such as the one asking for
more conservatively-oriented professors,
will probably not be acted on.
Harvey H. Hukari, Jr., chairman of
YAF and editor of the Arena, told
