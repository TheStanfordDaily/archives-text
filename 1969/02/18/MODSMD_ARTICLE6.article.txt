# Presidio Mutiny Trial
## Military Justice Like Military Music 
### MARSHALL E. SCHWARTZ 
Georges Clemenceau, prime minister
of France during World War I, once ob
served that "military justice is to justice
what military music is to music"—a
parody. His analogy was proven to be
only too true !ast week as the first three
of 27 Gls charged with mutiny were
found guilty and sentenced to 14, 15,
and 16 years at hard labor by a court
martial at the San Francisco Presidio.
Webster defines "mutiny" as an "in
surrection against, or refusal to obey,
constituted authority, particularly mili
tary or naval authority; concerted revolt
against the rules of discipline or lawful
commands of a superior officer; hence,

generally, forcible resistance to rightful
authority; insubordination."
On October 14 of last year, 27 pris
oners in the Presidio stockade left for
mation at early morning roll call and sat
down in the stockade yard. They began
chanting—"We Shall Overcome" and

"Freedom, Freedom"—and called for
the officer in charge of the stockade,
Capt. Robert Lamont, to present a list
of grievances to him.
When Lamont appeared, one of the
prisoners arose and began reading the
list. But the captain, after starting to
read the group the article on mutiny
from the Uniform Code of Military Jus
tice, walked away.
Then, using a PA system in a truck,
he ordered the group back into the
stockade. Testimony by an acoustics ex
pert revealed that it was doubtful the
group understood the order, and none
of the 27, still singing and chanting, got
up. Shortly thereafter, they were re
moved by MPs.
Mutiny? By strict interpetation of
the law, probably. But by the spirit of
the law and past applications, definitely
not.
Type of Mutiny
"There is no difference between a
violent and nonviolent mutiny," assis
tant trial counsel (prosecutor) Capt.
Dean Flippo told the court. "Congress
does not distinguish between the two
and the government contends that a
passive and violent mutiny are equally
serious. It is not the method of over
riding lawfully constituted authority
that matters, it is the result. It is an at
tack on the system, if you will, an
attack on the system of law and order."
Obviously, the six officers who sat
on the court in the trial of Pvt. Nesrey
Sood of Oakland, and the seven who
were at the court martial of Pvt. Law
rence Reidel of Medford, Ore., and Pvt.
Louis Osczepinski of Florida, N.Y.,
agreed with him.
But there was no need to charge the
men with mutiny. The law officer
(judge) for the first three cases, Lt. Col.
George R. Robinson, had just finished
hearing the cases of several soldiers at
Ft. Hood, Texas, who had refused to go
to Chicago during the Democratic Na
tional Convention last summer. The
soldiers in that case were only charged
with "willfully disobeying a superior
officer," not with mutiny.
Why Mutiny Charges?
Why the difference? The military
defense counsels for Reidel and
Osczepinski had asked for a change of
venue. They charged it was impossible
to get a fair trial in the military in San
Francisco because the overwhelming
amount of antimilitary activity in the
Bay Area had made local military men
uptight about any protest—especially an
internal one. This seems to have been
the reason why these 27 were charged
with mutiny, especially when one of the
three hearing officers (who, after pre
liminary hearings, recommend what the
charges should be) for the cases said
that the Army would be "overreacting"

if mutiny charges were pressed.
But they went ahead, and the first
three have been found guilty, and it is
likely 24 more convictions will follow.
If the sentences seem heavy, it may
be because it is the habit of a military
court to give a sentence harsher than
what seems reasonable, in the expecta
tion that review boards will cut it down.
But the defense attorneys will not be
satisfied merely with reducing the
sentence —they want acquittals.
Question of Constitutionality
Paul Halvonik, civilian counsel for
Sood, the first to be convicted, said he
would challenge the constitutionality of
the mutiny article if he had to go that
far. Comparing these trials to the in
famous Dreyfus case, he said "the Army
will not be able to get away with such

oppression for much longer."
Four student leaders at Stanford and
the University of California at Berkeley
have criticized the trials. In a joint tele
gram to President Richard Nixon, De
fense Secretary Melvin Laird, and
Undersecretary David Packard, the stu
dents said:
"This gross miscarriage of justice can
arouse only contempt and anger among
young Americans of all political persua
sions. We urge you to begin an impartial
review of this military trial immedi
ately."
Signers included Stanford Student
Body President Denis Hayes; Cal Stu
dent Body President Charles Palmer;
Stanford Daily Editor Phil Taubman;
and Daily Californian Editor Tom
Collins.
