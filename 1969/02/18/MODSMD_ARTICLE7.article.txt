# Colleges Across Nation Face Continued Unrest
## 
### ASSOCIATED PRESS 
New student disorders flared Mon
day at the University of Wisconsin, San
Francisco State College, and campuses
of the University of California at Santa
Barbara and Berkeley.
Scores of National Guardsmen with
fixed bayonets moved in on a demon
stration at Wisconsin, but it ended
without violence.
At San Francisco State, the spring
semester got off to a rocky start as
black students broke up a class taught
by a professor opposed to a faculty
strike.
However, striking students and
teachers went to classes at San Fran
cisco to prevent cancellation of new
classes for lack of attendance. They
vowed to resume the strike once the
new curriculum is established.
At Berkeley demonstrators emptied
two University of California cafeterias
of diners and employees with tear gas,
fired four cherry bombs and shattered
a few windows in a series of marches
around the campus Monday.
A canister of tear gas drove 200
patrons and most of the employees
from the Golden Bear cafeteria. Rising
fumes also drove nearly 100 persons
from a cafeteria on the floor above.
Tables were overturned and glasses
shattered.
Damage there and elsewhere was
minor as the pickets paraded to or
through Sproul, Dwindle and Wheeler
halls, the library and the physical
science building.
One student was arrested.
About 500 students marched Mor.-

day into the University of California at
Santa Barbara student union building,
declared it a "student liberated zone"
and vowed to stay indefinitely.
They said they are members of the
Students for a Democratic Society,
Black Students Union and United
Mexican-American Students.
The students asked negotiations
with the administration over demands
for a black studies department and an
end to alleged police harassment of stu
dents.
Robert Lorden, director of the
three-story University center, closed
the second floor bookstore and
cashier's office after the march-in. But
he said the students could stay as long
as there is no property damage.
It was quiet at Duke University in
When questioned about George
Murray, Dumke replied that the
Black instructor was suspended by
"due process and kept at full pay
under the rules of the American
Association of University Pro
fessors." He also said he antici
pated the confrontation that fol
lowed the action, and that he
knew it would come eventually,
no matter what the issue.
Dumke answered charges about
the Board of Trustees intervention
at S.F. state on the issue of build
ing a student union, by saying
that the union designs with 45-
degree angle walls would cause
wasted floor space and money.
The board told the student
government to investigate the
plans but the government refused.
When the Black Studies pro
gram was mentioned, Dumke
claimed that such a program had
been approved before the strike
had ever begun at S.F. State.
"Professor Nathan Hare was in
vited to produce a curriculum, but
he has never produced one,"
Dumke stated. "They don't want
a black studies program, they
want rocks."
Dumke denied that he was ig
noring the causes of student un
rest. The students had "legitimate
concerns" but they must be

studied "objectively in a scholarly
fashion." If this is not done "aca
demic freedom becomes eroded,"
he said.

Dumke answered charges about
the Board of Trustees intervention
at S.F. state on the issue of build
ing a student union, by saying
that the union designs with 45-
degree angle walls would cause
wasted floor space and money.
The board told the student
government to investigate the
plans but the government refused.
When the Black Studies pro
gram was mentioned, Dumke
claimed that such a program had
been approved before the strike
had ever begun at S.F. State.
"Professor Nathan Hare was in
vited to produce a curriculum, but
he has never produced one,"
Dumke stated. "They don't want
a black studies program, they
want rocks."
Dumke denied that he was ig
noring the causes of student un
rest. The students had "legitimate
concerns" but they must be

studied "objectively in a scholarly
fashion." If this is not done "aca
demic freedom becomes eroded,"
he said.
New student disorders flared Mon
day at the University of Wisconsin, San
Francisco State College, and campuses
of the University of California at Santa
Barbara and Berkeley.
Scores of National Guardsmen with
fixed bayonets moved in on a demon
stration at Wisconsin, but it ended
without violence.
At San Francisco State, the spring
semester got off to a rocky start as
black students broke up a class taught
by a professor opposed to a faculty
strike.
However, striking students and
teachers went to classes at San Fran
cisco to prevent cancellation of new
classes for lack of attendance. They
vowed to resume the strike once the
new curriculum is established.
At Berkeley demonstrators emptied
two University of California cafeterias
of diners and employees with tear gas,
fired four cherry bombs and shattered
a few windows in a series of marches
around the campus Monday.
A canister of tear gas drove 200
patrons and most of the employees
from the Golden Bear cafeteria. Rising
fumes also drove nearly 100 persons
from a cafeteria on the floor above.
Tables were overturned and glasses
shattered.
Damage there and elsewhere was
minor as the pickets paraded to or
through Sproul, Dwindle and Wheeler
halls, the library and the physical
science building.
One student was arrested.
About 500 students marched Mor.-

day into the University of California at
Santa Barbara student union building,
declared it a "student liberated zone"
and vowed to stay indefinitely.
They said they are members of the
Students for a Democratic Society,
Black Students Union and United
Mexican-American Students.
The students asked negotiations
with the administration over demands
for a black studies department and an
end to alleged police harassment of stu
dents.
Robert Lorden, director of the
three-story University center, closed
the second floor bookstore and
cashier's office after the march-in. But
he said the students could stay as long
as there is no property damage.
It was quiet at Duke University in
When questioned about George
Murray, Dumke replied that the
Black instructor was suspended by
"due process and kept at full pay
under the rules of the American
Association of University Pro
fessors." He also said he antici
pated the confrontation that fol
lowed the action, and that he
knew it would come eventually,
no matter what the issue.
