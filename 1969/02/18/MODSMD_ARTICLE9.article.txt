# The 						Election
## 
### 
Besides the voting for members of the
Education Council, the election being held
today and tomorrow will also feature seven
resolutions (numbered two through eight
on the ballot).
Although the issues involved in several of
the questions are complicated, most have
already been discussed at length in The
Daily, and need no lengthy explication
here. But the issues are of concern to the
entire student body, and therefore we are
presenting our recommendations on each
item.
TWO: This consists of six statements,
generally concerning SES recommen
dations. Its purpose is to present the Edu
cation Council and the Academic Senate
with a reading of student opinion on the
topics.
A. Semester vs quarter system-Each
calendar has its own merits, such as a larger
variety of courses under the quarter
system, more depth with semesters. The
Daily makes no recommendation on this
question.
B. Reading period- A week of study be
fore final exams is vital. The present rush
usually leaves the student with a superficial
knowledge of the subject sufficient only
for the test. Vote yes.
C. Pass-Fail—Removing the limit on
pass-fail courses will allow students to take
more courses they have an interest in, but
yet feel they do not have the time to work
for a good grade in the subject. Vote yes.
D. Essay vs objective examinations-
Objective exams usually test only super
ficial knowledge, not comprehension of
theory. Vote yes.
E. and F. General Studies-E supports
reducing the general studies requirements
to the level suggested by SES, while F asks
for their complete elimination. All con
straints should be removed, but we recom
mend voting yes on both items.
THREE: Judicial Charter Referendum.
The changes in the charter consist of trans
ferring the power to appoint faculty from

the President to the Academie Senate, and
inereasing the ways of amending the
eharter. Vote yes.
FOUR: Student Loans. Delinquency in
repayment of loans hurts only future stu
dents who need this service. Vote yes.
FIVE: Equal say in SES. As has pre
viously been discussed in The Daily, there
should be little doubt-in the students'
minds, at least -that the changes recom
mended by SES affect faculty and students
equally. Giving the Academic Senate more
say over the revisions is therefore patently
unfair and absurd. Vote yes.
SIX and SEVEN: Marijuana and other
drugs. Six petitions the State of California
to remove all bans against marijuana. As we
have previously stated, we support such a
stand. Seven asks for more stringent penal
ties for the sale of methedrine, and a strong
education campaign to inlorm youths
about this drug. Education is vital, striking
at the heart of the matter. But putting
emphasis on penalties is merely a dis
traction from the real issue. For this
reason, we urge you to vote yes on six, no
on seven.
EIGHT: Judicial Charter Amendment.
The change is aimed at establishing a two
chairman system for the SJC, a faculty
member for student cases, and a student
for faculty cases, with the chairman having
no vote. We feel this is more equitable than
the present structure. As with the fifth
resolution, this is aimed at establishing
equal status between students and faculty
in areas of mutual concern. Vote yes.
NINE: ROTC. The Daily supports the
majority report of the ROTC committee,
which urged an end to academic credit for
the program, and which was endorsed by
the Academic Senate. We go further-the
objectives, not only the mechanism, of
ROTC are wrong, and all ties with the
program should be cut. This resolution,
which urges retaining the program and
giving credit for parts of it, is entirely unac
ceptable. Vote no.

on seven.
EIGHT: Judicial Charter Amendment.
The change is aimed at establishing a two
chairman system for the SJC, a faculty
member for student cases, and a student
for faculty cases, with the chairman having
no vote. We feel this is more equitable than
the present structure. As with the fifth
resolution, this is aimed at establishing
equal status between students and faculty
in areas of mutual concern. Vote yes.
NINE: ROTC. The Daily supports the
majority report of the ROTC committee,
which urged an end to academic credit for
the program, and which was endorsed by
the Academic Senate. We go further-the
objectives, not only the mechanism, of
ROTC are wrong, and all ties with the
program should be cut. This resolution,
which urges retaining the program and
giving credit for parts of it, is entirely unac
ceptable. Vote no.
Besides the voting for members of the
Education Council, the election being held
today and tomorrow will also feature seven
resolutions (numbered two through eight
on the ballot).
Although the issues involved in several of
the questions are complicated, most have
already been discussed at length in The
Daily, and need no lengthy explication
here. But the issues are of concern to the
entire student body, and therefore we are
presenting our recommendations on each
item.
TWO: This consists of six statements,
generally concerning SES recommen
dations. Its purpose is to present the Edu
cation Council and the Academic Senate
with a reading of student opinion on the
topics.
A. Semester vs quarter system-Each
calendar has its own merits, such as a larger
variety of courses under the quarter
system, more depth with semesters. The
Daily makes no recommendation on this
question.
B. Reading period- A week of study be
fore final exams is vital. The present rush
usually leaves the student with a superficial
knowledge of the subject sufficient only
for the test. Vote yes.
C. Pass-Fail—Removing the limit on
pass-fail courses will allow students to take
more courses they have an interest in, but
yet feel they do not have the time to work
for a good grade in the subject. Vote yes.
D. Essay vs objective examinations-
Objective exams usually test only super
ficial knowledge, not comprehension of
theory. Vote yes.
E. and F. General Studies-E supports
reducing the general studies requirements
to the level suggested by SES, while F asks
for their complete elimination. All con
straints should be removed, but we recom
mend voting yes on both items.
THREE: Judicial Charter Referendum.
The changes in the charter consist of trans
ferring the power to appoint faculty from

the President to the Academie Senate, and
inereasing the ways of amending the
eharter. Vote yes.
FOUR: Student Loans. Delinquency in
repayment of loans hurts only future stu
dents who need this service. Vote yes.
FIVE: Equal say in SES. As has pre
viously been discussed in The Daily, there
should be little doubt-in the students'
minds, at least -that the changes recom
mended by SES affect faculty and students
equally. Giving the Academic Senate more
say over the revisions is therefore patently
unfair and absurd. Vote yes.
SIX and SEVEN: Marijuana and other
drugs. Six petitions the State of California
to remove all bans against marijuana. As we
have previously stated, we support such a
stand. Seven asks for more stringent penal
ties for the sale of methedrine, and a strong
education campaign to inlorm youths
about this drug. Education is vital, striking
at the heart of the matter. But putting
emphasis on penalties is merely a dis
traction from the real issue. For this
reason, we urge you to vote yes on six, no
on seven.
