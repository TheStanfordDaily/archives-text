# AFT Votes Strike At Berkeley
## 
### 
BERKELEYâ€”In a move motivated
possibly by the arrest of twenty of
its members last week the American
Federation of Teachers (AFT) Union
local at the University of California at
Berkeley has voted to call a strike
against the University.
The move came early in the evening
yesterday and spurred a concurrent
move by the American Confederation
of State, County and Municipal Emp
loyees (ACSCME) late last night to
honor the AFT picket line.
The events followed another day of
volence at the campus. Earlier in the
day the bloody arrest of Third World
Liberation Front (TWLF) spokesmen
Jim Nabors provoked a series of bat
tles between police and striking stu
dents which lasted throughout the
early afternoon.
The AFT membership of approxi
mately 400 is composed almostexclus
ively of graduate teaching assistants
and readers and represents approxi

mately one-quarter of the graduate
TA's at the school.
Clerical Staff
The ACSCME also claims a total of
about 400 members and includes most
of the clerical staff of the university.
The AFT strike vote, which was
190-40-5, also placed three demands
before the University.
The demands include:
police be removed and the "state
of emergency" lifted
the implementation of Third
World demands
an end to and rectification for the
University's complicity in their repres
sion of political and union organizing
on campus.
There was no immediate reaction
from the University administration.
Nabors Arrest
Nabors, who has been an active sup
porter of the strike since it began, was
arrested following a march of close to

1000 strike supporters throughout the
campus. The marchers, who were
closely followed by a detail of high
way patrolmen, allegedly threw rocks
and broke windows during the march.
By the day's end thirteen people in
cluding TWLF leaders Manuel Delgado
and Charles Jackson had been arrested
on charges ranging from "inciting to
riot" and "blocking a public way."
In a related strike development,
psychology Professor Edward
Sampson indicated that the American
Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) was con
sidering the possibility of suing the
university. Sampson said the ACLU
was concerned that the University may
have violated the civil rights of faculty
members who were denied the estab
lishment of a peaceful picket line last
Monday.
Peaceful Picketing
Picketing was peaceful at Sather
Gate and in front of Sproul Hall until
approximately 2 p.m. when Nabors'ar

rest was made by Alameda Sheriff's
Deputies.
The incident occurred when the
deputies, apparently deciding that the
Sproul Hall picket line had grown too
large, tried to clear the steps area of
demonstrators. As the deputies swept
the first group off the steps, a second
group including Nabors, moved from
Sproul Plaza to take their place.
Surround Nabors
Deputies surrounded Nabors and
began to lead him off when several
hundred students moved to intercept
them. The deputies waded into the
crowd, swinging their clubs and chas
ing many down Sproul steps.
At this point Nabors was able to
wiggle away from his captors but he
was quickly tackled by an officer of
the California Highway Patrol. Accord
ing to several eyewitnesses, Nabors was
then pinned to a bench by several
officers and beaten into unconscious
ness by others.
