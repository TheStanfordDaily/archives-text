# Military Mentality
## 
### 
One Friday last October, while most of
us were analyzing Herman Melville or
passing among the shady cloisters of Main
Quad, a boy named Richard Bunch turned
his back on a stockade guard at the Presidio
in San Francisco and ran. A moment later
he was dead.
Richard did not expect to escape. He
wanted to die. He was, by the standards of
this society, ill.
A message that defined Richard's illness
was found on the wall of his cell. "Well, if
you're not going to give me love," he
wrote, "at least do me the favor of
complete elimination."
Richard Bunch was not killed by a
military policeman or by the buckshot that
ripped off the back of his head. His mur
derer was a tradition, a value system, a set
of assumptions.
That system denied Richard psychiatric
care when his mother came here from Ohio
and pleaded with military authorities to
treat his emotional disorders.
That tradition rewarded his guard with
extra pay and leave instead of asking why
the man shot a 120-pound, 19-year-old
youth who was only 20 yards away.
Twenty-seven men who knew the
system that murdered Richard Bunch
found that their humanity would not let
them ignore what had happened. Having
been denied any communication with the
outside world, hoping to publicize both the
brutal nature of the killing and the
conditions in the stockade, these prisoners
sat on the grass and sang "We Shall
Overcome."
They were charged with mutiny, a
capital crime. In lieu of death, however, the
army has settled on sentences of 14, 15,
and 16 years for the first three to be tried.
Some of the 27 protesters had
previously questioned the military
world-view. Several were in the stockade
because they had refused to serve in
Vietnam.
But for others, their recent experiences
have led them to ask questions. What values
does the United States Army protect? Is it
humanity that our military establishment is
defending?
Is our armed might serving the
Vietnamese in the same way that an MP's
shotgun ministered to the needs of Richard
Bunch?

At Stanford we enjoy a different
tradition. We are allowed to sit down and
sing songs, ask questions, even criticize
conditions all day long. In a way, we are
encouraged to do so.
Many of us have been asking questions
about Vietnam for some time. Most are
against killing, although we vary in our
willingness to accept justifications for
taking the lives of others.
But Richard Bunch's death and the
treatment of the Presidio Mutineers should
lead us into new fields of inquiry.
How much, for example, will we
support the system that killed Richard?
For some of us that question may have
direct relevance. We may be called to
volunteer for military service, or we may be
forced to serve.
Perhaps, as students, we will accept
deferments from the draft, or we will use
the resources at our disposal to find
loopholes in the law. Is it possible that by
doing so we will put added pressure on men
like Nesrey Sood, father of three; Louis
Osczepenski, once a major source of
support for an invalid father; or Lawrence
Reidel, possessor of a long record at
juvenile court.
By law these men should not have been
required to serve, but they ended up in the
army. Now they have been sentenced to a
total of 45 years in prison for their part in
the protest.
Some members of this community are
doing research for the Defense Department,
or working for corporations that service the
military. To what extent are they helping
to perpetuate the system and the mentality
that killed Richard Bunch?
These questions are big. It may not be
possible for some of us to arrive at
satisfactory personal answers to them. But
there is something more managable that we
can ask ourselves.
How do we feel about the killing of
Richard Bunch? Do we think that justice
has been done in the courts-martial of
those who protested his fate?
For those who object strongly to what
has happened at the Presidio, there will be
an opportunity to act in the next few
weeks.
It is not likely that any of us will risk 1 5
years in jail. But we will have a chance to
provide a visible answer to a vital question:
How much will the American public ignore?
