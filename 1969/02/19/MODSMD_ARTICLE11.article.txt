## Human Values Challenge To Engineers 
### Judy Sloss 
There has been a lot of talk in
recent months about how Stan
ford is instilling anti-human values
in its students and creating docile
technicians to tend the Establish
ment Wheels.
Much of this talk is aimed, at
least implicitly, at the engineering
school, and I think it behooves
those of us in the School who care
whether or not we are being
morally lobotomized to think
about whether these charges are
really true.
Obviously, the engineering
school doesn't go around kid
napping impressionable freshmen
with high math aptitudes, secret
ing hypnopaedic propaganda de
vices under their pillows, or bar
raging them with posters reading
"Join the Establishment for Fun
and Profit."
Nor does it hassle students who
make public their intention not to
do defense work. But if the en
gineering school doesn't actively
recruit for the Establishment, it
doesn't go out of its way to ask its
students to question Establish
ment values either.
The engineering school's atti-

tude toward its educational re
sponsiblities is pretty well
summed up in its new under
graduate curriculum. The basic
idea of the new curriculum is that
the prospective major decides for
himself what his "educational
goals" are, and, in consultation
with his adviser, determines a pro
gram which best fits these goals.
(This might involve a "write
your-own" major, a flexible op
tion designed for students who are
interested in new applications of
enfineering, such as bio
engineering or urban planning).
Self-Defined
One of the key thing about the
new curriculum is the studied
neutrality which the School main
tains on this question of "edu
cational goals." The philosophy is
that it is up to the student to
dedine his goals; the School is
there to help him implement
them.
This sounds great in principle;
after all, no student should have
his goals dictated for him by Stan
ford, SDS, his parents, Lockheed,
or anyone else. But what it means
in practice is that the whole ques
tion of goals is mostly pushed
aside.
The rare student who really
knows what he wants will get help
and encouragement rather than
hassling, even if his goals have an
anti-Establishment bias (although
it's not quite clear what would
happen if a prospective major
walked in and said his goal was to
learn how to undermine the mili
tary-industrial complex more ef
fectively).
Not Challenged
But the student who enters
Stanford with some vague ideas
about getting a good, interesting,
high-paying job isn't going to be
asked to think critically about
those ideas. He may be asked to
define his goals more precisely in
terms of professional objectives,
but not in terms of life style or
values.
Tucked away in the corner of

the catalogue is a 2-unit course,
limited to 15 undergraduates, on
"Technology and Human Values."
This course, and more like it,
should be brought into the center
of the engineering curriculum.
One of the pouposes of a liber
al education is supposed to be to
make students look critically at
their values and presuppositions.
Why shouldn't this be equally true
of engineering education? Why
shouldn't some critical discussion
of values be counted as part of a
student's "Engineering Breadth"
requirement?

Technology is power, and
power carries responsibilities. If
the engineering school isn't
making its students aware of those
responsibilities, it isn't doing its
job. Of course it's up to the indi
vidual to decide what his values
are.
But certainly the engineering
school could make it a lot harder
for its students to escape any ex
posure to self-questioning.

ment values either.
The engineering school's atti-

tude toward its educational re
sponsiblities is pretty well
summed up in its new under
graduate curriculum. The basic
idea of the new curriculum is that
the prospective major decides for
himself what his "educational
goals" are, and, in consultation
with his adviser, determines a pro
gram which best fits these goals.
(This might involve a "write
your-own" major, a flexible op
tion designed for students who are
interested in new applications of
enfineering, such as bio
engineering or urban planning).
Self-Defined
One of the key thing about the
new curriculum is the studied
neutrality which the School main
tains on this question of "edu
cational goals." The philosophy is
that it is up to the student to
dedine his goals; the School is
there to help him implement
them.
This sounds great in principle;
after all, no student should have
his goals dictated for him by Stan
ford, SDS, his parents, Lockheed,
or anyone else. But what it means
in practice is that the whole ques
tion of goals is mostly pushed
aside.
The rare student who really
knows what he wants will get help
and encouragement rather than
hassling, even if his goals have an
anti-Establishment bias (although
it's not quite clear what would
happen if a prospective major
walked in and said his goal was to
learn how to undermine the mili
tary-industrial complex more ef
fectively).
Not Challenged
But the student who enters
Stanford with some vague ideas
about getting a good, interesting,
high-paying job isn't going to be
asked to think critically about
those ideas. He may be asked to
define his goals more precisely in
terms of professional objectives,
but not in terms of life style or
values.
Tucked away in the corner of

the catalogue is a 2-unit course,
limited to 15 undergraduates, on
"Technology and Human Values."
This course, and more like it,
should be brought into the center
of the engineering curriculum.
One of the pouposes of a liber
al education is supposed to be to
make students look critically at
their values and presuppositions.
Why shouldn't this be equally true
of engineering education? Why
shouldn't some critical discussion
of values be counted as part of a
student's "Engineering Breadth"
requirement?

Technology is power, and
power carries responsibilities. If
the engineering school isn't
making its students aware of those
responsibilities, it isn't doing its
job. Of course it's up to the indi
vidual to decide what his values
are.
But certainly the engineering
school could make it a lot harder
for its students to escape any ex
posure to self-questioning.

There has been a lot of talk in
recent months about how Stan
ford is instilling anti-human values
in its students and creating docile
technicians to tend the Establish
ment Wheels.
Much of this talk is aimed, at
least implicitly, at the engineering
school, and I think it behooves
those of us in the School who care
whether or not we are being
morally lobotomized to think
about whether these charges are
really true.
Obviously, the engineering
school doesn't go around kid
napping impressionable freshmen
with high math aptitudes, secret
ing hypnopaedic propaganda de
vices under their pillows, or bar
raging them with posters reading
"Join the Establishment for Fun
and Profit."
Nor does it hassle students who
make public their intention not to
do defense work. But if the en
gineering school doesn't actively
recruit for the Establishment, it
doesn't go out of its way to ask its
students to question Establish
ment values either.
