## Moderates Sap Student Power 
### Jeffrey Blum 
Ever since Leland, Sr. founded
Stanford University on his racing
horse farm, this place has had a
tradition of ignoring unpleasant
realities. The moderate students
who decry the extremism of both
SDS and YAF, who deplore dis
ruptive tactics regardless of the
issue involved, cast themselves in
to the mainstream of this tradi
tion.
The first reality that moderates
seem to ignore is the genuine con
flict of interest between the radi
cal students and the university
employees who engage in and sup
port defense research.
The radicals have opposed the
Vietnam War, see it as part of an
overall global expansionist for
eign policy (sometimes called con
tainment) and then looked home
to see what role the university
plays. Radical students oppose
American foreign policy and
therefore oppose research projects
which support it, research such as
"counterinsurgency in Thailand"
and the designing of weapons to
be used in Vietnam.
Opposing the radicals are
faculty members and SRI staff
who seek the lucrative benefits of
doing defense research for the
government. Also, there are the
administrators dedicated to pro
tecting the individual faculty
members' right to engage in any
research he desires without fear of
external regulation.
Finally, there are the trustees
who support and approve of the
expansionist foreign policy, if not
its ugliest sympton, Vietnam, and
who want to keep the university
in a supporting role, possibly
because their businesses profit
from the foreign policy which de
fends overseas investment.
Conflict
The conflict is between those
who want free unrestricted re
search within the university, and
those who advocate community
decisions over what political in
volvement the university should
have. (Defense research is political
involvement.)
The implication of the aca
demic freedom position is that in
dividual researchers make their
own choices, usually guided more
by monetary incentives than by
political ideologies. So, whoever
has enough money may rent out
parts of the university to support
his own political purposes. Now
adays, largely because of decisions
made in Washington, it is the
American defense department
that has money.
The radical position denies in
dividual faculty members the right
to engage in any research without
restriction. This has the advantage
of curtailing university involve
ment in a foreign policy of which
most students and faculty are not
sure they approve. The dis
advantage is that some faculty
members might become incensed
and possibly leave. Also, the rela
tionship between the university

and the federal government would
grow less intimate.
Misunderstanding
Informed moderate students
might agree that this is the issue
and that there is a conflict of in
terest, but they respond that all
conflicts should be discussed
openly and rationally and that
there is no place for disruptive
tactics in a university.
At the bottom of this position
is a misunderstanding as to the
nature of rational dialogue.
Rational discussion by itself is
nothing more than words flowing
out in orderly progression. It can
be a useful adjunct of the process
of collective bargaining whereby
both sides present their griev
ances, clarify the issues and begin
to compromise. What proponents
of rational dialogue really want is
collective bargaining.
But here they ignore a second
unpleasant reality, that collective
bargaining can occur only among
equals and that students are not
equals with faculty and adminis
trators, let alone trustees.
Only Requests
Before labar unions used the
strike as a means of gaining econ
omic power to match the power
of industry, there could be no col
lective bargaining, only polite re
quests of labor for humane treat
ment which usually went
unheeded.
So, it is at Stanford. Students
have so long been excluded from
the governance of the university
that they have no power base
from which to operate. When stu
dents are allowed to participate, it
is out of the goodness of en
lightened faculty and administra

tors' hearts, and the participation
is usually token.
Committees inevitably have
faculty-administration majorities
and usually predefine the area of
investigation to preclude the
possibility of recommending radi
cal change.
SRI Committee
The present SRI committee has
seven faculty members out of
twelve, just enough to allow for
the oddity of a faculty member,
Prof. Bernstein, who opposes un
restricted research. Despite the
fact that four of the five student
members appear to be taking a
radical position, the committee
will at least be deadlocked and
may even vote seven to five
against restricting research at SRI.
Even if some love potion were
to make two faculty members
change their minds, the commit
tee's recommendation would be
merely advisory, with the likeli
hood that President Pitzer would
refer the recommendation to a
higher committee for further con
sideration, possibly in the hopes
that the passing of time would see
a new student body not alienated
by the Vietnam War, and there
fore naively willing to have the
University engage in defense re
search.
The faculty and administration
allow students to participate on
committees, but reserve the ulti
mate authority for themselves.
Students certainly may make
polite requests.
But the researchers are less
likely to listen to students than to
the federal government which
gives them grants. Denis Hayes re
quested that a counter-insurgency
contract not be renewed until the
SRI committee was done delibera

ting. His request was politely
denied by the director of SRI.
No Bargaining
Given the inequality of faculty
and students, there can be no true
collective bargaining on issues
which threaten the faculty's self
interest.
The only pertinent rational dis
cussion is among faculty, adminis
trators, and trustees as to whether
the policy of unrestricted research
and active support of American
foreign policy are worth having
radical student uglify the campus
with frequent demonstrations and
occasional disruptions. The alter
native to changing policies, of
course, is to get rid of the radical
students.
The radicals, denied access to
decision making power, can only
hope to influence their superiors
by making the disruptions unbear
able. Last month's scuffle with
trustees was dedicated toward this
end. It is unfortunate that SDS
has not been more slick in its ap
proach, that it has allowed stu
dents to become turned off by its
tactics without these students
understanding the issues involved.
But the moderate students who
disavow only the tactics without
considering the underlying issues,
and the distribution of power that
makes disruptive tactics inevitable
(the alternative is virtual silence),
are acting incredibly naively.
Ironically, it is this naivete, so
long characteristic of the student
body, that furnishes the main rea
son why students do not share de
cision-ma king power and are
therefore unable to bargain collec
tively as the moderates propose.
