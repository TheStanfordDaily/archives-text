## Friendly Fraternity Life 
### Clay Miller 
To swallow a bitter stylistic pill and paraphrase
The Daily's Monday editorial on Rush—if you read
such emetic and spurious journalistic claptrap at
all, read it skeptically and with open eyes.
For those with the good fortune or the good
taste to have let this particular cupcake from the
Storke Student Publications Building slip past un
read, it suggested a series of questions freshmen
participating in Rush might ask fraternity men
about their houses, and that freshmen might ask
themselves about their own goals.
Unfortunately, these questions, designed as
they were to make fraternities look pretty awful,
quickly bogged down in a succession of coy winks
and fantastic inuendos. No doubt Dean Joel Smith
could scarcely have done better himself, but the
point is that the piece is utterly worthless to any
one sincerely trying to decide where he will live
next year.
It is worthless because the entire direction of its
inquiry is simply (dare I use the word?) irrelevant
to fraternity life at Stanford. These are the sorts of
questions that arise:
"Are the hell week practices brutal. . .?" I get a
fascinating mental picture of a terrified iniatiate
leaping through the back kitchen window of a
darkened fraternity house, struggling to pull up his
trousers while a leering active chases after him
brandishing an enormous pair of pinking shears.
Disappointingly, one fraternity with whose in
itiation practices I am familiar, drives its pledges to
the Searsville head, where they are given a blind
date and a glass of beer and a band for dancing,
and that is that.
"Would the group environment of the fraterni
ty inhibit scholarship?" In point of fact, of course,
nine different fraternities nosed out several Uni
versity-organized residences for academic honors
last spring, one of the victims, intriguingly enough,
being Grove House, The Daily's adopted brain
child and co-educational Valhalla.
Since The Daily apparently doesn't consider
this a (here comes that, word again) relevant
datum, we won't wither, conceeding The Daily its
role as arbiter of relevance, or Relevance, for us
all. Suffice to say that these words are being typed
in a fraternity house, my only distraction being

the drink to which frequent referral to The Daily
editorial in question has driven me.
Women
"Does social pressure within the fraternity de
personalize the fraternity man's attitude toward
the Stanford woman?" I presume The Daily means
to imply by this that fraternity men are somehow
expected to dive after a girl's under things in the
middle of the first date, again a very vivid mental
picture, this time involving the over-turning of
tables and the kicking down of fire-irons. Reality
is less colorful.
"Listen to what the fraternity man talks about
at Rush. Is it you? Can you see yourself saying
similiar things?" What on earth do you suppose
The Daily imagines that fraternity man to be say
ing? Probably pretty blue, involving crystal-clear
anatomical imagery, dealing with the fraternity
man's depersonalized view of Stanford women. Ho
hum.
The Daily raises some valid questions about
rush proceedure. Coincidentally, I have a couple
myself. Why, for example, when the Inter-
Fraternity Council voted at the beginning of this
year to replace the exasperatingly superficial
system then in effect with a completely open rush,
did they have to compromise in defference to the
University's apparent wish to keep freshmen in
nocent and ignorant of fraternities as long as possi
ble?
No Peep Show
In any event, it seems unlikely that fraternities
would want to select future roommates on the
basis of a peep show any more than rushees want
to be limited to short and contrived views of fra
ternities. Equating Stanford fraternities with the
rush system under which they are compelled to
operate begins to look a little disingenuous.
I hope freshman will take advantage of their
opportunities to inspect fraternities for them
selves, and that their minds will be as open as their
eyes. The Daily's conceptual grasp of the real
world has always been extraordinarily casual, even
for a newspaper, but any editorial board seeking
behemoth material in something as fundamentally
innocuous, even friendly, as the fraternity system
at Stanford, really ought to check and make sure it
still has all its collective marbles.
