## No Faith In Poli Sci Faculty 
### 
Edilor, THE DAILY:
Over the past few weeks there
have been many rumors circula
ting among the undergraduates of
the political science department
pertaining to T.A. taught courses.
We have heard various configura
tions of a review committee rang
ing from 4 faculty 2 graduate stu
dents and 2 undergraduate stu
dents to 8:3:2. Now that the plan
has been unveiled, I am forced to
apologize to my radical friends.
Last quarter, when you were
advocating strong action such as
mass withdrawal from the depart
ment, a strike against the depart
ment, etc., I spoke against you. I
felt that we could obtain far bet
ter results by relying on reason

able requests and rational dis
course. I felt that the T.A.'s pro
posal on a review committee was
fair and equitable. It assumed that
all sides would be represented,
giving the faculty and the com
bined voices of elected representa
tives of graduates and undergrad
uates equal voice.
In case of a tie vote, that
would spell defeat for any pro
posed course, regardless of whose
procedural rules were adopted.
But the faculty is obviously un
willing to negotiate our original
requests (demands). They were
very willing to allow students to
sit on the Undergraduate Curricu
lum Committee chaired by Prof.
Wolfinger provided they appoint
ed the undergraduates. Why the
undergraduates aren't qualified to
elect their own representative is
beyond me, but apparently my
naivete is not shared by our omni
potent faculty. The same question
applies to the appointment of
undergraduate representatives to
the new review committee, and I
suppose my bewilderment at the
breakdown of democracy is easily
explained by our competent and
skilled faculty.
Of course, the number and
manner of appointment of the six
faculty members isn't bewildering
at all. Students always vote as a
block so the faculty which may
not always vote as a block must
have assurance that it will win
every time! It seems to me that if
it is falacious for me as an under
graduate to assume that the facul
ty will vote as a block on all pro
posed courses, it is equally fal
acious for the faculty to assume
that all the students on the review
committee will vote as a block.
Last quarter I advocated a go
slow policy, a policy that has
given us, the political science
undergraduates two pieces of
tokenism. We have two represen
tatives on one faculty committee
that were appointed. We have
been given two seats on another
committee, again appointed.
Nuts! If this is what the political
science department calls respon
sible democracy, I want no part of
it and will not stand in opposition
to more militant tactics. We have
waited in good faith for the polit
ical science department to meet
the curriculum desires of its stu
dents and our good faith has not
been reciprocated. Under these
circumstances I cannot justify my
go slow policy, especially if I con
sider curriculum reform of urgent
necessity.

• LBJ And John Brown
Editor, THE DAILY:
Poor David Frank, "Humphrey
has probably done more in Con
gress for the American black than
has any other white man any
where." That is pure bullshit, why
•>doesn't Mr. Frank ask Black
people who they think has done
something. To my mind the only
white person that I know of any
where that has done something
significant for Black people was
John Brown—he gave some
brothers guns. I won't defend
white radicals, but I won't accept
the garbage pertaining to Black
people that Mr. Frank wrote in his
article.
Pointing to the appointment of
people such as Thurgood Marshall
as showing that LBJ is not a racist
is ridiculous. What has Marshall
been able to do for black people
in his position on the supreme
court. Marshall upheld the stop

and frisk practices of the police,
something that he had fought as
an NAACP lawyer. If LBJ had
wanted to do something for black
people he wouldn't have ap
pointed a black man to a position
that would make him have to
think white in order tp function.
Mr. Frank speaks of a person
raised in a liberal, tolerant atmos
phere. Maybe these people won't
revere a black for his blackness,
but will these motherfuckers con
sider the problems that create the
conditions in the ghetto?
On Feb. 18, 1965, three days
before he was cut down by shot
guns, Malcom X said: "It is in
corrent to classify the revolt of
the Negro as simply a racial con
flict of black against white, or as a
purely American problem. Rather
we are today seeing a global rebel
lion of the oppressed against the
oppressor, of the expolited against
the exploiter."
Your critical consideration is
rather nice, but can oppressed and
exploited people appreicate it?
I'm sure liberals aren't included in
this group, (the oppressed) but are
members of the opposing one.
One that is unwilling to face the
real causes of racism and poverty.

• Love Is Relevant
Editor, THE DAILY:
Assuming that the purpose of a
university is to show each one of
its students the road to a more
meaningful life, I would like to
recommend a course or series of
courses which would be based on
the theme, "The Expression of
Love." I can't think of a course
which would have greater rele
vance than this and therefore feel
that it should be required of all
students.
I eagerly await the professor or
professors who respond to this
challenge. The structuring of this
course would require mammoth
effort but I am convinced that the
results would be well worth it.
