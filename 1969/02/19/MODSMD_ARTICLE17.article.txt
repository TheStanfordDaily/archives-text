## Hippies 
### Vishist Vaid-Raizado 
The hippie phenomenon is not
a new one. Many times during the
history of mankind have such
silent protests occured against the
existing attitudes and institutions.
Periods of prolonged affluence
very often breed contempt for
materialism. This is as much true
in the advanced countries of to
day as it was during the relatively
prosperous periods in developing
countries.
The hippie idealization of the
eastern philosophy, particularly
the Indeain, has more to it than a
casual sympathy. Long ago, a tan
tric cult challenged the Victorian
type rigidity of Hindu society
caste hierarchy, sexual purity, and
traditional material and spiritual
values.
Members of this cult strongly
believed that the proper way to
achieve spirituality is through
drugs and sexuality. They showed
tremendous originality and cre
ativity in the sensual art. Some of
the huge temples, engraved with
erotic postures, that they built are
preserved to this day and are tour
ist attractions.
The hippie messiah, Allen Gins
berg, during his stay in India to
get acquainted with the native
philosophy had close contact with
this sect.
Although it is highly unlikely
that the present hippie movement
has any direct realtion to similar
cults of the past, it si conceivable
that a part of its inspiration comes
from them.
"The Hippie Trip," a recent
study study by Prof. Yoblonsky, a
sociologist at UCLA, brings out
some formerly unknown facts. His
personal experience relates to vari
ous hippie communes in Cali
fornia and those on the East
coast.
He suggests that one half of the
hippie population is "plastic"—
weekend, summer or part-time
drop-outs and drug users seeking
hippie immunity. Of the other
half, the "pure" one, about
fifteen per cent are what one
might call high priests or philoso
phers, the rest seekers and aspir
ants.

There also is a vague but ob
servable classification among the
hippies; however, mobility is pos
sible. On the top are the high
priests, the apirants are more like
the middle class and the rest
("plastic" ones) are the lower
class.
Drugs are more widely used
than it is generally believed. Vio
lence is becoming a serious prob
lem, there have been many rapes
and homicides.
"Free love," although not
practiced in the manner and to
the extent mass media suggests, is
common among couples who have
known each other and developed
an affectionate relationship.
Social behavior between the sexes
is not free of jealousy and envy.
The hippie scene appears to
have lost a lot of its initial ideal
ism. It is fast developing all the ills
and evils of the straight society.

some formerly unknown facts. His
personal experience relates to vari
ous hippie communes in Cali
fornia and those on the East
coast.
He suggests that one half of the
hippie population is "plastic"—
weekend, summer or part-time
drop-outs and drug users seeking
hippie immunity. Of the other
half, the "pure" one, about
fifteen per cent are what one
might call high priests or philoso
phers, the rest seekers and aspir
ants.

There also is a vague but ob
servable classification among the
hippies; however, mobility is pos
sible. On the top are the high
priests, the apirants are more like
the middle class and the rest
("plastic" ones) are the lower
class.
Drugs are more widely used
than it is generally believed. Vio
lence is becoming a serious prob
lem, there have been many rapes
and homicides.
"Free love," although not
practiced in the manner and to
the extent mass media suggests, is
common among couples who have
known each other and developed
an affectionate relationship.
Social behavior between the sexes
is not free of jealousy and envy.
The hippie scene appears to
have lost a lot of its initial ideal
ism. It is fast developing all the ills
and evils of the straight society.

The hippie phenomenon is not
a new one. Many times during the
history of mankind have such
silent protests occured against the
existing attitudes and institutions.
Periods of prolonged affluence
very often breed contempt for
materialism. This is as much true
in the advanced countries of to
day as it was during the relatively
prosperous periods in developing
countries.
The hippie idealization of the
eastern philosophy, particularly
the Indeain, has more to it than a
casual sympathy. Long ago, a tan
tric cult challenged the Victorian
type rigidity of Hindu society
caste hierarchy, sexual purity, and
traditional material and spiritual
values.
Members of this cult strongly
believed that the proper way to
achieve spirituality is through
drugs and sexuality. They showed
tremendous originality and cre
ativity in the sensual art. Some of
the huge temples, engraved with
erotic postures, that they built are
preserved to this day and are tour
ist attractions.
The hippie messiah, Allen Gins
berg, during his stay in India to
get acquainted with the native
philosophy had close contact with
this sect.
Although it is highly unlikely
that the present hippie movement
has any direct realtion to similar
cults of the past, it si conceivable
that a part of its inspiration comes
from them.
"The Hippie Trip," a recent
