# Presidio 'Mutineers' Speak Out
## 
### DIARMUID McGUIRE 
(Editor's Note—ln order to
speak to the prisoners, McGuire
posed as a priest. This article also
appeared in THE PLAIN
RAPPER, the Resistance news
paper. McGuire is a member of
THE DAILY editorial
committee.)
"You'll probably laugh when
you hear this," Randy Rowland
told me. "My folks wrote and
said, 'Be glad you didn't do this in
Russia instead of America. At
least here you have democracy
and justice on your side . .
Randy is one of 27 prisoners in
the Presidio stockade who are
charged with mutiny, and in war
time the offense carries a death
penalty.
What is mutiny? In this case it
consisted of refusing to go on a
work detail, of singing "Freedom,
Freedom" and "We Shall Over
come," of protesting the murder
of a mentally disturbed prisoner,
Richard Bunch.
"I'm not trying to say Russia is
better," says Randy, "But people
don't know what is going on."
What Is Happening
It is tough to find out what is
happening in the Presidio, but no
mission is impossible when people
believe as firmly in uniforms as do
the defenders of our national
security. Looking holy and feeling
distinctly unreal, we found our
selves in the Ward G-I of Letter
man Hospital.
The prison ward of Letterman
is in the basement. There, pro
tected by a steel door and two
MP's, Randy and six other in
mates are being treated for

hepatitis. They have an excellent
view of the plumbing.
A hospital ward for prisoners is
one of many innovations that fol
lowed the mutiny, Randy ex
plains. Others include rotation of
some of the more brutal guards,
additional sinks, some fresh paint
and a shiny new TV set. A poten
tial second Richard Bunch, a guy
who sat in the corner and clawed
imaginary cobwebs from his face,
was removed from the stockade.
Army Rules
So the "mutineers" proved
their point. But according to army

rules, when the army is wrong
somebody's ass gets strung up as a
ritual sacrifice. In this case, one of
the asses will probably be Stephen
R. (Randy) Rowland's.
Randy is a thin kid with a big,
crooked smile and owlish G.I.
glasses. Even after six months in
the stockade, he does not show
much bitterness. He was a trained
practical nurse and C.O. before
joining the service, and says he
joined to get a 91-C or medic's
rating.
When I saw Randy he was sit
ting on a steel cot, wearing only a

pair of blue pajama bottoms. He
said he could not understand how
he got hepatitis, except that he
must have contracted the in
fectious variety while working in
the hospital.
This is true of most prisoner
patients, for whom dirty needles
are one of the new ways out of
military insanity.
Protest And Inhumanity
It is easy to see how Randy got
involved in the protest. He is the
type of person to whom in
humanity just does not make any
sense. "It really shocked me to see
crazy people in jail in 1968," he
says, referring to Richard Bunch
and some of the other prisoners in
the stockade.
"If we hadn't screamed about
it, if the mutiny hadn't happened,
some of those guys would still be
there."
Some of the other mutineers
are a bit harder to figure out. Rick
Gentile, for example, is also in the
prison ward. He spent a year in
Vietnam as a machine gunner, is
an amateur boxer and has a Con
federate flag tattooed on his right
forearm. The same arm is marked
by a long, livid scar-the result of
one of Rick's several attempts to
kill himself.
Outside Standards
"By the standards of the out
side, most of us have done no big
thing," says Gentile. "But here
they are throwing useful citizens
into jail, normal citizens but guys
who just don't dig the army."
Rick's first offense was a
12-hour AWOL on October 12,
when he marched for peace in San
Francisco. Since then he has es
caped twice and participated in a
mutiny. If he serves the maximum
time for all his crimes, he will
spend the next 250 years in
prison.
Most of the mutineers, Randy
says, "are not the type of indi
viduals who normally would have
gotten into this. Most of them
were not too concerned about
Vietnam. They were just doing
time. But they got pissed and sat
down . . ."
Their experience over the past
few months have changed the 27,
according to Randy. "Everyone is
pretty much anti-war now, if for
no other reason than the fact that
the Resistance has helped them.
Army At Its Worst
"Also they have seen the army
at its worst. It would be impossi
ble to send any of them back to
duty now. Some will go out and
do Resistance work."

While he is saying this, his cell
mates get involved in a low-key
hassle with the MPs. They claim
they are too sick to carry their
dinner trays out to the steel door.
The guards won't do it either.
They go call an officer and the
prisoners spend some minutes
hiding a few odds and ends that
they don't want any officer to
see. I jam my notes and a poem
Dennis Owens gave me into my
shoe.
The lieutenant, who is about
four feet tall, decides to pass the
buck on to a doctor. Evidently
this is the kind of skirmish that
men in confinement use to main
tain some kind of interest in life.
Most of the guards are not too
bad, Randy says. The ones who
turn on are usually sympathetic.
Some of the worst ones, like Sgt.
Woodring at the stockade, were
transferred after the mutiny.
Population Pressure
Also the prisoner population
has been reduced by about a third
since October, relieving a lot of
the pressure. Before then, several
guys a week would slice them
selves or swollow lye or try to
poison themselves.
But, Randy says, if the 27 get a
lot of time "there will be a lot of
heavy stuff hitting together and
carrying nightsticks, which was
not customary before the
mutiny."
Are they aware of their civilian
supporters? According to Randy,
news of demonstrations and other
efforts to help them have been im
portant to the prisoners.
"But if anything takes place on
our behalf outside, all the
mutineers would plead that they
be nonviolent," he says. "Ours
was, even to the extent of not
screaming or flipping the bird.
The others should be in the same
spirit."
Powerful Military Mentality
The military mentality is
powerful and pervasive. In a place
like the Presidio, everything is
government issue, right down to
most men's minds. The 27 are
fighting overwhelming odds, be
cause they are fighting a set of as
sumptions, a life style, a system
that has the weight of many
generations behind it.
But it may be that humanity
has some power too. Rick Gentile
and their cell-mates do not seem
to have been destroyed yet. But
they are well aware of what they
are up against.
"They could give us 30 years as
easy as six months," Randy says.
"Originally we wanted them to
clean up these conditions, but
now all we want is for them to let
us alone. Let us go home."
