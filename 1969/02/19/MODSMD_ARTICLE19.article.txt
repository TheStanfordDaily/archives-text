# Tea With Mrs. Pitzer
## Moving Into The Hoover House 
### SUSAN SWARD 
Jean Pitzer sat in the room that
had once been Herbert Hoover's
study. She tilted the silver coffee
urn to pour two cups of coffee.
"After a house like this has had
constant use for public occasions,
there are problems with up-keep.
Mrs. Sterling took me on a tour of
the house when my husband and I
were here on our first visit. One
thing she suggested was that the
leaks be fixed.
"Apparently the walls were
made of hollow tile, so the water
seeped through and came down in
the most inconvenient places and
at the most inconvenient times,"
Mrs. Pitzer said.
Mrs. Pitzer has been in contact
with Birge Clark, the architect
who worked with Mrs. Hoover to
design the Lou Henry Hoover
House that the Kenneth Pitzers
moved into at the start of this
month.
"I asked Mr. Clark to write
down as much as he could remem
ber about why certain things were
planned the way they were
planned. I think his comments
will be very valuable to have as a
record for the University."
Refurnishing
Since the Pitzers have moved
in, the work that has been done
on the house has ranged from
painting the outside to refurnish
ing much of the kitchen-pantry
unit.
"We've bought practically no
new furniture. The major new
item has been the carpets. Mrs.
Sterling put off buying a new
carpet and reupholstering furni
ture because she knew a new
comer was coming. The major ex
pense was the kitchen and pantry
renovation," said Mrs. Pitzer.
In managing the house, Mrs.
Pitzer is assisted by Paul Nakajo, a
Japanese domestic who worked
for the Sterlings. There is also a
cook, Marie Reed, and a part-time
maid who "is the wife of Mr.
Hoover's old valet, Borus." Mrs.
Pitzer finds Paul's assistance "in
valuable" because he can either
handle problems that arise in
managing the house or can find
someone to handle them.
"Challenging" House
When Mrs. Sterling and Mrs.
Pitzer exchanged comments on
the house which was originally
Hoover's, housed the Sterlings
while Wallace Sterling was Presi
dent, and now houses the Pitzers;
Mrs. Sterling told Mrs. Pitzer that
the house constituted a "chal
lenge." The staff size Mrs. Pitzer
now maintains is minimal, accord
ing to the President's wife, con
sidering the size of the house. The
fireplaces alone in the home
number eleven.

Comparing her new home to
the home the Pitzers lived in at
Rice when Pitzer was President
there, Mrs. Pitzer noted, "The
house at Rice was much newer
built in the '50's~but it was a
more traditional house. It was lo
cated in a grove of live oaks. The
Rice campus is very green."
Mrs. Pitzer smiled and said,
"Of course, more than locations,
one misses one's friends. The
faculty there was a wonderful
group of people."
The President's wife went on
to admit that the Stanford and
Rice communities are very similar
in many ways.
Rice Community
"They started out at approxi
mately the same time—Stanford a
bit earlier. Both schools had to go
to court to get relief from provi
sions which stated they were
tuition-free schools. When Rice
went to court on this issue, the
question of whether or not it
could be integrated was settled at
the same time.
"Each school has tried to pro
vide a balanced liberal education,"
she concluded, "though some
people don't seem to realize that
about Rice. That was one area my
husband worked to expand while
he was at Rice.
Mrs. Pitzer and her husband
didn't come to a friendless en
vironment when they made the
move to Stanford. Dr. Pitzer had
known many men pn the chemis
try faculty before he came, and
for twenty-four years the Pitzers
had lived in Berkeley before they
went to Rice.

"We had many friends here be
fore we came," she said. "And last
fall we were more or less commut
ing between Rice and Stanford.
My husband worked very closely
with Dr. Glaser and various
faculty-student committees."
Faculty Women's Club
When questioned about her
contact with faculty wives and
women in the community, Mrs.
Pitzer said, "The President of the
Stanford Faculty Women's Club,
Mrs. Linvill, wrote me right away
when she learned we were coming
to Stanford and gave me all the
information on the Club. I have
been going to as many of the
meetings as I can since we got
here."
Mrs. Pitzer feels that it is very
difficult to define "the role of the
President's wife at Stanford."
"My role isn't much different
than any other faculty wife's role.
It's just a bit more intensified.
Every faculty wife does a very
valuable service to the university
by helping her husband get ac
quainted with students.
"All faculty wives maintain
many contacts with the
community-at-large and do the
community a valuable service by
their contacts. Faculty wives as a
whole are an extremely interesting
group of women with a great
number of capabilities," the Presi
dent's wife said.

Basically, Mrs. Pitzer feels that
the President's wife should be
helpfu) and should support him
"without interfering. I am sure
there are different successful
models, but this is the one I pre
fer."
ri
Meeting Her llut^band
When asked how she met her
husband, Mrs. Pitzer said that
they met in grammer school.
Though they dated in high school,
they did not become engaged
until their last year of college
when Mrs. Jean
Mosher—was at Pamona College
and he was at Cal Tech. They
graduated in June of 1935 and
were married in July of that same
year.
Dr. Pitzer did his graduate
work in chemistry at Berkeley and
then stayed on the faculty there
for 24 years. During that time he
served as dean of the college of
chemistry and as head of
Berkeley's academic senate.
"It was very difficult to leave
Berkeley for Houston when we
left in 1961. But then it was very
difficult to leave Houston when
we came here. I guess it might be
said that the total part of my hus
band's career has been in aca
demic life," she said.
A newly-appointed President's
wife like Mrs. Pitzer has little free
time. When she finds a rare
moment which she can use as she

pleases, Mrs. Pitzer often uses it to
pursue her hobby of studying
archaeology. She is particularly
interested in tools used by various
California Indian tribes. She got
out of a box of flecks of obsidian
and held up a few pieces of the
rock.
Indian Tools
"They tell me that when you
get really good at this," she noted,
"you can tell more about the
Indians' habits from the pieces of
rock they didn't use than from
the pieces they fashioned into
tools."
Mrs. Pitzer is also presently
trying to store up pertinent facts
about Herbert Hoover and the
history of the house that was sup
posed to be the culmination of his
wife's dream-come-true.
"It's rather sad that Mrs.
Hoover didn't get to spend more
time here after Hoover went back
to Washington," observed Mrs.
Pitzer as she surveyed the living
room which could be alternately
described as "Tudor" or
''Chinese" or "Southwest
America" or "Algerian."
"After she died," said Mrs. Pit
zer, "Hoover gave the house to
Stanford." Looking out the
leaded Tudor windows, the Presi
dent's wife continued, "Hoover
didn't like the Tudor windows
himself. He had a plain glass win
dow put in his study so he could
have a view of the bay. Of course,
then, the trees in the garden
hadn't grown so high, and there
was a better view. Now you have
to climb up on the roof to really
get a good view," she concluded.

Dr. Pitzer did his graduate
work in chemistry at Berkeley and
then stayed on the faculty there
for 24 years. During that time he
served as dean of the college of
chemistry and as head of
Berkeley's academic senate.
"It was very difficult to leave
Berkeley for Houston when we
left in 1961. But then it was very
difficult to leave Houston when
we came here. I guess it might be
said that the total part of my hus
band's career has been in aca
demic life," she said.
A newly-appointed President's
wife like Mrs. Pitzer has little free
time. When she finds a rare
moment which she can use as she

pleases, Mrs. Pitzer often uses it to
pursue her hobby of studying
archaeology. She is particularly
interested in tools used by various
California Indian tribes. She got
out of a box of flecks of obsidian
and held up a few pieces of the
rock.
Indian Tools
"They tell me that when you
get really good at this," she noted,
"you can tell more about the
Indians' habits from the pieces of
rock they didn't use than from
the pieces they fashioned into
tools."
Mrs. Pitzer is also presently
trying to store up pertinent facts
about Herbert Hoover and the
history of the house that was sup
posed to be the culmination of his
wife's dream-come-true.
"It's rather sad that Mrs.
Hoover didn't get to spend more
time here after Hoover went back
to Washington," observed Mrs.
Pitzer as she surveyed the living
room which could be alternately
described as "Tudor" or
''Chinese" or "Southwest
America" or "Algerian."
"After she died," said Mrs. Pit
zer, "Hoover gave the house to
Stanford." Looking out the
leaded Tudor windows, the Presi
dent's wife continued, "Hoover
didn't like the Tudor windows
himself. He had a plain glass win
dow put in his study so he could
have a view of the bay. Of course,
then, the trees in the garden
hadn't grown so high, and there
was a better view. Now you have

roof of the Hoover House, overlooking the entire Stanford campus.
Jean Pitzer sat in the room that
had once been Herbert Hoover's
study. She tilted the silver coffee
urn to pour two cups of coffee.
"After a house like this has had
constant use for public occasions,
there are problems with up-keep.
Mrs. Sterling took me on a tour of
the house when my husband and I
were here on our first visit. One
thing she suggested was that the
leaks be fixed.
"Apparently the walls were
made of hollow tile, so the water
seeped through and came down in
the most inconvenient places and
at the most inconvenient times,"
Mrs. Pitzer said.
Mrs. Pitzer has been in contact
with Birge Clark, the architect
who worked with Mrs. Hoover to
design the Lou Henry Hoover
House that the Kenneth Pitzers
moved into at the start of this
month.
"I asked Mr. Clark to write
down as much as he could remem
ber about why certain things were
planned the way they were
planned. I think his comments
will be very valuable to have as a
record for the University."
Refurnishing
Since the Pitzers have moved
in, the work that has been done
on the house has ranged from
painting the outside to refurnish
ing much of the kitchen-pantry
unit.
"We've bought practically no
new furniture. The major new
item has been the carpets. Mrs.
Sterling put off buying a new
carpet and reupholstering furni
ture because she knew a new
comer was coming. The major ex
pense was the kitchen and pantry
renovation," said Mrs. Pitzer.
In managing the house, Mrs.
Pitzer is assisted by Paul Nakajo, a
Japanese domestic who worked
for the Sterlings. There is also a
cook, Marie Reed, and a part-time
maid who "is the wife of Mr.
Hoover's old valet, Borus." Mrs.
Pitzer finds Paul's assistance "in
valuable" because he can either
handle problems that arise in
managing the house or can find
someone to handle them.
"Challenging" House
When Mrs. Sterling and Mrs.
Pitzer exchanged comments on
the house which was originally
Hoover's, housed the Sterlings
while Wallace Sterling was Presi
dent, and now houses the Pitzers;
Mrs. Sterling told Mrs. Pitzer that
the house constituted a "chal
lenge." The staff size Mrs. Pitzer
now maintains is minimal, accord
ing to the President's wife, con
sidering the size of the house. The
fireplaces alone in the home
number eleven.

Comparing her new home to
the home the Pitzers lived in at
Rice when Pitzer was President
there, Mrs. Pitzer noted, "The
house at Rice was much newer
built in the '50's~but it was a
more traditional house. It was lo
cated in a grove of live oaks. The
Rice campus is very green."
Mrs. Pitzer smiled and said,
"Of course, more than locations,
one misses one's friends. The
faculty there was a wonderful
group of people."
The President's wife went on
to admit that the Stanford and
Rice communities are very similar
in many ways.
Rice Community
"They started out at approxi
mately the same time—Stanford a
bit earlier. Both schools had to go
to court to get relief from provi
sions which stated they were
tuition-free schools. When Rice
went to court on this issue, the
question of whether or not it
could be integrated was settled at
the same time.
"Each school has tried to pro
vide a balanced liberal education,"
she concluded, "though some
people don't seem to realize that
about Rice. That was one area my
husband worked to expand while
he was at Rice.
Mrs. Pitzer and her husband
didn't come to a friendless en
vironment when they made the
move to Stanford. Dr. Pitzer had
known many men pn the chemis
try faculty before he came, and
for twenty-four years the Pitzers
had lived in Berkeley before they
went to Rice.

"We had many friends here be
fore we came," she said. "And last
fall we were more or less commut
ing between Rice and Stanford.
My husband worked very closely
with Dr. Glaser and various
faculty-student committees."
Faculty Women's Club
When questioned about her
contact with faculty wives and
women in the community, Mrs.
Pitzer said, "The President of the
Stanford Faculty Women's Club,
Mrs. Linvill, wrote me right away
when she learned we were coming
to Stanford and gave me all the
information on the Club. I have
been going to as many of the
meetings as I can since we got
here."
Mrs. Pitzer feels that it is very
difficult to define "the role of the
President's wife at Stanford."
"My role isn't much different
than any other faculty wife's role.
It's just a bit more intensified.
Every faculty wife does a very
valuable service to the university
by helping her husband get ac
quainted with students.
"All faculty wives maintain
many contacts with the
community-at-large and do the
community a valuable service by
their contacts. Faculty wives as a
whole are an extremely interesting
group of women with a great
number of capabilities," the Presi
dent's wife said.

Basically, Mrs. Pitzer feels that
the President's wife should be
helpfu) and should support him
"without interfering. I am sure
there are different successful
models, but this is the one I pre
fer."
ri
Meeting Her llut^band
When asked how she met her
husband, Mrs. Pitzer said that
they met in grammer school.
Though they dated in high school,
they did not become engaged
until their last year of college
when Mrs. Jean
Mosher—was at Pamona College

My husband worked very closely

Faculty Women's Club
When questioned about her

Pitzer said, "The President of the
Stanford Faculty Women's Club,
Mrs. Linvill, wrote me right away
when she learned we were coming

Mrs. Pitzer feels that it is very

"My role isn't much different

It's just a bit more intensified.
Every faculty wife does a very

by helping her husband get ac

"All faculty wives maintain

Meeting Her llut^band
When asked how she met her

Though they dated in high school,
they did not become engaged
until their last year of college
when Mrs. Jean
Mosher—was at Pamona College
and he was at Cal Tech. They
graduated in June of 1935 and
were married in July of that same
year.
Dr. Pitzer did his graduate
work in chemistry at Berkeley and
then stayed on the faculty there
for 24 years. During that time he
served as dean of the college of

Berkeley's academic senate.
"It was very difficult to leave

difficult to leave Houston when
we came here. I guess it might be

band's career has been in aca

A newly-appointed President's
wife like Mrs. Pitzer has little free
time. When she finds a rare
moment which she can use as she

pleases, Mrs. Pitzer often uses it to
pursue her hobby of studying
archaeology. She is particularly
interested in tools used by various
California Indian tribes. She got
out of a box of flecks of obsidian
and held up a few pieces of the
rock.
Indian Tools
"They tell me that when you
get really good at this," she noted,
"you can tell more about the
Indians' habits from the pieces of
rock they didn't use than from
the pieces they fashioned into
tools."
Mrs. Pitzer is also presently
trying to store up pertinent facts
about Herbert Hoover and the
history of the house that was sup
posed to be the culmination of his
wife's dream-come-true.
"It's rather sad that Mrs.
Hoover didn't get to spend more
time here after Hoover went back
to Washington," observed Mrs.
Pitzer as she surveyed the living
room which could be alternately
described as "Tudor" or
''Chinese" or "Southwest
America" or "Algerian."
"After she died," said Mrs. Pit
zer, "Hoover gave the house to
Stanford." Looking out the
leaded Tudor windows, the Presi
dent's wife continued, "Hoover
didn't like the Tudor windows
himself. He had a plain glass win
dow put in his study so he could
have a view of the bay. Of course,
then, the trees in the garden
hadn't grown so high, and there
was a better view. Now you have

STANFORD VIEW-Mrs. Pitzer and DAILY reporter Susan Sward chat on the
roof of the Hoover House, overlooking the entire Stanford campus.
Jean Pitzer sat in the room that
had once been Herbert Hoover's
study. She tilted the silver coffee
urn to pour two cups of coffee.
"After a house like this has had
constant use for public occasions,
there are problems with up-keep.
Mrs. Sterling took me on a tour of
the house when my husband and I
were here on our first visit. One
thing she suggested was that the
leaks be fixed.
"Apparently the walls were
made of hollow tile, so the water
seeped through and came down in
the most inconvenient places and
at the most inconvenient times,"
Mrs. Pitzer said.
Mrs. Pitzer has been in contact
with Birge Clark, the architect
who worked with Mrs. Hoover to
design the Lou Henry Hoover
House that the Kenneth Pitzers
moved into at the start of this
month.
"I asked Mr. Clark to write
down as much as he could remem
ber about why certain things were
planned the way they were
planned. I think his comments
will be very valuable to have as a
record for the University."
Refurnishing
Since the Pitzers have moved
in, the work that has been done
on the house has ranged from
painting the outside to refurnish
ing much of the kitchen-pantry
unit.
"We've bought practically no
new furniture. The major new
item has been the carpets. Mrs.
Sterling put off buying a new
carpet and reupholstering furni
ture because she knew a new
comer was coming. The major ex
pense was the kitchen and pantry
renovation," said Mrs. Pitzer.
In managing the house, Mrs.
Pitzer is assisted by Paul Nakajo, a
Japanese domestic who worked
for the Sterlings. There is also a
cook, Marie Reed, and a part-time
maid who "is the wife of Mr.
Hoover's old valet, Borus." Mrs.
Pitzer finds Paul's assistance "in
valuable" because he can either
handle problems that arise in
managing the house or can find
someone to handle them.
"Challenging" House
When Mrs. Sterling and Mrs.
Pitzer exchanged comments on
the house which was originally
Hoover's, housed the Sterlings
while Wallace Sterling was Presi
dent, and now houses the Pitzers;
Mrs. Sterling told Mrs. Pitzer that
the house constituted a "chal
lenge." The staff size Mrs. Pitzer
now maintains is minimal, accord
ing to the President's wife, con
sidering the size of the house. The
fireplaces alone in the home
number eleven.

Comparing her new home to
the home the Pitzers lived in at
Rice when Pitzer was President
there, Mrs. Pitzer noted, "The
house at Rice was much newer
built in the '50's~but it was a
more traditional house. It was lo
cated in a grove of live oaks. The
Rice campus is very green."
Mrs. Pitzer smiled and said,
"Of course, more than locations,
one misses one's friends. The
faculty there was a wonderful
group of people."
The President's wife went on
to admit that the Stanford and
Rice communities are very similar
in many ways.
Rice Community
"They started out at approxi
mately the same time—Stanford a
bit earlier. Both schools had to go
to court to get relief from provi
sions which stated they were
tuition-free schools. When Rice
went to court on this issue, the
question of whether or not it
could be integrated was settled at
the same time.
"Each school has tried to pro
vide a balanced liberal education,"
she concluded, "though some
people don't seem to realize that

in, the work that has been done
on the house has ranged from
painting the outside to refurnish
ing much of the kitchen-pantry
unit.
"We've bought practically no
new furniture. The major new
item has been the carpets. Mrs.
Sterling put off buying a new
carpet and reupholstering furni
ture because she knew a new
comer was coming. The major ex
pense was the kitchen and pantry
renovation," said Mrs. Pitzer.
In managing the house, Mrs.
Pitzer is assisted by Paul Nakajo, a
Japanese domestic who worked
for the Sterlings. There is also a
cook, Marie Reed, and a part-time
maid who "is the wife of Mr.
Hoover's old valet, Borus." Mrs.
Pitzer finds Paul's assistance "in
valuable" because he can either
handle problems that arise in
managing the house or can find
someone to handle them.
"Challenging" House
When Mrs. Sterling and Mrs.
Pitzer exchanged comments on
the house which was originally
Hoover's, housed the Sterlings
while Wallace Sterling was Presi
dent, and now houses the Pitzers;
Mrs. Sterling told Mrs. Pitzer that
the house constituted a "chal
lenge." The staff size Mrs. Pitzer
now maintains is minimal, accord
ing to the President's wife, con
sidering the size of the house. The
fireplaces alone in the home
number eleven.

Comparing her new home to
the home the Pitzers lived in at
Rice when Pitzer was President
there, Mrs. Pitzer noted, "The
house at Rice was much newer
built in the '50's~but it was a
more traditional house. It was lo
cated in a grove of live oaks. The
Rice campus is very green."
Mrs. Pitzer smiled and said,
"Of course, more than locations,
one misses one's friends. The
faculty there was a wonderful
group of people."
The President's wife went on
to admit that the Stanford and
Rice communities are very similar
in many ways.
Rice Community
"They started out at approxi
mately the same time—Stanford a
bit earlier. Both schools had to go
to court to get relief from provi
sions which stated they were
tuition-free schools. When Rice
went to court on this issue, the
question of whether or not it
could be integrated was settled at
the same time.
"Each school has tried to pro
vide a balanced liberal education,"
she concluded, "though some
people don't seem to realize that
about Rice. That was one area my
husband worked to expand while
he was at Rice.
Mrs. Pitzer and her husband
didn't come to a friendless en
vironment when they made the
move to Stanford. Dr. Pitzer had
known many men pn the chemis
try faculty before he came, and
for twenty-four years the Pitzers
had lived in Berkeley before they
went to Rice.

"We had many friends here be
fore we came," she said. "And last
fall we were more or less commut
ing between Rice and Stanford.
My husband worked very closely
with Dr. Glaser and various
faculty-student committees."
Faculty Women's Club
When questioned about her
contact with faculty wives and
women in the community, Mrs.
Pitzer said, "The President of the
Stanford Faculty Women's Club,
Mrs. Linvill, wrote me right away
when she learned we were coming
to Stanford and gave me all the
information on the Club. I have
been going to as many of the
meetings as I can since we got
here."
Mrs. Pitzer feels that it is very
difficult to define "the role of the
President's wife at Stanford."
"My role isn't much different
than any other faculty wife's role.
It's just a bit more intensified.
Every faculty wife does a very
valuable service to the university
by helping her husband get ac
quainted with students.
"All faculty wives maintain
many contacts with the
community-at-large and do the
community a valuable service by
their contacts. Faculty wives as a
whole are an extremely interesting
group of women with a great
number of capabilities," the Presi
dent's wife said.

Basically, Mrs. Pitzer feels that
the President's wife should be
helpfu) and should support him
"without interfering. I am sure
there are different successful
models, but this is the one I pre
fer."
ri
Meeting Her llut^band
When asked how she met her
husband, Mrs. Pitzer said that
they met in grammer school.
Though they dated in high school,
they did not become engaged
until their last year of college
when Mrs. Jean
Mosher—was at Pamona College
and he was at Cal Tech. They
graduated in June of 1935 and
were married in July of that same
year.
Dr. Pitzer did his graduate
work in chemistry at Berkeley and
then stayed on the faculty there
for 24 years. During that time he
served as dean of the college of
chemistry and as head of
Berkeley's academic senate.
"It was very difficult to leave
Berkeley for Houston when we
left in 1961. But then it was very
difficult to leave Houston when
we came here. I guess it might be
said that the total part of my hus
band's career has been in aca
demic life," she said.
A newly-appointed President's
wife like Mrs. Pitzer has little free
time. When she finds a rare
moment which she can use as she

pleases, Mrs. Pitzer often uses it to
pursue her hobby of studying
archaeology. She is particularly
interested in tools used by various
California Indian tribes. She got
out of a box of flecks of obsidian
and held up a few pieces of the
rock.
Indian Tools
"They tell me that when you
get really good at this," she noted,
"you can tell more about the
Indians' habits from the pieces of
rock they didn't use than from
the pieces they fashioned into
tools."
Mrs. Pitzer is also presently
trying to store up pertinent facts
about Herbert Hoover and the
history of the house that was sup
posed to be the culmination of his
wife's dream-come-true.
"It's rather sad that Mrs.
Hoover didn't get to spend more
time here after Hoover went back
to Washington," observed Mrs.
Pitzer as she surveyed the living
room which could be alternately
described as "Tudor" or
''Chinese" or "Southwest
America" or "Algerian."
"After she died," said Mrs. Pit
zer, "Hoover gave the house to
Stanford." Looking out the
leaded Tudor windows, the Presi
dent's wife continued, "Hoover
didn't like the Tudor windows
himself. He had a plain glass win
dow put in his study so he could
have a view of the bay. Of course,
then, the trees in the garden
hadn't grown so high, and there
was a better view. Now you have
to climb up on the roof to really
get a good view," she concluded.

roof of the Hoover House, overlooking the entire Stanford campus.
Jean Pitzer sat in the room that
had once been Herbert Hoover's
study. She tilted the silver coffee
urn to pour two cups of coffee.
"After a house like this has had
constant use for public occasions,
there are problems with up-keep.
Mrs. Sterling took me on a tour of
the house when my husband and I
were here on our first visit. One
thing she suggested was that the
leaks be fixed.
"Apparently the walls were
made of hollow tile, so the water
seeped through and came down in
the most inconvenient places and
at the most inconvenient times,"
Mrs. Pitzer said.
Mrs. Pitzer has been in contact
with Birge Clark, the architect
who worked with Mrs. Hoover to
design the Lou Henry Hoover
House that the Kenneth Pitzers
moved into at the start of this
month.
"I asked Mr. Clark to write
down as much as he could remem
ber about why certain things were
planned the way they were
planned. I think his comments
will be very valuable to have as a
record for the University."
