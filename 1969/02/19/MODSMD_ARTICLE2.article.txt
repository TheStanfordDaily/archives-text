# Boa, Piranha, And Pig
## Students Develop Unofficial Zoo 
### BARBARA HYLAND 
When a girl shudders about a harrow
ing experience with one of the frater
nity animals, she may be jsutified. One
house is raising a pig in its back yard,
and another has a boa constrictor in an
upstairs bedroom.
Pets on campus almost constitute a
zoo. There is everything from piranha
fish to alligators, including numerous
rats, guinea pigs, mice, cats, dogs, tad
poles, and goldfish. Since most are con
traband, according to Stanford and
County laws, keeping pets involves the
challenge of hiding it from the author
ities or the maid. The larger the animal,
the more ingenious one must be.
The pig, affectionately called "Mem
I' g" or "Fascist Pig," although less than
i. ur months old, weighs 45 pounds. His
o i/ner is raising him until he is "big
eiiOi'gh to eat," although he possibly
m ;y go to a children's zoo.
Baby Powder For Pigs
Caring for him includes giving him a
weekly bath. Then he is dusted with
baby powder. His owner conceded that
"he smells pretty bad even when he's
clean."
Odor problems have made it neces
sary to rotate his position in the back
yard. The most common criticism mem

bers of the house have is that he smells
when kept outside their rooms.
His pen is small so it's necessary to
give him extra exercise. On weekends
his owner plays with him and takes him
on walks on a rinestone leash.
Lyndon, the boa constrictor, is "not
as much a pet as a friend," according to
his master. He is between four and five
years old and is four and a half feet
long. In estimating his weight, his owner
said, "I need both hands to get him off
my neck."
His owner highly recommends boas
for pets because they are "clean, easy to
take care of, and good for scaring peo
ple." Although Lyndon needs little ex
ercise, his owner enjoys taking him out
of his cage and letting him loose in the
showers or in the halls.
Dr. Philip Haines, the County Veter
inarian, said that boas are considered
exotic animals and one must have a
permit to keep them. Regarding pigs, he
stressed, "They are not permitted in any
circumstance." This is due to zoning
laws.
However he was most upset at the
possibility of piranhas being kept on
campus. Piranhas are illegal in the Uni
ted States, for, as Dr. Haines explained,
"If they get lost in one of our streams

and started to multiply, we might have a
piranha problem."
Hal Wilson, Health Officer at Stan
ford, said that in dorms there are no
official restrictions regarding cats, birds,
and fish. This is not true in Escondido
Village where married students must
sign as an agreement that states they are
subject to certain regulations, "specifi
cally the prohibition of pets."
Cats are prohibited for health
reasons. The sandboxes in Escondido
Village attr them and often children
playing there contract penworm.
The rulings for dogs are more string
ent. In a memo to campus residents it
states that "dogs are not permitted in
multiple housing units, including frater
nities; in any food establishment or area
where food is prepared or served; or in
classrooms, or other academic or admin
istrative buildings."
Rabid Skunks and Racoons
This memo also reads, "Since Stan
ford University is a rabies endemic area
with a high population of predatory ani
mals, including skunks (rabid skunks
have been found in this area) it becomes
doubly important to provide responsible
control and confinement of pets on the
campus." Wilson also mentioned the
existence of rabid racoons in this area.
For other than health reasons, dogs
should be controlled since they can be
come a nuisance. Twice dogs that were
let loose have attacked cattle on campus
and sometimes cows have died.
Wilson also questioned the desir
ability of a dog having 60 masters as it
sometimes does in a fraternity house.
Wilson argued that a dog needs one res
ponsible owner, otherwise he may be
come psychotic.
Animals And Traditions
Animals play a part in many of the
Stanford traditions. In one row house,
every year at senior breakfast a large
white rat, "Moby," is handed down.
Measuring 18'/2 inches from his nose to
the end of his tail, he owes his size to
his special treat, "Life" cereal. Wilson
said that some of the fraternities use
greased pigs in their activities.
The possibilities of what may be liv
ing undiscovered on campus are innum
erable. Wilson said nostagically, "I re
member finding a cow in a bedroom
once." Haines was almost as awed when
he spoke of an investigation for animals
a year ago. "They had everything on the
campus â€”exotic birds, snakes, bobcats,
you name it."
Perhaps there is some basis for believ
ing that Stanford is going to the dogs or
even becoming an animal farm.

OINK-Known to friends and foes alike as "Fascist Pig," this noble animal is another
fraternity denizen.

SNAKE IN THE GRASS?-No, it's actually in
a fraternity house on campus.
