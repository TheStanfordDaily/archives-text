Dr. Paul Ehrlich, Stanford's
most vocal advocate of population
control, presented his views to the
Faculty Mothers Club yesterday.
According to Ehrlich, the two
main problems facing the world
today are the population increase
and destruction of the earth's re
sources. The natural environment T
began to deteriorate when man
first settled down to farm the land
and the population began to in
crease, he said.
With the arrival of the Indus
trial Age, mankind saw "spectac
ular rise in the rate of increase" of
population, that will cause the
world's population to double
within the next thirty-five years.
In addition, he warned that
"the major cause of death in India
may be malnutrition". He feels
that highly developed countries
are helping to solve this problem.
Ehrlich pinpointed population
control as the solution to the pro
blem. "Anything you try and do
on the food and environment end j
is like giving a cancer patient
aspirin and morphine to ease the
pain. Eventually he still dies from
the cancer."
