## Committee Play Excellent 
### BOB O'MEALLY 
Dialogue Black-White's produc
tion of Big Time Buck White, cur
rently playing at the Committee
Theatre, should be seen by every
one who can get to the City. The
cast is superlative, the music
rhythmic and memorable, and the
company takes bold steps toward
establishing a new and exciting
type of theatre.
This musical-play, written by
Joseph Tuotti and Oscar Brown,
Jr., invites the audience to the
meeting hall of a black cultural
organization, BAD (Beautiful
Alleluia Day), where two fo the
members discuss ousting the or
ganization's leader. James Earl
Garrison ("Honey Man"), Ted
Lange ("Weasel"), Hershell Bur
ton ("Rubber Band"), and
Antony Williams ("Jive") arrive,

one by one, and each tells his
story in a monologue and a song.
"Honeyman Song," "Nobody
Does My Thing," and "Head
Nigger in Charge" (H.N.1.C.1.8.)
are the most exciting of these
sketches. As Weasel, who is insti
gating the proposed coup, tries to
encourage support against Jive,
the "H.N.1.C.," the best song,
"Step Across That Line (And
Your Behind Will Be Mine)," is
sung by Rubber Band. Expert
dozens playing "you upper-class
bourgeois muthafucker"), tale
telling and effeminate flourishes
shape Hershell Burton's role as
"The Hunter" into by far the
most striking and amusing one.
Audience Interaction
Perhaps Big Time Buck White's
greatest achievement is interaction
with and participation by the aud
ience. "All you people came here
to be threatened and damn if
you're gonna get out before we do

a job on you!" are the opening
lines spoken by Honey Man as he
enters from a side door, locking it
behind him.
People are invited to ask ques
tions of Buck White, the charis
matic leader of the group, who is
the last to enterâ€”but only after
they "tap the plate" with money.
One man, who contributed only a
dime, was told "He has four
hundred years of back dues to pay
and he's going to begin payment
tonight."
Drums and Balloons
Big Time Buck White (Big
Black) halts most of this ribaldry.
The fantastic Afro-Drummer
delivers "the Word" to the group
punctuating his remarks with
conga drum playing. He exposes
the other characters as "jives" and
"studs" and declares that black
people must abandon such roles
because they obstruct together
ness and self-pride. "We're going

to fill the streets with soulful
songs beneath black balloons of
love after we just break these
chains," says Big Time Buck
White. "We just got a few more
chains to break, but we'll do it."
Finally, while a strobe light
flashes and the cast dances and
sings. Stephen Zendt, seated in
the audience, warns other while
viewers that black people are ser
ious in their quest for freedom.
"Look at them," he says. "We'd
better call them crazy and lock
them up. They're threatening our
way of life!"
Big Time Buck White is a new
approach to drama. There a*e no
stereotypes, only real people from
certain parts of your home town,
getting together, singing a song of
revolution. You will laugh, you
will cry, you may cringe, you may
cheer, you will be given a balloon
when you leave. No one should
miss an opportunity for all that
for the price of a theatre ticket.
