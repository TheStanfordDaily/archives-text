# German Expressionist Films: 'The Cabinet Of Dr. Caligari'
## 
### TODD McCARTHY 
For the final Wednesday night
art lecture this winter, Standish
Lawder, professor of film history

and 20th century art at Yale,
spoke on "The German Expres
sionist Cinema" and about the
key film of that movement, The
Cabinet of Dr. Caligari.
The lecture, given in Bishop
Auditorium, centered around the
artistic trends of the early 20th
century which culminated in the
creation of Caligari in 1920. Be
fore World War I, Lawder said,
there was "much discharge of
creative urges and arts," abetted
during war years by an "extended

use of technological devices." A
German style, quite distinct from
the more graceful French, emer
ged and employed "sharp, ang
ular, restless and agitated images
and design patterns."
Besides having a unique visual
style, the German cinema was
vastly influenced by the national
state of mind. After the war,
Germany was left in ruin, without
a leader or national spirit. There
fore, "with the problems of the
present too unbearable," there
was "a pre-occupation with a view
of the world in the past." Films
contained vast amounts of
"romanticism, death, spiritulism,
violence and melancholy," as re
flected in Caligari and other im
portant pictures such as Faust and
The Colem.
Lawder suggested that the
exaggerated acting style of the
day was, at the time, "not con
sidered bad acting." Rather, the
style was taken directly from the
theatre and consisted of "sym
bolic gestures, not meant to be
realistic but to convey an obvious
inner emotional state."
Expressionist Cinema
Psychological conditions were
conveyed in the German expres
sionist cinema not only by acting
but by the visual design of the
film. Such conditions as the
"melancholy aloneness of man"
were expressed by "man-made
psychological landscapes," which,
in the case of Caligari, were cre
ated not so much by the film
makers as by three of Germany's
leading artists of the time.
Upon its release in 1920, Cali
gari was a big hit but was regarded
as "a cheap experiment." None
theless, the film greatly influenced
the German cinema for, in the
ensuing four or five years, there
was "a big tendancy to pre-stylize
films."
Ultimately, Lawder feels that,
"what makes The Cabinet of I>.
Caligari so memorable is the per
fect integration of its visual and
dramatic qualities ... its amalgam
ation of feeling and form."
Lawder used slides throughout
his presentation to demonstrate
the evolution of the German
visual style and then screened
Caligari.
