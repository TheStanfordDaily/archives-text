# Hockey Team Falls
## 
### 
Stanford's ice hockey team
dropped its second game of the
season Sunday night to the San
Francisco Senior Hockey Club,
11-5, at the Belmont Iceland.
The game was closer than the
score indicates, and faced with a
fast and experienced team, it was
probably Stanford's best effort to
date. The San Francisco team in
cluded three players from the
Fresno semipro hockey team, and
overall, the club is the equivalent
of a good Eastern college team.
Before a vocal and extremely
partisan Indian crowd, San Fran
cisco jumped off to an early lead
that Stanford could never close.
Down 5-0, Allen Pyle rammed
home two quick goals on passes
from Hugh Tirrell, Dick Herzog,
and Jon Westerlin to make it 5-2.
In the second and third per
iods, Westerlin, a standout all

night, scored three goals to give
him a hat trick. They came on
passes from Tom Generous, Fuller
Torrey, and Bob Kadlec, and kept
the Stanford hopes alive. Each
was answered by an SF goal how
ever.
Stanford's defensive problems
mounted during the game. First
string defenseman Mark Heffel
finger was knocked out of the
game early with a deep laceration.
And latter, defenseman Marty
Taylor got the same, though he
was able to continue.
Sunday night, the team goes
against the thrice-beaten Peninsula
Hockey Club at Belmont. Stan
ford is now 3-2 on the season, and
has improved steadily since start
ing in January. There are now
noticeably fewer cobwebs in both
the skates and legs of the players.
Game time is 10:15 p.m.


WET AND WlLD—Stanford's senior swim captain, Pete Siebert gets gang tackled
by his jubilant teammates after the aquatic victory of the decade, the 57-56 win
over USC on Saturday. Coach Jim Gaughran joined his team in the victory bath.
