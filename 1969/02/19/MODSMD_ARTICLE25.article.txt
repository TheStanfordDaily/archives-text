# Volleyball Squad Wins In Napa Invitational
## 
### 
The Stanford volleyball team
continues to improve.
The A squad took first at the
Napa Invitational Open beating
Berkeley in the finals. Members of
the squad include Jim Julian,
John Birch, Mike Stevens, Mike
Moore, Eric Rhineholm, Rocky
Laverty, and Marv Vickers.
Up until now, Stanford has
only participated in open tourn
aments, eligible for any organized
amateur team. They have faired
quite well. Their toughest com
petition has come from the Olym
pic Club teams. However in two
weeks, March 1-3, they will enter
the Santa Barbara Invitational
with every top college team in the
nation represented.
Stanford's placement there
will be a fair indication of the
team's national potential. Last
year, they were ranked fifth.
In the following weeks the
squad will begin its climb towards
the nationals, playing in the Far
Western Open at Alameda, and
the Regionals at San Jose.

Dick Sudarko, a graduate stu
dent, is acting as coach of the
squad, with the help of Leonard
Gipson. Gipson is a member of
the U.S. Olympic Committee and
has several national volleyball
championships to his credit.


SURE TWO—Stanford's big man, Hill Palmer hits on a layup against Oregon's
Ducks in the Cards' 81-76 victory Saturday night. Watching helplessly is Hill
Dro/.diak. Palmer canned 17 points and grabbed 11 rebounds in the contest. The
varsity has finally escaped the cellar of the Pac-8, with their double weekend
wins. Saturday night, they face Washington State (5-3) in Pullman, and then
work Monday evening at Seattle against Washington (4-4). UCLA moves in a
week from Friday in the big one.
