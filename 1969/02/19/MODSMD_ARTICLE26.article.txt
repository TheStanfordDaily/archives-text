FIRST DEFEAT-Staniord's string of '
five straight rugby wins was decisively
snapped Saturday, as visiting UCLA J
outslogged the Tribe for a muddy 11-3 j
win.
The score was no fluke. UCLA's
control of the scrums and excellent
kicking bottled up Stanford quite ef- j
fectively. The Tribe's only score came
when Jim Raufmann scooped up a
loose ball on the Bruin 40 and broke
through for a diving try into the corner
of the end/one.
UCLA opened the scoring and !
gained a quick psychological edge with
a try between the posts early in the j
first half. A 35-yard penalty kick and a t
three yard try in the second half put
die game out of reach.
Stanford barely missed three sec
ond-half points when Leon Hartvick
son's 40-yard penalty kick was blown
back by the wind and bounced off the
crossbar.
The Tribe now stands at 5-1 for the
season and 1-1 in conference play.
UCLA is 5-0 overall and 2-0 in league, i
