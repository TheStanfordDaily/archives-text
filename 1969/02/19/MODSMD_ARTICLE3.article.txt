# Pitzer To Discuss Demands With BSU
## 
### 
The first meeting between represen
tatives of the Black Student Union
(BSU) and President Kenneth Pitzer will
be held tomorrow morning. Discussion
will center around the BSU's 12 de
mands, including the future position of
Prof. Robert Koff, director of the Stan
ford Teacher Education Program
(STEP).
Last Thursday Dean H. Thomas

James of the School of Education an
nounced the appointment of Cecil
Shaw, a black graduate student, to co
ordinate recruitment and interviewing
for STEP.
In a letter to Pitzer, James referred
to the Koff-Stevenson interview in
which Miss Stevenson was allegedly
asked racially and personally embarrass
ing questions. "Certainly no one can
argue that this interview turned out
well," he said.
James defended Koff by pointing
out, "Professor Koff has successfully
conducted more than forty interviews
since September."
In Pitzer's response to James' letter,
he declared, "I am persuaded by the
(Human Relations Commission) report
that Dr. Koff's conduct of the interview
was at times 'indelicate' and 'insensi
tive,' and that while he certainly did not
intend to cause Miss Stevenson distress,
he did in fact do so.
"The new arrangements for inter
viewing candidates to the STEP Program
should help to avoid similar incidents in
the future, and I am pleased to note
that you are appointing a committee to
look into the entire admissions process
in the School."
The BSU has not met with the uni
versity administration since they pre
sented their demands on Feb. 5.
