# Road Width
## 
### 
Two Stanford civil engineers
were awarded national honors in
Washington recently for a tech
nical paper proposing the width of
rural roads be reduced.
Two two professors, Clarkson
H. Oglesby and Matthew J. Al
tenhofen, were given the top
award for 1968 by the Highway
Research Board at its 48th annual
meeting. The highway board is
part of the National Research
Council.
The professors argued that
rural roads are needlessly being
built to almost the same specifica
tions as major highways.
