# Law Students Hit 'Review' Set-Up
## 
### DENNIS PERLUSS 
A challenge to the organization of
the Stanford Law Review, termed a
symbol of the present orientation of
legal education at Stanford, was issued
yesterday in the Law School's Moot
courtroom.
More than 150 law students heard
arguments that criteria for membership
on the Review staff should be altered, if
in fact the students wanted to continue
to publish the periodical.
The primary objections to the Law
Review involve its manner of selecting
workers and its "artificially high status"
among Law School activities.
The Law Review publishes original
manuscripts of legal interest submitted
by student staffers, Stanford faculty,
other Stanford students and outside
sources.
Selection Procedure
Under the current selection pro
cedure approximately twenty-five stu
dents are chosen, after completion of
their first year, to serve for the next two
years on the Stanford Law Review.
The selection is done entirely by first
year grades.
Membership on the Review requires
many hours of work checking citations
in submitted articles. The staffers, in ad
dition, are expected to contribute
material of their own.
The reward for the time spent work
ing on the Law Review is intensive train
ing in areas of expertise required of
most attorneys. This training is sup
ported by resources and encouragement
from the Law School.
Many of the students at yesterday's
meeting, sponsored by the Stanford stu
dent chapter of the National Lawyers
Guild, agreed that membership on the
Law Review also could mean an extra
$5,000 for starting salaries after gradu
ation.
Review Criticism
Criticism of the Review centered on
issues. Most of the students who spoke
were concerned that the educational op
portunities that Law Reviewers receive
are denied to the vast majority of stu
dents at Stanford Law School.
Blame was leveled at the current
selection system for creating and per-

petuating an elite group within the Law
School. The selection process was also
criticized for creating an "artificially
high status" for the Law Review, which
slighted the other activities available to
law students.
The most frequent suggestion to alle
viate these problems was making the
Law Review a voluntary organization,
or one whose members where chosen by
writing samples, interviews, or some
other criterion rather than grades. The
Yale Law Journal was cited as an ex
ample of a highly-rated law review
whose members were chosen by writing
competition.
In-Groups And Out-Groups
The failure of Stanford's "writing
on" program, whereby second year stu
dents could be admitted to the Law Re
view after original selections had been
made, was attributed to the creation of
an original in-group, out-group feeling.
The question of the law review, and
its selection procedure, and its attrac
tiveness to students brought into the
open the problem of the entire orien
tation of education at the Stanford Law
School.
One student questioned the function
of a law review or of grades at a law
school. He charged that Stanford's law
school was "performing a recruiting
function for law firms while the idea of
a community of scholars is tossed to the
wind."
Coercive Education
Another student added that edu
cation at the law school proceded en
tirely under the stimulus of "coercion."
The idea of learning because one is in
terested in something, she declared, is
entirely ignored.
Making the Stanford Law Review
voluntary (or anonymous as someone
else suggested) was seen by several of
the students as a logical first step
toward the elimination of grades and
the law school's orientation to corpor
ate recruiting methods.
Final suggestions by the meeting
chairman called for a referendum to be
sponsored by the Law School Student
Association and for the formation of a
list of people interested in working on
the matter.
