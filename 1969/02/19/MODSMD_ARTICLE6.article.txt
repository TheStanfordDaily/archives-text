# Beating Of Stanford Student Not Caused By ROTC Ties
## 
### 
The beating of a Stanford student
Monday night appears to have no con
nection with his past participation in
the ROTC program, despite erroneous
press releases.
Sophomore Stephen Duncan who
was assaulted by three unidentified men
while he was walking near Maples
Pavilion at about 10:00 p.m. stated "the
men were probably just looking for
trouble."
When questioned that evening by
police as to any possible motive for the
incident, Duncan mentioned his recent
support for ROTC, although he stated
that he could find no evidence to make
such a connection.
"Even though I was kind of deliri
ous," Duncan later stated, "I didn't
want to link anything, because I know
how things get blown up."
The Stanford News Service, however,
released a statement Tuesday morning
of an "apparent" connection of the
beating with Duncan's active support
for ROTC, and the unfounded con
clusion was spread to other wire
services, radio news broadcasts and ap
peared in an article in the Palo Alto
Times.

Jeff Littleboy of the Stanford News
Service stated that his office published a
further statement Tuesday afternoon
clarifying the incident.
Duncan told police that he spoke to
his attackers but their dialogue had
nothing to do with Duncan's political
views on opinions on ROTC.
Duncan could only give a meager de
scription of the men, stating, however,
that the one who initially accosted him
was about 20-23 years old and white,
with dark hair and wearing dark clothes.
After struggling back to his fra
ternity, Delta Kappa Epsilon, Duncan
was taken to Cowell Health Center,
treated for injuries, and was released
yesterday morning.
Duncan was a member of Stanford's
naval ROTC until he was forced to re
sign because of a previous shoulder
separation.
The nineteen-year-old sophomore
agrees that he has "active support" for
ROTC, having worked recently for its
continuation at Stanford.
Police Chief Thomas Bell stated that
he was "upset that ROTC was tied into
the incident".

attacked for no apparent reason Monday
night. Original reports that his affiliation with
ROTC was the cause of the beating seem
erroneous.
