# Changes On Fraternity Row
## 
### MARK WEINBERGER 
As the yearly fraternity drive for new
recruits begins, fraternities are once
again emphasizing a new-found "rele
vance" and "positivism."
The surprising thing is that this year
these claims just might reflect the first
glimmering of truth.
The attractiveness of the coed living
alternative, the stinging attacks of SES,
the excruciating self-criticism exhibited
by increasing numbers of fraternity
brothers, and the changing values of suc
cessive entering classes: all seem to indi
cate that change in not only desirable,
but essential.
Begrudgingly, the first indications are
now coming to light that change is in-

have voted this year to end the "ding"
system that barred fraternity member
ship to any rushee who was opposed by
from one to three active members.
'Positive Selection Systems
Instead, they have instituted "posi
tive" selection systems that require that
potential members gain approval from a
certain percentage of the current mem
bership.
One such plan was recently adopted
bv Alpha Sigma Phi. As house president

Norm Boone explained, "First, a rushee
must become acquainted with at least
four-fifths of the members of the house
and secondly, he must become ac
quainted with at least two-fifths of the
house such that two-fifths indicate their
support of the candidate.
"When these two conditions are satis
fied the candidate is automatically given
a bid. As rooms become available the
new members will move into the house
in the order in which they accepted
their bids," Boone continued.
Philosophy Of Liberalization
Boone commented on the philoso

phy of his fraternity's selection liberali
zation: "The new procedure guarantees
equal access to the fraternity and selects
primarily for the strength of the interest
in the house of the individual rushee.
"If he has any sense at all, the rushee
can tell after a few visits if the house
will be right for him. Part of that de
cision is based on his feeling of whether
he would be right for the house. He can
tell if he would fit into the sense of
community that the fraternity de
velops," Boone stated
In a similar move, Phi Kappa Sigma
decided at its last meeting to abandon
its "two ding" system in favor of an 80
percent approval plan for admittance.
Backed By Many Houses
This move to the positive selection
system is backed by a large number of
Stanford's 24 houses. Dan Williams,
dean of students office advisor to the
fraternities, estimates that about two
thirds of the houses embrace some type
of positive selection system.
And, of the one-third of the fraterni
ties which retain a unanimous vote
system, "it is often on paper only. Very
often, the minority defers to the wishes
of the majority," Williams stated.
There is little doubt that Stanford

fraternities are moving away from the
old way of doing things. The single
blackball, hell week, meaningless tra
dition, overt discrimination, and the
Greek god, he-man ideal are gone or
rapidly losing the "relevance" that fra
ternity men so stridently claim to seek.
The question is: are the fraternities
moving fast enough to retain or regain
their popularity?
Meal exchanges are now underway,
and formal rush opens March 4 with the
first open house. The rush and selection
policies may be just the ones that will
continue to attract 1,300 pledges.

have voted this year to end the "ding"
system that barred fraternity member
ship to any rushee who was opposed by
from one to three active members.
'Positive Selection Systems
Instead, they have instituted "posi
tive" selection systems that require that
potential members gain approval from a
certain percentage of the current mem
bership.
One such plan was recently adopted
bv Alpha Sigma Phi. As house president

Norm Boone explained, "First, a rushee
must become acquainted with at least
four-fifths of the members of the house
and secondly, he must become ac
quainted with at least two-fifths of the
house such that two-fifths indicate their
support of the candidate.
"When these two conditions are satis
fied the candidate is automatically given
a bid. As rooms become available the
new members will move into the house
in the order in which they accepted
their bids," Boone continued.
Philosophy Of Liberalization
Boone commented on the philoso

phy of his fraternity's selection liberali
zation: "The new procedure guarantees
equal access to the fraternity and selects
primarily for the strength of the interest
in the house of the individual rushee.
"If he has any sense at all, the rushee
can tell after a few visits if the house
will be right for him. Part of that de
cision is based on his feeling of whether
he would be right for the house. He can
tell if he would fit into the sense of
community that the fraternity de
velops," Boone stated
In a similar move, Phi Kappa Sigma
decided at its last meeting to abandon
its "two ding" system in favor of an 80
percent approval plan for admittance.
Backed By Many Houses
This move to the positive selection
system is backed by a large number of
Stanford's 24 houses. Dan Williams,
dean of students office advisor to the
fraternities, estimates that about two
thirds of the houses embrace some type
of positive selection system.
And, of the one-third of the fraterni
ties which retain a unanimous vote
system, "it is often on paper only. Very
often, the minority defers to the wishes
of the majority," Williams stated.
There is little doubt that Stanford

fraternities are moving away from the
old way of doing things. The single
blackball, hell week, meaningless tra
dition, overt discrimination, and the
Greek god, he-man ideal are gone or
rapidly losing the "relevance" that fra
ternity men so stridently claim to seek.
The question is: are the fraternities
moving fast enough to retain or regain
their popularity?
Meal exchanges are now underway,
and formal rush opens March 4 with the
first open house. The rush and selection
policies may be just the ones that will
continue to attract 1,300 pledges.

Analysis
As the yearly fraternity drive for new
recruits begins, fraternities are once
again emphasizing a new-found "rele
vance" and "positivism."
The surprising thing is that this year
these claims just might reflect the first
glimmering of truth.
The attractiveness of the coed living
alternative, the stinging attacks of SES,
the excruciating self-criticism exhibited
by increasing numbers of fraternity
brothers, and the changing values of suc
cessive entering classes: all seem to indi
cate that change in not only desirable,
but essential.
