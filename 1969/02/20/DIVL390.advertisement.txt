The
Standard
THE KLH* Model Twenty is the stereo
music system against which all the
others are measured.
The Model Twenty was the first stereo
system to put all of the performance asso
ciated with separate audio components into
one package. More accurately, into three
simple and handsome walnut packages that
just plug together and play.
When the Model Twenty appeared, the
experts said that it would take an extra
three or four hundred dollars—plus a lot
more complexity— to make any real
improvement on its startling performance.
That still holds.

The Model Twenty plays mono or stereo
records and FM broadcasts. You can have
it with AM radio as well. And there are
jacks for making or listening to tape record
ings, or for headphones. The Garrard turn
table, made to KLH specifications, has a
low-mass tone arm and Pickering cartridge
with diamond stylus. Vernier tuning and a
"zero-center" meter help bring in the most
difficult FM stations.
But the sound quality is what KLH
owners talk about. The Model Twenty has
the range and power needed to fill even the
largest living room with the undistorted
sound of a symphony orchestra.
Come in and check the standard for your
self. Then take it away and fill your home
with music instead of equipment.
