# Berkeley Violence Flares, 25 Arrested, Many Hurt
## 
### CRAIG WILSON 
The worst violence in a month broke
out at the University of California at
Berkeley yesterday as student strikers
and sympathizers hurled stones, bottles,
and stinkbombs at police.
Twenty-five people were arrested in
the melee and many others injured as
police waded into the hostile crowd on
numerous occasions indiscriminately
swinging clubs while moving back
masses of people.
At one point the violence became so
intense that police began spraying Mace
just outside the Student Union building
sending students reeling. This reporter
received a dose of the eye-irritant and
had to be treated.
Campus officials said 35 windows
were broken in eight buildings—ls in
University Hall where UC Regents are to
meet today and tomorrow.
First Day On Strike
The trouble came on the first day of
the American Federation of Teachers
(AFT), Local 1570, strike. Teaching As
sistants walked picket lines at a half
dozen campus entrances and at several
campus buildings.
Trouble did not develop until mid
afternoon when 60 highway patrol
officers came to reinforce deputies
supervising a picket line.
Until then conditions had been rela
tively quiet as students marched and
heckled police both at Sather Gate and
at the Telegraph-Bancroft intersection,
which is a primary access to the campus.
Sporadic Arrests
Sporadic arrests had been made in the
morning for both outstanding warrants
and various other offenses.
The crowd estimated at two or three
thousand continued to swell after the
usual noon hour buildup. At 1 p.m.
various spokesmen began leading march
ers five abreast away from Sather Gate
and onto the campus, as had happened
on several previous occasions.
The crowd at one point passed Uni
versity Hall where stones and asphalt
were hurled breaking nearly every win
dow on the first floor of the structure.
From 150-200 officers most of them
state highway patrolmen, chased
demonstrators around the campus, ar
resting, among others, three non
students, one of them a 13 year-old
Negro youth.
Flying Wedge
Conditions quieted momentarily after
a flying wedge of police pursued the

marchers and chased them back to
Sproul Plaza.
The most serious trouble erupted at
about 2:30 after the police reinforce
ments arrived. Students began hurling
rocks and bottles at the deputies, and
the squad began chasing demonstrators
at the point where the rocks had ap
parently been thrown.
Several times officers charged stu
dents near the Union driving them back
into the confines of the building. Police
apparently had the Plaza under control
when a large groupof students suddenly
formed themselves into a group and
began chanting and shouting as they
moved into the police lines.
Bedlam
From that point on bedlam broke
loose.
Students began pelting police with
objects as chanting "pigs off campus"
became louder and louder. Police
charged the Union on half a dozen occa
sions this time entering the Union
swinging their clubs as they came.
Large windows were smashed in the
Union at one point when a student was
thrown through one of them. People
were trampled as students scurried for
cover. One girl on the staircase inside
appeared delirious and in shock.
Ncck Lock
Outside one policeman had a demon
strator around the neck and was club
bing him, while several students were
being led away. One officer, caught in
side the Union alone, was tackled by
strikers and mauled before he could es
cape.
Mace was sprayed as student medics
administered an antidote to victims.
Broken glass from the windows and ash
trays was scattered throughout the
room.
At 3:15 the decision was made to
retreat into Sproul Hall. After that most
demonstrators left the intersection.
Those arrested were charged with dis
orderly conduct and resisting arrest.
Five persons were treated in the Uni
versity health center including a police
man who suffered a bloody nose and a

Negro photographer for the campus
newspaper who said police clubbed him
from behind. All were released after
treatment.
The teaching assistants local, which
maintained picketing throughout (he en
tire afternoon, represents 400 of the
1,025 teaching assistants at UC Berke
ley.
Local 1695, American Federation of
State County and Municipal Employees,
voted strike support. Members of the
group are primarily clerical workers.
Union pickets during the day were
orderly in general although students
paraded around campus pitching cherry
bombs, stink bombs and smashing win
dows.
After the trouble subsided William
Bouwsma, vice chancellor for academic
affairs, sent a letter to all departments,
warning that employees and teachers
who participate in any violence would
face dismissal.
Earlier in the day law students from
Boalt Law School held a rally on the
Sproul Hall steps protesting the ban on
assemblies and rallies issued earlier in
the month. One spokesman said the
rally was being held as a test to the
constitutionality of the University ban..
Local AFT President Conn Hallinan
said the group will not seek strike sanc
tions from the Alameda County Central
Labor Council unless "our nonviolent
picket lines are broken up or if our
members are fired." If sanctions are ob
tained, 38 other unions could be in
volved.

ARE YOU LISTENING?—Speaking before an unsympathetic group of black students, Education graduate student Mark Schweninger
presented twelve questions to the Black Students Union yesterday at noon on White Plaza.
The questions, which dealt with matters of BSU internal policy and funding, included "What is the policy on admission of non-blacks to
the BSU?," "Are all blacks members of the BSU, whether they want to be or not?," "Does the BSU receive funds from any outside
organizations?," "Does the BSU refer all questions of racist behavior to the Human Relations Commission?," and "Does the BSU believe
that a black administrator would be better than a white one as director of the STEP program?"
Schweninger, who stood alone at the microphone, was heckled and taunted by the black students, as roughly 100 people looked on.
