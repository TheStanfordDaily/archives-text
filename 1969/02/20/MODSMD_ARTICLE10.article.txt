# The 						Far Right
## 
### 
There has been of late a resurgence of
the right at Stanford. A heretofore unheard
group, about as large as SDS was before the
spring sit-in, has stepped foreward, sought
publicity, and demanded consideration.
Students now face two different groups
using somewhat similar tactics.
Looking at the right-wingers, it is almost
as if they had sat down and tried to decide
what Bill Buckley would have done. Turn
the enemy's slogans against him. Cry "pig"
and "oink." Bring protest signs. Use clever
ploys and stay cool.
These right-wingers hope that they have
assessed a shift in the sentiment of the
broad mass of the studeny body. Instead of
an inclination toward supportive acqui
escence in the left's causes, the Young
Americans for Freedom hope they sense
growing outrage with the tactics of the left.
So they harass the left through mimicry.
New Leftists in America claim that they
try to achieve unity of thought and action.
This goal may not be realized, but at at
tempt is made.
What thought is behind the right wing's
action?
Is there an intellectual framework to the
right's defense of Stanford Research Insti
tute and the Applied Electronic Labora
tories? If there is, why don't the right
wingers tell us more about it?
From the right, which will we have as a
prime value to be sustained-law and order,
tradition, opposition to a liberal establish
ment, anti-communism, or untrammeled
liberty?
It appears that no principles are to be
applied rigorously in considering the situ
ation at Stanford or in America. The right
winger has stepped forth to do holy battle

with the enemy. When SDS launches an
attack on the status quo, YAF will defend
the status quo.
YAF has chosen to focus on the left's
tactics and not on the left's arguments.
Students have not heard the arguments of
the right.
Seeing a lot of tactics will be like watch
ing fireworks or seeing a battle from on
high. It's like watching Bill Buckley on
television. You admire his wit. But after
wards you are left feeling it was all style.
No content remains to haunt you.
The leftists at Stanford have raised sub
stantive issues. They state that the Uni
versity has become a proving ground for
the Defense Department and that the Uni
versity is an institutional component of an
oppressive system. Let's have some sub
stantive arguments and issues from the
right. No more of this intellectual smoke
screen of righteous indignation.
Furthermore, a blend of righteous indig
nation and hypocrisy is too much to
stomach. The right strongly condemned the
tactics of disrupting the trustee's meeting,
yet who was yelling and screaming in the
Old Union courtyard during as SDS rally?
If the left can be criticized for decrying
inhumanity while supposedly being unkind
to trustees, members of YAF ought to
practice the fair-play preaching of their
own philosophy.
Those who equate the SDS with Hitler
Youth might do well to remember that
brownshirts came from the right-wing of
the political spectrum.
It is appropriate two days prior to
George Washington's birthday, to note the
freedom so idolized by the YAF was
fought for in a revolution.
