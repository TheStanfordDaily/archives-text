## Population Problem Relates To Poverty 
### Joshua Lederberg 
"POPULATION!" my shrillest
critics cry. "Whv don't you say
more about the world's most criti
cal problem, the population ex
plosion?"
The cold logic of Malthusian
arithmetic is of course inescapa
ble. The sheer mass of humanity
cannot long increase at its present
rate of a doubling every 40 years.
There will be an inexorable halt to
human increase within, at most, a
few generations. We can hardly
doubt that the quality of life and
the odds of peaceful survival are
deteriorating under the impact of
that increase long before we reach

the biological limit.
As everyone knows, western
science and medicine have contri
buted to the problem: directly, by
perfecting our techniques of pre
serving life and of remedying in
fertility, and indirectly, by under
pinning the humanitarian outlook
that cherishes the value of each
individual life.
The technology of contra
ception has of course lagged be
hind the evident humanitarian
need for it. The perfectly safe,
reliable, cheap and unobtrusive
method has still to be developed.
Nevertheless, the obstacles to

population control can hardly be
labeled as technological gaps. Nor
could the ecclesiastical dogmas
persist as long as they have with
out reinforcement from some
even more primitive, irrational
myths. (In any case, the crisis in
Roman Catholic theology must
now reach its own resolution re
gardless of outside comment.)
Heritage
As Prof. Garrett Hardin, in an
article in Science magazine, and
many before him have pointed
out, man's heritage reinforces a
will to multiply against a now ob-

solete set of odds of infant death.
He goes on to compare the planet
to a common pasture, and reviews
the economics of a system where
a common good is left to the
greediest harvesters.
He suggests that voluntary re
straint will be self-eliminating. A
system based on social conscience
will merely raise the general level
of guilty anxiety among the well
intentioned ("Was it morally right
for us to have had those twins?")
without achieving practically use
ful results. He would invoke law
ful coercion to achieve the ends of
the social consensus. In fact, the
main aim of his discourse is to
attack the unlimited "right to
breed" which now stands as a
basic personal freedom.
Merits
One has to question the merits
of such a freedom in a crowded
world. Nevertheless, I believe that
Prof. Hardin has grossly under
estimated the difficulty of actual
ly policing explicit social controls
on reproduction without tramp
ling on every other personal free
dom.
I would not willingly abandon
our cumbersome system of due
process that protects the security
of rry person against arbitrary as
saults by the fallible agents of the
state. We can more readily toler
ate the inevitable minor inequities
in the allotment of positive incen
tives and rewards that can achieve
the same ends.
Poverty
This may seem a feeble answer
to the population problem in poor
countries, but their basic problem
is poverty. Overbreeding is no less
a consequence of their poverty
than a cause of it, and no amount
of gloomy! exhortation or diplo
matic pressure will get very far
unless accompanied by answers to
their desperate problems of eco
nomic development.
Knowing Prof. Hardin's back
ground as a biologist, I expected
him to insist that action be pre
ceded by more detailed
knowledge of the motivational
causes of overbreeding. In
middle-class America, they may
"POPULATION!" my shrillest
critics cry. "Whv don't you say
more about the world's most criti
cal problem, the population ex
plosion?"

science and medicine have contri
buted to the problem: directly, by
perfecting our techniques of pre
serving life and of remedying in
fertility, and indirectly, by under
pinning the humanitarian outlook
that cherishes the value of each
individual life.
The technology of contra
ception has of course lagged be
hind the evident humanitarian
need for it. The perfectly safe,
reliable, cheap and unobtrusive
method has still to be developed.
Nevertheless, the obstacles to

population control can hardly be
labeled as technological gaps. Nor
could the ecclesiastical dogmas
persist as long as they have with
out reinforcement from some
even more primitive, irrational
myths. (In any case, the crisis in
Roman Catholic theology must
now reach its own resolution re
gardless of outside comment.)
Heritage
As Prof. Garrett Hardin, in an
article in Science magazine, and
many before him have pointed
out, man's heritage reinforces a
will to multiply against a now ob-

solete set of odds of infant death.
He goes on to compare the planet
to a common pasture, and reviews
the economics of a system where
a common good is left to the
greediest harvesters.
He suggests that voluntary re
straint will be self-eliminating. A
system based on social conscience
will merely raise the general level
of guilty anxiety among the well
intentioned ("Was it morally right
for us to have had those twins?")
without achieving practically use
ful results. He would invoke law
ful coercion to achieve the ends of
the social consensus. In fact, the
main aim of his discourse is to
attack the unlimited "right to
breed" which now stands as a
basic personal freedom.
Merits
One has to question the merits
of such a freedom in a crowded
world. Nevertheless, I believe that
Prof. Hardin has grossly under
estimated the difficulty of actual
ly policing explicit social controls
on reproduction without tramp
ling on every other personal free
dom.
I would not willingly abandon
our cumbersome system of due
process that protects the security
of rry person against arbitrary as
saults by the fallible agents of the
state. We can more readily toler
ate the inevitable minor inequities
in the allotment of positive incen
tives and rewards that can achieve
the same ends.
Poverty
This may seem a feeble answer
to the population problem in poor
countries, but their basic problem
is poverty. Overbreeding is no less
a consequence of their poverty
than a cause of it, and no amount
of gloomy! exhortation or diplo
matic pressure will get very far
unless accompanied by answers to
their desperate problems of eco
nomic development.
Knowing Prof. Hardin's back
ground as a biologist, I expected
him to insist that action be pre
ceded by more detailed
knowledge of the motivational
causes of overbreeding. In
middle-class America, they may
"POPULATION!" my shrillest
critics cry. "Whv don't you say
more about the world's most criti
cal problem, the population ex
plosion?"
The cold logic of Malthusian
arithmetic is of course inescapa
ble. The sheer mass of humanity
cannot long increase at its present
rate of a doubling every 40 years.
There will be an inexorable halt to
human increase within, at most, a
few generations. We can hardly
doubt that the quality of life and
the odds of peaceful survival are
deteriorating under the impact of
that increase long before we reach

the biological limit.
As everyone knows, western
science and medicine have contri
buted to the problem: directly, by
perfecting our techniques of pre
serving life and of remedying in
fertility, and indirectly, by under
pinning the humanitarian outlook
that cherishes the value of each
individual life.
