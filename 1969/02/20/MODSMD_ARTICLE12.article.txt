# Dear Mom
## Truce Dilemma 
### Cissie Bonini 
Dear Mom,
My wife and I are graduate stu
dents at Stanford and we have
been bored lately. We used to
have a lot of fun arguing, but
we've been married six months
now and have used up all of our
topics like: "Divorce Is Inevita
ble"; "No one else Would Have
Married You with a T.A.'s
Salary"; "I'm Just as Tired As
You Are, and You Can't Have
Forgotten the Recipe for Ham
burgers"; and "It's Your Turn to
take Out the Garbage." Have you
any new ideas?
Bored but Loving

Dear 11. hut L.,
Mumbling always generates a
lot of interest. You begin a sen
tence with a mind-alerting come
-on like, "When she started to cry
in earnest . . ." and then let the
end of the sentence trail off into
incoherence. Some other good
starters are, "I told him I didn't
care how much money he offered
me . . or (stronger) "She may
not be much of a looker,
but . . ."; and (the old stand-by)
"I heard the most fantastic com
pliment about you today ..." I
do feel that one owes it to one's
spouse to keep the marriage inter-

esting and I compliment you on
your loving concern.
Romantically,
Dear Mom, Mom
There used to be a lot of rivalry
between the S.A.E.'s and the Phi
Delt's, but now that we have new
houses next to each other, we
want to be friendly. There is one
problem though: the Phi Delt's
keep saying they "want an S.A.E.
for dinner" and then they laugh a
lot and elbow each other in the
ribs. Now we think it's great to
exchange bros. for meals but they
have a five-foot high iron cooking
pot. Do you think this is
ominous?
A Friendly "E"
Dear Friendly "E",
I have several suggestions: (1)
Get a five-foot iron cooking pot
of your own and then (2) invite
an important officer (preferably
the president) of the Phi Delt's to
your house for dinner the same
night that you sent a (3) thin,
unpopular "E" to be with them.
The basis of the antagonism seems
to lie in an unreasonable jealousy
about cooking utensils. In the
tract where I used to live, this was
very common, and every "Tupper
ware" party ended in pistol shots.
We solved the problem by doing

communal cooking on a spit in
the middle of the cul-de-sac.
I look forward to the
ecumenical day when your group
will be called the Sigma Phi Alpha
Delta Epsilon Thetas!
Yours for loving brotherhood,
Mom
Dear Mom,
My boyfriend has poison oak
on his nose and the right side of
his mouth. He gives me double
kisses from the left side, but it is
not satisfying. What should we
do?
Itchy
Dear Itchy,
I suggest that he stick his nose
in a bowl of Calomine Lotion.
How do you give a double kiss
from the left side of your mouth?
Rashly,
Dear Mom, Mom
Are snakes dangerous?

Dear Tender-Hearted Woman,
Too many people worry about
danger and feel threatened in our
society. By all means, hold the
snake to your bosom. As the Bible
says, "We have nothing to fear but
fear itself."
Snakily,
M om
