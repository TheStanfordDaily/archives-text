# It's No Joke
## Search For Black Minds 
### Dick Gregory 
A new mood has captured the
minds and determined the actions
of black students in colleges
throughout this country. It is a
mood which understands the real
values in life.
For years black students, like
their white counterparts, were at
tending college primarily to learn
how to make a living. Today black
students are in college primarily
to learn how to live. And they are
demanding that the educational
system be geared to that life
orientation.
Black students are recognizing
that colleges in this country are
more concerned with indoctrin
ation than education. The average
educational institution indoctrin
ates it* students rather than pro
viding a healthy climate for free
and open education, which creates
a special problem for black stu
dents since the indoctrination is
from the perspective of white
middle-class values.
The black student is fighting
the deeply ingrained institutional
racism permeating colleges and
universities throughout the land.
If all white folks disappeared from
these United States one evening,
leaving an all-black population,
black students would still have a
problem if structured institutional
racism remained in effect.
If the same college entrance
exams were still used, blacks
would be excluded. Such exams
have nothing to do with "2x2 =
4," but rather with questions test
ing one's assimilation into a white
middle-class value system. How
can a black student be expected
to pass such an exam after he has
been kept in the ghetto all of his
life?
Black students are demanding
the right to develop individual and
group identityâ€”a personal, social
and cultural understanding and
perspective which tells the black
student who he is and from which
he can develop his own value
system.
It is nothing less than black stu
dents truly learning their unique
place in America and in the world.
All of a sudden, a confused and
outraged white America calls this
phenomenon "separatism."
But when white America puts
blacks in their place and system
atically applies the concept of
black separatism, it seems to be
acceptable to the majority. For
example, a black student is visual
ly aware of white America's de
votion to the separatist concept
every time he rides a train. He sees
that black railroad employees are

not supposed to be ticket agents,
or engineers, only porters.
Yet if that same student organ
ized black railroad employees to
demand that all porters will be
black, that blacks will not accept
jobs as ticket agents, engineers or
any other position, he would be
criticized for separatism and
"reverse racism."
Black separatism is only shock
ing to white America when prac
ticed or advocated by blacks.
Three years ago, if I had ad
vocated blacks separating them
selves from the white economy
and setting up their own struc
ture, I would have been called a
racist.
Yet when Richard Nixon
speaks of black capitalism it is ac
ceptable, because he is white. If
white America is really so op
posed to separatism, why is the
Indian still on the reservation?
Separatism for the Indian is de
signed, approved, and enforced by
white America.
White America is unaware that
the civil rights movement began in
the South as a result of the activi
ties of black students. Black stu
dents marched for integration in
public accommodations and
services, as well as in educational
institutions.
What black students are doing
now is the end result of a long
evolutionary process. Marching
for integration has passed. A new
mood of black pride and a new
spirit of independence has
evolved. Black students are now
shouting their just demands with
pride and, as a result, more blacks
and whites are working together
than ever before in the history of
America.
Some members of the academic
community have criticized black
student demands that they should
have a voice in selecting faculty

and determining curriculum. Such
academicians feel that only mem
bers of the intellectual communi
ty are qualified to make such de
cisions. If the intellectuals had
done their job in the past, and
made the right decisions, there
would be no black student pro
test, no SDS, no Third World stu
dent movement today.
It is hard for white America to
understand the evolutionary pro
cess that has taken place in the
black student community. Just as
it is hard for whites to understand
how the social system in this
country made blacks ashamed of
themselves.
Blacks have risen above the
system-imposed shame and are
saying, "Black is beautiful," wear
ing natural hairdos, and taking
pride in their natural black heri
tage. If the new mood affects the
way blacks dress and groom them
selves, white America should not
be surprised that it will also affect
her institutions.
There was a day in America
when the basic problem of the
black man was a hungry stomach.
Now he has a full stomach and a
hungry mind. Black students want
their minds to be black, as well as
their bodies. And it is the search
for a unique black mind which is
unifying the black community as
never before.
When blacks were forcibly
brought to America from their
native land, their skin color was
visibly black; along with other
identifiable features as kinky hair,
thick lips and flat noses. White
America's unique acculturation
process changed all that, pro
ducing many different hues of pig
mentation, straightening out the
hair and otherwise changing physi
cal features. But blacks of all
shades of color are becoming

united in the desire for a black
mind.
The black student demands will
continue and grow. And black stu
dents will be criticized for block
ing the entrances to college build
ings. But college entrance exams
have blocked black student enroll
ment for years. And blocking the
entrances to buildings is part of
the American way of life. Union
members block the entrances to
business buildings when they are
demanding more money.
The black student movement
exemplifies a higher morality than
the demand for money. It is a
revolution in values rather than a
petty demand for benefits.
