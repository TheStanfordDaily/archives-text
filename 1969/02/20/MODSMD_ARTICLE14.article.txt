## Using Business For Order 
### Bill Evers 
Back in 1966, Lyle Spencer, the head of an IBM
subsidiary, heralded the growth of a "social
industrial complex," a partnership of government
and industry dedicated to eradicating social in
justice.
As an example, Spencer pointed out that "a list
of the contractors for the Job Corps looks like a
digest of trading on the New York Stock Ex
change: Litton Industries, Xerox, RCA, Burroughs
Business Machines, G.E., Packard-Bell, Northern
Natural Gas, and others."
There are indications that this existing trend
toward subcontracting of the business of govern
ment will be accelerated during Richard Nixon's
administration. For instance, Nixon chose Roy
Ash, president of Litton Industries (which oper
ates a Job Corps center in California), to present a
study of possible reorganization of the U.S.
government.
As another example, during the presidential
campaign, Nixon used the phrase "black capital
ism," a slogan which summarized his intended
approach in this field of governmental endeavor.
Black capitalism, as described by Nixon, involves
the government backing the funding of business
enterprises for black Americans.
The new Republican administration wants to
expand private industry's role in the effort to
achieve "national goals." Businesses have found
that it is in their interest to cooperate. According
to a Johnson era article in the Wall Street Journal,
"Business in turning into an important force for
pushing embattled domestic proposals through
Congress." An executive of the Department of

Housing and Urban Development is quoted as say
ing, "Each agency has gradually developed a list of
firms interested in its field ... we don't keep them
turned on all the time, but we know how to turn
them on. ..."
Participation in the social-industrial complex, as
in the military-industrial complex, is financially
attractive. Senator Charles Percy, in offering the
advantages of a home ownership scheme proposed
by him, gave what is a generally applicable de
scription of partnership between the national
government and big business.
His housing program, he said, would be attrac
tive to lenders "because it promises a competitive
yield and no risk in addition to its social and
philanthropic appeal."
By having the national government act through
businesses more than it has in the past, the Nixon
administration hopes to better secure the existing
political and social order. The durability of state
monopoly capitalism in America comes from what
Gabriel Kolko calls "a resilience made possible by
political rather than economic power."
American history reflects the extent to which
reform is a vital component of successful social
control. Through programs like "black capitalism"
and the Urban Coalition, the Nixon government
will "harness private enterprise" in welfare re
forms. With Nixon in charge, alliance of govern
ment with industry, an institutional arrangement
characteristic of corporate states, can be expected.

firms interested in its field ... we don't keep them
turned on all the time, but we know how to turn

Participation in the social-industrial complex, as
in the military-industrial complex, is financially
attractive. Senator Charles Percy, in offering the
advantages of a home ownership scheme proposed
by him, gave what is a generally applicable de
scription of partnership between the national
government and big business.
His housing program, he said, would be attrac
tive to lenders "because it promises a competitive
yield and no risk in addition to its social and
philanthropic appeal."
By having the national government act through
businesses more than it has in the past, the Nixon
administration hopes to better secure the existing
political and social order. The durability of state
monopoly capitalism in America comes from what
Gabriel Kolko calls "a resilience made possible by
political rather than economic power."
American history reflects the extent to which
reform is a vital component of successful social
control. Through programs like "black capitalism"
and the Urban Coalition, the Nixon government
will "harness private enterprise" in welfare re
forms. With Nixon in charge, alliance of govern
ment with industry, an institutional arrangement
characteristic of corporate states, can be expected.

Back in 1966, Lyle Spencer, the head of an IBM
subsidiary, heralded the growth of a "social
industrial complex," a partnership of government
and industry dedicated to eradicating social in
justice.
As an example, Spencer pointed out that "a list
of the contractors for the Job Corps looks like a
digest of trading on the New York Stock Ex
change: Litton Industries, Xerox, RCA, Burroughs
Business Machines, G.E., Packard-Bell, Northern
Natural Gas, and others."
There are indications that this existing trend
toward subcontracting of the business of govern
ment will be accelerated during Richard Nixon's
administration. For instance, Nixon chose Roy
Ash, president of Litton Industries (which oper
ates a Job Corps center in California), to present a
study of possible reorganization of the U.S.
government.
As another example, during the presidential
campaign, Nixon used the phrase "black capital
ism," a slogan which summarized his intended
approach in this field of governmental endeavor.
Black capitalism, as described by Nixon, involves
the government backing the funding of business
enterprises for black Americans.
The new Republican administration wants to
expand private industry's role in the effort to
achieve "national goals." Businesses have found
that it is in their interest to cooperate. According
to a Johnson era article in the Wall Street Journal,
"Business in turning into an important force for
pushing embattled domestic proposals through
Congress." An executive of the Department of

Housing and Urban Development is quoted as say
ing, "Each agency has gradually developed a list of
firms interested in its field ... we don't keep them
turned on all the time, but we know how to turn
