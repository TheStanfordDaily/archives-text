# Letters To The Editor
## Election Violations; BSU; SJC; Birth Rate 
### 
Editor, THE DAILY:
Tuesday morning when the
polling places opened a number of
electioneering handbills were
posted on the pillars of the Post
Office, the Bookstore, and
Engineering Corner. These hand
bills were in violation of regu
lations governing elections found
in the ASSU By-Laws. Specifical
ly, no handbills are to be posted
anywhere on campus buildings
and grounds (Section 7 :A2.3c)
and there is to be no electioneer
ing within 100 feet of the polls
(Sec. 7:A3.c). These handbills
were removed and no complaints,
to my knowledge, were made.
Tuesday afternoon more hand
bills of the kind removed in the
morning were found on the pillars
directly adjacent to the polling
place at Engineering Corner. The
regulations cited above were once
again violated.
Thus, I am registering a formal
complaint against David Damassa,
Anthony Lambert, Peter Stair,
Ann Tuttle, Ed Bergo, Carol
Fagan, Terrence Gitzgerald,
Chuck Petty, Martha Bell, Ruth
Ann Crowley, Brigitte Labrentz,
Patrick McConeghy, George
Peters, and Rainer Rumold. En
closed is one of many handbills re
moved from the location men
tioned above.
My real complaint, however, is
not with these candidates. I sus
pect that their error lies in their
failure to read the ASSU By-
Laws rather than flagrant disre
gard of the regulations governing
elections.
My main objection is the gross
irresponsibility demonstrated by
the Elections Commissioner. His
negligence last quarter was a signi
ficant contributing factor to the
disqualification of the first SCLC
election. He also failed to ascer
tain the eligibility of candidates
running for the position of Head
Yell Leader. A detailed descrip
tion of the Commissioner's perfor
mance in the carrying out of his
duties will be provided upon re
quest.
In the current election, he has
failed to properly instruct the stu
dents who are operating the polls
with the consequence that flag
rant violations of the rules govern
ing electioneering have gone un
noticed. It should also be brought
to the attention of the Committee
that the polls at Engineering Cor
ner and at the Post Office were
forced to close during part of the
afternoon because all their ballots
were used. Only after the Com
missioner was contacted in his fra
ternity house were more ballots
provided and the polls reopened.
It is quite obvious that the
ASSU Elections have not been
properly conducted this year and
I suspect that future elections also
will not be unless the present
Elections Commissioner assumes
the responsibility his office de
mands; or he is replaced by some
one more competent.
My intention is not to dis
qualify any candidate nor to de
cry the personality of the Elec
tions Commissioner, but to have
the Committee explore means by
which future ASSU Elections can
be properly conducted.

• Questions For BSU
Editor, THE DAILY:
Mr. Booth's article "Why the
BSU asked Students" which ap
peared in yesterday's Daily starts
with the unsupported assumption
that the BSU has appealed to the
student body of Stanford Uni
versity.
At last Thursday evening's
LASSU meeting Mr. Booth spon
sored a bill endorsing the BSU's
twelve demands. The members of
LASSU, recognizing that they do
not necessarily represent the
opinion of the student body, and
noting the upcoming ASSU elec
tion, proposed that the twelve de
mands be placed individually or
collectively on the ballot.
The BSU was so interested in
appealing to student support that
they wanted Mr. Booth to with
draw the bill rather than have
their demands presented to the
student body.
In reply to a question concern
ing the BSU's response to a stu
dent vote, the BSU representatives
stated that they would not abide
by any vote of the student body.
Perhaps one ought to place the
BSU under as much scrutiny as
the BSU is placing the Stanford
administration. Ask of the nearest
BSU representative: Why are you
afraid to present your demands to
a vote of the Stanford student
body? Why would you "go to war

with this administration?" And,
why do you need pawns like Jack
son Booth to apologize for the
anti-democratic philosophy of
your organization?

•Who Opened The Door?
Editor, THE DAILY:
The Daily's coverage of ti.j
third hearing of the Stanford Judi
cial Council on the alleged dis
ruption of last month's Trustee
meeting failed to indicate the im
portance of some key testimony
presented. The only reference to
testimony regarding the central
issue of how the student demon
strators were able to enter the
Trustee meeting was the state
ment: "After two witnesses testi
fied about the lock system in the
Faculty Club, Weinberg began the
defense." (It should be recalled
that student demonstrators were
able to enter the Trustee meeting
only after a student entered the
meeting room through a court
yard door.)
The witnesses were two Faculty
Club employees—Tom Byrom and
Mrs. Wilma Hollingsworth—who
testified that the doors to the
courtyard could not be opened
from the outside when locked.
In private conversation, Mrs. Hol
lingsworth, supervisor of the Fac
ulty Club and an eyewitness to
the events of the Trustee meeting,
stated that the courtyard doors
were locked and that "the Trustees
let them in."
Student demonstrators have
told me that they had tried to
open the courtyard doors at least
fifteen minutes before a student
gained admittance to the meeting
and found them locked. Both
Byrom and Mrs. Hollingsworth
testified that these doors could
not be forced open from the out
side.
Since student entry to the
Trustee meeting was made possi
ble only through the entrance of a
student through a courtyard door,
these facts are very relevant to the
case pending before the Judicial
Council. Only administrators and
Trustees —and perhaps a few facul
ty members—were in the meeting
room. Since the demonstration
had been going on for some time,
and students had already attempt
ed to enter the meeting room
from the courtyard, why did
someone inside the room open the
courtyard door? Three possible
answers can be given:
1. Despite the facts that the
demonstration was going on out
side and students had already
been forcibly barred from enter
ing the room, an administrator or
Trustee opened the door to leave
or to get some fresh air. Not
closing the door under these cir
cumstances would have been an
act of dubious intelligence, if the
intent of those present at the
meeting was to bar the demon
strators from it.
2. A Trustee or administrator
opened the door to allow the
demonstrators to attend the meet
ing.
3. A Trustee or administrator
opened the door in hopes that the
demonstrators would enter the
room and thus be punished for
disrupting the meeting.
All of these explanations may
seem implausible, but the facts of
the situation —the doors were
locked and could be opened from
within only—makes no other ex
planation of the unlocking of the
courtyard door tenable. The dis
covery of the correct explanation
is directly relevant to the decision
of the Judicial Council.
If the demonstrators were in
vited in, it is unclear what rules
were broken. If they were allowed
to enter for purposes of entrap
ment, serious questions regarding
the ethics of punishing students
under such conditions arise. If the
door was opened because of the
ineptitude of one of the occu
pants of the room, he may have
created the impression that the
Trustees had decided to discuss
SDS's grievances with them and
may have contributed to a tragic
misunderstanding by both the
Trustees and the students of what
student entrance to the room
represented.
It is unfortunate that the Judi
cial Council has not attempted to
pursue such relevant questions. If
a just decision is to be arrived at,
the Judicial Council should do a
more careful job of establishing
the facts of the case.

• Apology To Scott
Editor, THE DAILY:
I apologize to Johnie Scott and
Ram's Head for unwittingly re
peating in my column the old dis
credited story that Mr. Scott's
Gaieties script was rejected be
cause Ram's Head didn't like it.
After the Gaieties controversy
was broached by Mr. Scott in a
column in The Daily on October
16, 1968, Ram's Head explained
that it did not have the resources
to produce Mr. Scott's play in the
short time available. Apparently
the Ram's Head explanations were
acceptable to Mr. Scott, as evi
denced by his letter in yesterday's
Daily.
Mr. Scott also asserted in his
letter that I maliciously misrepre
sented his remarks at the BSU
rally of February 4. I invite Mr.
Scott to make the tape recording
of the rally available to The Daily,
so its readers can judge for them
selves.

• Population Problem
Editor, THE DAILY:
I would like to make a cor
rection to the otherwise good re
port in The Daily of the recent
Population and Environment
Forum on "Population vs Planet
Earth."
In that report I read with

astonishment that I had "dis
agreed that population was a
problem." As I said at the meet
ing, reduction in the rate of world
population growth is an absolute
essential for our age. Before
coming to Stanford I spent 13
years as Demographic Director of
the Population Council, a major
foundation whose specific pur
pose is to advance solutions of the
world population problem
through research, development of
better methods of birth control,
and assistance to governments in
national family planning pro
grams. At the meeting I referred
to important successes in such
programs and the urgent need for
more of them. I expressed
reasoned optimism for the future
based on close acquaintance with
those programs and with other
social and economic changes in
the less developed world. Ap
parently if one does not speak of
"starving millions" or forecast

"imminent famine" it is inter
preted that one sees no problem.
I did say that the population
problem of the United States is
quite different from that in the
less developed world. Our present
and prospective birth rates are
very much lower than in these
areas and our national rate of
population growth is only one per
cent per year. Whatever the merits
of reducing our national rate of
population growth, it is unrealistic
to think of that as a primary solu
tion of our major enironmental
problems, either for now or in the
foreseeable future up to the year
2000. These problems are due to
(1) the massive movements of our
population to and within our
sprawling metropolitan areas and
(2) our affluence and the misuse
of the great technology at our
command.

years as Demographic Director of
the Population Council, a major
foundation whose specific pur
pose is to advance solutions of the
world population problem
through research, development of
better methods of birth control,
and assistance to governments in
national family planning pro

to important successes in such
programs and the urgent need for
more of them. I expressed
reasoned optimism for the future
based on close acquaintance with
those programs and with other
social and economic changes in
the less developed world. Ap

I did say that the population
problem of the United States is
quite different from that in the
less developed world. Our present
and prospective birth rates are
very much lower than in these
areas and our national rate of
population growth is only one per
cent per year. Whatever the merits
of reducing our national rate of
population growth, it is unrealistic
to think of that as a primary solu
tion of our major enironmental
problems, either for now or in the
foreseeable future up to the year
2000. These problems are due to
(1) the massive movements of our
population to and within our
sprawling metropolitan areas and
(2) our affluence and the misuse
of the great technology at our
command.

Editor, THE DAILY:
Tuesday morning when the
polling places opened a number of
electioneering handbills were
posted on the pillars of the Post
Office, the Bookstore, and
Engineering Corner. These hand
bills were in violation of regu
lations governing elections found
in the ASSU By-Laws. Specifical
ly, no handbills are to be posted
anywhere on campus buildings
and grounds (Section 7 :A2.3c)
and there is to be no electioneer
ing within 100 feet of the polls
(Sec. 7:A3.c). These handbills
were removed and no complaints,
to my knowledge, were made.
Tuesday afternoon more hand
bills of the kind removed in the
morning were found on the pillars
directly adjacent to the polling
place at Engineering Corner. The
regulations cited above were once
again violated.
Thus, I am registering a formal
complaint against David Damassa,
Anthony Lambert, Peter Stair,
Ann Tuttle, Ed Bergo, Carol
Fagan, Terrence Gitzgerald,
Chuck Petty, Martha Bell, Ruth
Ann Crowley, Brigitte Labrentz,
Patrick McConeghy, George
Peters, and Rainer Rumold. En
closed is one of many handbills re
moved from the location men
tioned above.
My real complaint, however, is
not with these candidates. I sus
pect that their error lies in their
failure to read the ASSU By-
Laws rather than flagrant disre
gard of the regulations governing
elections.
My main objection is the gross
irresponsibility demonstrated by
the Elections Commissioner. His
negligence last quarter was a signi
ficant contributing factor to the
disqualification of the first SCLC
election. He also failed to ascer
tain the eligibility of candidates
running for the position of Head
Yell Leader. A detailed descrip
tion of the Commissioner's perfor
mance in the carrying out of his
duties will be provided upon re
quest.
In the current election, he has
failed to properly instruct the stu
dents who are operating the polls
with the consequence that flag
rant violations of the rules govern
ing electioneering have gone un
noticed. It should also be brought
to the attention of the Committee
that the polls at Engineering Cor
ner and at the Post Office were
forced to close during part of the
afternoon because all their ballots
were used. Only after the Com
missioner was contacted in his fra
ternity house were more ballots
provided and the polls reopened.
It is quite obvious that the
ASSU Elections have not been
properly conducted this year and
I suspect that future elections also
will not be unless the present
Elections Commissioner assumes
the responsibility his office de
mands; or he is replaced by some
one more competent.
My intention is not to dis
qualify any candidate nor to de
cry the personality of the Elec
tions Commissioner, but to have
the Committee explore means by
which future ASSU Elections can
be properly conducted.

• Questions For BSU
Editor, THE DAILY:
Mr. Booth's article "Why the
BSU asked Students" which ap
peared in yesterday's Daily starts
with the unsupported assumption
that the BSU has appealed to the
student body of Stanford Uni
versity.
At last Thursday evening's
LASSU meeting Mr. Booth spon
sored a bill endorsing the BSU's
twelve demands. The members of
LASSU, recognizing that they do
not necessarily represent the
opinion of the student body, and
noting the upcoming ASSU elec
tion, proposed that the twelve de
mands be placed individually or
collectively on the ballot.
The BSU was so interested in
appealing to student support that
they wanted Mr. Booth to with
draw the bill rather than have
their demands presented to the
student body.
In reply to a question concern
ing the BSU's response to a stu
dent vote, the BSU representatives
stated that they would not abide
by any vote of the student body.
Perhaps one ought to place the
BSU under as much scrutiny as
the BSU is placing the Stanford
administration. Ask of the nearest
BSU representative: Why are you
afraid to present your demands to
a vote of the Stanford student
body? Why would you "go to war

with this administration?" And,
why do you need pawns like Jack
son Booth to apologize for the
anti-democratic philosophy of
your organization?

•Who Opened The Door?
Editor, THE DAILY:
The Daily's coverage of ti.j
third hearing of the Stanford Judi
cial Council on the alleged dis
ruption of last month's Trustee
meeting failed to indicate the im
portance of some key testimony
presented. The only reference to
testimony regarding the central
issue of how the student demon
strators were able to enter the
Trustee meeting was the state
ment: "After two witnesses testi
fied about the lock system in the
Faculty Club, Weinberg began the
defense." (It should be recalled
that student demonstrators were
able to enter the Trustee meeting
only after a student entered the
meeting room through a court
yard door.)
The witnesses were two Faculty
Club employees—Tom Byrom and
Mrs. Wilma Hollingsworth—who
testified that the doors to the
courtyard could not be opened
from the outside when locked.
In private conversation, Mrs. Hol
lingsworth, supervisor of the Fac
ulty Club and an eyewitness to
the events of the Trustee meeting,
stated that the courtyard doors
were locked and that "the Trustees
let them in."
Student demonstrators have
told me that they had tried to
open the courtyard doors at least
fifteen minutes before a student
gained admittance to the meeting
and found them locked. Both
Byrom and Mrs. Hollingsworth
testified that these doors could
not be forced open from the out
side.
Since student entry to the
Trustee meeting was made possi
ble only through the entrance of a
student through a courtyard door,
these facts are very relevant to the
case pending before the Judicial
Council. Only administrators and
Trustees —and perhaps a few facul
ty members—were in the meeting
room. Since the demonstration
had been going on for some time,
and students had already attempt
ed to enter the meeting room
from the courtyard, why did
someone inside the room open the
courtyard door? Three possible
answers can be given:
1. Despite the facts that the
demonstration was going on out
side and students had already
been forcibly barred from enter
ing the room, an administrator or
Trustee opened the door to leave
or to get some fresh air. Not
closing the door under these cir
cumstances would have been an
act of dubious intelligence, if the
intent of those present at the
meeting was to bar the demon
strators from it.
2. A Trustee or administrator
opened the door to allow the
demonstrators to attend the meet
ing.
3. A Trustee or administrator
opened the door in hopes that the
demonstrators would enter the
room and thus be punished for
disrupting the meeting.
All of these explanations may
seem implausible, but the facts of
the situation —the doors were
locked and could be opened from
within only—makes no other ex
planation of the unlocking of the
courtyard door tenable. The dis
covery of the correct explanation
is directly relevant to the decision
of the Judicial Council.
If the demonstrators were in
vited in, it is unclear what rules
were broken. If they were allowed
to enter for purposes of entrap
ment, serious questions regarding
the ethics of punishing students
under such conditions arise. If the
door was opened because of the
ineptitude of one of the occu
pants of the room, he may have
created the impression that the
Trustees had decided to discuss
SDS's grievances with them and
may have contributed to a tragic
misunderstanding by both the
Trustees and the students of what
student entrance to the room
represented.
It is unfortunate that the Judi
cial Council has not attempted to
pursue such relevant questions. If
a just decision is to be arrived at,
the Judicial Council should do a
more careful job of establishing
the facts of the case.

• Apology To Scott
Editor, THE DAILY:
I apologize to Johnie Scott and
Ram's Head for unwittingly re
peating in my column the old dis
credited story that Mr. Scott's
Gaieties script was rejected be
cause Ram's Head didn't like it.
After the Gaieties controversy
was broached by Mr. Scott in a
column in The Daily on October
16, 1968, Ram's Head explained
that it did not have the resources
to produce Mr. Scott's play in the
short time available. Apparently
the Ram's Head explanations were
acceptable to Mr. Scott, as evi
denced by his letter in yesterday's
Daily.
Mr. Scott also asserted in his
letter that I maliciously misrepre
sented his remarks at the BSU
rally of February 4. I invite Mr.
Scott to make the tape recording
of the rally available to The Daily,
so its readers can judge for them
selves.

• Population Problem
Editor, THE DAILY:
I would like to make a cor

Ram's Head for unwittingly re
peating in my column the old dis
credited story that Mr. Scott's
Gaieties script was rejected be
cause Ram's Head didn't like it.
After the Gaieties controversy
was broached by Mr. Scott in a
column in The Daily on October
16, 1968, Ram's Head explained
that it did not have the resources
to produce Mr. Scott's play in the
short time available. Apparently
the Ram's Head explanations were
acceptable to Mr. Scott, as evi
denced by his letter in yesterday's
Daily.
Mr. Scott also asserted in his
letter that I maliciously misrepre
sented his remarks at the BSU
rally of February 4. I invite Mr.
Scott to make the tape recording
of the rally available to The Daily,
so its readers can judge for them
selves.

• Population Problem
Editor, THE DAILY:
I would like to make a cor
rection to the otherwise good re
port in The Daily of the recent
Population and Environment
Forum on "Population vs Planet
Earth."
In that report I read with

astonishment that I had "dis
agreed that population was a
problem." As I said at the meet
ing, reduction in the rate of world
population growth is an absolute
essential for our age. Before
coming to Stanford I spent 13
years as Demographic Director of
the Population Council, a major
foundation whose specific pur
pose is to advance solutions of the
world population problem
through research, development of
better methods of birth control,
and assistance to governments in
national family planning pro
grams. At the meeting I referred
to important successes in such
programs and the urgent need for
more of them. I expressed
reasoned optimism for the future
based on close acquaintance with
those programs and with other
social and economic changes in
the less developed world. Ap
parently if one does not speak of
"starving millions" or forecast

"imminent famine" it is inter
preted that one sees no problem.
I did say that the population
problem of the United States is
quite different from that in the
less developed world. Our present
and prospective birth rates are
very much lower than in these
areas and our national rate of
population growth is only one per
cent per year. Whatever the merits
of reducing our national rate of
population growth, it is unrealistic
to think of that as a primary solu
tion of our major enironmental
problems, either for now or in the
foreseeable future up to the year
2000. These problems are due to
(1) the massive movements of our
population to and within our
sprawling metropolitan areas and
(2) our affluence and the misuse
of the great technology at our
command.

Editor, THE DAILY:
Tuesday morning when the
polling places opened a number of
electioneering handbills were
posted on the pillars of the Post
Office, the Bookstore, and
Engineering Corner. These hand
bills were in violation of regu
lations governing elections found
in the ASSU By-Laws. Specifical
ly, no handbills are to be posted
anywhere on campus buildings
and grounds (Section 7 :A2.3c)
and there is to be no electioneer
ing within 100 feet of the polls
(Sec. 7:A3.c). These handbills
were removed and no complaints,
to my knowledge, were made.
Tuesday afternoon more hand
bills of the kind removed in the
morning were found on the pillars
directly adjacent to the polling
place at Engineering Corner. The
regulations cited above were once
again violated.
Thus, I am registering a formal
complaint against David Damassa,
Anthony Lambert, Peter Stair,
Ann Tuttle, Ed Bergo, Carol
Fagan, Terrence Gitzgerald,
Chuck Petty, Martha Bell, Ruth
Ann Crowley, Brigitte Labrentz,
Patrick McConeghy, George
Peters, and Rainer Rumold. En
closed is one of many handbills re
moved from the location men
tioned above.
My real complaint, however, is
not with these candidates. I sus
pect that their error lies in their
failure to read the ASSU By-
Laws rather than flagrant disre
gard of the regulations governing
elections.
My main objection is the gross
irresponsibility demonstrated by
the Elections Commissioner. His
negligence last quarter was a signi
ficant contributing factor to the
disqualification of the first SCLC
election. He also failed to ascer
tain the eligibility of candidates
running for the position of Head
Yell Leader. A detailed descrip
tion of the Commissioner's perfor
mance in the carrying out of his
duties will be provided upon re
quest.
In the current election, he has
failed to properly instruct the stu
dents who are operating the polls
with the consequence that flag
rant violations of the rules govern
ing electioneering have gone un
noticed. It should also be brought
to the attention of the Committee
that the polls at Engineering Cor
ner and at the Post Office were
forced to close during part of the
afternoon because all their ballots
were used. Only after the Com
missioner was contacted in his fra
ternity house were more ballots
provided and the polls reopened.
It is quite obvious that the
ASSU Elections have not been
properly conducted this year and
I suspect that future elections also
will not be unless the present
Elections Commissioner assumes
the responsibility his office de
mands; or he is replaced by some
one more competent.
My intention is not to dis
qualify any candidate nor to de
cry the personality of the Elec
tions Commissioner, but to have
the Committee explore means by
which future ASSU Elections can
be properly conducted.

• Questions For BSU
Editor, THE DAILY:
Mr. Booth's article "Why the
BSU asked Students" which ap
peared in yesterday's Daily starts
with the unsupported assumption
that the BSU has appealed to the
student body of Stanford Uni
versity.
At last Thursday evening's
LASSU meeting Mr. Booth spon
sored a bill endorsing the BSU's
twelve demands. The members of
LASSU, recognizing that they do
not necessarily represent the
opinion of the student body, and
noting the upcoming ASSU elec
tion, proposed that the twelve de
mands be placed individually or
collectively on the ballot.
The BSU was so interested in
appealing to student support that
they wanted Mr. Booth to with
draw the bill rather than have
their demands presented to the
student body.
In reply to a question concern
ing the BSU's response to a stu
dent vote, the BSU representatives
stated that they would not abide
by any vote of the student body.
Perhaps one ought to place the
BSU under as much scrutiny as
the BSU is placing the Stanford
administration. Ask of the nearest
BSU representative: Why are you
afraid to present your demands to
a vote of the Stanford student
body? Why would you "go to war

with this administration?" And,
why do you need pawns like Jack
son Booth to apologize for the
anti-democratic philosophy of
your organization?

•Who Opened The Door?
Editor, THE DAILY:
The Daily's coverage of ti.j
third hearing of the Stanford Judi
cial Council on the alleged dis
ruption of last month's Trustee
meeting failed to indicate the im
portance of some key testimony
presented. The only reference to
testimony regarding the central
issue of how the student demon
strators were able to enter the
Trustee meeting was the state
ment: "After two witnesses testi
fied about the lock system in the
Faculty Club, Weinberg began the
defense." (It should be recalled
that student demonstrators were
able to enter the Trustee meeting
only after a student entered the
meeting room through a court
yard door.)
The witnesses were two Faculty
Club employees—Tom Byrom and
Mrs. Wilma Hollingsworth—who
testified that the doors to the
courtyard could not be opened
from the outside when locked.
In private conversation, Mrs. Hol
lingsworth, supervisor of the Fac
ulty Club and an eyewitness to
the events of the Trustee meeting,
stated that the courtyard doors
were locked and that "the Trustees
let them in."
Student demonstrators have
told me that they had tried to
open the courtyard doors at least
fifteen minutes before a student
gained admittance to the meeting
and found them locked. Both
Byrom and Mrs. Hollingsworth
testified that these doors could
not be forced open from the out
side.
Since student entry to the
Trustee meeting was made possi
ble only through the entrance of a
student through a courtyard door,
these facts are very relevant to the
case pending before the Judicial
Council. Only administrators and
Trustees —and perhaps a few facul
ty members—were in the meeting
room. Since the demonstration
had been going on for some time,
and students had already attempt
ed to enter the meeting room
from the courtyard, why did
someone inside the room open the
courtyard door? Three possible
answers can be given:
1. Despite the facts that the
demonstration was going on out
side and students had already
been forcibly barred from enter
ing the room, an administrator or
Trustee opened the door to leave
or to get some fresh air. Not
closing the door under these cir
cumstances would have been an
act of dubious intelligence, if the
intent of those present at the
meeting was to bar the demon
strators from it.
2. A Trustee or administrator
opened the door to allow the
demonstrators to attend the meet
ing.
3. A Trustee or administrator
opened the door in hopes that the
demonstrators would enter the
room and thus be punished for
disrupting the meeting.
All of these explanations may
seem implausible, but the facts of
the situation —the doors were
locked and could be opened from
within only—makes no other ex
planation of the unlocking of the
courtyard door tenable. The dis
covery of the correct explanation
is directly relevant to the decision
of the Judicial Council.
If the demonstrators were in
vited in, it is unclear what rules
were broken. If they were allowed
to enter for purposes of entrap
ment, serious questions regarding
the ethics of punishing students
under such conditions arise. If the
door was opened because of the
ineptitude of one of the occu
pants of the room, he may have
created the impression that the
Trustees had decided to discuss
SDS's grievances with them and
may have contributed to a tragic
misunderstanding by both the
Trustees and the students of what
student entrance to the room
represented.
It is unfortunate that the Judi
cial Council has not attempted to
pursue such relevant questions. If
a just decision is to be arrived at,
the Judicial Council should do a
more careful job of establishing
the facts of the case.

3. A Trustee or administrator
opened the door in hopes that the
demonstrators would enter the
room and thus be punished for
disrupting the meeting.
All of these explanations may
seem implausible, but the facts of
the situation —the doors were
locked and could be opened from
within only—makes no other ex
planation of the unlocking of the
courtyard door tenable. The dis
covery of the correct explanation
is directly relevant to the decision
of the Judicial Council.
If the demonstrators were in
vited in, it is unclear what rules
were broken. If they were allowed
to enter for purposes of entrap
ment, serious questions regarding
the ethics of punishing students
under such conditions arise. If the
door was opened because of the
ineptitude of one of the occu
pants of the room, he may have
created the impression that the
Trustees had decided to discuss
SDS's grievances with them and
may have contributed to a tragic
misunderstanding by both the
Trustees and the students of what
student entrance to the room
represented.
It is unfortunate that the Judi
cial Council has not attempted to
pursue such relevant questions. If
a just decision is to be arrived at,
the Judicial Council should do a
more careful job of establishing
the facts of the case.

• Apology To Scott
Editor, THE DAILY:
I apologize to Johnie Scott and
Ram's Head for unwittingly re
peating in my column the old dis
credited story that Mr. Scott's
Gaieties script was rejected be
cause Ram's Head didn't like it.
After the Gaieties controversy
was broached by Mr. Scott in a
column in The Daily on October
16, 1968, Ram's Head explained
that it did not have the resources
to produce Mr. Scott's play in the
short time available. Apparently
the Ram's Head explanations were
acceptable to Mr. Scott, as evi
denced by his letter in yesterday's
Daily.
Mr. Scott also asserted in his
letter that I maliciously misrepre
sented his remarks at the BSU
rally of February 4. I invite Mr.
Scott to make the tape recording
of the rally available to The Daily,
so its readers can judge for them
selves.

• Population Problem
Editor, THE DAILY:
I would like to make a cor
rection to the otherwise good re
port in The Daily of the recent
Population and Environment
Forum on "Population vs Planet
Earth."
In that report I read with

astonishment that I had "dis
agreed that population was a
problem." As I said at the meet
ing, reduction in the rate of world
population growth is an absolute
essential for our age. Before
coming to Stanford I spent 13
years as Demographic Director of
the Population Council, a major
foundation whose specific pur
pose is to advance solutions of the
world population problem
through research, development of
better methods of birth control,
and assistance to governments in
national family planning pro
grams. At the meeting I referred
to important successes in such
programs and the urgent need for
more of them. I expressed
reasoned optimism for the future
based on close acquaintance with
those programs and with other
social and economic changes in
the less developed world. Ap
parently if one does not speak of
"starving millions" or forecast

"imminent famine" it is inter
preted that one sees no problem.
I did say that the population
problem of the United States is
quite different from that in the
less developed world. Our present
and prospective birth rates are
very much lower than in these
areas and our national rate of
population growth is only one per
cent per year. Whatever the merits
of reducing our national rate of
population growth, it is unrealistic
to think of that as a primary solu
tion of our major enironmental
problems, either for now or in the
foreseeable future up to the year
2000. These problems are due to
(1) the massive movements of our
population to and within our
sprawling metropolitan areas and
(2) our affluence and the misuse
of the great technology at our
command.

Editor, THE DAILY:
Tuesday morning when the
polling places opened a number of
electioneering handbills were
posted on the pillars of the Post
Office, the Bookstore, and
Engineering Corner. These hand
bills were in violation of regu
lations governing elections found
in the ASSU By-Laws. Specifical
ly, no handbills are to be posted
anywhere on campus buildings
and grounds (Section 7 :A2.3c)
and there is to be no electioneer
ing within 100 feet of the polls
(Sec. 7:A3.c). These handbills
were removed and no complaints,
to my knowledge, were made.
Tuesday afternoon more hand
bills of the kind removed in the
morning were found on the pillars
directly adjacent to the polling
place at Engineering Corner. The
regulations cited above were once
again violated.
Thus, I am registering a formal
complaint against David Damassa,
Anthony Lambert, Peter Stair,
Ann Tuttle, Ed Bergo, Carol
Fagan, Terrence Gitzgerald,
Chuck Petty, Martha Bell, Ruth
Ann Crowley, Brigitte Labrentz,
Patrick McConeghy, George
Peters, and Rainer Rumold. En
closed is one of many handbills re
moved from the location men
tioned above.
My real complaint, however, is
not with these candidates. I sus
pect that their error lies in their
failure to read the ASSU By-
Laws rather than flagrant disre
gard of the regulations governing
elections.
My main objection is the gross
irresponsibility demonstrated by
the Elections Commissioner. His
negligence last quarter was a signi
ficant contributing factor to the
disqualification of the first SCLC
election. He also failed to ascer
tain the eligibility of candidates
running for the position of Head
Yell Leader. A detailed descrip
tion of the Commissioner's perfor
mance in the carrying out of his
duties will be provided upon re
quest.
In the current election, he has
failed to properly instruct the stu
dents who are operating the polls
with the consequence that flag
rant violations of the rules govern
ing electioneering have gone un
noticed. It should also be brought
to the attention of the Committee
that the polls at Engineering Cor
ner and at the Post Office were
forced to close during part of the
afternoon because all their ballots
were used. Only after the Com
missioner was contacted in his fra
ternity house were more ballots
provided and the polls reopened.
It is quite obvious that the
ASSU Elections have not been
properly conducted this year and
I suspect that future elections also
will not be unless the present
Elections Commissioner assumes
the responsibility his office de
mands; or he is replaced by some
one more competent.
My intention is not to dis
qualify any candidate nor to de
cry the personality of the Elec
tions Commissioner, but to have
the Committee explore means by
which future ASSU Elections can
be properly conducted.

• Questions For BSU
Editor, THE DAILY:
Mr. Booth's article "Why the
BSU asked Students" which ap
peared in yesterday's Daily starts
with the unsupported assumption
that the BSU has appealed to the
student body of Stanford Uni
versity.
At last Thursday evening's
LASSU meeting Mr. Booth spon
sored a bill endorsing the BSU's
twelve demands. The members of
LASSU, recognizing that they do
not necessarily represent the
opinion of the student body, and
noting the upcoming ASSU elec
tion, proposed that the twelve de
mands be placed individually or
collectively on the ballot.
The BSU was so interested in
appealing to student support that
they wanted Mr. Booth to with
draw the bill rather than have
their demands presented to the
student body.
In reply to a question concern
ing the BSU's response to a stu
dent vote, the BSU representatives
stated that they would not abide
by any vote of the student body.
Perhaps one ought to place the
BSU under as much scrutiny as
the BSU is placing the Stanford
administration. Ask of the nearest
BSU representative: Why are you
afraid to present your demands to
a vote of the Stanford student
body? Why would you "go to war

with this administration?" And,
why do you need pawns like Jack
son Booth to apologize for the
anti-democratic philosophy of
your organization?

•Who Opened The Door?
Editor, THE DAILY:
The Daily's coverage of ti.j
third hearing of the Stanford Judi
cial Council on the alleged dis
ruption of last month's Trustee
meeting failed to indicate the im
portance of some key testimony
presented. The only reference to
testimony regarding the central
issue of how the student demon
strators were able to enter the
Trustee meeting was the state
ment: "After two witnesses testi
fied about the lock system in the
Faculty Club, Weinberg began the
defense." (It should be recalled
that student demonstrators were
able to enter the Trustee meeting
only after a student entered the
meeting room through a court
yard door.)
The witnesses were two Faculty
Club employees—Tom Byrom and
Mrs. Wilma Hollingsworth—who
testified that the doors to the
courtyard could not be opened
from the outside when locked.
In private conversation, Mrs. Hol
lingsworth, supervisor of the Fac
ulty Club and an eyewitness to
the events of the Trustee meeting,
stated that the courtyard doors
were locked and that "the Trustees
let them in."
Student demonstrators have
told me that they had tried to
open the courtyard doors at least
fifteen minutes before a student
gained admittance to the meeting
and found them locked. Both
Byrom and Mrs. Hollingsworth
testified that these doors could
not be forced open from the out
side.
Since student entry to the
Trustee meeting was made possi
ble only through the entrance of a
student through a courtyard door,
these facts are very relevant to the
case pending before the Judicial
Council. Only administrators and
Trustees —and perhaps a few facul
ty members—were in the meeting
room. Since the demonstration
had been going on for some time,
and students had already attempt
ed to enter the meeting room
from the courtyard, why did
someone inside the room open the
courtyard door? Three possible
answers can be given:
1. Despite the facts that the
demonstration was going on out
side and students had already
been forcibly barred from enter
ing the room, an administrator or
Trustee opened the door to leave
or to get some fresh air. Not
closing the door under these cir
cumstances would have been an
act of dubious intelligence, if the
intent of those present at the
meeting was to bar the demon
strators from it.
2. A Trustee or administrator
opened the door to allow the
demonstrators to attend the meet
ing.
3. A Trustee or administrator
opened the door in hopes that the
demonstrators would enter the
room and thus be punished for
disrupting the meeting.
All of these explanations may
seem implausible, but the facts of
the situation —the doors were
locked and could be opened from

were locked and that "the Trustees
let them in."
Student demonstrators have
told me that they had tried to
open the courtyard doors at least
fifteen minutes before a student
gained admittance to the meeting
and found them locked. Both
Byrom and Mrs. Hollingsworth
testified that these doors could
not be forced open from the out
side.
Since student entry to the
Trustee meeting was made possi
ble only through the entrance of a
student through a courtyard door,
these facts are very relevant to the
case pending before the Judicial
Council. Only administrators and
Trustees —and perhaps a few facul
ty members—were in the meeting
room. Since the demonstration
had been going on for some time,
and students had already attempt
ed to enter the meeting room
from the courtyard, why did
someone inside the room open the
courtyard door? Three possible
answers can be given:
1. Despite the facts that the
demonstration was going on out
side and students had already
been forcibly barred from enter
ing the room, an administrator or
Trustee opened the door to leave
or to get some fresh air. Not
closing the door under these cir
cumstances would have been an
act of dubious intelligence, if the
intent of those present at the
meeting was to bar the demon
strators from it.
2. A Trustee or administrator
opened the door to allow the
demonstrators to attend the meet
ing.
3. A Trustee or administrator
opened the door in hopes that the
demonstrators would enter the
room and thus be punished for
disrupting the meeting.
All of these explanations may
seem implausible, but the facts of
the situation —the doors were
locked and could be opened from
within only—makes no other ex
planation of the unlocking of the
courtyard door tenable. The dis
covery of the correct explanation
is directly relevant to the decision
of the Judicial Council.
If the demonstrators were in
vited in, it is unclear what rules
were broken. If they were allowed
to enter for purposes of entrap
ment, serious questions regarding
the ethics of punishing students
under such conditions arise. If the
door was opened because of the
ineptitude of one of the occu
pants of the room, he may have
created the impression that the
Trustees had decided to discuss
SDS's grievances with them and
may have contributed to a tragic
misunderstanding by both the
Trustees and the students of what
student entrance to the room
represented.
It is unfortunate that the Judi
cial Council has not attempted to
pursue such relevant questions. If
a just decision is to be arrived at,
the Judicial Council should do a
more careful job of establishing
the facts of the case.

• Apology To Scott
Editor, THE DAILY:
I apologize to Johnie Scott and
Ram's Head for unwittingly re
peating in my column the old dis
credited story that Mr. Scott's
Gaieties script was rejected be
cause Ram's Head didn't like it.
After the Gaieties controversy
was broached by Mr. Scott in a
column in The Daily on October
16, 1968, Ram's Head explained
that it did not have the resources
to produce Mr. Scott's play in the
short time available. Apparently
the Ram's Head explanations were
acceptable to Mr. Scott, as evi
denced by his letter in yesterday's
Daily.
Mr. Scott also asserted in his
letter that I maliciously misrepre
sented his remarks at the BSU
rally of February 4. I invite Mr.
Scott to make the tape recording
of the rally available to The Daily,
so its readers can judge for them
selves.

• Population Problem
Editor, THE DAILY:
I would like to make a cor
rection to the otherwise good re
port in The Daily of the recent
Population and Environment
Forum on "Population vs Planet
Earth."
In that report I read with

astonishment that I had "dis
agreed that population was a
problem." As I said at the meet
ing, reduction in the rate of world
population growth is an absolute
essential for our age. Before
coming to Stanford I spent 13
years as Demographic Director of
the Population Council, a major
foundation whose specific pur
pose is to advance solutions of the
world population problem
through research, development of
better methods of birth control,
and assistance to governments in
national family planning pro
grams. At the meeting I referred
to important successes in such
programs and the urgent need for
more of them. I expressed
reasoned optimism for the future
based on close acquaintance with
those programs and with other
social and economic changes in
the less developed world. Ap
parently if one does not speak of
"starving millions" or forecast

"imminent famine" it is inter
preted that one sees no problem.
I did say that the population
problem of the United States is
quite different from that in the
less developed world. Our present
and prospective birth rates are
very much lower than in these
areas and our national rate of
population growth is only one per
cent per year. Whatever the merits
of reducing our national rate of
population growth, it is unrealistic
to think of that as a primary solu
tion of our major enironmental
problems, either for now or in the
foreseeable future up to the year
2000. These problems are due to
(1) the massive movements of our
population to and within our
sprawling metropolitan areas and
(2) our affluence and the misuse
of the great technology at our
command.

Editor, THE DAILY:
Tuesday morning when the
polling places opened a number of
electioneering handbills were
posted on the pillars of the Post
Office, the Bookstore, and
Engineering Corner. These hand
bills were in violation of regu
lations governing elections found
in the ASSU By-Laws. Specifical
ly, no handbills are to be posted
anywhere on campus buildings
and grounds (Section 7 :A2.3c)
and there is to be no electioneer
ing within 100 feet of the polls
(Sec. 7:A3.c). These handbills
were removed and no complaints,
to my knowledge, were made.
Tuesday afternoon more hand
bills of the kind removed in the
morning were found on the pillars
directly adjacent to the polling
place at Engineering Corner. The
regulations cited above were once
again violated.
Thus, I am registering a formal
complaint against David Damassa,
Anthony Lambert, Peter Stair,
Ann Tuttle, Ed Bergo, Carol
Fagan, Terrence Gitzgerald,
Chuck Petty, Martha Bell, Ruth
Ann Crowley, Brigitte Labrentz,
Patrick McConeghy, George
Peters, and Rainer Rumold. En
closed is one of many handbills re
moved from the location men
tioned above.
My real complaint, however, is
not with these candidates. I sus
pect that their error lies in their
failure to read the ASSU By-
Laws rather than flagrant disre
gard of the regulations governing
elections.
My main objection is the gross
irresponsibility demonstrated by
the Elections Commissioner. His
negligence last quarter was a signi
ficant contributing factor to the
disqualification of the first SCLC
election. He also failed to ascer
tain the eligibility of candidates
running for the position of Head
Yell Leader. A detailed descrip
tion of the Commissioner's perfor
mance in the carrying out of his
duties will be provided upon re
quest.
In the current election, he has
failed to properly instruct the stu
dents who are operating the polls
with the consequence that flag
rant violations of the rules govern
ing electioneering have gone un
noticed. It should also be brought
to the attention of the Committee
that the polls at Engineering Cor
ner and at the Post Office were
forced to close during part of the
afternoon because all their ballots
were used. Only after the Com
missioner was contacted in his fra
ternity house were more ballots
provided and the polls reopened.
It is quite obvious that the
ASSU Elections have not been
properly conducted this year and
I suspect that future elections also
will not be unless the present
Elections Commissioner assumes
the responsibility his office de
mands; or he is replaced by some
one more competent.
My intention is not to dis
qualify any candidate nor to de
cry the personality of the Elec
tions Commissioner, but to have
the Committee explore means by
which future ASSU Elections can
be properly conducted.

• Questions For BSU
Editor, THE DAILY:
Mr. Booth's article "Why the
BSU asked Students" which ap
peared in yesterday's Daily starts
with the unsupported assumption
that the BSU has appealed to the
student body of Stanford Uni
versity.
At last Thursday evening's
LASSU meeting Mr. Booth spon
sored a bill endorsing the BSU's
twelve demands. The members of
LASSU, recognizing that they do
not necessarily represent the
opinion of the student body, and
noting the upcoming ASSU elec
tion, proposed that the twelve de
mands be placed individually or
collectively on the ballot.
The BSU was so interested in
appealing to student support that
they wanted Mr. Booth to with
draw the bill rather than have
their demands presented to the
student body.
In reply to a question concern
ing the BSU's response to a stu
dent vote, the BSU representatives
stated that they would not abide
by any vote of the student body.
Perhaps one ought to place the
BSU under as much scrutiny as
the BSU is placing the Stanford
administration. Ask of the nearest
BSU representative: Why are you
afraid to present your demands to
a vote of the Stanford student
body? Why would you "go to war

with this administration?" And,
why do you need pawns like Jack
son Booth to apologize for the
anti-democratic philosophy of
your organization?

•Who Opened The Door?
Editor, THE DAILY:
The Daily's coverage of ti.j
third hearing of the Stanford Judi
cial Council on the alleged dis
ruption of last month's Trustee
meeting failed to indicate the im
portance of some key testimony
presented. The only reference to
testimony regarding the central
issue of how the student demon
strators were able to enter the
Trustee meeting was the state
ment: "After two witnesses testi
fied about the lock system in the
Faculty Club, Weinberg began the
defense." (It should be recalled
that student demonstrators were
able to enter the Trustee meeting
only after a student entered the
meeting room through a court
yard door.)
The witnesses were two Faculty
Club employees—Tom Byrom and
Mrs. Wilma Hollingsworth—who
testified that the doors to the
courtyard could not be opened
from the outside when locked.
In private conversation, Mrs. Hol
lingsworth, supervisor of the Fac
ulty Club and an eyewitness to
the events of the Trustee meeting,
stated that the courtyard doors
were locked and that "the Trustees
let them in."
