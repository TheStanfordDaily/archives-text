# Naval ROTC Head
## Colonel Opposes Ouster Of ROTC 
### SUSAN SWARD 
Ask a career Marine like
Colonel Robert Thomas how he
has managed to move around the
country and the world 22 times
since 1944, and he responds with
a smile, "I think you have to be
sort of an adventurer and a
romantic to join the military in
the first place."
When Robert Thomas was a
boy of ten he used to take jobs
sweeping up hangars in his home
town of Muskegon, Michigan, so
he could earn a ten-minute ride on
a plane. He graduated from the
University of Michigan, went di
rectly into marine aviator training
at Corpus Christi and went to the
South Pacific in 1942.
"I saw action as a second lieu
tenant at Guadacanal, New
Georgia and Bouganville," said the
Colonel. "Immediately after the
Japanese surrender, I flew trans
port aircraft in North China."
Far East Duty
Subsequent to the war, Thomas
was promoted to the position of
major. He has had several tours of
duty to the Far East and Mediter
ranean since that time. He has also
taught school and attended classes
off and on all through his career
in the Marines. From 1965
through 1967 he and his family—
that includes a wife and three
sons —were in Washington, D.C.,
while he was with the Head
quarters of the Marine Corps.
According to Thomas, it is not
at all a rare thing to keep return
ing to school. "You're constantly
preparing and training," he said.
"Every four to six years or so you
go back to school for awhile.
Right now, as my job permits me
some time, I've been taking
courses at Stanford working
toward an M.A. in English.
"I've completed about 20 units.
This quarter I'm taking a course
from Professor Stone on the liter
ature of World War I."
Thomas came to Stanford in
1967. Tentatively, his tour of
duty here as Professor of Naval
Sciences in the ROTC program
will be concluded a year from this
June. His job presently includes
supervising the curriculum of the
naval sciences department, ad
vising naval science students and
teaching selected naval science
courses.
"The job itself is not very
time-consuming by other stand
ards," admitted the Colonel, put
ting a hand to his strik-ngly white
hair. "On my last tour of duty at
Washington, we worked 65 hours
a week, week in and week out. My
work within the naval sciences de

partment takes about 30 hours a
week."
Interest in Aviation
When questioned about his
motives for becoming a career of
ficer in the Marines, the Colonel
responded, "I'd always been inter
ested in aviation. By June of 1941
it was apparent to me we were
going to be involved in war, so I
entered the Marines initially to
fight in World War 11.
"Following the war, it appeared
to me that we hadn't really solved
the things we'd set out to solve.
And aviation had gotten into my
blood. First, in Europe we'd re
placed one aggressive power with
another—Russia for Germany. By
1948 China was exhibiting much
the same expansionist designs
Japan had during World War II."
The Colonel sees a parallel be
tween the type of containment
the United States is attempting
now in Vietnam with the type of
containment the United States at
tempted with Japan prior to and
during World War 11.
The dissatisfaction currently
felt in the United States against
the Vietnam War, according to the
Colonel, greatly influences those
people who are dissatisfied with
ROTC and the military in general.
"I don't think that individuals,
even though they may try, are
able to disassociate Vietnam,
ROTC and the military in general
from one another. I know many
people try to judge ROTC on its
institutional merits, but I don't
think they attain the objectivity
they strive for."
Military Ethics
Last Tuesday the Colonel gave
a talk in Robert Mac Af fee
Brown's course on Christian
ethics. Thomas spoke on the topic
of ethics of a career military man.
He isolates three major con
victions which support his pursuit
of a military career. First, though
not necessarily first in import
ance, Thomas feels that the
United States and its institutions
are "worthy of preservation."
This is not to say that those insti
tutions are flawless, admits the
Colonel.
Secondly, Thomas fails to find
any historical support for the fact
that man can transcend nation
state boundaries. He views any al
liances or organizations which
have attempted to cross this all
powerful boundary as essentially
failures.
Finally, Thomas feels that the
deprivation of freedom is a con
dition which merits fighting with
one's life. "For these reasons I
feel justified participating in war

fare. The just war has to be de
fined by the society and the indi
viduals within the society. Each
can make a separate or collective
judgment."
Thomas feels that the ROTC
student is "not too different than
most of the Stanford students in
his attitudes. He has a greater re
gard for our institutions and a
stronger commitment to those in
stitutions than perhaps a large
number of students.
"But the ROTC student is by
no means of any one given mold.
This is one of the great benefits of
drawing our military officers from
our civilian institutions rather
than from our service academies
like Annapolis, West Point or the
Air Force Academy."
Criticisms
Thomas has some definite criti
cisms to make of the service aca
demy training system.
"I think the young man who
goes to a service academy receives
his education in a cloistered en
vironment," observed the Colonel.
"He doesn't daily confront the
civilian concerns and outlooks as
do the ROTC students, nor is his
commitment continually chal
lenged."

As a consequence, the young
man here at Stanford has a chance
to test his commitment whereas
the service academy product often
goes unchallenged until he rubs
shoulders with his ROTC contem
poraries.
"The junior officer from ROTC
has a lasting influence on his con
temporaries from the academy.
And it's the very real influence of
bringing to the military the
civilian perspective."
If credit is taken away from the
ROTC program at Stanford, the
result will be that "the quality of
leadership in the junior ranks of
our armed forces will not be what
we desire. The service academies
and the Officers' Candidate
School alone cannot provide the
numbers.
"On the other hand, to try to
build up the academies to meet
total needs would be exceptional
ly expensive. It costs 40,000
dollars more a year in the military
budget to commission a young
man from the service academies
than from ROTC."
Professional Core
Thomas envisions that as a re
sult of these events, the United
States may end up with a profes

sional officer core. "And the pro
fessional officer core has not pro
vided a good answer in Europe or
South America.
"Military values, doctrines,
theory and history taught by mili
tary officers are worthy subjects
for academic inquiry. The student
may accept or reject these values
and theories the same as he may
accept or reject economic, histori
cal or literary interpretations.
"It seems reasonable to me that
you'd go to the military for com
petence in teaching those subjects.
To remove these subjects from the
Stanford curriculum when there is
a proven interest seems to me to
be foreign to the objectives of aca
demic freedom."
Although Thomas argues
against taking credit away from
ROTC courses at Stanford, he
does not feel that the program is
above being reformed. In signing
the minority report of the Ad Hoc
Committee of the Senate on
ROTC, Thomas feels he demon
strated his feeling that the ROTC
program needs substantial reform
but not a total loss of course
credit.

To remove these subjects from the
Stanford curriculum when there is
a proven interest seems to me to
be foreign to the objectives of aca
demic freedom."
Although Thomas argues
against taking credit away from
ROTC courses at Stanford, he
does not feel that the program is
above being reformed. In signing
the minority report of the Ad Hoc
Committee of the Senate on
ROTC, Thomas feels he demon
strated his feeling that the ROTC
program needs substantial reform
but not a total loss of course
credit.
Ask a career Marine like
Colonel Robert Thomas how he
has managed to move around the
country and the world 22 times
since 1944, and he responds with
a smile, "I think you have to be
sort of an adventurer and a
romantic to join the military in
the first place."
When Robert Thomas was a
boy of ten he used to take jobs
sweeping up hangars in his home
town of Muskegon, Michigan, so
he could earn a ten-minute ride on
a plane. He graduated from the
University of Michigan, went di
rectly into marine aviator training
at Corpus Christi and went to the
South Pacific in 1942.
"I saw action as a second lieu
tenant at Guadacanal, New
Georgia and Bouganville," said the
Colonel. "Immediately after the
Japanese surrender, I flew trans
port aircraft in North China."
Far East Duty
Subsequent to the war, Thomas
was promoted to the position of
major. He has had several tours of
duty to the Far East and Mediter
ranean since that time. He has also
taught school and attended classes
off and on all through his career
in the Marines. From 1965
through 1967 he and his family—
that includes a wife and three
sons —were in Washington, D.C.,
while he was with the Head
quarters of the Marine Corps.
According to Thomas, it is not
at all a rare thing to keep return
ing to school. "You're constantly
preparing and training," he said.
"Every four to six years or so you
go back to school for awhile.
Right now, as my job permits me
some time, I've been taking
courses at Stanford working
toward an M.A. in English.
"I've completed about 20 units.
This quarter I'm taking a course
from Professor Stone on the liter
ature of World War I."
Thomas came to Stanford in
1967. Tentatively, his tour of
duty here as Professor of Naval
Sciences in the ROTC program
will be concluded a year from this
June. His job presently includes
supervising the curriculum of the
naval sciences department, ad
vising naval science students and
teaching selected naval science
courses.
"The job itself is not very
time-consuming by other stand
ards," admitted the Colonel, put
ting a hand to his strik-ngly white
hair. "On my last tour of duty at
Washington, we worked 65 hours
a week, week in and week out. My
work within the naval sciences de

partment takes about 30 hours a
week."
Interest in Aviation
When questioned about his
motives for becoming a career of
ficer in the Marines, the Colonel
responded, "I'd always been inter
ested in aviation. By June of 1941
it was apparent to me we were
going to be involved in war, so I
entered the Marines initially to
fight in World War 11.
"Following the war, it appeared
to me that we hadn't really solved
the things we'd set out to solve.
And aviation had gotten into my
blood. First, in Europe we'd re
placed one aggressive power with
another—Russia for Germany. By
1948 China was exhibiting much
the same expansionist designs
Japan had during World War II."
The Colonel sees a parallel be
tween the type of containment
the United States is attempting
now in Vietnam with the type of
containment the United States at
tempted with Japan prior to and
during World War 11.
The dissatisfaction currently
felt in the United States against
the Vietnam War, according to the
Colonel, greatly influences those
people who are dissatisfied with
ROTC and the military in general.
"I don't think that individuals,
even though they may try, are
able to disassociate Vietnam,
ROTC and the military in general
from one another. I know many
people try to judge ROTC on its
institutional merits, but I don't
think they attain the objectivity
they strive for."
Military Ethics
Last Tuesday the Colonel gave
a talk in Robert Mac Af fee
Brown's course on Christian
ethics. Thomas spoke on the topic
of ethics of a career military man.
He isolates three major con
victions which support his pursuit
of a military career. First, though
not necessarily first in import
ance, Thomas feels that the
United States and its institutions
are "worthy of preservation."
This is not to say that those insti
tutions are flawless, admits the
Colonel.
Secondly, Thomas fails to find
any historical support for the fact
that man can transcend nation
state boundaries. He views any al
liances or organizations which
have attempted to cross this all
powerful boundary as essentially
failures.
Finally, Thomas feels that the
deprivation of freedom is a con
dition which merits fighting with
one's life. "For these reasons I
feel justified participating in war

fare. The just war has to be de
fined by the society and the indi
viduals within the society. Each
can make a separate or collective
judgment."
Thomas feels that the ROTC
student is "not too different than
most of the Stanford students in
his attitudes. He has a greater re
gard for our institutions and a
stronger commitment to those in
stitutions than perhaps a large
number of students.
"But the ROTC student is by
no means of any one given mold.
This is one of the great benefits of
drawing our military officers from
our civilian institutions rather
than from our service academies
like Annapolis, West Point or the
Air Force Academy."
Criticisms
Thomas has some definite criti
cisms to make of the service aca
demy training system.
"I think the young man who
goes to a service academy receives
his education in a cloistered en
vironment," observed the Colonel.
"He doesn't daily confront the
civilian concerns and outlooks as
do the ROTC students, nor is his
commitment continually chal
lenged."

As a consequence, the young
man here at Stanford has a chance
to test his commitment whereas
the service academy product often
goes unchallenged until he rubs
shoulders with his ROTC contem
poraries.
"The junior officer from ROTC
has a lasting influence on his con
temporaries from the academy.
And it's the very real influence of
bringing to the military the
civilian perspective."
If credit is taken away from the
ROTC program at Stanford, the
result will be that "the quality of
leadership in the junior ranks of
our armed forces will not be what
we desire. The service academies
and the Officers' Candidate
School alone cannot provide the
numbers.
"On the other hand, to try to
build up the academies to meet
total needs would be exceptional
ly expensive. It costs 40,000
dollars more a year in the military
budget to commission a young
man from the service academies
than from ROTC."
Professional Core
Thomas envisions that as a re
sult of these events, the United
States may end up with a profes

sional officer core. "And the pro
fessional officer core has not pro
vided a good answer in Europe or
South America.
"Military values, doctrines,
theory and history taught by mili
tary officers are worthy subjects
for academic inquiry. The student
may accept or reject these values
and theories the same as he may
accept or reject economic, histori
cal or literary interpretations.
"It seems reasonable to me that
you'd go to the military for com
petence in teaching those subjects.

Stanford curriculum when there is

Although Thomas argues
against taking credit away from
ROTC courses at Stanford, he
does not feel that the program is
above being reformed. In signing
the minority report of the Ad Hoc
Committee of the Senate on
ROTC, Thomas feels he demon

credit.
Ask a career Marine like
Colonel Robert Thomas how he
has managed to move around the
country and the world 22 times
since 1944, and he responds with
a smile, "I think you have to be
sort of an adventurer and a
romantic to join the military in
the first place."
When Robert Thomas was a
boy of ten he used to take jobs
sweeping up hangars in his home
town of Muskegon, Michigan, so
he could earn a ten-minute ride on
a plane. He graduated from the
University of Michigan, went di
rectly into marine aviator training
at Corpus Christi and went to the
South Pacific in 1942.
"I saw action as a second lieu
tenant at Guadacanal, New
Georgia and Bouganville," said the
Colonel. "Immediately after the
Japanese surrender, I flew trans
port aircraft in North China."
Far East Duty
Subsequent to the war, Thomas
was promoted to the position of
major. He has had several tours of
duty to the Far East and Mediter
ranean since that time. He has also
taught school and attended classes
off and on all through his career
in the Marines. From 1965
through 1967 he and his family—
that includes a wife and three
sons —were in Washington, D.C.,
while he was with the Head
quarters of the Marine Corps.
According to Thomas, it is not
at all a rare thing to keep return
ing to school. "You're constantly
preparing and training," he said.
"Every four to six years or so you
go back to school for awhile.
Right now, as my job permits me
some time, I've been taking
courses at Stanford working
toward an M.A. in English.
"I've completed about 20 units.
This quarter I'm taking a course
from Professor Stone on the liter
ature of World War I."
Thomas came to Stanford in
1967. Tentatively, his tour of
duty here as Professor of Naval
Sciences in the ROTC program
will be concluded a year from this
June. His job presently includes
supervising the curriculum of the
naval sciences department, ad
vising naval science students and
teaching selected naval science
courses.
"The job itself is not very
time-consuming by other stand
ards," admitted the Colonel, put
ting a hand to his strik-ngly white
hair. "On my last tour of duty at
Washington, we worked 65 hours
a week, week in and week out. My
work within the naval sciences de

partment takes about 30 hours a
week."
Interest in Aviation
When questioned about his
motives for becoming a career of
ficer in the Marines, the Colonel
responded, "I'd always been inter
ested in aviation. By June of 1941
it was apparent to me we were
going to be involved in war, so I
entered the Marines initially to
fight in World War 11.
"Following the war, it appeared
to me that we hadn't really solved
the things we'd set out to solve.
And aviation had gotten into my
blood. First, in Europe we'd re
placed one aggressive power with
another—Russia for Germany. By
1948 China was exhibiting much
the same expansionist designs
Japan had during World War II."
The Colonel sees a parallel be
tween the type of containment
the United States is attempting
now in Vietnam with the type of
containment the United States at
tempted with Japan prior to and
during World War 11.
The dissatisfaction currently
felt in the United States against
the Vietnam War, according to the
Colonel, greatly influences those
people who are dissatisfied with
ROTC and the military in general.
"I don't think that individuals,
even though they may try, are
able to disassociate Vietnam,
ROTC and the military in general
from one another. I know many
people try to judge ROTC on its
institutional merits, but I don't
think they attain the objectivity
they strive for."
Military Ethics
Last Tuesday the Colonel gave
a talk in Robert Mac Af fee
Brown's course on Christian
ethics. Thomas spoke on the topic
of ethics of a career military man.
He isolates three major con
victions which support his pursuit
of a military career. First, though
not necessarily first in import
ance, Thomas feels that the
United States and its institutions
are "worthy of preservation."
This is not to say that those insti
tutions are flawless, admits the
Colonel.
Secondly, Thomas fails to find
any historical support for the fact
that man can transcend nation
state boundaries. He views any al
liances or organizations which
have attempted to cross this all
powerful boundary as essentially
failures.
Finally, Thomas feels that the
deprivation of freedom is a con
dition which merits fighting with
one's life. "For these reasons I
feel justified participating in war

fare. The just war has to be de
fined by the society and the indi
viduals within the society. Each
can make a separate or collective
judgment."
Thomas feels that the ROTC
student is "not too different than
most of the Stanford students in
his attitudes. He has a greater re
gard for our institutions and a
stronger commitment to those in
stitutions than perhaps a large
number of students.
"But the ROTC student is by
no means of any one given mold.
This is one of the great benefits of
drawing our military officers from
our civilian institutions rather
than from our service academies
like Annapolis, West Point or the
Air Force Academy."
Criticisms
Thomas has some definite criti
cisms to make of the service aca
demy training system.
"I think the young man who
goes to a service academy receives
his education in a cloistered en
vironment," observed the Colonel.
"He doesn't daily confront the
civilian concerns and outlooks as
do the ROTC students, nor is his
commitment continually chal
lenged."

As a consequence, the young
man here at Stanford has a chance
to test his commitment whereas
the service academy product often
goes unchallenged until he rubs
shoulders with his ROTC contem
poraries.
"The junior officer from ROTC
has a lasting influence on his con
temporaries from the academy.
And it's the very real influence of
bringing to the military the
civilian perspective."
If credit is taken away from the
ROTC program at Stanford, the
result will be that "the quality of
leadership in the junior ranks of
our armed forces will not be what
we desire. The service academies
and the Officers' Candidate
School alone cannot provide the
numbers.
"On the other hand, to try to
build up the academies to meet
total needs would be exceptional
ly expensive. It costs 40,000
dollars more a year in the military
budget to commission a young
man from the service academies
than from ROTC."
Professional Core
Thomas envisions that as a re
sult of these events, the United
States may end up with a profes

sional officer core. "And the pro
fessional officer core has not pro
vided a good answer in Europe or
South America.
"Military values, doctrines,
theory and history taught by mili

we desire. The service academies
and the Officers' Candidate
School alone cannot provide the
numbers.
"On the other hand, to try to
build up the academies to meet
total needs would be exceptional
ly expensive. It costs 40,000
dollars more a year in the military
budget to commission a young
man from the service academies
than from ROTC."
Professional Core
Thomas envisions that as a re
sult of these events, the United
States may end up with a profes

sional officer core. "And the pro
fessional officer core has not pro
vided a good answer in Europe or
South America.
"Military values, doctrines,
theory and history taught by mili
tary officers are worthy subjects
for academic inquiry. The student
may accept or reject these values
and theories the same as he may
accept or reject economic, histori
cal or literary interpretations.
"It seems reasonable to me that
you'd go to the military for com
petence in teaching those subjects.
To remove these subjects from the
Stanford curriculum when there is
a proven interest seems to me to
be foreign to the objectives of aca
demic freedom."
Although Thomas argues
against taking credit away from
ROTC courses at Stanford, he
does not feel that the program is
above being reformed. In signing
the minority report of the Ad Hoc
Committee of the Senate on
ROTC, Thomas feels he demon
strated his feeling that the ROTC
program needs substantial reform
but not a total loss of course
credit.
Ask a career Marine like
Colonel Robert Thomas how he
has managed to move around the
country and the world 22 times
since 1944, and he responds with
a smile, "I think you have to be
sort of an adventurer and a
romantic to join the military in
the first place."
When Robert Thomas was a
boy of ten he used to take jobs
sweeping up hangars in his home
town of Muskegon, Michigan, so
he could earn a ten-minute ride on
a plane. He graduated from the
University of Michigan, went di
rectly into marine aviator training
at Corpus Christi and went to the
South Pacific in 1942.
"I saw action as a second lieu
tenant at Guadacanal, New
Georgia and Bouganville," said the
Colonel. "Immediately after the
Japanese surrender, I flew trans
port aircraft in North China."
Far East Duty
Subsequent to the war, Thomas
was promoted to the position of
major. He has had several tours of
duty to the Far East and Mediter
ranean since that time. He has also
taught school and attended classes
off and on all through his career
in the Marines. From 1965
through 1967 he and his family—
that includes a wife and three
sons —were in Washington, D.C.,
while he was with the Head
quarters of the Marine Corps.
According to Thomas, it is not
at all a rare thing to keep return
ing to school. "You're constantly
preparing and training," he said.
"Every four to six years or so you
go back to school for awhile.
Right now, as my job permits me
some time, I've been taking
courses at Stanford working
toward an M.A. in English.
"I've completed about 20 units.
This quarter I'm taking a course
from Professor Stone on the liter
ature of World War I."
Thomas came to Stanford in
1967. Tentatively, his tour of
duty here as Professor of Naval
Sciences in the ROTC program
will be concluded a year from this
June. His job presently includes
supervising the curriculum of the
naval sciences department, ad
vising naval science students and
teaching selected naval science
courses.
"The job itself is not very
time-consuming by other stand
ards," admitted the Colonel, put
ting a hand to his strik-ngly white
hair. "On my last tour of duty at
Washington, we worked 65 hours
a week, week in and week out. My
work within the naval sciences de

partment takes about 30 hours a
week."
Interest in Aviation
When questioned about his
motives for becoming a career of
ficer in the Marines, the Colonel
responded, "I'd always been inter
ested in aviation. By June of 1941
it was apparent to me we were
going to be involved in war, so I
entered the Marines initially to
fight in World War 11.
"Following the war, it appeared
to me that we hadn't really solved
the things we'd set out to solve.
And aviation had gotten into my
blood. First, in Europe we'd re
placed one aggressive power with
another—Russia for Germany. By
1948 China was exhibiting much
the same expansionist designs
Japan had during World War II."
The Colonel sees a parallel be
tween the type of containment
the United States is attempting
now in Vietnam with the type of
containment the United States at
tempted with Japan prior to and
during World War 11.
The dissatisfaction currently
felt in the United States against
the Vietnam War, according to the
Colonel, greatly influences those
people who are dissatisfied with
ROTC and the military in general.
"I don't think that individuals,
even though they may try, are
able to disassociate Vietnam,
ROTC and the military in general
from one another. I know many
people try to judge ROTC on its
institutional merits, but I don't
think they attain the objectivity
they strive for."
Military Ethics
Last Tuesday the Colonel gave
a talk in Robert Mac Af fee
Brown's course on Christian
ethics. Thomas spoke on the topic
of ethics of a career military man.
He isolates three major con
victions which support his pursuit
of a military career. First, though
not necessarily first in import
ance, Thomas feels that the
United States and its institutions
are "worthy of preservation."
This is not to say that those insti
tutions are flawless, admits the
Colonel.
Secondly, Thomas fails to find
any historical support for the fact
that man can transcend nation
state boundaries. He views any al
liances or organizations which
have attempted to cross this all
powerful boundary as essentially
failures.
Finally, Thomas feels that the
deprivation of freedom is a con
dition which merits fighting with
one's life. "For these reasons I
feel justified participating in war

fare. The just war has to be de
fined by the society and the indi
viduals within the society. Each
can make a separate or collective
judgment."
Thomas feels that the ROTC
student is "not too different than
most of the Stanford students in
his attitudes. He has a greater re
gard for our institutions and a
stronger commitment to those in
stitutions than perhaps a large
number of students.
"But the ROTC student is by
no means of any one given mold.
This is one of the great benefits of
drawing our military officers from
our civilian institutions rather
than from our service academies
like Annapolis, West Point or the
Air Force Academy."
Criticisms
Thomas has some definite criti
cisms to make of the service aca
demy training system.
"I think the young man who
goes to a service academy receives
his education in a cloistered en
vironment," observed the Colonel.
"He doesn't daily confront the
civilian concerns and outlooks as
do the ROTC students, nor is his
commitment continually chal
lenged."

As a consequence, the young
man here at Stanford has a chance
to test his commitment whereas
the service academy product often
goes unchallenged until he rubs
shoulders with his ROTC contem
poraries.
"The junior officer from ROTC
has a lasting influence on his con
temporaries from the academy.
And it's the very real influence of
bringing to the military the
civilian perspective."
If credit is taken away from the
ROTC program at Stanford, the
result will be that "the quality of
leadership in the junior ranks of
our armed forces will not be what
we desire. The service academies
and the Officers' Candidate
School alone cannot provide the
numbers.
"On the other hand, to try to
build up the academies to meet
total needs would be exceptional
ly expensive. It costs 40,000
