## Israel Threatens Arabs 
### 
JERUSALEM (AP)-Israel de
manded Wednesday that Arab
governments and airlines "take
immediate measures to prevent
further attacks on Israel's air
routes." Coupled with this was a
warning of counteraction.
The Arab guerrilla raid on an El
A 1 jetliner at Zurich—the third
blow at Israel's civil aviation in
seven months—prompted Trans
port Minister Moshe Carmel to de
clare the air routes "are of the
highest security priority."
He aimed his warning specifical
ly at Lebanon, though Swiss
police reported the three Arabs
captured at the Zurich airport said
they came from Damascus, Syria's
capital. And the Popular Front for
the Liberation of Palestine, which
claimed responsibility for the at
tack, said it was planned in the
Jordan River Valley.
"Israel has the full moral right
and operational ability to take all
necessary defensive measures at
any place to break up the ring of
terrorism on the airways and
assure that Israel has completely
free air traffic," Carmel said in an

address to the Knesset, the nation
al parliament.
Singling out neighboring
Lebanon as the stamping ground
of guerrillas responsible in Israel's
view for all three incidents, the
transport minister declared the
government in Beirut has the duty
to "uproot any nest of piracy
from its territory."
He noted that the Popular
Front, a Marxist Arab outfit that
claimed it handled the hijacking
of an El A 1 airliner to Algeria last
July 23 and the attack on another
in Athens Dec. 26, took responsi
bility for the Swiss incident in a
statement published in Beirut.
This statement had been issued
two hours earlier in Amman, Jor
dan's capital. A spokesman for the
front in Amman subsequently said
two of the raiders came from refu
gee camps in Jordan, one from a
camp in Syria and another from
the Israeli-occupied west bank of
the Jordan.
The Knesset endorsed Carmel's
presentation of the government
position with a unanimous vote of
confidence.
•JOB CORPS ALIVE .
WASHINGTON (AP)-Presi
dent Nixon, backtracking on some
election campaign views, told
Congress Wednesday he wants to
keep the Job Corps alive for at
least another year, but remove it
from the antipoverty agency.
Nixon, who called for abolish
ing the Job Corps during the cam
paign, also announced to Congress
| that he'll switch the popular Head
Start program from the Office of
Economic Opportunity to the De
partment of Health, Education
and Welfare.
Loss of the Job Corps and Head
Start will remove from OEO
about half of its $2 billion annual
budget for antipoverty efforts.
While there had been specu
| lation early in the administration
j that Nixon might even abolish the
! OEO, he said experience has
proven "the value of having in the
: federal government an agency
whose special concern is the
poor."
But he pictured OEO's greatest
value as devising new programs
and serving as an "incubator" for
them "during their initial, experi
mental phases."
By shifting the Job Corps to
the Labor Department and re
lieving OEO of responsibility for
operating Head Start, the Presi
dent said that agency could con
centrate its energies on inno
vation.
In what was described by White
House sources as an important
new move, Nixon told Congress in
a special message that he pledges
to support "a national commit
ment to providing all American
children an opportunity for
healthful and stimulating develop
ment during the first five years of
life."
•WARNING ON IN FLA TION
WASHINGTON (AP)-In a
brief and less-than-cordial en
counter with the Senate-House
1 Economic Committee Wednesday,

Secretary of the Treasury David
M. Kennedy cautioned against
"attempting to stop inflation too
abruptly."
Kennedy said Congress must
extend the 10 percent tax sur
charge for another year "unless
fiscal 1970 federal expenditures
can be cut back appreciably."
"The economy must be placed
under firm restraint until there are
unmistakable signs that we are
headed back on a noninflationary
path," Kennedy said.
But he added there would be
grave risk in pulling the brakes too
fast, saying:
"If the economy were to be
halted in its tracks, unemploy
ment would rise prohibitively.
Even though the inflationary
psychology might be broken, the
cost would be too high."
Kennedy, former board chair
man of Continental Illinois
National Bank and Trust Co.,
Chicago, ran into some stiff-arm
questions on conflict of interest
before he was well settled in the
witness chair.
Rep. Wright Patman, D-Tex.,
chairman of the joint committee
which is holding hearings on John
son's economic message to Con
gress, raised the conflict issue. He
volunteered the information that
he had once "challenged a secre
tary of the Treasury with im
peachment"; he was referring to
Andrew Mellon.
Kennedy spoke up defensively
—"lf you are going to impeach
me . . ."—but Patman assured him
this was not his intention, but
nevertheless went on to speak his
doubts on the propriety of a
banker handling government
policy directly affecting the bank
ing industry.
