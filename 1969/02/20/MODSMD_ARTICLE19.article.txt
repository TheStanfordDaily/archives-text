# A 						Day With The Standard Oil Picket Line
## 
### BARBARA HYLAND 
Author's Note: In going to the
strike I sincerely hoped to present
a fair view of the strike from both
the management's and union's
points of view. However it was
impossible to interview anyone
representing the management's
perspective. Therefore this article
does not pretend to be objective,
but rather to present the views of
the strikers and some of their sup
porters and to convey the atmos
phere on one side of the picket
line.
It was a gray Wednesday morn
ing on Castro Street outside of the
Richmond Standard Oil Refinery.
Striking members of the Oil,
Chemical and Atomic Workers
Union manned picket lines at all
the entrances.
Despite the changing rumor
that the police had broken a lead
er's wrists (which the police de
nied), most people conceded that
it was a quiet morning. There
were only a few scuffles with
workers who crossed picket lines
to go into the plant.

Yet the mood was not truly
peaceful; there was too much ten
sion to feel at ease. Police adjust
ing their gas masks or checking
their guns is not a reassuring sight.
Neither is seeing police dogs snarl
ing in the backs of station wagons.
The police were very willing to
talk, if they were approached
courteously. When asked if there
had been any violence, one ser
geant pointed to the pickets and
replied, "No, just a bunch of fools
walking across the street."
Another officer was coopera
tive in explaining about tactics the
force uses. Tear gas he said would
be used when a lieutenant ordered
it. He thought that circumstances
warranting tear gas would be if
strikers really began beating
people crossing their lines or if
they tried to storm the gates.
Displaying the small aerosol can
on his belt, he said that mace
would be used in case an indi
vidual, and not a mob, was in
volved. Mace can be shot from a
distance of 20 feet he stated.
It was much more difficult to
talk with workers who crossed the
picket lines. Separated from the
jeering picketeers by police armed
with clubs, they walked resolute
ly. When approached, they tended
to be tight-lipped and to walk asfast
as possible. One man in a business
suit wondered how many students

were there from Stanford, and
then commented that it did not
bother him at all to break through
the line. Other attempts to inter
view workers going to their jobs
were futile.
On the picket line people were
more open for discussion. They
were anxious to present their
views.
One striker said that he had
been an employee since 1948. He
strongly supported the Union's
demand for a 72c wage increse
and added that if the Union gave
in "just lc an hour, we've lost the
damn fight." ♦
He hesitated before expressing
his feeling toward people he knew
who had stayed at their jobs and
crossed the lines. He finally said
he felt "damn bad." "If I were to
cross the picket, I think my wife
would leave me," he said. He ex
plained that he had come from a
mining family in Illinois that had
believed in unions, but that his
wife was not even from a union
family.
He guessed that the reasons so
many oil workers had not gone on
strike is because they were scared
of losing their jobs, they were
short of money, or their wives
were pressuring them. Most are
not that much in need of money
that they must stay at their jobs,
he said bitterly.

He believed that students were
as involved as the strikers in the
question of equal rights and big
business. Between 50 and 70 per
cent of the strikers would actively
participate in a student strike he
estimated. His union has already
voted 2:1 to support striking stu
dents at S.F. State.
Members of the Oil, Chemical
and Atomic Workers Union were
not alone on the picket lines.
Longshoremen, members of the
AFT, students, a member of the
Amalgamated Clothing Workers,
and various individuals (including
a supposed veteran of the Spanish
Civil War) walked back and forth
before the gates.
About twenty longshoremen
had come in a bus. One explained
that he was there, even if he for
feited $30 a day in pay, because
"we've all got the same cause.
Labor and the students are in the
same struggle. They're all against
the system." He said that he had
been arrested earlier at S.F. State.
"The days of laying down and
singing 'We Shall Overcome' and
having a big dog bite you in the
ass—these says are gone." He ex
pected a violent fast change.
"We're going to use the same tac
tics the United States uses in Viet
nam—only we talk and then
murder."
He was optimistic though.

"Things are going to get better no
matter what the system says." He
thought people would soon realize
that the whole economic system of
the country was wrong. A dicta
torship of the proletariat was his
goal.
He commented, "You have to
get people to work for their own
pride and not because someone's
waving a pay check in front of his
nose. Who wants to go to college
in order to make a better
napalm?"
Teachers from S.F. State
echoed his feelings on students'
and workers' uniting. One said
that 100 Longshoremen had
picketed with them recently.
A woman from the Amalga
mated Clothing Workers praised
students for being the "vanguard
of the movement today to make
great changes in our society."
Yet occasionally people's out
ward confidence weakened and
they talked about the risks they
were taking. One young girl
laughed nervously as she spoke of
having spent two months in jail.
"Well if you expect cloth napkins
or salt with your dinner," it can
be awful, she admitted. She then
got out of the V.W. bus and
joined the strikers.
"Yet this ideal seems very re
mote from the real world of many
young blacks, Mexican-Americans,

American Indians and poor
whites. 'Do you really mean what
you say?', they ask. Our response
will provide a litmus test for
democracy . . .

porters and to convey the atmos
phere on one side of the picket
line.
It was a gray Wednesday morn
ing on Castro Street outside of the
Richmond Standard Oil Refinery.
Striking members of the Oil,
Chemical and Atomic Workers
Union manned picket lines at all
the entrances.
Despite the changing rumor
that the police had broken a lead
er's wrists (which the police de
nied), most people conceded that
it was a quiet morning. There
were only a few scuffles with
workers who crossed picket lines
to go into the plant.

Yet the mood was not truly
peaceful; there was too much ten
sion to feel at ease. Police adjust
ing their gas masks or checking
their guns is not a reassuring sight.
Neither is seeing police dogs snarl
ing in the backs of station wagons.
The police were very willing to
talk, if they were approached
courteously. When asked if there
had been any violence, one ser
geant pointed to the pickets and
replied, "No, just a bunch of fools
walking across the street."
Another officer was coopera
tive in explaining about tactics the
force uses. Tear gas he said would
be used when a lieutenant ordered
it. He thought that circumstances
warranting tear gas would be if
strikers really began beating
people crossing their lines or if
they tried to storm the gates.
Displaying the small aerosol can
on his belt, he said that mace
would be used in case an indi
vidual, and not a mob, was in
volved. Mace can be shot from a
distance of 20 feet he stated.
It was much more difficult to
talk with workers who crossed the
picket lines. Separated from the
jeering picketeers by police armed
with clubs, they walked resolute
ly. When approached, they tended
to be tight-lipped and to walk asfast
as possible. One man in a business
suit wondered how many students

were there from Stanford, and
then commented that it did not
bother him at all to break through
the line. Other attempts to inter
view workers going to their jobs
were futile.
On the picket line people were
more open for discussion. They
were anxious to present their
views.
One striker said that he had
been an employee since 1948. He
strongly supported the Union's
demand for a 72c wage increse
and added that if the Union gave
in "just lc an hour, we've lost the
damn fight." ♦
He hesitated before expressing
his feeling toward people he knew
who had stayed at their jobs and
crossed the lines. He finally said
he felt "damn bad." "If I were to
cross the picket, I think my wife
would leave me," he said. He ex
plained that he had come from a
mining family in Illinois that had
believed in unions, but that his
wife was not even from a union
family.
He guessed that the reasons so
many oil workers had not gone on
strike is because they were scared
of losing their jobs, they were
short of money, or their wives
were pressuring them. Most are
not that much in need of money
that they must stay at their jobs,
he said bitterly.

He believed that students were
as involved as the strikers in the
question of equal rights and big
business. Between 50 and 70 per
cent of the strikers would actively
participate in a student strike he
estimated. His union has already
voted 2:1 to support striking stu
dents at S.F. State.
Members of the Oil, Chemical
and Atomic Workers Union were
not alone on the picket lines.
Longshoremen, members of the
AFT, students, a member of the
Amalgamated Clothing Workers,
and various individuals (including
a supposed veteran of the Spanish
Civil War) walked back and forth
before the gates.
About twenty longshoremen
had come in a bus. One explained
that he was there, even if he for
feited $30 a day in pay, because
"we've all got the same cause.
Labor and the students are in the
same struggle. They're all against
the system." He said that he had
been arrested earlier at S.F. State.
"The days of laying down and
singing 'We Shall Overcome' and
having a big dog bite you in the
ass—these says are gone." He ex
pected a violent fast change.
"We're going to use the same tac
tics the United States uses in Viet
nam—only we talk and then
murder."
He was optimistic though.

"Things are going to get better no
matter what the system says." He
thought people would soon realize
that the whole economic system of
the country was wrong. A dicta
torship of the proletariat was his
goal.
He commented, "You have to
get people to work for their own
pride and not because someone's
waving a pay check in front of his
nose. Who wants to go to college
in order to make a better
napalm?"
Teachers from S.F. State
echoed his feelings on students'
and workers' uniting. One said
that 100 Longshoremen had
picketed with them recently.
A woman from the Amalga
mated Clothing Workers praised
students for being the "vanguard
of the movement today to make
great changes in our society."
Yet occasionally people's out
ward confidence weakened and
they talked about the risks they
were taking. One young girl
laughed nervously as she spoke of
having spent two months in jail.
"Well if you expect cloth napkins
or salt with your dinner," it can
be awful, she admitted. She then
got out of the V.W. bus and
joined the strikers.
"Yet this ideal seems very re
mote from the real world of many
young blacks, Mexican-Americans,

American Indians and poor
whites. 'Do you really mean what
you say?', they ask. Our response
will provide a litmus test for
democracy . . .

the management's and union's
points of view. However it was

nied), most people conceded that
it was a quiet morning. There
were only a few scuffles with
workers who crossed picket lines
to go into the plant.

Yet the mood was not truly
peaceful; there was too much ten
sion to feel at ease. Police adjust
ing their gas masks or checking
their guns is not a reassuring sight.
Neither is seeing police dogs snarl
ing in the backs of station wagons.
The police were very willing to
talk, if they were approached
courteously. When asked if there
had been any violence, one ser
geant pointed to the pickets and
replied, "No, just a bunch of fools
walking across the street."
Another officer was coopera
tive in explaining about tactics the
force uses. Tear gas he said would
be used when a lieutenant ordered
it. He thought that circumstances
warranting tear gas would be if
strikers really began beating
people crossing their lines or if
they tried to storm the gates.
Displaying the small aerosol can
on his belt, he said that mace
would be used in case an indi
vidual, and not a mob, was in
volved. Mace can be shot from a
distance of 20 feet he stated.
It was much more difficult to
talk with workers who crossed the
picket lines. Separated from the
jeering picketeers by police armed
with clubs, they walked resolute
ly. When approached, they tended
to be tight-lipped and to walk asfast
as possible. One man in a business
suit wondered how many students

were there from Stanford, and
then commented that it did not
bother him at all to break through
the line. Other attempts to inter
view workers going to their jobs
were futile.
On the picket line people were
more open for discussion. They
were anxious to present their
views.
One striker said that he had
been an employee since 1948. He
strongly supported the Union's
demand for a 72c wage increse
and added that if the Union gave
in "just lc an hour, we've lost the
damn fight." ♦
He hesitated before expressing
his feeling toward people he knew
who had stayed at their jobs and
crossed the lines. He finally said
he felt "damn bad." "If I were to
cross the picket, I think my wife
would leave me," he said. He ex
plained that he had come from a
mining family in Illinois that had
believed in unions, but that his
wife was not even from a union
family.
He guessed that the reasons so
many oil workers had not gone on
strike is because they were scared
of losing their jobs, they were
short of money, or their wives
were pressuring them. Most are
not that much in need of money
that they must stay at their jobs,
he said bitterly.

He believed that students were
as involved as the strikers in the
question of equal rights and big
business. Between 50 and 70 per
cent of the strikers would actively
participate in a student strike he
estimated. His union has already
voted 2:1 to support striking stu
dents at S.F. State.
Members of the Oil, Chemical
and Atomic Workers Union were
not alone on the picket lines.
Longshoremen, members of the
AFT, students, a member of the
Amalgamated Clothing Workers,
and various individuals (including
a supposed veteran of the Spanish
Civil War) walked back and forth
before the gates.
About twenty longshoremen
had come in a bus. One explained
that he was there, even if he for
feited $30 a day in pay, because
"we've all got the same cause.
Labor and the students are in the
same struggle. They're all against
the system." He said that he had
been arrested earlier at S.F. State.
"The days of laying down and
singing 'We Shall Overcome' and
having a big dog bite you in the
ass—these says are gone." He ex
pected a violent fast change.
"We're going to use the same tac
tics the United States uses in Viet
nam—only we talk and then
murder."
He was optimistic though.

"Things are going to get better no
matter what the system says." He
thought people would soon realize
that the whole economic system of
the country was wrong. A dicta
torship of the proletariat was his
goal.
He commented, "You have to
get people to work for their own
pride and not because someone's
waving a pay check in front of his
nose. Who wants to go to college
in order to make a better
napalm?"
Teachers from S.F. State
echoed his feelings on students'
and workers' uniting. One said
that 100 Longshoremen had
picketed with them recently.
A woman from the Amalga
mated Clothing Workers praised
students for being the "vanguard
of the movement today to make
great changes in our society."
Yet occasionally people's out
ward confidence weakened and
they talked about the risks they
were taking. One young girl
laughed nervously as she spoke of
having spent two months in jail.
"Well if you expect cloth napkins
or salt with your dinner," it can
be awful, she admitted. She then
got out of the V.W. bus and
joined the strikers.
"Yet this ideal seems very re
mote from the real world of many
young blacks, Mexican-Americans,

American Indians and poor
whites. 'Do you really mean what
you say?', they ask. Our response
will provide a litmus test for
democracy . . .
Author's Note: In going to the
strike I sincerely hoped to present
a fair view of the strike from both
the management's and union's
points of view. However it was
impossible to interview anyone
representing the management's
perspective. Therefore this article
does not pretend to be objective,
but rather to present the views of
the strikers and some of their sup
porters and to convey the atmos
phere on one side of the picket
line.
It was a gray Wednesday morn
ing on Castro Street outside of the
Richmond Standard Oil Refinery.
Striking members of the Oil,
Chemical and Atomic Workers
Union manned picket lines at all
the entrances.
Despite the changing rumor
that the police had broken a lead
