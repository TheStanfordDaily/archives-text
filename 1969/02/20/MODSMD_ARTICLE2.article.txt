## Marcuse Appointment Hit 
### 
SACRAMENTO (AP)-Three Repub
lican legislators said Wednesday the Uni
versity of California regents should not
rehire Herbert Marcuse, controversial
philosophy professor at UC San Diego.
Assemblyman E. Richard Barnes of
San Diego and Sen. James E. Whetmore
of La Habra said they had sent tele
grams to regent's Chairman DeWitt A.
Higgs of San Diego protesting the reap
pointment of Marcuse for another year.
Whetmore called Marcuses's appoint
ment "utterly absurd." Barnes called it
"absolutely unacceptable."
Assemblyman John Stull, R-
Leucadia, said Marcuse "has been issu
ing a call to arms to students to engage
in guerilla warfare and sabotage as steps
toward a left-wing dictatorship."
Chancellor William McGill of the San
Diego campus made the decision to
grant a continued appointment on a

one-year basis to Marcuse, 71. Manda
tory retirement age for UC faculty is 67.
McGill also had the option to rehire
Marcuse for a longer period.
Last fall Marcuse said in an interview,
"I have not pursued any militant politi
cal activity for a long time."
He also said, "The Russians consider
me an agent of Wall Street. There must
be something good about me if I'm
equally condemned by both sides."
•UC Riverside Vote
RIVERSIDE (AP)—Students at the
University of California at Riverside
voted Wednesday to pay $4.50 annually
to provide tutoring for special students
from minority races.
The vote was 1,073 to 364 with half
of those eligible voting the largest turn
out in campus history.

The tutoring will be given students
whose past academic records are below
college standards because of disadvan
taged backgrounds, but who show po
tential for competing with students with
richer backgrounds, Chancellor Ivan
Hinderaker said.
• Trustees A t tacked
SACRAMENTO (AP)-A Democratic
senator caustically proposed Wednesday
that state colleges be run largely by
local governing boards because the chan
cellor and trustees "have failed in their
duty."
Sen. James Q. Wedworth, D-
Hawthorne, introduced a bill that would
set up five-member, locally elected
board of trustees for each of the 19
campuses. The college system now is
run by a single board of trustees, ap
pointed by the governor.
Wedworth spent several weeks late
last year on the embattled San Fran
cisco State College campus. But he said
Wednesday that trustees and Chancellor
Glenn S. Dumke "have failed all over
the state."
"The whole thing has fallen down
around their necks," he said.
Another state college proposal intro
duced in the legislature was a bill be
Sen. John G. Schmitz, R-Tustin, to
eliminate mandatory student body fees
and a measure by Sen. Howard Way,
R-Exeter, to move the college system's
headquarters from Los Angeles to Sacra
mento.
Schmitz said his measure "would re
move the authorization now given to
the state colleges to compel students to
furnish financial support for student
organizations . . .which may directly
threaten them with bodily harm."
