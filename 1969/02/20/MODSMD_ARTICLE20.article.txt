# Pitzer: Trust In Education Low
## 
### 
In the past five years, public
confidence in higher education
has been severely shaken, especial
ly in California, President
Kenneth S. Pitzer told the San
Francisco Rotary Club Tuesday.
"We have moved from a climate
of uncritical acclaim to one of

profound pessimism," he de
clared.
While "no one can expect an
overnight transformation in these
attitudes," Pitzer added, changes
now occurring in colleges offer
grounds for long-run optimism.
The current reappraisal of high
er education "has been and will be
agonizing," he noted, but "its re
sults can be extremely reward
ing... .
"The main result might well be
to put concern for the develop
ment of individual students back
to the center of education, where
it belongs.
"This concern has not vanished
from our colleges, but in an era of
scholarly research and other pres
tigious pursuits, it has tended to
become a minority viewpoint on
many leading college
campuses ....
"Putting the student back at

the center of our educational con
cerns is neither easy nor cheap.
Realization of this goal, both at
Stanford and elsewhere, will re
quire unprecedented levels of pub
lic understanding and financial
support.
"It will require that colleges
look at themselves in a way that
they have long looked at other
social institutions—as a focal point
for rational study, reasoned de
bate, and major reform.
"And finally it will require
clear consensus among men of
good will that the control of
changes be kept within normal,
democratic processes, and not
abandoned by default or pressure
to extremists of any stripe."
Pitzer noted that the public
"bewilderment and anger" which
the Free Speech Movement pre
cipitated in 1964 "somewhat re
sembled the criticism which en
gulfed our high schools after

Russia launched Sputnik.
"More than 10 years have
elasped since Sputnik. Few today
would question that our high
schools were strengthened by that
controversy."
During the half century which
preceded FSM, he noted, more
than half the students who en
tered four-year colleges never
graduated.
"The main cause for this start
ling drop-out rate—contrary to
popular belief—was not low grades
or lack of funds for the individual
student. It was, and is, lack of
motivation.
"By defining all drop-outs as
failures, both the public and the
professors postponed re
examination and criticism of our
educational system."
Pitzer noted that more than
200 students, faculty, and staff
members have just completed a
two-year Study of Education at
Stanford, a university-wide reform
effort.
"No one in higher education
today can afford to be com
placent, either about our progress
or our prospects," Pitzer said.
"America's commitment to
1 broadly based higher educational
opportunities for its youth is one
! of the truly revolutionary forces
sweeping the world today. In
Britain, France, Russia, as well as
, less developed countries, major ef
'■ forts at education reform are
being patterned after the Ameri
can example of a comprehensive
and pluralistic college system.
"And nowhere in America is
this commitment more apparent
| than in the West. In California
today, more than four out of five
[ high school graduates continue
their education in college. Within
a decade or two, the commitment
to at least 14 years of universal
public education may quietly be
come a reality in this state.
