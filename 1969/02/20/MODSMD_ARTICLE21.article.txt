WASHINGTON (AP)-The
Nixon administration, under prod
ding by senators investigating
hunger in the nation has acted to
relieve the severe malnutrition af
flicting two rural Southern
counties.
Agriculture Secretary Clifford
Hardin agreed to make free food
available to the two South Caro
lina counties by providing food
stamps to eligible citizens at no
cost.
Hardin agreed to allow the free
stamps, subject to state and local
approval, in a meeting Wednesday
with Sen. George S. McGovern,
D-S.D., chairman of the Select
Committee on Nutrition and
Human Needs, and Ernest F.
Hollings, D-S.C.
McGovern, who originally
urged the administration to send
surplus food directly to Beaufort
and Jasper counties, said the
stamp plan "will be a pilot pro
gram that will give us some oper
ating experience" in meeting
hunger problems.
Hollings, who Tuesday said
federal red tape was standing in
the way of feeding the hungry in
his state, also indicated he was
satisfied with the quick action.
