# Arjay Miller: Business Solving Social Problems; Still Needs Federal Help
## 
### 
Business is doing much to help
solve the nation's social problems,
but could do even more with
added encouragement from the
government, believes Arjay Miller,
new dean of the Graduate School
i of Business.
Miller told a Stanford business
| conference luncheon meeting at
; the Fairmont Hotel that the
attack on social problems calls for
a two-fold response by business —
first to do "everything we can
I within the present framework of

national policy," and second to
"participate in and support realis
tic changes in law that will en
courage still greater private effort
toward public goals."
Miller said incentives are
needed "that are adequate to
attract the participation of great
numbers of businesses, large and
small, in the drive toward social
improvement."
"Our task" he asserted, "is to
make clear the need for incentives
that will 'turn on' the full re
sources of the private sector in
meeting demands of our society
which, for one reason or another,
are not met by traditional market
mechanisms. Properly structured,
the profit incentive can be a
powerful tool for meeting con
sumer wants and for directing pri
vate efforts toward meeting es
tablished social goals ....
"The common objective of
both business and government
should be to provide the incen
tives necessary to offset the added
business costs of meeting public
goals, at the same time guarding
against windfall profits."
Miller said the major role of
business is to provide jobs, and
that this is where the greatest re
sponse is being made. But, he
added, business also "can and
should do much more to help pro
vide adequate low-cost housing

for the urban poor."
"Continuing failure to make a
breakthrough in this significant
area makes it clear that traditional
approaches to the problem are
simply not enough," he said.
"Large companies and financial
institutions have an obvious stake
in the rehabilitation of urban
slums, and they can provide the
leverage that is needed."
The new dean said the best ef
forts oi both the private and pub
lic sectors are needed to cope with
today's problems.
"Much more can be done than
we are now doing," he said, "but
it is no more reasonable to expect
business to do everything than it
is to expect government to do
everything.
"In effect, we must make clear
the present conditions under
which business now operates, so
that people will not expect more
than we can deliver. If it should
then be decided that business
must expand its efforts, as I be
lieve it must, it will be necessary
to change some of the ground
rules. Just as the corporation must
re-examine its traditional role and
adjust to new concepts and prac
tices, so there must be a willing
ness by government to encourage
and support a broader and more
direct business attack on social
problems."

Mr. Miller said the country's
principal goals "can be grouped in
four areas roughly delineating the
kind of action required to meet
them":
1. Problems or programs best
handled by business alone. These
include employment of those who
can meet minimum work stand
ards without special social or re
habilitative training, and pro
motion of economic growth
through more efficient pro
duction.
2. Programs in which govern
ment's role should be limited to
establishing objectives or stand
ards that industry would be re
quired to meet within a given
time. "Once the standards have
been established and assuming
they are reasonable, industry
should be free to exercise its own
initiative and ingenuity in reach
ing the target."
3. Activities requiring govern
ment aid to business to help it do
a particular job more efficiently.
Examples are special training for
"unemployables" and new ap
proaches to low-cost housing.
4. Tasks (hat are primarily the
responsibility of government, such
as administration of justice, law
enforcement, national defense and
space exploration.

first to do "everything we can
I within the present framework of

national policy," and second to
"participate in and support realis
tic changes in law that will en
courage still greater private effort
toward public goals."
Miller said incentives are
needed "that are adequate to
attract the participation of great
numbers of businesses, large and
small, in the drive toward social
improvement."
"Our task" he asserted, "is to
make clear the need for incentives
that will 'turn on' the full re
sources of the private sector in
meeting demands of our society
which, for one reason or another,
are not met by traditional market
mechanisms. Properly structured,
the profit incentive can be a
powerful tool for meeting con
sumer wants and for directing pri
vate efforts toward meeting es
tablished social goals ....
"The common objective of
both business and government
should be to provide the incen
tives necessary to offset the added
business costs of meeting public
goals, at the same time guarding
against windfall profits."
Miller said the major role of
business is to provide jobs, and
that this is where the greatest re
sponse is being made. But, he
added, business also "can and
should do much more to help pro
vide adequate low-cost housing

for the urban poor."
"Continuing failure to make a
breakthrough in this significant
area makes it clear that traditional
approaches to the problem are
simply not enough," he said.
"Large companies and financial
institutions have an obvious stake
in the rehabilitation of urban
slums, and they can provide the
leverage that is needed."
The new dean said the best ef
forts oi both the private and pub
lic sectors are needed to cope with
today's problems.
"Much more can be done than
we are now doing," he said, "but
it is no more reasonable to expect
business to do everything than it
is to expect government to do
everything.
"In effect, we must make clear
the present conditions under
which business now operates, so
that people will not expect more
than we can deliver. If it should
then be decided that business
must expand its efforts, as I be
lieve it must, it will be necessary
to change some of the ground
rules. Just as the corporation must
re-examine its traditional role and
adjust to new concepts and prac
tices, so there must be a willing
ness by government to encourage
and support a broader and more
direct business attack on social
problems."

Mr. Miller said the country's
principal goals "can be grouped in
four areas roughly delineating the
kind of action required to meet
them":
1. Problems or programs best
handled by business alone. These
include employment of those who
can meet minimum work stand
ards without special social or re
habilitative training, and pro
motion of economic growth
through more efficient pro
duction.
2. Programs in which govern
ment's role should be limited to
establishing objectives or stand
ards that industry would be re
quired to meet within a given
time. "Once the standards have
been established and assuming
they are reasonable, industry
should be free to exercise its own
initiative and ingenuity in reach
ing the target."
3. Activities requiring govern
ment aid to business to help it do
a particular job more efficiently.
Examples are special training for
"unemployables" and new ap
proaches to low-cost housing.
4. Tasks (hat are primarily the
responsibility of government, such
as administration of justice, law
enforcement, national defense and
space exploration.
Business is doing much to help
solve the nation's social problems,
but could do even more with
added encouragement from the
government, believes Arjay Miller,
new dean of the Graduate School
i of Business.
Miller told a Stanford business
| conference luncheon meeting at
; the Fairmont Hotel that the
attack on social problems calls for
a two-fold response by business —
first to do "everything we can

national policy," and second to
"participate in and support realis
tic changes in law that will en
courage still greater private effort
toward public goals."
