The Stanford Debate Union
will host over 100 high school de
baters from 14 states on the cam
pus tomorrow and Saturday.
Participating in the 28th An
nual Stanford High School Debate
and Speech Tournament, the de
baters will be arguing whether or
not "the federal government
should establish a system of com
pulsory service by all citizens."
The tournament is sponsored as
a service project by the Stanford
debaters. Approximately 300

Stanford students, both graduates
and undergraduates, will be
judging the debates with several
members of the faculty.
Stanford judges will be writing
extensive critiques of the debates.
The criticisms are aimed at dis
cussing both the teams' strengths
and weaknesses in an effort to
guide them toward improved de
bate techniques.
The Stanford High School
Tournament is exceeded only by
the National High School Tourn
ament in its strength and broad

representation. Stanford will be
hosting top debaters and speakers
from Louisiana, Tennessee, Okla
homa, Missouri, Texas, Pennsyl
vania, and Hawaii, as well as those
from nearby Western states.
Three speech events will be
held in conjunction with the de
bate rounds.
Impromptu speaking will re
quire the students to react to an
editorial comment regarding inter
national affairs.
Each contestant will have one
minute after reading the comment
to organize his toughts. Giving a
five minute speech, he must ad
vance a definite opinion on the
editorial. Judges will then have a
minute to question each speaker.
Students entered in the ex
temporaneous speaking event will
select three speech topics at ran
dom from a list which includes
national and international affairs,
along with news personalities and
their effects on contemporary
events.
With thirty minutes to prepare,
the entrant will organize
and present a seven minute speech.
The final event, oratory, allows
the contestant to prepare, in ad
