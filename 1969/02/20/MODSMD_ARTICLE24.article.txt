# New Art Building Displays Henry Moore Work
## 
### KIM THORBURN 
A major piece of sculpture by
Henry Moore is a featured work in
the recently opened Art Building.
Large Torso: Arch will be at
Stanford on extended loan from
Nathan Cummings, donor of the
new art building. The bronze
sculpture is one of several casts of
the same work. Other casts are
displayed at a private collection in
Switzerland, at the Museum of
Modern Art in New York, and at
the artist's home.
The work is six feet, four
inches tall; four feet deep; and
four feet, seven inches wide. It
will stand on a three inch cement
slab on a dirt mound at the inter
section of the four paths in front
of the library of the new building.
Moore chose the location.
Human Body
Art history professor Albert
Elsen says,"The title of the work
reflects Mr. Moore's multiple as
sociations of the sculpture's forms
with the human body: the pelvic
arch, the curve of the shoulders
and arms when a figure leans for
ward and stretches downward
towards the earth." Henry Moore
has "developed an art that denies
resemblance to the external ap
pearance of the human body" but
seeks shapes "for metaphorizing
the human form."
Moore works "not from ab
straction, but with ideas derived
from nature. Stanford's new
sculpture conjures associations
with natural rocky apertures,
ancient manmade gateways, the

entrance to the human body it
sell."
Large Torso: Arch was original
ly chiselled and chipped in clay. It
was then cut into pieces and
shipped to Noak Foundrey in
West Berlin where a mold was
made and it was cast in bronze
under Moore's supervision. The
Stanford sculpture will arrive in
April or May.
Elsen and his colleague Lornez
Eitner found Large Torso: Arch
and discussed the possibility of
bringing it to Stanford with
Cummings. Both men are mem
bers of the Subcommittee on Out
doors Campus Sculpture.
Sculpture on Campus
This committee, formed last
year, is chaired by Associate Pro
fessor of Art Nathan Oliveira.
"The group is a vehicle to bring
important pieces of sculpture to
the campus," says Oliveira. Con
sisting mainly of art and archi
tecture professors, the committee
provides professional judgment of
art works and motivates interest
among collectors outside the Uni
versity to bring works to campus.
"It is hoped that we will even
tually bring five major sculptures
to Stanford. These will be the
finest examples of contemporary
and traditional works," he con
tinues. Mr. and Mrs. H. Anderson
of Atherton may loan a stainless
steel sculpture by David Smith to
be placed in front of the art build
ing. Smith, who is now dead, is
one of the greatest contemporary
American sculptors.

Nathan Cummings, donor of the
new art building. The bronze
sculpture is one of several casts of
the same work. Other casts are
displayed at a private collection in
Switzerland, at the Museum of
Modern Art in New York, and at
the artist's home.
The work is six feet, four
inches tall; four feet deep; and
four feet, seven inches wide. It
will stand on a three inch cement
slab on a dirt mound at the inter
section of the four paths in front
of the library of the new building.
Moore chose the location.
Human Body
Art history professor Albert
Elsen says,"The title of the work
reflects Mr. Moore's multiple as
sociations of the sculpture's forms
with the human body: the pelvic
arch, the curve of the shoulders
and arms when a figure leans for
ward and stretches downward
towards the earth." Henry Moore
has "developed an art that denies
resemblance to the external ap
pearance of the human body" but
seeks shapes "for metaphorizing
the human form."
Moore works "not from ab
straction, but with ideas derived
from nature. Stanford's new
sculpture conjures associations
with natural rocky apertures,
ancient manmade gateways, the

entrance to the human body it
sell."
Large Torso: Arch was original
ly chiselled and chipped in clay. It
was then cut into pieces and
shipped to Noak Foundrey in
West Berlin where a mold was
made and it was cast in bronze
under Moore's supervision. The
Stanford sculpture will arrive in
April or May.
Elsen and his colleague Lornez
Eitner found Large Torso: Arch
and discussed the possibility of
bringing it to Stanford with
Cummings. Both men are mem
bers of the Subcommittee on Out
doors Campus Sculpture.
Sculpture on Campus
This committee, formed last
year, is chaired by Associate Pro
fessor of Art Nathan Oliveira.
"The group is a vehicle to bring
important pieces of sculpture to
the campus," says Oliveira. Con
sisting mainly of art and archi
tecture professors, the committee
provides professional judgment of
art works and motivates interest
among collectors outside the Uni
versity to bring works to campus.
"It is hoped that we will even
tually bring five major sculptures
to Stanford. These will be the
finest examples of contemporary
and traditional works," he con
tinues. Mr. and Mrs. H. Anderson
of Atherton may loan a stainless
steel sculpture by David Smith to
be placed in front of the art build
ing. Smith, who is now dead, is
one of the greatest contemporary
American sculptors.


"The Large Torso: Arch," displayed in the new campus Art Building, is on loan
