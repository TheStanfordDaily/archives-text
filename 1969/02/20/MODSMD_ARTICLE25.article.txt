The Stanford debate team dis
played unequalled depth at a
tournament held last weekend at
Cal Tech.
Four of its five teams survived
the preliminary debate rounds and
advanced to the octa-finals.
Only two other schools were
able to qualify more than one
team for the elimination rounds:
UCLA with two teams and USC
with two teams.
The Stanford team of Bob
Cory-Ron Oster advanced to the
final round of the tournament to
meet the University of Arizona.
In a close debate, with Cory
and Oster upholding the negative
arguments on a reduction of exe
cutive power in foreign policy de
cisions, the University of Arizona
received the decision.
Having received a $5000 loan
from the student legislature
(LASSU), the debate team will be
gin its new two-step program for
the remainder of the year.
Beginning next weekend Stan
ford debate teams will travel to
tournaments and also speak to
alumni groups in an attempt to
establish their endowment fund
and become financially indepen
dent from LASSU.
