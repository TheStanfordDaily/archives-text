# SDS: Make Trial Trustee Teach-in
## 
### 
Students for a Democratic
Society (SDS) met Monday to dis
cuss the motivational hearing
scheduled Friday for which they
plan a "teach-in" for the trustees.
Invitations were sent out but con
siderable doubt was expressed as
to what the response will be. They
set up a tentative outline of the
topics which will be discussed,
which includes:
•Wealth and Power: The exis
tence of a "ruling class" with
authority and control over insti
tutions
•The University in Local Af
fairs: land use, employment, role
in S.F. State Strike
• University and the Student:
powerlessness, submissiveness,
•University as a Channeling In
stitution in Society: students pre
pared for their roles as corporate
capitalists

•Stanford in S.E. Asia: 5.R.1.,
A.E.L.
•Confrontation and the Funda
mental Standard
It was also announced at the
meeting that the Standard Oil
laborers' union at Richmond
voted 2 to 1 in favor of support
ing the S.F. State Strike. SDS
took this as indication that labor
is beginning to understand and
support their demands.
There was discussion on the
need for more people—perhaps a
coalition with the liberals who in
the past have agreed with their
demands but not their tactics, but
members said they still want to
hold the reins.
The final comment for the
evening and the high point was
when the movement was made
that SDS "shit or get off the pot."
