# Fascist Group Formed?
## 
### 
A new conservative group
called the "'Fascist Liberation
Party" has surfaced on campus,
claiming that the newly-formed
Community of the Right is too
conservative.
The new group supports the
Community's recommendations,
but also makes a number of "sug
gestions" of their own. First, "in
order to counterbalance the vast
preponderance of Socialists, Com
munists, Anarchists, and Liberals
on the staff of the Hoover Insti
tute and in the Humanities and
Sciences faculty, the University

should pursue an active program
of recruitment of Fascists-In-
Exile, both in the United States
and Argentina."
Secondly, "All male students
should be required to enroll in
ROTC as a demonstration of their
loyalty to their country."
Finally, "Any student who dis
rupts any Administration Func
tion of the University or any
Legally Constituted Student Meet
ing should be expelled within 24
hours."
There was much speculation
yesterday that the organization
was strictly not-for-real.
