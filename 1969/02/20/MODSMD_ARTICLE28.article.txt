# Lecture Tonight On Linguistics Theory
## 
### 
Have you ever wondered what
you would do if you were sud
denly parachuted into a jungle
area, amidst people whose lan
guage you cannot speak, and who
have no alphabet, dictionary,
books, or teacher?
Tonight at 8:00 at the Physics
Tank, Room 100, Kenneth L.
Pike, Professor of Linguistics at
the University of Michigan (cur
rently here at the Center for Ad
vanced Study in the Behavioral
Sciences) will present his mono
lingual demonstration which il
lustrates for the layman one of
the most exciting developments in
linguistic theory and practice.
The Department of Linguistics
will choose a speaker (or "infor
mant") of some language not
known to Pike. They will tell
Pike neither the name of the lan
guage nor the part of the world in
which it is spoken.
Since there are over 3,000 lan

guages in Asia, Africa and the is
lands of the Pacific to choose
from, and the department guar
antees that the choice is kept
from Pike, he can have no way of
preparing in advance for the dem
onstration.
He will not be allowed to use
any English—nor any other lan
guage known to the informant.
Pike will meet the informant for
the first time on the platform.
Then, without English, he must
try to show that in a short space
of time he can in fact begin to
learn the language.
Pike is President of the Summer
Institute of Linguistics, a private
Californian Corporation, studying
over 400 primitive languages in 18
countries. Various of his students
have had to learn their languages
this way, since most of them have
no alphabet, primers, dictionaries,
books, or teachers.
The public is invited.


LOOK \IA, NO ENGLlSH—Professor Pike attempts to learn, without using
English, the word for "three" in Cheyenne, an American Indian language of
Oklahoma. The "informant" is Mrs. Anna Hawk.
