# Movie Review
## Two Bombs, One Blast 
### BROOKE SHEARER 
"I have to read a lot of poems
which I don't like in order to
know which ones I do like," said
Dylan Thomas long and far ago.
The same applies to films today in
America, or at least, this is how I

rationalized my spending seven
and a half hours at the movies
recently.
During five of those seven and a
half hours I saw what may well be
the two worst films to be made
this year —"Candy" and "Three in

the Attic." Both are trash. Luck
ily, the evening was saved in the
final hours by a unpretentious
film called "Good-bye, Colum
bus."
Universal Studios destroyed the
novel Candy. It serves as a perfect
example of a Hollywood mas
sacre. What was once a riotous,
pornographic parody is now a
drawn out, banal collection of
smutty jokes.
The film opens with a series of
brilliant scenes, but from then on
it races downhill towards bore
dom, carrying its audience with it.
The first scene in the high school
gymnasium, featuring Richard
Burton, a la Normal Mailer in
flowing velvet and curls is superb.
The succeeding frames of Ringo
Starr, portraying a Mexican priest
disguised as a gardener to protect
his innocence, match the first for
satire and sex. After this you had
best go into the lounge and sleep
for thirty minutes.
The only liberating scene in the
movie is the final one. This is
precisely because it is the final
scene and because all of the stars
(Charles Aznavour, Sugar Ray
Robinson included) go out and
play.
"Three in the Attic," which
was originally and more appropri
ately titled "She Let Him Con
tinue," is the film version of
Archie and Veronica comic books
with Mademoiselle magazine as
the production consultant.
First, the plot: It is modern.
College cat spends the summer
with college chick, Yvette
Mimieux, but things change when
school begins. One fall night our
cat by chance falls upon a beauti
ful Negro nymphomaniac (Judy

Pace), who is even cooler and
hippier than he.
On the way to the Black's
apartment one evening his
Yamaha leads him to a long-haired
hippie Jewess (Maggie Thrett),
who greets him with, "Do you
think a person can be Jewish and
psychedelic at the same time?"
The i hippie paints his skin
with flowers, and he pretends that
he is a homosexual in order to
seduce her. Our hero now pro
ceeds to run from one dormitory
bed to another, amazing his frat
brothers at this small Vermont
college.
His three lovelies discover each
other and spurred on by love
soured Yvette Mimieux lock him
in the attic of their dorm and
smother him with their attentions.
He is saved from death by a
snoopy sorority sister and a pipe
smoking dean of women, who
takes him to the hospital. But the
Black beauty sneaks into the
hospital, says to our hero, "Get
your white ass in the car fast,"
and delivers him to the bus depot
in time to stop his love from
leaving.
The setting of this movie is as
hackneyed as the plot. Its scenes
are patterned after advertisements
from teenage magazines. We see
Yamaha, Clearasil and Prince
Matchabelli ads on the screen, and
we are treated to one lengthy seg
ment stolen from Elvira Madigan
as well as a number of "racy"
scenes taken from old Hells
Angels' flicks.
The final movie (and you are
subjected to them in the order in
which I saw them) is "Good-bye,
Columbus." It is worth waiting
for. Both technically and the
matically it is an innovative and
important production.
Briefly, the situation is similar
to that of the first two movies:
The heroine, a young Radcliffe
student named Brenda, meets and
sleeps with a sensitive, Jewish man
named Neal, who works in a
Bronx library. They spend the
summer together in her parents'
New York suburb and leave each
other the following Thanksgiving
after a quarrel.
The film stars a new, former
"Glamour" model as Brenda, but
her male counterpart, Neal (Rich
ard Benjamin), is a veteran Broad
way stage hand. These faces are
refreshing; similar to those of Dus
tin Hoffman and Catharine Ross,
their features are not "too"
pretty, nor do we attach earlier
roles to them.
Undoubtedly, this film will be
accused immediately and by many
as the sister film to "The
Graduate." In some respects this
is true (tone, time, place), but
"Good-bye, Columbus" is import
ant in its own right as it addresses
itself to the emancipated, inde
pendent female with images and
sounds which are realistic. Like
"The Graduate" this movie is set
in suburbia. "Good-bye, Colum
bus" does not depend on soap
box theatrics like those between
Mrs. Robinson and Elaine when
they discover that they share
lovers. It is rather like a
Chekhovian drama in that its po
tency lies in its absence of con
frontation.
Technically this film is master
ful. The photography is delicate
and original, turning a dive into
the pool into a poetic combin
ation of human form, sunlight and
spray. It is straightforward where
it has to be.


THE AMERICAN WAY—The guy on the left is Marshall llockett, a Stanford
senior. The fox on the right is his date. In fact, she is his "dream date," Sandy
Norris, who girl-watchers will isntantly recognize as the stewardess in those
American Airlines TV and magazine ads. Seems that Hockett won a charity
"Dream Date" contest in which the prize was a night on the town with any girl in
the world. So Hockett chose Sandy right out of the pages of Time magazine.
American has given full cooperation so far, and even invited Hockett to a press
conference in San Francisco where Sandy modeled American's new stewardess
uniform. Pending final management approval, American will fly her to San
Francisco for that dream date in the near future. The Incomparable LSJU
Marching Hand has enthusiastically volunteered to meet Sandy's plane with strains
of "Fly the American Way."

his innocence, match the first for
satire and sex. After this you had
best go into the lounge and sleep

The only liberating scene in the

precisely because it is the final

(Charles Aznavour, Sugar Ray

"Three in the Attic," which
was originally and more appropri
ately titled "She Let Him Con
tinue," is the film version of
Archie and Veronica comic books
with Mademoiselle magazine as
the production consultant.
First, the plot: It is modern.
College cat spends the summer
with college chick, Yvette
Mimieux, but things change when
school begins. One fall night our
cat by chance falls upon a beauti
ful Negro nymphomaniac (Judy

Pace), who is even cooler and
hippier than he.
On the way to the Black's
apartment one evening his
Yamaha leads him to a long-haired
hippie Jewess (Maggie Thrett),
who greets him with, "Do you
think a person can be Jewish and
psychedelic at the same time?"
The i hippie paints his skin
with flowers, and he pretends that
he is a homosexual in order to
seduce her. Our hero now pro
ceeds to run from one dormitory
bed to another, amazing his frat
brothers at this small Vermont
college.
His three lovelies discover each
other and spurred on by love
soured Yvette Mimieux lock him
in the attic of their dorm and
smother him with their attentions.
He is saved from death by a
snoopy sorority sister and a pipe
smoking dean of women, who
takes him to the hospital. But the
Black beauty sneaks into the
hospital, says to our hero, "Get
your white ass in the car fast,"
and delivers him to the bus depot
in time to stop his love from
leaving.
The setting of this movie is as
hackneyed as the plot. Its scenes
are patterned after advertisements
from teenage magazines. We see
Yamaha, Clearasil and Prince
Matchabelli ads on the screen, and
we are treated to one lengthy seg
ment stolen from Elvira Madigan
as well as a number of "racy"
scenes taken from old Hells
Angels' flicks.
The final movie (and you are
subjected to them in the order in
which I saw them) is "Good-bye,
Columbus." It is worth waiting
for. Both technically and the
matically it is an innovative and
important production.
Briefly, the situation is similar
to that of the first two movies:
The heroine, a young Radcliffe
student named Brenda, meets and
sleeps with a sensitive, Jewish man
named Neal, who works in a
Bronx library. They spend the
summer together in her parents'
New York suburb and leave each
other the following Thanksgiving
after a quarrel.
The film stars a new, former
"Glamour" model as Brenda, but
her male counterpart, Neal (Rich
ard Benjamin), is a veteran Broad
way stage hand. These faces are
refreshing; similar to those of Dus
tin Hoffman and Catharine Ross,
their features are not "too"
pretty, nor do we attach earlier
roles to them.
Undoubtedly, this film will be
accused immediately and by many
as the sister film to "The
Graduate." In some respects this
is true (tone, time, place), but
"Good-bye, Columbus" is import
ant in its own right as it addresses
itself to the emancipated, inde
pendent female with images and
sounds which are realistic. Like
"The Graduate" this movie is set
in suburbia. "Good-bye, Colum
bus" does not depend on soap
box theatrics like those between
Mrs. Robinson and Elaine when
they discover that they share
lovers. It is rather like a
Chekhovian drama in that its po
tency lies in its absence of con
frontation.
Technically this film is master
ful. The photography is delicate
and original, turning a dive into
the pool into a poetic combin
ation of human form, sunlight and
spray. It is straightforward where
it has to be.


THE AMERICAN WAY—The guy on the left is Marshall llockett, a Stanford
senior. The fox on the right is his date. In fact, she is his "dream date," Sandy
Norris, who girl-watchers will isntantly recognize as the stewardess in those
American Airlines TV and magazine ads. Seems that Hockett won a charity
"Dream Date" contest in which the prize was a night on the town with any girl in
the world. So Hockett chose Sandy right out of the pages of Time magazine.
American has given full cooperation so far, and even invited Hockett to a press
conference in San Francisco where Sandy modeled American's new stewardess
uniform. Pending final management approval, American will fly her to San
Francisco for that dream date in the near future. The Incomparable LSJU
Marching Hand has enthusiastically volunteered to meet Sandy's plane with strains
of "Fly the American Way."

Dylan Thomas long and far ago.
The same applies to films today in
America, or at least, this is how I

rationalized my spending seven

recently.
During five of those seven and a

the two worst films to be made
this year —"Candy" and "Three in

the Attic." Both are trash. Luck
ily, the evening was saved in the
final hours by a unpretentious
film called "Good-bye, Colum

Universal Studios destroyed the
novel Candy. It serves as a perfect

sacre. What was once a riotous,
pornographic parody is now a
drawn out, banal collection of
smutty jokes.
The film opens with a series of
brilliant scenes, but from then on
it races downhill towards bore

ceeds to run from one dormitory
bed to another, amazing his frat
brothers at this small Vermont
college.
His three lovelies discover each
other and spurred on by love
soured Yvette Mimieux lock him
in the attic of their dorm and
smother him with their attentions.
He is saved from death by a
snoopy sorority sister and a pipe
smoking dean of women, who
takes him to the hospital. But the
Black beauty sneaks into the
hospital, says to our hero, "Get
your white ass in the car fast,"
and delivers him to the bus depot
in time to stop his love from
leaving.
The setting of this movie is as
hackneyed as the plot. Its scenes
are patterned after advertisements
from teenage magazines. We see
Yamaha, Clearasil and Prince
Matchabelli ads on the screen, and
we are treated to one lengthy seg
ment stolen from Elvira Madigan
as well as a number of "racy"
scenes taken from old Hells
Angels' flicks.
The final movie (and you are
subjected to them in the order in
which I saw them) is "Good-bye,
Columbus." It is worth waiting
for. Both technically and the
matically it is an innovative and
important production.
Briefly, the situation is similar
to that of the first two movies:
The heroine, a young Radcliffe
student named Brenda, meets and
sleeps with a sensitive, Jewish man
named Neal, who works in a
Bronx library. They spend the
summer together in her parents'
New York suburb and leave each
other the following Thanksgiving
after a quarrel.
The film stars a new, former
"Glamour" model as Brenda, but
her male counterpart, Neal (Rich
ard Benjamin), is a veteran Broad
way stage hand. These faces are
refreshing; similar to those of Dus
tin Hoffman and Catharine Ross,
their features are not "too"
pretty, nor do we attach earlier
roles to them.
Undoubtedly, this film will be
accused immediately and by many
as the sister film to "The
Graduate." In some respects this
is true (tone, time, place), but
"Good-bye, Columbus" is import
ant in its own right as it addresses
itself to the emancipated, inde
pendent female with images and
sounds which are realistic. Like
"The Graduate" this movie is set
in suburbia. "Good-bye, Colum
bus" does not depend on soap
box theatrics like those between
Mrs. Robinson and Elaine when
they discover that they share
lovers. It is rather like a
Chekhovian drama in that its po
tency lies in its absence of con
frontation.
Technically this film is master
ful. The photography is delicate
and original, turning a dive into
the pool into a poetic combin
ation of human form, sunlight and
spray. It is straightforward where
it has to be.


THE AMERICAN WAY—The guy on the left is Marshall llockett, a Stanford
senior. The fox on the right is his date. In fact, she is his "dream date," Sandy
Norris, who girl-watchers will isntantly recognize as the stewardess in those
American Airlines TV and magazine ads. Seems that Hockett won a charity
"Dream Date" contest in which the prize was a night on the town with any girl in
the world. So Hockett chose Sandy right out of the pages of Time magazine.
American has given full cooperation so far, and even invited Hockett to a press
conference in San Francisco where Sandy modeled American's new stewardess
uniform. Pending final management approval, American will fly her to San
Francisco for that dream date in the near future. The Incomparable LSJU
Marching Hand has enthusiastically volunteered to meet Sandy's plane with strains
of "Fly the American Way."
"I have to read a lot of poems
which I don't like in order to
know which ones I do like," said
Dylan Thomas long and far ago.
The same applies to films today in
America, or at least, this is how I

rationalized my spending seven
and a half hours at the movies
recently.
During five of those seven and a
half hours I saw what may well be
the two worst films to be made
this year —"Candy" and "Three in

the Attic." Both are trash. Luck
ily, the evening was saved in the
final hours by a unpretentious
film called "Good-bye, Colum
bus."
Universal Studios destroyed the
novel Candy. It serves as a perfect
example of a Hollywood mas
sacre. What was once a riotous,
pornographic parody is now a
drawn out, banal collection of
smutty jokes.
The film opens with a series of
brilliant scenes, but from then on
it races downhill towards bore
dom, carrying its audience with it.
The first scene in the high school
gymnasium, featuring Richard
Burton, a la Normal Mailer in
flowing velvet and curls is superb.
The succeeding frames of Ringo
Starr, portraying a Mexican priest
disguised as a gardener to protect
his innocence, match the first for
satire and sex. After this you had
best go into the lounge and sleep
for thirty minutes.
The only liberating scene in the
movie is the final one. This is
precisely because it is the final
scene and because all of the stars
(Charles Aznavour, Sugar Ray
Robinson included) go out and
play.
"Three in the Attic," which
was originally and more appropri
ately titled "She Let Him Con
tinue," is the film version of
Archie and Veronica comic books
with Mademoiselle magazine as
the production consultant.
First, the plot: It is modern.
College cat spends the summer
with college chick, Yvette
Mimieux, but things change when
school begins. One fall night our
cat by chance falls upon a beauti
ful Negro nymphomaniac (Judy

Pace), who is even cooler and
hippier than he.
On the way to the Black's
apartment one evening his
Yamaha leads him to a long-haired
hippie Jewess (Maggie Thrett),
who greets him with, "Do you
think a person can be Jewish and
psychedelic at the same time?"
The i hippie paints his skin
with flowers, and he pretends that
he is a homosexual in order to
seduce her. Our hero now pro
ceeds to run from one dormitory
bed to another, amazing his frat
brothers at this small Vermont
college.
His three lovelies discover each
