# Graduate Education Called Disaster Area
## 
### ANN DENTON 
"Graduate education is sort of a dis
aster area," declared Barry Askinas,
head of the Graduate Students Associ
ation (GSA) and moderator at a panel
discussion on "The Problems and Pros
pects of Graduate Education in
America" last night.
The four other panelists agreed.
Virgil Whitaker, dean of the graduate
division, stated graduate level is the
"least effective area of education in the
university." Dr. Joseph Katz, executive
director of the Institute for the Study
of Human Problems, outlined the
numerous psychological problems faced
by the graduate.
Fellow panelist Herbert Packer, vice
provost and SES chairman, proclaimed,
"The only word aptly descriptive of the
life of graduate students is 'malaise'."
System Blasted
The fourth panelist, Richard Young,
TA in political science and AFT mem
ber, blasted the entire system. He
quoted from Dos Passos, "We are indeed
two different nations," meaning that
graduate students are not at all like
faculty or administration.
"What is really the root of the prob
lems of graduate education is the dispar
ate world views of students and their
professors . . . Graduates are acquiring a

speciality which is neither relevant nor
constructive for society's needs," Young
continued.
The panelists agreed on a number of
problems the graduate must face. One
of the most obvious is economic depri
vation, which, when coupled with the
tendency for early marriage, produces
great resentment.
Appeasement Policy
Another difficulty is the ever-present
necessity to appease professors. In order
to obtain a Ph.D. a graduate student
does not need intelligence, only "sensi
tivity" in how to play up to the profs.
Opportunism is the way to success at
the graduate level.
Young emphasized that graduates
have to do the teaching jobs the faculty
refuse. Often, therefore, TA's are the
only faculty students have personal con
tact with. This is the origin of the low
status accorded teaching.
Graduate students realize they are in
volved in a "disfunctional exercise"
when teaching because they learn very
little and have less time to study and do
research. Most graduates, therefore,
tend to look at teaching chores as an
evil which should be minimized. The
key to success becomes, at a very early
stage, primary research and playing up
to professors.
