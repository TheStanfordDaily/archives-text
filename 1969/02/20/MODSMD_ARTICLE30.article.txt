# Cards Face Yale In Swim Titanic
## 
### WELLS SHOEMAKER 
Stanford swimmers will have to
hang onto the mental and physical
peak that downed USC last week
to overcome Yale's fourth-ranked
Eli's Friday night in New Haven.
Stanford knocked off USC last
Saturday, 57-56, severing a
109-meet undefeated string that
spanned twelve years. Stanford
lost all four swimmers that took
firsts in last year's USC meet,
either to graduation or attrition,
but held off the deeper Trojans
with a powerful sophomore squad
and five senior veterans.
Some let-down must inevitably
follow the climax of such a vic
tory, but the Indians cannot af
ford anything short of top form
by the time Friday rolls around.
The whole Yale season keys on
the Stanford dual meet, the first
intersectional of its kind. The Eli's
have won 47 straight against East-
Coast competition.
The Indians can expect to find
a shaved, peaked, rabidly excited
collection of talented swimmers in
a pool packed with 3500 Eastern
supremacists.
Hulldogs Can Kite
Yale has essentially no weak
spots in the lineup, and shapes up

close to Stanford in depth. The
Hi's major hopes lie in:
—John Nelson, medalist dis
tance freestyler in two Olympics
—Robin Waples, Yale captain,
high school teammate of Stanford
captain Pete Siebert and a threat
in any sprint event
—Dave Johnson, NCAA finalist
in two individual medley events
—Ed Bettendorf and Chuck
Goettsche, Ail-American back
strokers
Phil Long, NCAA breast
stroke finalist
—Paul Katz and Mike Cadden,
sophomore butterflier and middle
distance freestyler
—Steve Job and Dean Kackley,
sprint freestylers.
An article in the Yale Daily
may help get the Indians inter
ested in the meet. The story
casually referred to the West coast
in general and Stanford in partic
ular as "an academic farce," an
"athletic factory, indeed an intel
lectual hinterland sprinkled with
basket weavers and professional
athletes."
A number of personal com
ments concerning Stanford coach
Jim Gaughran and several Stan
ford swimmers overstepped the
apology of misinformation.
At any rate, according to our
erudite informer, Yale produced
"the best damn swimming team in

the country" despite the rigors of
Ivy League education.
Stanford can bet that the Eli's
will be out to add to the ethereal
intellectual and educational exper
ience at Yale by tripping up the
team that beat USC in barbarian
conquest.
Columbus brought savages from
the West to King Ferdinand's
court, considered by King Ferd
the capital of the civilized world.
So indeed, Stanford swimmers
timorously venture to the seat of
American enlightenment.
Perhaps the Yalies will teach
the Indians to help themselves.
