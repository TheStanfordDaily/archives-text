CHAMPIONSHIPS
The intramural A basketball
championships begin play this week
end. Thirty-two teams are entered in
the championship tournament, with
the top two teams in each league
having qualified in seasonal play. The
top five seeds in the tourney are Kappa
Sigma, Kappa Alpha, Theta Delt, Serra,
and the Panthers. All five teams were
undefeated, but the Kappa Sigs were
playing in the toughest fraternity
league.
