The Department of Athletics
has recently opened a new ticket
selling facility. The new outlet is
located on Campus Drive on the
Maples Pavilion site. It is a uni
quely designed building and has,
by virtue of it's appearance, al
ready been assigned a "title" by
passersbyâ€”the "Pavilion Pagoda."
All advance ticket sales for
Athletic Department sponsored
events will be handled from this
conveniently located facility, in
cluding basketball and football.
This facility will replace the
ticket selling booth in the lobby
of the Department of Athletics
building.
