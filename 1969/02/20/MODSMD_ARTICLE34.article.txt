# Gerken, Van Dillen In Class Net Finals
## 
### 
A couple of mere youngsters,
Paul Gerken and Erik van Dillen,
powered their way into the Men's
Class A finals of the 65th annual
Class Singles Tennis Iburnament
at Golden Gate Park Sunday.
Gerken, a Stanford freshman
from East Norwalk, Conn., had
old-timers shaking their heads as
he defeated two veteran cham
pions, Tom Brown and Whitney
Reed, within a couple of hours to
make his advance.
Van Dillen, who will be 18 Fri
day, was just as impressive as he
blasted a pair of his elders, Bob
Murio and Rich Anderson, into
quick submission.
Gerken and Van Dillen thus set
the stage for next Saturday's final
and what a final it promises to be.
Consider Gerken's qualifi
cations first. He stepped onto the
court the first time yesterday to
meet Brown, a 9u l e:time finalist at

both Wimbledon and Forest Hills
and winner of this tournament in
1967. Brown took the first set
from the tall, blond Gerken but
that was all. Gerken then stormed
back to Lake the next two sets and
the match, 5-7, 6-3, 6-2.
An hour later he came back to
rout Reed, the number one seed
who, in 1961, was rated No. 1
nationally. Gerken subdued Reed,
6-3, 6-2.
Gerken and Van Dillen are no
strangers to each other. For one
thing, both were on the Junior
Davis Cup squad that trained at
Stanford last summer.
But Sunday's match, for the
Class title, will be something else
again with each out to grab the
first important title of the local
1969 season.
