# Airlines Split
## Youth Fare Threatened 
### LYNNE, McCALLISTER 
The Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB)
will soon consider a proposal that youth
fare on airlines be cancelled. The pro
posal was originated by several domestic
airlines and the Trailway Bus System,
and is based on the claim that giving
half-fare stand-by rates to people under
21 is "discriminatory" to those who are
older.
According to a Trans World Airlines
(TWA) official, the decision of CAB will
not go into affect for at least eight
months. In the meanwhile, the airlines
are split over the issue.
According to an official of United
Airlines, "Some airlines, including
United, asked that youth fare be can
celled." Besides believing that it is dis
criminatory to people over 21, United
also feels that stand-by is not generating
new business. Whether or not the can
cellation of youth fare will increase
profits is still a question, however.
It is possible, the United represen
tative said, that any young people
would pay full fare if stand-by were not
available. The airline also objects to the
"mass confusion" generated in airports

due to those who are waiting for empty
seats on flights.
Two-Thirds Fare Alternative
The United official said that CAB is
considering the alternative of instituting
a two-thirds fare with confirmed reser
vations for passengers from 12 to 22.
Several airlines, including National Air
lines, follow this plan already.
Among those who are against the can
cellation of youth fare is American Air
lines. According to one of their officials,
"American Airlines strongly favors the
continuance of youth fare. We believe
that it is good for the general public in
that it allows youth of limited funds to
fly, and that it is good for the airlines
because it introduces young people to
flying." American Airlines started youth
fares.
Pan American airlines has youth fare
only to Hawaii, and has not asked to
have it cancelled.
The cancellation of youth fare would
not extend to other cut-rate fares such
as the family plan. There is some ques
tion as to whether the Board will con
sider the youth fare unique in its dis
crimination. Separate decisions must be
made for each case, however.

The Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB),
which will make the final decision on
youth fares, has complete control over
the pricing policies of the airlines. It
must approve all fares proposed by the
airlines before they go into effect. It
sets up national air routes, and proposes
international routes to the President for
approval.
A proposal to make or change regu
lations is made by a CAB examiner,
appointed by the Board. In this case,
the examiner was appointed to investi
gate the airlines' complaints about
youth fare. He decided that they were
discriminatory. His proposal, goes be
fore the Board. If they do not act upon
it within 30 days, it becomes law.
Review of Youth Fare
CAB plans to review the issue of
youth fare, however. Parties to the case
will submit written briefs to the Board.
Afterwards, petitions can be made for
a reconsideration of the decision on the
grounds that all the evidence was not
presented. An American Airlines Of
ficial commented, however, that such a
petition was unlikely in this case be
cause CAB plans to make an extensive
investigation.

CAB plans to review the issue of
youth fare, however. Parties to the case
will submit written briefs to the Board.
Afterwards, petitions can be made for
a reconsideration of the decision on the
grounds that all the evidence was not
presented. An American Airlines Of
ficial commented, however, that such a
petition was unlikely in this case be
cause CAB plans to make an extensive
investigation.
The Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB)
will soon consider a proposal that youth
fare on airlines be cancelled. The pro
posal was originated by several domestic
airlines and the Trailway Bus System,
and is based on the claim that giving
half-fare stand-by rates to people under
21 is "discriminatory" to those who are
older.
According to a Trans World Airlines
(TWA) official, the decision of CAB will
not go into affect for at least eight
months. In the meanwhile, the airlines
are split over the issue.
According to an official of United
Airlines, "Some airlines, including
United, asked that youth fare be can
celled." Besides believing that it is dis
criminatory to people over 21, United
also feels that stand-by is not generating
new business. Whether or not the can
cellation of youth fare will increase
profits is still a question, however.
It is possible, the United represen
tative said, that any young people
would pay full fare if stand-by were not
available. The airline also objects to the
"mass confusion" generated in airports

due to those who are waiting for empty
seats on flights.
Two-Thirds Fare Alternative
The United official said that CAB is
considering the alternative of instituting
a two-thirds fare with confirmed reser
vations for passengers from 12 to 22.
Several airlines, including National Air
lines, follow this plan already.
Among those who are against the can
cellation of youth fare is American Air
lines. According to one of their officials,
"American Airlines strongly favors the
continuance of youth fare. We believe
that it is good for the general public in
that it allows youth of limited funds to
fly, and that it is good for the airlines
because it introduces young people to
flying." American Airlines started youth
fares.
Pan American airlines has youth fare
only to Hawaii, and has not asked to
have it cancelled.
The cancellation of youth fare would
not extend to other cut-rate fares such
as the family plan. There is some ques
tion as to whether the Board will con
sider the youth fare unique in its dis
crimination. Separate decisions must be
made for each case, however.

The Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB),
which will make the final decision on
youth fares, has complete control over
the pricing policies of the airlines. It
must approve all fares proposed by the
airlines before they go into effect. It
sets up national air routes, and proposes
international routes to the President for
approval.
A proposal to make or change regu
lations is made by a CAB examiner,
appointed by the Board. In this case,
the examiner was appointed to investi
gate the airlines' complaints about
youth fare. He decided that they were
discriminatory. His proposal, goes be
fore the Board. If they do not act upon
it within 30 days, it becomes law.
