# Motivational Hearings To Begin Tomorrow
## 
### 
Students accused of violating the
campus demonstration policy at last
month's Trustee meeting will have an
opportunity to explain their underlying
motivation at tomorrow's Student Judi
cial Council (SJC) hearings.
According to informal defense coun
selor, Doron Weinberg, "at these moti
vational hearings, the students will be
initially presenting a 'coherent picture'
of the political reasons which prompted
the actions of the group rather than
going through the specific reasons of
every individual."
A significant encounter, however, is
expected from one defendant who was
"radicalized" during his two-year term
of military service in Vietnam.
Weinberg stated that the student de
fendants want to emphasize "what it is
about the University, its place in the
community, and how it relates to the

rest of the world, that the group objects
to."
The students will also present their
belief that confrontations such as the
one during the Trustee meeting are
necessary, if this is to be the only possible
means by which to express important
views.
In order to implement their state
ment of objections, the students have
requested that eight Trustee members
attend the hearings.
"The students," explained Weinberg,
"wish to question the individual
Trustees about both their individual and
group connections with various Uni
versity policies."
As of Wednesday afternoon, Wein
berg was uncertain of the number of
Trustees that will actually appear at to
morrow's meeting.
The hearings will be held at 1 p.m. in
room 163-E of the Law School.
