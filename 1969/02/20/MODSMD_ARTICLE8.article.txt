# Fiery Braunstein Replies
## LASSU Speaker Under Attack 
### DAVID DAVENPORT 
Hampered by a flurry of criticisms,
and even a few attempted impeach
ments, LASSU Speaker Yale Braunstein
now considers it "a major accomplish
ment to get through a legislature meet
ing alive."
Armed with Robert's Rules of Order

and the ASSU By-Laws for his defense,
Braunstein does not intend to be quick
ly crushed by his critics.
As speaker of the student legislature,
Braunstein draws fire from many people
for his iron-fisted conduct of the meet
ings. Specifically his opponents object
to the fact that he will not always allow
appeals to the decisions he makes.
Such criticisms often enrage Yale at
the meetings, but in an interview with
the Daily, he was very subdued as he
discussed the issue.
Yale's Defense
He noted that as speaker of the legis
lature he is to apply Robert's Rules and
the By-Laws as carefully as possible. But
once he makes a decision which is clear
ly supported in either of his two
sources, the decision cannot be ap
pealed.
Yale lamented the lack of knowledge
of parliamentary procedure displayed
by many legislators. He concluded that
his critics either hadn't studied the pro
cedures and rules, or else just didn't
understand them.
But Yale's adversaries are not easily
deterred. Letters have been mailed to all
LASSU representatives explaining possi
ble means of removing Yale from office.
Impeachment Attempts
The author of the letter, represen
tative Jim Schnieder, claimed that a
motion to impeach Yale would give
both opponents and supporters of the
speaker a chance to voice their views.
When asked if he favored the im
peachment himself, Schnieder replied,
"No, I think he's done about all the
damage he can do this year. If we im
peached him I'm afraid he'd just be
made into a martyr, and nothing would
make me more ill than to see Braunstein
a martyr."
Potential martyr Braunstein, when
confronted with Schnieder's comment,

merely said, "Print it." He emphasized
that he would not prevent a motion to
impeach him from reaching the floor.
To the contrary he said he'd "put it at
the top of the agenda."
Braunstein Warning
However, Braunstein issued one warn
ing to his opponents. "The By-Laws
state that they must have just cause.
They'd better have just cause, that's all
I've got to say, they'd better have just
cause."
Defending his position Yale noted
that he shows no political prejudices in
his conduct of the meetings. "The
attacks are now from the left and right
together," he said. "That shows I'm
politically impartial."
Braunstein stressed that he attempts
to protect the rights of the minorities at
LASSU meetings. He claimed that his
critics "just don't understand that a
majority vote does not necesarily over
come all the rights of minorities."
Braunstein Aii Activist
In one of his more fiery moments he
stated, "If they're trying to abridge the
rights of the minorities or introduce dili
tory motions I'll rule them out of order.
I don't care if they're right, left,
centrist, commie, pinko, or fascist."
Braunstein emphasized the activist
role which characterizes this year's legis
lature and ASSU officers. Commenting
on the officers' views on student power
he remarked, "We're willing to go out
and take some." He was proud of the
ability of the ASSU officers to fill in
power gaps and give students a voice.
Even his critics don't deny that
Braunstein is one of the more excitable
and enthusiastic ASSU officers. "I go
out and scream, go out and talk and
discuss. We've all been screaming, dis
cussing, bringing up relevant comments
which is why we're being listened to.
Even if I'm impeached, I consider that

I've accomplished quite a lot," he con
cluded.
Administrative Hoax
Stemming from the officers' initiative
has been an increase in the role of
LASSU in Braunstein's opinion. The
legislature has been used to lend
credence to student demands, to give
them a louder voice, such as in the AFT
bargaining, the Coalition proposals, and
the BSU proposals.
Many LASSU critics have complained
throughout the year that LASSU is not
representative of the student body.
However, Braunstein vigorously denied
such accusations.
He noted that even the adminis
tration has suggested that LASSU isn't
representative. "That's a hoax," he
cried. "Their point really is that LASSU
has no power so they don't have to
listen. But we are representative of stu
dent views."

I don't care if they're right, left,
centrist, commie, pinko, or fascist."
Braunstein emphasized the activist
role which characterizes this year's legis
lature and ASSU officers. Commenting
on the officers' views on student power
he remarked, "We're willing to go out
and take some." He was proud of the
ability of the ASSU officers to fill in
power gaps and give students a voice.
Even his critics don't deny that
Braunstein is one of the more excitable
and enthusiastic ASSU officers. "I go
out and scream, go out and talk and
discuss. We've all been screaming, dis
cussing, bringing up relevant comments
which is why we're being listened to.
Even if I'm impeached, I consider that

I've accomplished quite a lot," he con
cluded.
Administrative Hoax
Stemming from the officers' initiative
has been an increase in the role of
LASSU in Braunstein's opinion. The
legislature has been used to lend
credence to student demands, to give
them a louder voice, such as in the AFT
bargaining, the Coalition proposals, and
the BSU proposals.
Many LASSU critics have complained
throughout the year that LASSU is not
representative of the student body.
However, Braunstein vigorously denied
such accusations.
He noted that even the adminis
tration has suggested that LASSU isn't
representative. "That's a hoax," he
cried. "Their point really is that LASSU
has no power so they don't have to
listen. But we are representative of stu
dent views."

YALE BRAUNSTKIN
Hampered by a flurry of criticisms,
and even a few attempted impeach
ments, LASSU Speaker Yale Braunstein
now considers it "a major accomplish
ment to get through a legislature meet
ing alive."
Armed with Robert's Rules of Order

and the ASSU By-Laws for his defense,
Braunstein does not intend to be quick
ly crushed by his critics.
As speaker of the student legislature,
Braunstein draws fire from many people
for his iron-fisted conduct of the meet
ings. Specifically his opponents object
to the fact that he will not always allow
appeals to the decisions he makes.
Such criticisms often enrage Yale at
the meetings, but in an interview with
the Daily, he was very subdued as he
discussed the issue.
Yale's Defense
He noted that as speaker of the legis
lature he is to apply Robert's Rules and
the By-Laws as carefully as possible. But
once he makes a decision which is clear
ly supported in either of his two
sources, the decision cannot be ap
pealed.
Yale lamented the lack of knowledge
of parliamentary procedure displayed
by many legislators. He concluded that
his critics either hadn't studied the pro
cedures and rules, or else just didn't
understand them.
But Yale's adversaries are not easily
deterred. Letters have been mailed to all
LASSU representatives explaining possi
ble means of removing Yale from office.
Impeachment Attempts
The author of the letter, represen
tative Jim Schnieder, claimed that a
motion to impeach Yale would give
both opponents and supporters of the
speaker a chance to voice their views.
When asked if he favored the im
peachment himself, Schnieder replied,
"No, I think he's done about all the
damage he can do this year. If we im
peached him I'm afraid he'd just be
made into a martyr, and nothing would
make me more ill than to see Braunstein
a martyr."
Potential martyr Braunstein, when
confronted with Schnieder's comment,

merely said, "Print it." He emphasized
that he would not prevent a motion to
impeach him from reaching the floor.
To the contrary he said he'd "put it at
the top of the agenda."
Braunstein Warning
However, Braunstein issued one warn
ing to his opponents. "The By-Laws
state that they must have just cause.
They'd better have just cause, that's all
I've got to say, they'd better have just
cause."
Defending his position Yale noted
that he shows no political prejudices in
his conduct of the meetings. "The
attacks are now from the left and right
together," he said. "That shows I'm
politically impartial."
Braunstein stressed that he attempts
to protect the rights of the minorities at
LASSU meetings. He claimed that his
critics "just don't understand that a
majority vote does not necesarily over
come all the rights of minorities."
Braunstein Aii Activist
In one of his more fiery moments he
stated, "If they're trying to abridge the
rights of the minorities or introduce dili
tory motions I'll rule them out of order.
I don't care if they're right, left,
centrist, commie, pinko, or fascist."

tative Jim Schnieder, claimed that a
motion to impeach Yale would give
both opponents and supporters of the
speaker a chance to voice their views.
When asked if he favored the im
peachment himself, Schnieder replied,
"No, I think he's done about all the
damage he can do this year. If we im
peached him I'm afraid he'd just be
made into a martyr, and nothing would
make me more ill than to see Braunstein
a martyr."
Potential martyr Braunstein, when
confronted with Schnieder's comment,

merely said, "Print it." He emphasized
that he would not prevent a motion to
impeach him from reaching the floor.
To the contrary he said he'd "put it at
the top of the agenda."
Braunstein Warning
However, Braunstein issued one warn
ing to his opponents. "The By-Laws
state that they must have just cause.
They'd better have just cause, that's all
I've got to say, they'd better have just
cause."
Defending his position Yale noted
that he shows no political prejudices in
his conduct of the meetings. "The
attacks are now from the left and right
together," he said. "That shows I'm
politically impartial."
Braunstein stressed that he attempts
to protect the rights of the minorities at
LASSU meetings. He claimed that his
critics "just don't understand that a
majority vote does not necesarily over
come all the rights of minorities."
Braunstein Aii Activist
In one of his more fiery moments he
stated, "If they're trying to abridge the
rights of the minorities or introduce dili
tory motions I'll rule them out of order.
I don't care if they're right, left,
centrist, commie, pinko, or fascist."
Braunstein emphasized the activist
role which characterizes this year's legis
lature and ASSU officers. Commenting
on the officers' views on student power
he remarked, "We're willing to go out
and take some." He was proud of the
ability of the ASSU officers to fill in
power gaps and give students a voice.
Even his critics don't deny that
Braunstein is one of the more excitable
and enthusiastic ASSU officers. "I go
out and scream, go out and talk and
discuss. We've all been screaming, dis
cussing, bringing up relevant comments
which is why we're being listened to.
Even if I'm impeached, I consider that

I've accomplished quite a lot," he con
cluded.
Administrative Hoax
Stemming from the officers' initiative
has been an increase in the role of
LASSU in Braunstein's opinion. The
legislature has been used to lend
credence to student demands, to give
them a louder voice, such as in the AFT
bargaining, the Coalition proposals, and
the BSU proposals.
Many LASSU critics have complained
throughout the year that LASSU is not
representative of the student body.
However, Braunstein vigorously denied
such accusations.
He noted that even the adminis
tration has suggested that LASSU isn't
representative. "That's a hoax," he
cried. "Their point really is that LASSU
has no power so they don't have to
listen. But we are representative of stu
dent views."
