# Militant Blacks Raid Bookstore; Pitzer's Absence Causes Fury
## 
### MADELYNSPATT 
Student violence struck
Stanford yesterday afternoon, as
about 15 black demonstrators
rampaged through the campus
bookstore, breaking glass cases
and shelves and throwing
hundreds of books on the floor.
The incident was touched off
as black students, following a
three hour BSU demonstration,
left President Pitzer's office in
frustration after Pitzer no^
appear when anticipated by BSU
leaders.
No arrests have been made, nor
action taken against the persons

involved. The demonstration
broke up almost immediately
following the ransacking.
The damage to the bookstore in
estimated in excess of $1,000,
according to Professor Clifford
Weigle, who heads the board of
the store. The estimate includes
the business expected to be lost
by the forced closing of the store
yesterday. It is scheduled to
reopen on Monday.
A special session of the
FAcuity Senate has been called
for this afternoon at 3:15 to
discuss yesterday's events.
Pitzer Clarification
Late yesterday afternoon,

Pitzer called a news conference in
his office to explain the confusion
over the 2 p.m. meeting for which
he appeared 45 minutes late, and
to reveal what proposals had been
presented to the BSU that
morning (see story below; text of
University response to the 12
demands appears on page three).
At the conference Pitzer
stated, "It is clearly impossible to
continue discussion of substantive
issues until a more responsible
atmosphere exists."
The violent incident, in which
no participants have been
identified by name, apparently
resulted from a communication

gap between Pitzer and the
demonstrators. Pitzer twice
changed his mind about attending
the 2 p.m. meeting, changes
unknown to the demonstrators.
At the time of the incident, Pitzer
was in his car, en route to his
office to meet with the
demonstrators. Pitzer agreed to a
mid afternoon meeting following
a call by Assistant Provost James
Simmons who spoke with the
BSU leaders and persuaded them
to clear the President's office.
Build-Up
The bookstore incident
climaxed series of incidents
beginning with a noon
demonstration in White Plaza.
Before the demonstration, BSU
co-chairmen Nate Kirtman and
Leo Bazile met with Pitzer for
almost two hours to discuss the
BSU demands sent to the
administration February 4th. At
the same time as Kirtman and
Bazile were meeting in the
President's office, other BSU
members, along with minority
supports from the community,
held a closed meeting in
Dinkelspiel auditorium.
Provost Richard Lyman
explained "the morning's session
with BSU leaders was, "very
business like. We discussed very
practical and detailed questions
and there seemed to be agreement
on many points." Lyman reported
that the major items considered
were BSU demands concerning
financial aid.
According to Lyman, there was
apparently agreement that
admitting large numbers of black
students was less important than
insuring that those admitted
receive the best possible financial
help.

This includes University plans
to expand its information system
for incoming students to more
fully supply information on the
type of financial aid they will
receive and the expenses they will
face.
Lyman said, "We must give
students a complete packet of
information so they will know
that faces them upon arrival in
terms of income and work and
expenses. Experience proves that
many new students enter, receive
a large check, and don't realize
they will need all the money."
The Dinkelspiel meeting, as
well as the rally which followed,
were keynoted by discussion of
the fourth anniversary of the
assas'nation of black militant
leader Malcolm X.
Speeches by BSU members at
the rally, most notably Johnny
Scott, emphasized the
anniversary. According to Scott,
who read a long manuscript for
more han twenty minutes, history
was made at Stanford today.
Black Unanimity
He said unanimity between
black students had been achieved
to an unprecedented extent. "We
are here today, he said because of
black destiny."
The final speaker at the rally
was BSU chairman Leo Bazile,
who reported on the meeting he
and co-chairman Nate Kirtman
had just come from with President
Fitzer.
Lack of Urgcncy
According to Bazile, Pitzer had
closed the meeting at 20 minutes
to noon, saying he had a lunch
engagement. Up to that point,
Bazile said they had discussed
'hree of the twelve BSU demands.
