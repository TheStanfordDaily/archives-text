# Militant Blacks Raid Bookstore; Pitzer's Absence Causes Fury
## 
### MADELYNSPATT 
Student violence struck
Stanford yesterday afternoon, as
about 15 black demonstrators
rampaged through the campus
bookstore, breaking glass cases
and shelves and throwing
hundreds of books on the floor.
The incident was touched off
as black students, following a
three hour BSU demonstration,
left President Pitzer's office in
frustration after Pitzer no^
appear when anticipated by BSU
leaders.
No arrests have been made, nor
action taken against the persons

involved. The demonstration
broke up almost immediately
following the ransacking.
The damage to the bookstore in
estimated in excess of $1,000,
according to Professor Clifford
Weigle, who heads the board of
the store. The estimate includes
the business expected to be lost
by the forced closing of the store
yesterday. It is scheduled to
reopen on Monday.
A special session of the
FAcuity Senate has been called
for this afternoon at 3:15 to
discuss yesterday's events.
Pitzer Clarification
Late yesterday afternoon,

Pitzer called a news conference in
his office to explain the confusion
over the 2 p.m. meeting for which
he appeared 45 minutes late, and
to reveal what proposals had been
presented to the BSU that
morning (see story below; text of
University response to the 12
demands appears on page three).
At the conference Pitzer
stated, "It is clearly impossible to
continue discussion of substantive
issues until a more responsible
atmosphere exists."
The violent incident, in which
no participants have been
identified by name, apparently
resulted from a communication

gap between Pitzer and the
demonstrators. Pitzer twice
changed his mind about attending
the 2 p.m. meeting, changes
unknown to the demonstrators.
At the time of the incident, Pitzer
was in his car, en route to his
office to meet with the
demonstrators. Pitzer agreed to a
mid afternoon meeting following
a call by Assistant Provost James
Simmons who spoke with the
BSU leaders and persuaded them
to clear the President's office.
Build-Up
The bookstore incident
climaxed series of incidents
beginning with a noon
demonstration in White Plaza.
Before the demonstration, BSU
co-chairmen Nate Kirtman and
Leo Bazile met with Pitzer for
almost two hours to discuss the
BSU demands sent to the
administration February 4th. At
the same time as Kirtman and
Bazile were meeting in the
President's office, other BSU
members, along with minority
supports from the community,
held a closed meeting in
Dinkelspiel auditorium.
Provost Richard Lyman
explained "the morning's session
with BSU leaders was, "very
business like. We discussed very
practical and detailed questions
and there seemed to be agreement
on many points." Lyman reported
that the major items considered
were BSU demands concerning
financial aid.
According to Lyman, there was
apparently agreement that
admitting large numbers of black
students was less important than
insuring that those admitted
receive the best possible financial
help.

This includes University plans
to expand its information system
for incoming students to more
fully supply information on the
type of financial aid they will
receive and the expenses they will
face.
Lyman said, "We must give
students a complete packet of
information so they will know
that faces them upon arrival in
terms of income and work and
expenses. Experience proves that
many new students enter, receive
a large check, and don't realize
they will need all the money."
The Dinkelspiel meeting, as
well as the rally which followed,
were keynoted by discussion of
the fourth anniversary of the
assas'nation of black militant
leader Malcolm X.
Speeches by BSU members at
the rally, most notably Johnny
Scott, emphasized the
anniversary. According to Scott,
who read a long manuscript for
more han twenty minutes, history
was made at Stanford today.
Black Unanimity
He said unanimity between
black students had been achieved
to an unprecedented extent. "We
are here today, he said because of
black destiny."
The final speaker at the rally
was BSU chairman Leo Bazile,
who reported on the meeting he
and co-chairman Nate Kirtman
had just come from with President
Fitzer.
Lack of Urgcncy
According to Bazile, Pitzer had
closed the meeting at 20 minutes
to noon, saying he had a lunch
engagement. Up to that point,
Bazile said they had discussed
'hree of the twelve BSU demands.
"I say that Chancellor Heyns
has luncheon engagements,"
Bazile said, "President Hayakawa
does also ... but if the shijt gets
thick enough they cancel them."
He proposed a choice to the
assembly: Did they want to go
back to Dinkelspiel and discuss
what they would say to Pitzer the
next day, or go get him to talk
immediately?
At this point, the mass of
students, most of the 400 who
had been at the rally, marched
over to the President's office,
shouting "We Want Pitzer." They
arrived at the office about 12:40
p.m., piling en masse into the
president's office.
Pigs on Campus"
Throughout the rally a.id the
demonstration which followed,
BSU members alluded to the
presence of the police, all in
plainclothes, who followed along
and stayed at the edge of the
crowd. Police officials were in
evidence, though none were in
uniform, but took no action.
The students, who filled several
rooms in the president's office, as
well as the stairs and the
courtyard outside, quickly
discovered that Pitzer wasn't in
the building, and set out in search
of him. The throng marched to
the faculty club, where black
students in the vanguard climbed
over the wall into the courtyard,
opening the door for the group
following them.
The group massed in the
courtyard and lobby of the
building.
Wc Want Pitzer'
The group, with black students
in the vanguard, chanted "We
want Pitzer" at the doorway to
the faculty dining room. Tht
demonstration continued, and
Pitzer came to the door of the

dining room to speak to the
students.
"I was available to meet last
week," Pitzer told them. "It was
the BSU that chose to wait till
this week." At that time ht
refused to meet with
demonstrators later in the day.
After , . Jim Simmons
told students he would arrange a
meeting for 2 p.m., the group left.
Meanwhile, Pitzer had left the
faculty club by a rear exit and
gone to the house of Fred Glover,
his assistant, and was not available
when Simmons went looking for
him.
Led by cries of "If Pitzer's got
time to eat, we have too," and
"Free lunch on Pitzer," the group
of black and white students, went
to Tressider cafeteria, at about
1:15 p.m., to have lunch on the
unversity.
They took down the barrier to
the cafeteria section and massed
inside. The crowd was calm and
orderly. Demonstrators waited
their turn by coffee and soda
machines, while others, brought
out trays of sandwiches for those
outside. BSU leader Johnny Scott
spoke to the captive audience.
About 1:45 p.m., the group
again marched to the President's
office, leaders stopping frequently
to wait for the remainder of the
crowd. Shouts of "We Want
Pitzer" again dominated. They
arrived shortly before 2 - 00.
Food Libciauon
This time, only a few leaders
entered the building. The rest
massed outside. BSU leaders
invited heads of other campus
groups, who were present as
onlookers to come inside with
them to demonstrate support of
the BSU action.
In Pitzer's office, BSU leaders
were again met by Assistant
Provost Simmons, who spoke to
them and then called Pitzer to

convince him again to come meet
with the BSU. Pitzer had been
advised before, during the
cafeteria incident, not to appear.
Co-Chairmen Kirtman and
Bazile waited in the conference
room.
After an extended phone
conversation, Simmons
reappeared to announce Pitzer
was coming and would be there
shortly, if demonstrators would
clear the building. This was done,
and a path was formed for Pitzer
in front of the door.
NoShow
Pitzer did not appear by 2:30,
at which time BSU leaders
decided to wait five more
minutes, a limit which was again
extended. At 2:40 P.M., the time
was announced. The debate went
on whether to leave or stay.
Simmons, as well as BSU leaders
and members of the press, left the
President's office to wait at the
door. From the window upstairs,
an observer could see a pathway
leading from the center of the
courtyard to the door of the
building which houses the
president's office.
Then, after a consultation
between BSU leaders in the
downstairs office of the building,
Bazile announced he was leaving,
and others could do what they
wanted.
The crowd, which had been
reduced to about 150, went to the
bookstore, no longer in an
organized group. There is no
accurate account of who were the
students who ransacked the
building, but apparently they
were almost exclusively black.
Two student photographers,
Craig Ostfeld and Peter
Zimmerman, had their film taken
by the BSU.

was in his car, en route to his
office to meet with the
demonstrators. Pitzer agreed to a
mid afternoon meeting following
a call by Assistant Provost James
Simmons who spoke with the
BSU leaders and persuaded them
to clear the President's office.
Build-Up
The bookstore incident
climaxed series of incidents
beginning with a noon
demonstration in White Plaza.
Before the demonstration, BSU
co-chairmen Nate Kirtman and
Leo Bazile met with Pitzer for
almost two hours to discuss the
BSU demands sent to the
administration February 4th. At
the same time as Kirtman and
Bazile were meeting in the
President's office, other BSU
members, along with minority
supports from the community,
held a closed meeting in
Dinkelspiel auditorium.
Provost Richard Lyman
explained "the morning's session
with BSU leaders was, "very
business like. We discussed very
practical and detailed questions
and there seemed to be agreement
on many points." Lyman reported
that the major items considered
were BSU demands concerning
financial aid.
According to Lyman, there was
apparently agreement that
admitting large numbers of black
students was less important than
insuring that those admitted
receive the best possible financial
help.

This includes University plans
to expand its information system
for incoming students to more
fully supply information on the
type of financial aid they will
receive and the expenses they will
face.
Lyman said, "We must give
students a complete packet of
information so they will know
that faces them upon arrival in
terms of income and work and
expenses. Experience proves that
many new students enter, receive
a large check, and don't realize
they will need all the money."
The Dinkelspiel meeting, as
well as the rally which followed,
were keynoted by discussion of
the fourth anniversary of the
assas'nation of black militant
leader Malcolm X.
Speeches by BSU members at
the rally, most notably Johnny
Scott, emphasized the
anniversary. According to Scott,
who read a long manuscript for
more han twenty minutes, history
was made at Stanford today.
Black Unanimity
He said unanimity between
black students had been achieved
to an unprecedented extent. "We
are here today, he said because of
black destiny."
The final speaker at the rally
was BSU chairman Leo Bazile,
who reported on the meeting he
and co-chairman Nate Kirtman
had just come from with President
Fitzer.
Lack of Urgcncy
According to Bazile, Pitzer had
closed the meeting at 20 minutes
to noon, saying he had a lunch
engagement. Up to that point,
Bazile said they had discussed
'hree of the twelve BSU demands.
"I say that Chancellor Heyns
has luncheon engagements,"
Bazile said, "President Hayakawa
does also ... but if the shijt gets
thick enough they cancel them."
He proposed a choice to the
assembly: Did they want to go
back to Dinkelspiel and discuss
what they would say to Pitzer the
next day, or go get him to talk
immediately?
At this point, the mass of
students, most of the 400 who
had been at the rally, marched
over to the President's office,
shouting "We Want Pitzer." They
arrived at the office about 12:40
p.m., piling en masse into the
president's office.
Pigs on Campus"
Throughout the rally a.id the
demonstration which followed,
BSU members alluded to the
presence of the police, all in
plainclothes, who followed along
and stayed at the edge of the
crowd. Police officials were in
evidence, though none were in
uniform, but took no action.
The students, who filled several
rooms in the president's office, as
well as the stairs and the
courtyard outside, quickly
discovered that Pitzer wasn't in
the building, and set out in search
of him. The throng marched to
the faculty club, where black
students in the vanguard climbed
over the wall into the courtyard,
opening the door for the group
following them.
The group massed in the
courtyard and lobby of the
building.
Wc Want Pitzer'
The group, with black students
in the vanguard, chanted "We
want Pitzer" at the doorway to
the faculty dining room. Tht
demonstration continued, and
Pitzer came to the door of the

dining room to speak to the
students.
"I was available to meet last
week," Pitzer told them. "It was
the BSU that chose to wait till
this week." At that time ht
refused to meet with
demonstrators later in the day.
After , . Jim Simmons
told students he would arrange a
meeting for 2 p.m., the group left.
Meanwhile, Pitzer had left the
faculty club by a rear exit and
gone to the house of Fred Glover,
his assistant, and was not available
when Simmons went looking for
him.
Led by cries of "If Pitzer's got
time to eat, we have too," and
"Free lunch on Pitzer," the group
of black and white students, went
to Tressider cafeteria, at about
1:15 p.m., to have lunch on the
unversity.
They took down the barrier to
the cafeteria section and massed
inside. The crowd was calm and
orderly. Demonstrators waited
their turn by coffee and soda
machines, while others, brought
out trays of sandwiches for those
outside. BSU leader Johnny Scott
spoke to the captive audience.
About 1:45 p.m., the group
again marched to the President's
office, leaders stopping frequently
to wait for the remainder of the
crowd. Shouts of "We Want
Pitzer" again dominated. They
arrived shortly before 2 - 00.
Food Libciauon
This time, only a few leaders
entered the building. The rest
massed outside. BSU leaders
invited heads of other campus
groups, who were present as
onlookers to come inside with
them to demonstrate support of
the BSU action.
In Pitzer's office, BSU leaders
were again met by Assistant
Provost Simmons, who spoke to
them and then called Pitzer to

convince him again to come meet
with the BSU. Pitzer had been
advised before, during the
cafeteria incident, not to appear.
Co-Chairmen Kirtman and
Bazile waited in the conference
room.
After an extended phone
conversation, Simmons
reappeared to announce Pitzer
was coming and would be there
shortly, if demonstrators would
clear the building. This was done,
and a path was formed for Pitzer
in front of the door.
NoShow
Pitzer did not appear by 2:30,
at which time BSU leaders
decided to wait five more
minutes, a limit which was again
extended. At 2:40 P.M., the time
was announced. The debate went
on whether to leave or stay.
Simmons, as well as BSU leaders
and members of the press, left the
President's office to wait at the
door. From the window upstairs,
an observer could see a pathway
leading from the center of the
courtyard to the door of the
building which houses the
president's office.
Then, after a consultation
between BSU leaders in the
downstairs office of the building,
Bazile announced he was leaving,
and others could do what they
wanted.
The crowd, which had been
reduced to about 150, went to the
bookstore, no longer in an
organized group. There is no
accurate account of who were the
students who ransacked the
building, but apparently they
were almost exclusively black.
Two student photographers,
Craig Ostfeld and Peter
Zimmerman, had their film taken
by the BSU.

PITZER'S PRESS CONFERENCE - President Pitzer called a press conference yesterday afternoon to reveal the
administration's preliminary responses to the Black Students Union's demands. Seated beside President Pitzer are Daily
editors Pal McMahon (left) and Michael Kuhl. Standing in the rear are Provost Richard Lvma" Finance Vice President
Kenneth Cuthbertson, and Director of University Relations Lyle Nelson.
Student violence struck
Stanford yesterday afternoon, as
about 15 black demonstrators
rampaged through the campus
bookstore, breaking glass cases
and shelves and throwing
hundreds of books on the floor.
The incident was touched off
as black students, following a
three hour BSU demonstration,
left President Pitzer's office in
frustration after Pitzer no^
appear when anticipated by BSU
leaders.
No arrests have been made, nor
action taken against the persons

involved. The demonstration
broke up almost immediately
following the ransacking.
The damage to the bookstore in
estimated in excess of $1,000,
according to Professor Clifford
Weigle, who heads the board of
the store. The estimate includes
the business expected to be lost
by the forced closing of the store
yesterday. It is scheduled to
reopen on Monday.
A special session of the
FAcuity Senate has been called
for this afternoon at 3:15 to
discuss yesterday's events.
Pitzer Clarification
Late yesterday afternoon,

Pitzer called a news conference in
his office to explain the confusion
over the 2 p.m. meeting for which
he appeared 45 minutes late, and
to reveal what proposals had been
presented to the BSU that
morning (see story below; text of
University response to the 12
demands appears on page three).
At the conference Pitzer
stated, "It is clearly impossible to
continue discussion of substantive
issues until a more responsible
atmosphere exists."
The violent incident, in which
no participants have been
identified by name, apparently
resulted from a communication

gap between Pitzer and the
demonstrators. Pitzer twice
changed his mind about attending
the 2 p.m. meeting, changes
unknown to the demonstrators.
At the time of the incident, Pitzer
was in his car, en route to his

the fourth anniversary of the
assas'nation of black militant
leader Malcolm X.
Speeches by BSU members at
the rally, most notably Johnny
Scott, emphasized the
anniversary. According to Scott,
who read a long manuscript for
more han twenty minutes, history
was made at Stanford today.
Black Unanimity
He said unanimity between
black students had been achieved
to an unprecedented extent. "We
are here today, he said because of
black destiny."
The final speaker at the rally
was BSU chairman Leo Bazile,
who reported on the meeting he
and co-chairman Nate Kirtman
had just come from with President
Fitzer.
Lack of Urgcncy
According to Bazile, Pitzer had
closed the meeting at 20 minutes
to noon, saying he had a lunch
engagement. Up to that point,
Bazile said they had discussed
'hree of the twelve BSU demands.
"I say that Chancellor Heyns
has luncheon engagements,"
Bazile said, "President Hayakawa
does also ... but if the shijt gets
thick enough they cancel them."
He proposed a choice to the
assembly: Did they want to go
back to Dinkelspiel and discuss
what they would say to Pitzer the
next day, or go get him to talk
immediately?
At this point, the mass of
students, most of the 400 who
had been at the rally, marched
over to the President's office,
shouting "We Want Pitzer." They
arrived at the office about 12:40
p.m., piling en masse into the
president's office.
Pigs on Campus"
Throughout the rally a.id the
demonstration which followed,
BSU members alluded to the
presence of the police, all in
plainclothes, who followed along
and stayed at the edge of the
crowd. Police officials were in
evidence, though none were in
uniform, but took no action.
The students, who filled several
rooms in the president's office, as
well as the stairs and the
courtyard outside, quickly
discovered that Pitzer wasn't in
the building, and set out in search
of him. The throng marched to
the faculty club, where black
students in the vanguard climbed
over the wall into the courtyard,
opening the door for the group
following them.
The group massed in the
courtyard and lobby of the
building.
Wc Want Pitzer'
The group, with black students
in the vanguard, chanted "We
want Pitzer" at the doorway to
the faculty dining room. Tht
demonstration continued, and
Pitzer came to the door of the

dining room to speak to the
students.
"I was available to meet last
week," Pitzer told them. "It was
the BSU that chose to wait till
this week." At that time ht
refused to meet with
demonstrators later in the day.
After , . Jim Simmons
told students he would arrange a
meeting for 2 p.m., the group left.
Meanwhile, Pitzer had left the
faculty club by a rear exit and
gone to the house of Fred Glover,
his assistant, and was not available
when Simmons went looking for
him.
Led by cries of "If Pitzer's got
time to eat, we have too," and
"Free lunch on Pitzer," the group
of black and white students, went
to Tressider cafeteria, at about
1:15 p.m., to have lunch on the
unversity.
They took down the barrier to
the cafeteria section and massed
inside. The crowd was calm and
orderly. Demonstrators waited
their turn by coffee and soda
machines, while others, brought
out trays of sandwiches for those
outside. BSU leader Johnny Scott
spoke to the captive audience.
About 1:45 p.m., the group
again marched to the President's
office, leaders stopping frequently
to wait for the remainder of the
crowd. Shouts of "We Want
Pitzer" again dominated. They
arrived shortly before 2 - 00.
Food Libciauon
This time, only a few leaders
entered the building. The rest
massed outside. BSU leaders
invited heads of other campus
groups, who were present as
onlookers to come inside with
them to demonstrate support of
the BSU action.
In Pitzer's office, BSU leaders
were again met by Assistant
Provost Simmons, who spoke to
them and then called Pitzer to

convince him again to come meet
with the BSU. Pitzer had been
advised before, during the
cafeteria incident, not to appear.
Co-Chairmen Kirtman and
Bazile waited in the conference
room.
After an extended phone
conversation, Simmons
reappeared to announce Pitzer
was coming and would be there
shortly, if demonstrators would
clear the building. This was done,
and a path was formed for Pitzer
in front of the door.
NoShow
Pitzer did not appear by 2:30,
at which time BSU leaders
decided to wait five more
minutes, a limit which was again
extended. At 2:40 P.M., the time
was announced. The debate went
on whether to leave or stay.
Simmons, as well as BSU leaders
and members of the press, left the
President's office to wait at the
door. From the window upstairs,
an observer could see a pathway
leading from the center of the
courtyard to the door of the
building which houses the
president's office.
Then, after a consultation
between BSU leaders in the
downstairs office of the building,
Bazile announced he was leaving,
and others could do what they
wanted.
The crowd, which had been
reduced to about 150, went to the
bookstore, no longer in an
organized group. There is no
accurate account of who were the
students who ransacked the
building, but apparently they
were almost exclusively black.
Two student photographers,
Craig Ostfeld and Peter
Zimmerman, had their film taken
by the BSU.

PITZER'S PRESS CONFERENCE - President Pitzer called a press conference yesterday afternoon to reveal the
administration's preliminary responses to the Black Students Union's demands. Seated beside President Pitzer are Daily
editors Pal McMahon (left) and Michael Kuhl. Standing in the rear are Provost Richard Lvma" Finance Vice President
Kenneth Cuthbertson, and Director of University Relations Lyle Nelson.
Student violence struck
Stanford yesterday afternoon, as
about 15 black demonstrators
rampaged through the campus
bookstore, breaking glass cases
and shelves and throwing
hundreds of books on the floor.
The incident was touched off
as black students, following a
three hour BSU demonstration,
left President Pitzer's office in
frustration after Pitzer no^
appear when anticipated by BSU
leaders.
No arrests have been made, nor
action taken against the persons

involved. The demonstration
broke up almost immediately
following the ransacking.
The damage to the bookstore in
estimated in excess of $1,000,
according to Professor Clifford
Weigle, who heads the board of
the store. The estimate includes
the business expected to be lost
by the forced closing of the store
yesterday. It is scheduled to
reopen on Monday.
A special session of the
FAcuity Senate has been called
for this afternoon at 3:15 to
discuss yesterday's events.
Pitzer Clarification
Late yesterday afternoon,

Pitzer called a news conference in
his office to explain the confusion
over the 2 p.m. meeting for which
he appeared 45 minutes late, and
to reveal what proposals had been
presented to the BSU that
morning (see story below; text of
University response to the 12
demands appears on page three).
At the conference Pitzer
stated, "It is clearly impossible to
continue discussion of substantive
issues until a more responsible
atmosphere exists."
The violent incident, in which
no participants have been
identified by name, apparently
resulted from a communication

gap between Pitzer and the
demonstrators. Pitzer twice
changed his mind about attending
the 2 p.m. meeting, changes
unknown to the demonstrators.
At the time of the incident, Pitzer
was in his car, en route to his
office to meet with the
demonstrators. Pitzer agreed to a
mid afternoon meeting following
a call by Assistant Provost James
Simmons who spoke with the
BSU leaders and persuaded them
to clear the President's office.
Build-Up
The bookstore incident
climaxed series of incidents
beginning with a noon
demonstration in White Plaza.
Before the demonstration, BSU
co-chairmen Nate Kirtman and
Leo Bazile met with Pitzer for
almost two hours to discuss the
BSU demands sent to the
administration February 4th. At
the same time as Kirtman and
Bazile were meeting in the
President's office, other BSU
members, along with minority
supports from the community,
held a closed meeting in
Dinkelspiel auditorium.
Provost Richard Lyman
explained "the morning's session
with BSU leaders was, "very
business like. We discussed very
practical and detailed questions
and there seemed to be agreement
on many points." Lyman reported
that the major items considered
were BSU demands concerning
financial aid.
According to Lyman, there was
apparently agreement that
admitting large numbers of black
students was less important than
insuring that those admitted
receive the best possible financial
help.

This includes University plans
to expand its information system
for incoming students to more
fully supply information on the
type of financial aid they will
receive and the expenses they will
face.
Lyman said, "We must give
students a complete packet of
information so they will know
that faces them upon arrival in
terms of income and work and
expenses. Experience proves that
many new students enter, receive
a large check, and don't realize
they will need all the money."
The Dinkelspiel meeting, as
well as the rally which followed,
were keynoted by discussion of
the fourth anniversary of the
assas'nation of black militant
leader Malcolm X.
Speeches by BSU members at
the rally, most notably Johnny
Scott, emphasized the

evidence, though none were in
uniform, but took no action.
The students, who filled several
rooms in the president's office, as
well as the stairs and the
courtyard outside, quickly
discovered that Pitzer wasn't in
the building, and set out in search
of him. The throng marched to
the faculty club, where black
students in the vanguard climbed
over the wall into the courtyard,
opening the door for the group
following them.
The group massed in the
courtyard and lobby of the
building.
Wc Want Pitzer'
The group, with black students
in the vanguard, chanted "We
want Pitzer" at the doorway to
the faculty dining room. Tht
demonstration continued, and
Pitzer came to the door of the

dining room to speak to the
students.
"I was available to meet last
week," Pitzer told them. "It was
the BSU that chose to wait till
this week." At that time ht
refused to meet with
demonstrators later in the day.
After , . Jim Simmons
told students he would arrange a
meeting for 2 p.m., the group left.
Meanwhile, Pitzer had left the
faculty club by a rear exit and
gone to the house of Fred Glover,
his assistant, and was not available
when Simmons went looking for
him.
Led by cries of "If Pitzer's got
time to eat, we have too," and
"Free lunch on Pitzer," the group
of black and white students, went
to Tressider cafeteria, at about
1:15 p.m., to have lunch on the
unversity.
They took down the barrier to
the cafeteria section and massed
inside. The crowd was calm and
orderly. Demonstrators waited
their turn by coffee and soda
machines, while others, brought
out trays of sandwiches for those
outside. BSU leader Johnny Scott
spoke to the captive audience.
About 1:45 p.m., the group
again marched to the President's
office, leaders stopping frequently
to wait for the remainder of the
crowd. Shouts of "We Want
Pitzer" again dominated. They
arrived shortly before 2 - 00.
Food Libciauon
This time, only a few leaders
entered the building. The rest
massed outside. BSU leaders
invited heads of other campus
groups, who were present as
onlookers to come inside with
them to demonstrate support of
the BSU action.
In Pitzer's office, BSU leaders
were again met by Assistant
Provost Simmons, who spoke to
them and then called Pitzer to

convince him again to come meet
with the BSU. Pitzer had been
advised before, during the
cafeteria incident, not to appear.
Co-Chairmen Kirtman and
Bazile waited in the conference
room.
After an extended phone
conversation, Simmons
reappeared to announce Pitzer
was coming and would be there
shortly, if demonstrators would
clear the building. This was done,
and a path was formed for Pitzer
in front of the door.
NoShow
Pitzer did not appear by 2:30,
at which time BSU leaders
decided to wait five more
minutes, a limit which was again
extended. At 2:40 P.M., the time
was announced. The debate went
on whether to leave or stay.
Simmons, as well as BSU leaders
and members of the press, left the
President's office to wait at the
door. From the window upstairs,
an observer could see a pathway
leading from the center of the
courtyard to the door of the
building which houses the
president's office.
Then, after a consultation
between BSU leaders in the
downstairs office of the building,
Bazile announced he was leaving,
and others could do what they
wanted.
The crowd, which had been
reduced to about 150, went to the
bookstore, no longer in an
organized group. There is no
accurate account of who were the
students who ransacked the
building, but apparently they
were almost exclusively black.
Two student photographers,
Craig Ostfeld and Peter
Zimmerman, had their film taken
by the BSU.

PITZER'S PRESS CONFERENCE - President Pitzer called a press conference yesterday afternoon to reveal the
administration's preliminary responses to the Black Students Union's demands. Seated beside President Pitzer are Daily
editors Pal McMahon (left) and Michael Kuhl. Standing in the rear are Provost Richard Lvma" Finance Vice President
Kenneth Cuthbertson, and Director of University Relations Lyle Nelson.
Student violence struck
Stanford yesterday afternoon, as
about 15 black demonstrators
rampaged through the campus
bookstore, breaking glass cases
and shelves and throwing
hundreds of books on the floor.
The incident was touched off
as black students, following a
three hour BSU demonstration,
left President Pitzer's office in
frustration after Pitzer no^
appear when anticipated by BSU
leaders.
No arrests have been made, nor
action taken against the persons

involved. The demonstration
broke up almost immediately
following the ransacking.
The damage to the bookstore in
estimated in excess of $1,000,
according to Professor Clifford
Weigle, who heads the board of
the store. The estimate includes
the business expected to be lost
by the forced closing of the store
yesterday. It is scheduled to
reopen on Monday.
A special session of the
FAcuity Senate has been called
for this afternoon at 3:15 to
discuss yesterday's events.
Pitzer Clarification
Late yesterday afternoon,

Pitzer called a news conference in
his office to explain the confusion
over the 2 p.m. meeting for which
he appeared 45 minutes late, and
to reveal what proposals had been
presented to the BSU that
morning (see story below; text of
University response to the 12
demands appears on page three).
At the conference Pitzer
stated, "It is clearly impossible to
continue discussion of substantive
issues until a more responsible
atmosphere exists."
The violent incident, in which
no participants have been
identified by name, apparently
resulted from a communication

gap between Pitzer and the
demonstrators. Pitzer twice
changed his mind about attending
the 2 p.m. meeting, changes
unknown to the demonstrators.
At the time of the incident, Pitzer
was in his car, en route to his
office to meet with the
demonstrators. Pitzer agreed to a
mid afternoon meeting following
a call by Assistant Provost James
Simmons who spoke with the
BSU leaders and persuaded them
to clear the President's office.
Build-Up
The bookstore incident
climaxed series of incidents
beginning with a noon
demonstration in White Plaza.
Before the demonstration, BSU
co-chairmen Nate Kirtman and
Leo Bazile met with Pitzer for
almost two hours to discuss the
BSU demands sent to the
administration February 4th. At
the same time as Kirtman and
Bazile were meeting in the
President's office, other BSU
members, along with minority
supports from the community,
held a closed meeting in
Dinkelspiel auditorium.
Provost Richard Lyman
explained "the morning's session
with BSU leaders was, "very
business like. We discussed very
practical and detailed questions
and there seemed to be agreement
on many points." Lyman reported
that the major items considered
were BSU demands concerning
financial aid.
According to Lyman, there was
apparently agreement that
admitting large numbers of black
students was less important than
insuring that those admitted
receive the best possible financial
help.

This includes University plans
to expand its information system
for incoming students to more
fully supply information on the
type of financial aid they will
receive and the expenses they will
face.
Lyman said, "We must give
students a complete packet of
information so they will know
that faces them upon arrival in
terms of income and work and
expenses. Experience proves that
many new students enter, receive
a large check, and don't realize
they will need all the money."
The Dinkelspiel meeting, as
well as the rally which followed,
were keynoted by discussion of
the fourth anniversary of the
assas'nation of black militant
leader Malcolm X.
Speeches by BSU members at
the rally, most notably Johnny
Scott, emphasized the
anniversary. According to Scott,
who read a long manuscript for
more han twenty minutes, history
was made at Stanford today.
Black Unanimity
He said unanimity between
black students had been achieved
to an unprecedented extent. "We
are here today, he said because of
black destiny."
The final speaker at the rally
was BSU chairman Leo Bazile,
who reported on the meeting he
and co-chairman Nate Kirtman
had just come from with President
Fitzer.
Lack of Urgcncy
According to Bazile, Pitzer had
closed the meeting at 20 minutes
to noon, saying he had a lunch
engagement. Up to that point,
Bazile said they had discussed
'hree of the twelve BSU demands.
"I say that Chancellor Heyns
has luncheon engagements,"
Bazile said, "President Hayakawa
does also ... but if the shijt gets
thick enough they cancel them."
He proposed a choice to the
assembly: Did they want to go
back to Dinkelspiel and discuss
what they would say to Pitzer the
next day, or go get him to talk
immediately?
At this point, the mass of
students, most of the 400 who
had been at the rally, marched
over to the President's office,
shouting "We Want Pitzer." They
arrived at the office about 12:40
p.m., piling en masse into the
president's office.
Pigs on Campus"
Throughout the rally a.id the
demonstration which followed,
BSU members alluded to the
presence of the police, all in
plainclothes, who followed along
and stayed at the edge of the
crowd. Police officials were in
evidence, though none were in
uniform, but took no action.
The students, who filled several
rooms in the president's office, as
well as the stairs and the
courtyard outside, quickly

outside. BSU leader Johnny Scott
spoke to the captive audience.
About 1:45 p.m., the group
again marched to the President's
office, leaders stopping frequently
to wait for the remainder of the
crowd. Shouts of "We Want
Pitzer" again dominated. They
arrived shortly before 2 - 00.
Food Libciauon
This time, only a few leaders
entered the building. The rest
massed outside. BSU leaders
invited heads of other campus
groups, who were present as
onlookers to come inside with
them to demonstrate support of
the BSU action.
In Pitzer's office, BSU leaders
were again met by Assistant
Provost Simmons, who spoke to
them and then called Pitzer to

convince him again to come meet
with the BSU. Pitzer had been
advised before, during the
cafeteria incident, not to appear.
Co-Chairmen Kirtman and
Bazile waited in the conference
room.
After an extended phone
conversation, Simmons
reappeared to announce Pitzer
was coming and would be there
shortly, if demonstrators would
clear the building. This was done,
and a path was formed for Pitzer
in front of the door.
NoShow
Pitzer did not appear by 2:30,
at which time BSU leaders
decided to wait five more
minutes, a limit which was again
extended. At 2:40 P.M., the time
was announced. The debate went
on whether to leave or stay.
Simmons, as well as BSU leaders
and members of the press, left the
President's office to wait at the
door. From the window upstairs,
an observer could see a pathway
leading from the center of the
courtyard to the door of the
building which houses the
president's office.
Then, after a consultation
between BSU leaders in the
downstairs office of the building,
Bazile announced he was leaving,
and others could do what they
wanted.
The crowd, which had been
reduced to about 150, went to the
bookstore, no longer in an
organized group. There is no
accurate account of who were the
students who ransacked the
building, but apparently they
were almost exclusively black.
Two student photographers,
Craig Ostfeld and Peter
Zimmerman, had their film taken
by the BSU.

PITZER'S PRESS CONFERENCE - President Pitzer called a press conference yesterday afternoon to reveal the
administration's preliminary responses to the Black Students Union's demands. Seated beside President Pitzer are Daily
editors Pal McMahon (left) and Michael Kuhl. Standing in the rear are Provost Richard Lvma" Finance Vice President
Kenneth Cuthbertson, and Director of University Relations Lyle Nelson.
Student violence struck
Stanford yesterday afternoon, as
about 15 black demonstrators
rampaged through the campus
bookstore, breaking glass cases
and shelves and throwing
hundreds of books on the floor.
The incident was touched off
as black students, following a
three hour BSU demonstration,
left President Pitzer's office in
frustration after Pitzer no^
appear when anticipated by BSU
leaders.
No arrests have been made, nor
action taken against the persons

involved. The demonstration
broke up almost immediately
following the ransacking.
The damage to the bookstore in
estimated in excess of $1,000,
according to Professor Clifford
Weigle, who heads the board of
the store. The estimate includes
the business expected to be lost
by the forced closing of the store
yesterday. It is scheduled to
reopen on Monday.
A special session of the
FAcuity Senate has been called
for this afternoon at 3:15 to
discuss yesterday's events.
Pitzer Clarification
Late yesterday afternoon,

Pitzer called a news conference in
his office to explain the confusion
over the 2 p.m. meeting for which
he appeared 45 minutes late, and
to reveal what proposals had been
presented to the BSU that
morning (see story below; text of
University response to the 12
demands appears on page three).
At the conference Pitzer
stated, "It is clearly impossible to
continue discussion of substantive
issues until a more responsible
atmosphere exists."
The violent incident, in which
no participants have been
identified by name, apparently
resulted from a communication

gap between Pitzer and the
demonstrators. Pitzer twice
changed his mind about attending
the 2 p.m. meeting, changes
unknown to the demonstrators.
At the time of the incident, Pitzer
was in his car, en route to his
office to meet with the
demonstrators. Pitzer agreed to a
mid afternoon meeting following
a call by Assistant Provost James
Simmons who spoke with the
BSU leaders and persuaded them
to clear the President's office.
Build-Up
The bookstore incident
climaxed series of incidents
beginning with a noon
demonstration in White Plaza.
Before the demonstration, BSU
co-chairmen Nate Kirtman and
Leo Bazile met with Pitzer for
almost two hours to discuss the
BSU demands sent to the
administration February 4th. At
the same time as Kirtman and
Bazile were meeting in the
President's office, other BSU
members, along with minority
supports from the community,
held a closed meeting in
Dinkelspiel auditorium.
Provost Richard Lyman
explained "the morning's session
with BSU leaders was, "very
business like. We discussed very
practical and detailed questions
and there seemed to be agreement
on many points." Lyman reported
that the major items considered
were BSU demands concerning
financial aid.
According to Lyman, there was
apparently agreement that
admitting large numbers of black
students was less important than
insuring that those admitted
receive the best possible financial
help.

This includes University plans
to expand its information system
for incoming students to more
fully supply information on the
type of financial aid they will
receive and the expenses they will
face.
Lyman said, "We must give
students a complete packet of
information so they will know
that faces them upon arrival in
terms of income and work and
expenses. Experience proves that
many new students enter, receive
a large check, and don't realize
they will need all the money."
The Dinkelspiel meeting, as
well as the rally which followed,
were keynoted by discussion of
the fourth anniversary of the
assas'nation of black militant
leader Malcolm X.
Speeches by BSU members at
the rally, most notably Johnny
Scott, emphasized the
anniversary. According to Scott,
who read a long manuscript for
more han twenty minutes, history
was made at Stanford today.
Black Unanimity
He said unanimity between
black students had been achieved
to an unprecedented extent. "We
are here today, he said because of
black destiny."
The final speaker at the rally
was BSU chairman Leo Bazile,
who reported on the meeting he
and co-chairman Nate Kirtman
had just come from with President
Fitzer.
Lack of Urgcncy
According to Bazile, Pitzer had
closed the meeting at 20 minutes
to noon, saying he had a lunch
engagement. Up to that point,
Bazile said they had discussed
'hree of the twelve BSU demands.
"I say that Chancellor Heyns
has luncheon engagements,"
Bazile said, "President Hayakawa
does also ... but if the shijt gets
thick enough they cancel them."
He proposed a choice to the
assembly: Did they want to go
back to Dinkelspiel and discuss
what they would say to Pitzer the
next day, or go get him to talk
immediately?
At this point, the mass of
students, most of the 400 who
had been at the rally, marched
over to the President's office,
shouting "We Want Pitzer." They
arrived at the office about 12:40
p.m., piling en masse into the
president's office.
Pigs on Campus"
Throughout the rally a.id the
demonstration which followed,
BSU members alluded to the
presence of the police, all in
plainclothes, who followed along
and stayed at the edge of the
crowd. Police officials were in
evidence, though none were in
uniform, but took no action.
The students, who filled several
rooms in the president's office, as
well as the stairs and the
courtyard outside, quickly
discovered that Pitzer wasn't in
the building, and set out in search
of him. The throng marched to
the faculty club, where black
students in the vanguard climbed
over the wall into the courtyard,
opening the door for the group
following them.
The group massed in the
courtyard and lobby of the
building.
Wc Want Pitzer'
The group, with black students
in the vanguard, chanted "We
want Pitzer" at the doorway to
the faculty dining room. Tht
demonstration continued, and
Pitzer came to the door of the

dining room to speak to the
students.
"I was available to meet last
week," Pitzer told them. "It was
the BSU that chose to wait till
this week." At that time ht
refused to meet with
demonstrators later in the day.
After , . Jim Simmons
told students he would arrange a
meeting for 2 p.m., the group left.
Meanwhile, Pitzer had left the
faculty club by a rear exit and
gone to the house of Fred Glover,
his assistant, and was not available
when Simmons went looking for
him.
Led by cries of "If Pitzer's got
time to eat, we have too," and
"Free lunch on Pitzer," the group
of black and white students, went
to Tressider cafeteria, at about
1:15 p.m., to have lunch on the
unversity.
They took down the barrier to
the cafeteria section and massed
inside. The crowd was calm and
orderly. Demonstrators waited
their turn by coffee and soda
machines, while others, brought
out trays of sandwiches for those
outside. BSU leader Johnny Scott
spoke to the captive audience.
About 1:45 p.m., the group
again marched to the President's
office, leaders stopping frequently
to wait for the remainder of the
crowd. Shouts of "We Want
Pitzer" again dominated. They
arrived shortly before 2 - 00.
