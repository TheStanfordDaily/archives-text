# Administration Responds
## 
### 
The University administration
revealed its preliminary responses
to the 12 demands ot the Black
Student Union (BSU), at a press
conference yesterday afternoon.
The responses to the BSU Feb. 4
demands revealed that the
University plans to take no further
action regarding Prof. Robert Koff,
but they indicated substantial
agreement with the BSU in other
areas.
Professor Koff of the School of
Education had held an interview
with a black applicant. Remarks
made by him during the interview
prompted a demand that he be
"relieved of all his duties". Koff
will now no longer interview
candidates for the Stanford
Teacher Education Program
(STEP), which he heads.
The University will hire a
counselor for financial and general
counseling, will continue to seek

more minority employees at all
levels, and will allocate $168,000
in additional funds for financial aid
for minority students.
Simmons' New Title
Assistant Provost James
Simmons will become Assistant to
the President, a Mexican-American
will be appointed to a similar post,
and the demand for an
Afro-American Cultural Research
Institute will be met by a program
developed by Professor Wesley
Johnson of history for research and
curricular development in this area,
for which the University is seeking
financial aid.
These University responses to
the BSU demands provide an
outline of the overall University
response and is evidently not
intended to be the final answer of
the administration.
Provost Richard Lyman, one of
those present at the meeting with

the BSU yesterday morning,
commented last night that
''concerning the demands
discussed this morning, there is
obviously more to be said and
worked out than appears in our
stated response."
Limited Ph.D.'s
The University responded to the
demand for a black faculty
member in every department,
saying that "even if this were to be
adopted as a desirable goal, it
would bo impossible to attain."
They cite a study showing that a
limited number of black
Ph.D.-holders are produced each
year, but suggest "the situation is
not hopeless."
The Ur'versity suggested that
they would like to know about
ways ''to recruit a larger
