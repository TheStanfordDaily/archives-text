# Administration Responds
## 
### 
The University administration
revealed its preliminary responses
to the 12 demands ot the Black
Student Union (BSU), at a press
conference yesterday afternoon.
The responses to the BSU Feb. 4
demands revealed that the
University plans to take no further
action regarding Prof. Robert Koff,
but they indicated substantial
agreement with the BSU in other
areas.
Professor Koff of the School of
Education had held an interview
with a black applicant. Remarks
made by him during the interview
prompted a demand that he be
"relieved of all his duties". Koff
will now no longer interview
candidates for the Stanford
Teacher Education Program
(STEP), which he heads.
The University will hire a
counselor for financial and general
counseling, will continue to seek

more minority employees at all
levels, and will allocate $168,000
in additional funds for financial aid
for minority students.
Simmons' New Title
Assistant Provost James
Simmons will become Assistant to
the President, a Mexican-American
will be appointed to a similar post,
and the demand for an
Afro-American Cultural Research
Institute will be met by a program
developed by Professor Wesley
Johnson of history for research and
curricular development in this area,
for which the University is seeking
financial aid.
These University responses to
the BSU demands provide an
outline of the overall University
response and is evidently not
intended to be the final answer of
the administration.
Provost Richard Lyman, one of
those present at the meeting with

the BSU yesterday morning,
commented last night that
''concerning the demands
discussed this morning, there is
obviously more to be said and
worked out than appears in our
stated response."
Limited Ph.D.'s
The University responded to the
demand for a black faculty
member in every department,
saying that "even if this were to be
adopted as a desirable goal, it
would bo impossible to attain."
They cite a study showing that a
limited number of black
Ph.D.-holders are produced each
year, but suggest "the situation is
not hopeless."
The Ur'versity suggested that
they would like to know about
ways ''to recruit a larger
proportion of our own students
into graduate programs that lead to
teaching careers."
The administration said that
"no student is ever required to
work in any particular program,"
in response to a demand that
students not be required to work in
the Work-Study Program
involuntarily. They further felt
that a $2.50 minimum salary
"cannot be met.'
Concerning work-study
programs in East Palo Alto, the
administration referred to a
recently announced program for
several students to tutor at
Ravenswood High School, which
serves East Palo Alto.
The administration said the
Graduate Dean's office could
coordinate information and
recruitment assistance for minority
tdmissions but decisions "would,
of course, continue to be made by
the individual departments," this
speaking primarily of Humanities
and Sciences departments.
They said efforts are being made
in Business, Law, and Medicine to
develop recruiting plans.
Engineering departments are
"more varied."
They also revealed that the
Jniversity is negotiating with a
najor scholar in the field "in the

lope that he will join the faculty
next fall and assume the leadership
of the program."
The BSU demands were
presented to the administration on
February 4 following a noon rally
in White Plaza. The rally and
demands were partially sparked by
anger over university handling of
the Koff incident.
Further, the demand that the
minority recruitment committee
make decisions in the medical
school was felt by President Pitzer
to be "an issue for the Medical
School faculty."
Concerning a department of
Afro-American Studies, the
statement reports that a major in
"African and Afro American
Studies was developed by a
student-faculty committee."
The administration suggests
that its form as a program rather
than a department "represented
the committee's best judgment on
how to get a solid program started
at Stanford" and to overrule that
decision "would be premature."
The HRC recommended that
Koff cease conducting interviews.
This recommendation, though
taken as an "informal suggestion"
by President Pitzer, was supported
the education school
