## Crisis In Black And White 
### 
There is an atmosphere of detachment about Stanford.
Chicago, Vietnam, the Sierra Maestra - those places stiem very
far away
Yesterday the world came closer. Harlem, llough and Watts
suddenly became a bit more relevant.
The day began with a meeting between President Kenneth
Pitzer and the Black. Students Union and climaxed in the
disruption of the University Bookstore.
The Parallel between yesterday's events and a ghetto rebel
lion is emotional rather than material. No one was hurt. Noth
ing was burned. Property damage appears to have been slight.
But the black students clearly displayed the same frustra
tion and urgency that has been dramatically demonstrated in
black communities since 1965.
Their message is not difficult to interpret: "The Stanford
administration does not share the seriousness with which we
view our problems and, specifically, our 12 demands. The only
power available to us is our ability lo destroy vulnerable Uni
versity property. If our problems and demands are not given
satisfactory attention, we intend lo exercise that power."
Since the message was not transmitted verbally, it is import
ant to understand exactly what happened yesterday. The at
tack on the bookstore was a precisely controlled act. Items like
typewriters and expensive plate, glass windows escaped virtual
ly untouched. BSU leaders appear to have prevented looting.
But the BSU made it clear, both yesterday and at their Feb.
4 rally, that they are capable of more than sweeping book
shelves. In any case the next move belongs lo tlie administra
tion.
in making that move, it would be useful to know why com
munication broke down yesterday. One crucial decision was
made when President Pitzer left the Faculty (Hub and became
unavailable.
Pitzer may have, intended to demonstrate his refusal lo be
coerced. Possibly he felt that he would have been in physical
danger if he had stayed.
In either case he misread the situation. No one was ready to
hurt him. And the moment was one that demanded flexibility
rather than stubbornness.
It is our feeling that Stanford needs a leader who will go out
of his way to understand his constituents. This means that he
must be in frequent contact with members of the community.
The mayor of New York walks the roughest streets of his
city. His problems are probably more complex than those fac
ing Kenneth Pitzer. but his example should be noted. Perhaps
Pitzer will consider something more substantial than walking
tours of the campus.
In any ease, if the President had real empathy with the
viewpoint of students in general and black students in particu
lar. and if members of his administration had been able to reach
him quickly when he was needed, the books would probably
still be on their shelves.
