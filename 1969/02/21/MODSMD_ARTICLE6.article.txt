# Text of Pitzer's Statement
## 
### 
While Provost Lyman and I
welcome discussions with
responsible student groups, it is
not possible to hold such
discussions under conditions of
destruction or coercion. We regret
very much that a constructive
meeting with the BSU leadership
this morning was followed by
disruptive tactics and destructive
acts. It is clearly impossible to
continue discussion of substantive
issues until a more responsible
atmosphere exists.
The University has made
substantial progress and will
continue to move forward in
improving educational
opportunities as our response to
the BSU proposals demonstrates.

The following working paper,
intended as a basis for further
discussion, was presented
Thursday to the leaders of the
Black Students Union by
President Pitzer and other
University officers in response to
the Feb. 4 demands of the BSU.

At a public rally in White Plaza
on February 4, 1969, the Black
Student Union made public a set
of 12 demands having to do with
various aspects of programs
involving blacks at Stanford. The
attached statement responds
point-by-point to those demands.
Several introductory comments
are in order.
First, the first of the BSU
demands had to do with the
allegations against Professor
Robert Koff of the 'School of
Education. No response to that
demand is included here, because
the results of that case are now a
matter of public record. The
Human Relations Commission
report on it has been made public,
as has the following exchange of
correspondence between President
Pitzer and Dean James. The
School of Education has moved to
reorganize the interviewing for the
STEP program, and the
coordinator of interviewing is now
a black man who has been a
member of the STEP staff.
Second, it should be noted that
a number of the demands ask for
changes that had already been
planned before any demands were
made. That is true of at least parts
of numbers 3, 4, 6, 8 and 9.
Action on these was under way
and would have been taken
whether or not they had been
demanded. This suggests that
Stanford is, in fact, moving
forward toward greater
opportunities for members of
minority groups, be they students,
faculty, of staff. Even more
important, it argues strongly for
the proposition that progress can
and will be made without
confrontation, violence or
disruption so long as all elements
of the community are willing to
join in cooperative efforts towards
that end.
2. "There be a black faculty
member in every department by
Fall 'eg."
Even if this were to be adopted
as a desirable goal, it would be
impossible to attain. A recent
study of 105 universities (every
institution which averages 10
doctorates or more per year)
showed that a total of 294 Ph.D.'s
were awarded to Black Americans
from 1964-68. Further, of the 83
Black recipients in 1967 and
1968, more than 25% were in two
fields, Biology and Education. A
total of 22 fields were
represented, 7 with only one
degree in that two-year period.
Persons with the standard
qualifications simply do not exist
to meet the need.
The situation is not hopeless.
The academic departments are
responsible for faculty
recruitment, and many have been
actively searching for minority

group candidates capable of
serving on the Stanford faculty. In
1967-68 there was one black
member of the Academic Council
at Stanford. If present plans
materialize, there will be six or
more by September 1969. This is
an encouraging start. Clearly,
however, the full answer to the
problem lies in encouraging more
black students to choose college
teaching as their career and to
make the necessary training
available. Item 8 speaks to the
latter point. A start on the former
might be made with
undergraduates currently enrolled
at Stanford. We would welcome
ideas on ways to recruit a larger
proportion of our own students
into graduate programs that lead
to teaching careers.
3. "The Counseling and Testing
Center have five black
counselors."
There is clearly a need for
additional counseling services for
minority students. For the past
several months Mr. Simmons and
Dean Smith have been working on
ways to begin to meet this need
and they have been in
correspondence with several
possible candidates for a position
at Stanford. The most critical
problem area appears to be
financial counseling. We intend,
therefore, to add a person to the
staff whose duties would include
financial counseling of minority
students and general counseling as
well. Because of this combination
of responsibilities he will serve
jointly on the staffs of the
Financial Aids Office and the
Dean of Students.
4. "Stanford University hire more
black people on all levels, and
provide more jobs for black high
school students, and that all
employed as such use the
Minority Divisions Office."
To take the second part first, a
change in the University's
employment procedures is about
to be issued which will require
that all non-professional job
openings be listed with the
Personnel Office so that minority
applicants will have a fair chance
at ail positions normally filled
through the Personnel Office. This
policy change has been developed
over the last 3 months and was
discussed at the Dean's Council
meeting of January 27. Faculty
and professional research
positions will, as always, be the
responsibility of departments.
It is important to have the
facts of our present situation
clear. In March 1968, there were
223 Blacks and 156
Mexican-Americans employed by
Stanford. At the end of November
there were 390 Blacks (an increase
of 74.9%) and 177
Mexican-Americans (an increase
of 13.5%). The two groups
combined constitute about 6.5%
of all Stanford employees and a
considerably larger fraction on
non-faculty employees. Many
problems remain, particularly in
the area of Mexican-American
employment, but progress has
been and will continue to be
made.
Finally, with respect to the
employment of Black high school
students, last summer 152
minority students from nearby
communities were employed on
Campus. Eighty six of these were
formally in the Youth
Opportunity Program. The effort
to provide part-time jobs during
the school year has been less
successful; about twenty students
are now employed. The sharp
reduction in government funds for
research has made it difficult for
departments and laboratories
which want to employ a student
to do so. In response to this, the
Personnel Office has shifted funds
from other uses to keep this
program alive. It would be useful
to know how the BSU and other
groups feel about the importance

of this program as compared to
such other uses of limited funds as
pre-employment training
programs or on-the-job training
programs.
5. "No black student work in the
Work-Study Program
involuntarily, and that their
>cholarship be supplemented by a
grant instead. Minimum salary of
$2.50."
No student is ever required to
work in any particular program;
rather Work-Study is an
opportunity for students who
need or desire funds in addition to
those which can be provided as
grants. It is now the policy of the
University to evaluate each
student's financial and academic
needs on an individual basis and
to provide an aid package that
tries to account for both sets of
needs within the limits of
available funds. For 1969-70,
$168,800 in additional funds has
been allocated for minority
student financial aid.
Employment is rarely required for
a freshman minority student.
Beyond that, decisions must be
based on the facts of individual
cases in consultation with, and
with the understanding of the
student involved.
The demand for a $2.50 per
hour minimum wage for
work-study jobs cannot be met,
although some increases in present
stipend levels will be made from
time to time. To do so would not
result in any student's earning
additional money since the
government regulations stipulate
maximum earning power under
the program. Students would, of
course earn the maximum in
fewer hours, but one result of that
would be to put employers who
must carry on student performed
functions in a difficult position.
6. "Stanford create jobs and/or
give academic credit for students
working in East Palo Alto."
We are exploring ways to use
Work-Study funds in East Palo
Alto. In the interim, students
were informed last week that
$2,500 is available to pay five of
six black students for tutoring at
Ravenswood High School.
The idea of closer connections
between the University and
community groups which would
permit students to work on
community projects is an
excellent one. Mr. Simmons will
be seeking out these opportunities
and will give special attention to
the possibility of joint
fund-raising efforts to finance this
involvement.
The question of academic
credit properly rests with the
University faculty. Individual
faculty members and their
departments are responsible for
designing and approving courses.
Courses involving field
experiences of various kinds have
been and are part of the
curriculum. More can be added if
faculty are prepared to design and
teach them.
7. "A black man be hired as
Assistant to the President in
Financial Aids Department and be
in charge of all black financial
matters."
This is covered under item 3.
8. "A black man be in charge of
all black graduate admissions,
acting as coordinator for graduate
schools in graduate admissions."
There are two separate
problems here, one involving the
professional schools and another
having to do *ith the graduate
programs, mostly in H&S. The
former are relatively
self-contained and completely
autonomous in admissions
matters. Business, Law, and
Medicine have used their
autonomy to develop their own
minority recruiting programs.
Business and Law each has a
person in charge of its efforts; in
Medicine, a committee is doing
the work. Education has actively

ecruited minority students, most
notably in the STEP program. The
picture is more varied in
Engineering, which is more like
H&S. Electrical Engineering has
been active and effective, other
departments somewhat less so.
The problem in H&S is that of
autonomy among a large number
of small units. To illustrate the
complexity that this produces, of
15 H&S departments canvassed,
10 have some active concern for
attracting minority candidates.
The forms of this concern range
from active recruitment programs
to some kind of special
consideration for applicants who
can be identified as members of
minority groups. The canvass
disclosed no cooperative efforts
among departments. Each was
acting on its own. This suggests
that assistance from the Graduate
Dean's office in the form of
information, assistance in
recruitment, and the like, would
pay dividends by making more
effective the individual
department efforts already
underway. This kind of assistance
will be offered and will be made
more systematic than in the
past. Admission decisions would,
of course, continue to be made by
the individual departments.
9. "A black man be hired as
Vice-President of Stanford in
charge of all black affairs,
answerable only to the President."
Over the past several months it
has become clear that the duties
of Mr. Simmons and those to be
performed by the new
Mexican-American appointee can
be more effectively carried out
from the President's Office rather
than from within any one of the
vice-presidential areas. Therefore,
both positions are to carry the
title of Assistant to the President.
From the vantage point of the
President's Office, Mr. Simmons
and his counterpart will have
direct and easy access to the
President, and the ability to
handle problems in any of the vice
presidential areas at the request of
the President.
10. "The minority recruitment
committee for the Medical School
be given full power over minority
admissions."

As was indicated in Item 8, this
is an issue for the Medical School
faculty to decide.
11. "An Afro-American Studies
Department be established at
Stanford University."
The new degree-granting major
in African and Afro-American
Studies was developed by a
faculty-student committee. Its
form as a program rather than a
department represented the
committee's best judgment on
how to get a solid program started
at Stanford. It would at best be
premature to overrule that
judgment now.
It should be noted that the
Committee and others are aware
that our offerings are strongest in
African Studies and significantly
weaker in Afro-American studies.
The Committee believed that it is
valuable to bring together in a
more systematic way what is now
available and to work toward
providing what is not now
available. Some courses in the
program are new to Stanford this
year, including Racism and
Prejudice, African Civilizations,
the Politics of Minority Groups,
and others. New courses will be
added next year as faculty are
brought to Stanford with
competence in relevant fields. In
that connection, the University is
now negotiating with a major
scholar in the field in the hope
that he will join the faculty next
fall and assume the leadership of
the program. A decision on
departmental status, in this case as
in others, must follow from the
development of the program
rather than precede it.
12. "An Afro-American Cultural
Research Institute be established
at Stanford University."
There is a great need for
:esearch and curriculum
development in this field." The
University is actively seeking
funds for a program developed by
Professor Wesley Johnson of
History winch would start on
both of those and would include
PhD and post-doctoral training to
provide persons qualified to teach
in the field. We believe that this is
the most effective approach to
take, and we hope that
foundations and others will agree.
