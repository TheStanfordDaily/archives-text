# Reaction: Pitzer Blamed
## 
### FELICITY BARRINGER DAVID DAVENPORT 
Very few people on the
Stanford campus last night had
any opinion on the violent
demonstration that took place at
the Stanford bookstore yesterday
afternoon. Very few people knew
anything about it.
At Tresidder Union, several
people looked up from their
dinners in mild surprise upon
being told of the incident. When
asked for their opinions, many
had the same reply as graduate

student Donald Bamder, "1 don't
know the issues."
Curt Boylls, a graduate student
in electrical engineering, also
replied that he had only heard
snatches of what had happened.
"Someone came in this afternoon
and told me that something was
happening down at the
bookstore." He said that this was
all he had heard.
"Irrational behaviour is out of
place in a rational institution," he
added.
Of the people that did know
what had happened, several

place.the blame for the incident
on President Pitzer. Doron
Weinberg, unofficial counsel for
the defendants at the recent
hearings of the Stanford Judicial
Council, remarked, "I certainly
regard the anger and frustration
behind the action as justified. I
don't know if I would have gone
to the bookstore but the
university can't insist on having
the students react to it in a human
way when it won't relate to them
in a human way."
Yale Braunstein, speaker of the
student legislature, said, when
contacted yesterday evening, "A
major tactical error was made by
President Pitzer.
"A group of well-mannered
students left his office and the
hallways after a telephone request
from him that they do so.

"The group then waited for
more than twenty minutes
outside.
"Although they got repeated
reports that he was coming, he
never showed ud.
"No student could possibly be
blamed for getting upset after he
demonstrated his lack of
concern."
Harvey Hukari, president of
the Young Americans for
Freedom, (YAF) and William
Boyd, the president of the
Stanford chapter of the Young
Republicans, were unavailable for
comment.
Student body president Denis
Hayes, in a statement released to
the Stanford News Service
yesterday evening, said, "There
were a lot of mistakes made today
by both sides in the issue. But the

vast majority of students on this
campus do not want to see
constructive change halted either
as a result of apparent
administrative blundering or as a
result of the destructive acts of a
small number of individuals.
"A real effort must be made to
overcome the present trend
toward polarization. I will be
happy to use my office as an
intermediary between any
factions who are willing to resume
earnest bargaining in good faith.
"The Associated Students is
already on record as supporting
the essense of the Black Students
Union's demands, and it would be
tragic if these attempts at
constructive change were
forgotten. I hope the sides will
have met and begun bargaining
before school resumes next
Monday."

Very few people on the
Stanford campus last night had
any opinion on the violent
demonstration that took place at
the Stanford bookstore yesterday
afternoon. Very few people knew
anything about it.
At Tresidder Union, several
people looked up from their
dinners in mild surprise upon
being told of the incident. When
asked for their opinions, many
had the same reply as graduate

student Donald Bamder, "1 don't
know the issues."
Curt Boylls, a graduate student
in electrical engineering, also
replied that he had only heard
snatches of what had happened.
"Someone came in this afternoon
and told me that something was
happening down at the
bookstore." He said that this was
all he had heard.
"Irrational behaviour is out of
place in a rational institution," he
added.
Of the people that did know
what had happened, several

place.the blame for the incident
on President Pitzer. Doron
Weinberg, unofficial counsel for
the defendants at the recent
hearings of the Stanford Judicial
Council, remarked, "I certainly
regard the anger and frustration
behind the action as justified. I
don't know if I would have gone
to the bookstore but the
university can't insist on having
the students react to it in a human
way when it won't relate to them
in a human way."
Yale Braunstein, speaker of the
student legislature, said, when
contacted yesterday evening, "A
major tactical error was made by
President Pitzer.
"A group of well-mannered
students left his office and the
hallways after a telephone request
from him that they do so.

"The group then waited for
more than twenty minutes
outside.
"Although they got repeated
reports that he was coming, he
never showed ud.
"No student could possibly be
blamed for getting upset after he
demonstrated his lack of
concern."
Harvey Hukari, president of
the Young Americans for
Freedom, (YAF) and William
Boyd, the president of the
Stanford chapter of the Young
Republicans, were unavailable for
comment.
Student body president Denis
Hayes, in a statement released to
the Stanford News Service
yesterday evening, said, "There
