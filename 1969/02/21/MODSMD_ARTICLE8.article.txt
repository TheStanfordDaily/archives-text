# Mexican-American Students Question School of Education
## 
### RANDAL SAMSTAG 
What relevancy does Stanford
training of teachers have to the
education of Mexican-Americans
who comprise 17% of the
school-age population? The
M e x i can-American Student
Confederation (MASC) is seeking
an answer from the Stanford
School of Education.
In a meeting last week with
Dean H. Thomas James MASC
"urgently requested" that the
School of Education consider and
implement a number of proposals.
Included were requests for a
Mexican-American professor,
increased Mexican-American
recruitment and enrollment, a
review of minority admissions
criteria, and curriculum expansion
to better prepare educators for
dealing with the special problems
of Mexican-Americans.
Alienation Clear
Says Rudolfo Cancin, MASC
president, "a few figures from
census statistics make it clear that
alienation of Mexican-Americans
from the mainstream of society is
already advanced, and it is a
matter of greatest urgency to
reserve the process and to bring
Mexican-Americans to a
preception of their self-interest in
the institutions of society."
The Mexican-American is the
largest minority in California

comprising more than 14% of the
population. The annual income of
Mexican-Americans in California
is lower on the average than
blacks.
In California's public schools
the Mexican-American has the
highest drop-out rate. Over 50%
of the Spa n is h-s peaking
Mexican-Americans do not
complete eighth grade.
Sacramento Problems
Students cited the Sacramento
public school system as exemplary
of the special problem of
Mexican-Americans. There 20% of
the Mexican-American students
are placed in E.M.R. (Educatable
Mentally Retarded) classes while
there is evidence that these
students are not "mentally
retarded" but are merely unable to
overcome a language barrier.
MASC charges that there are
no courses in the School of
Education which are relevant to
Mexican-Americans. Says Dean
James, "If you mean, 'do we have
courses specifically tailored to
Mexican-Americans,' the answer is
no."
Only five of the 500 students
enrolled in the School of
Education are Mexican-American.
There are non enrolled i:i the
Doctorate program. This is to be
compared with the 33 black
«l'idents now enrolled.

The School of Education
recently appointed graduate
student Clark Jenkins as a special
recruiter for Mexican-Americans
to the Secondary Teacher
Education Program (STEP).
Students make it clear however
that this is the first year that
Mexican-Americans have been
recruited and that this was only at
the insistance of MASC members.
Dean James points out that of
the 15 students recruited, only
four have filed applications. Says
Cancino, "You should almost go
out and chase them."
Students suggest that quotas
should be established for
Mexican-American enrollment.
Graduate Student Association
representative Pat Stell says
quotas get the idea across with an
immediate impact to the entire
community.
She says, "One week after the
Medical School announced its
quota of ten minority students for
their class announced of seventy it
had over 20 applicants."
Dean James replies, "I don't
like quotas. We don't want to play
numbers games. We have asked
our search committee if targets,
not quotas, can be established in
these areas." He concludes, "You
are asking us to do what we are
trying to do as hard and as fast as
we can."

What relevancy does Stanford
training of teachers have to the
education of Mexican-Americans
who comprise 17% of the
school-age population? The
M e x i can-American Student
Confederation (MASC) is seeking
an answer from the Stanford
School of Education.
In a meeting last week with
Dean H. Thomas James MASC
"urgently requested" that the
School of Education consider and
implement a number of proposals.
Included were requests for a
Mexican-American professor,
increased Mexican-American
recruitment and enrollment, a
review of minority admissions
criteria, and curriculum expansion
to better prepare educators for
dealing with the special problems
of Mexican-Americans.
Alienation Clear
Says Rudolfo Cancin, MASC
president, "a few figures from
census statistics make it clear that
alienation of Mexican-Americans
from the mainstream of society is
already advanced, and it is a
matter of greatest urgency to
reserve the process and to bring
Mexican-Americans to a
preception of their self-interest in
the institutions of society."
The Mexican-American is the
largest minority in California

comprising more than 14% of the
population. The annual income of
Mexican-Americans in California
is lower on the average than
blacks.
In California's public schools
the Mexican-American has the
highest drop-out rate. Over 50%
of the Spa n is h-s peaking
Mexican-Americans do not
complete eighth grade.
Sacramento Problems
Students cited the Sacramento
public school system as exemplary
of the special problem of
Mexican-Americans. There 20% of
the Mexican-American students
are placed in E.M.R. (Educatable
Mentally Retarded) classes while
there is evidence that these
students are not "mentally
retarded" but are merely unable to
overcome a language barrier.
MASC charges that there are
no courses in the School of
Education which are relevant to
Mexican-Americans. Says Dean
James, "If you mean, 'do we have
courses specifically tailored to
Mexican-Americans,' the answer is
no."
Only five of the 500 students
enrolled in the School of
Education are Mexican-American.
There are non enrolled i:i the
Doctorate program. This is to be
compared with the 33 black
«l'idents now enrolled.

The School of Education
recently appointed graduate
student Clark Jenkins as a special
recruiter for Mexican-Americans
to the Secondary Teacher
Education Program (STEP).
Students make it clear however
that this is the first year that
Mexican-Americans have been
recruited and that this was only at
the insistance of MASC members.
Dean James points out that of
the 15 students recruited, only
four have filed applications. Says
Cancino, "You should almost go
out and chase them."
Students suggest that quotas
should be established for
Mexican-American enrollment.
Graduate Student Association
representative Pat Stell says
quotas get the idea across with an
immediate impact to the entire
community.
She says, "One week after the
Medical School announced its
quota of ten minority students for
their class announced of seventy it
had over 20 applicants."
Dean James replies, "I don't
like quotas. We don't want to play
numbers games. We have asked
our search committee if targets,
not quotas, can be established in
these areas." He concludes, "You
are asking us to do what we are
trying to do as hard and as fast as
we can."
