# Police Turn To Tear Gas To Stop Berkeley Strikers

### 
BERKELEY (AP) - Police
fired tear gas in rifle grenades,
tossed it in cannisters and sprayed
it from backpack dispensers for
two hours Thursday afternoon to
drive 2,000 students and
demonstrators from the
University of California campus.
The demonstrators hurled
rocks, large "cherry bomb"
firecrackers and bottles and
responded with tear gas of their
own.
There were barricades and
bonfires in nearby streets at
nightfall after hours of surging
conflict between the
demonstrators and an estimated
150 police officers.
There were at least nine arrests.
Several minor injuries were
reported from tossed rocks and
other missiles.
Both Sproul Hall, the campus
administration building, and the

nearby student union building
were closed after heavy tear gas
fumes drifted inside.
About 2,000 people jammed
into the area around Sproul Hall
when the tear gas flew. About the
same number had earlier staged a
rock-throwing march across
campus to University Hall where
the Board of Regents was
meeting.
Crowd Scattered
The crowd broke into three
groups, one retreating north
through Sather Gate, main
campus entrance.
Another poured into the
intersection of Bancroft and
Telegraph Avenues and threw up a
barricade of benches around a
stalled car.
A third group moved off
towards downtown Berkeley.
Police officers pursued, throwing
more tear gas.

Other officers formed a line at
the edge of the campus, facing the
milling mob in the street.
Acrid gas fumes clouded the
entire area, and most officers
donned masks.
The major violence and tear
gassing came in mid-afternoon
some three hours after about
2,000 demonstrators had marched
on University Hall while the
Regents were meeting.
Screaming, "We want Reagan,"
they broke some windows in the
building before highway
patrolmen and sheriff's deputies
forced them back from the main
entrance.
Gov. Reagan is not due to
attend the Regents' sessions until
Friday morning.
Scattered, the demonstrators
regathered in Sproul Plaza two
hours later and started another
rally.
