# Accused Students 'Justify' Actions
## 
### JENNY MATTHEWS 
Students accused of violating the
campus demonstration policy by dis
rupting last month's Trustees meeting
presented an extended statement of the
motivation behind their actions at Fri
day's Student Judicial Council (SJC)
hearing.
The defendants, mostly SDS mem
bers, attacked the failure of the Trustees
to listen to student demands and the
resulting necessity of confrontation in
order to force the airing of these con
cerns.
"At the January 14th Trustees meet
ing," complained defendant Christa
Mrak, "there were students outside of
glass doors trying to communicate with
Trustees . . .who were oblivious to our
very existence. . . and not caring to
find out why we were there.
'Trustees Untouchable'
"It seems pathetic," she added,
"That these sacrosanct men are un
touchable.
"They have yet to face up to the
issues we've raised â€”or their students."
Eight Trustees were requested to
attend the hearing to be questioned
about their individual and group in
volvement in various activities that are
objectionable to the defendants.
Five responded by letter, but none of
them showed up at the hearing.
One Trustee responded with a state
ment to the effect that the 29 students
were on trial and not the Trustees.
According to defendant Jim John
son, however, "The people who should
be on trail are those god-damned
mother-fucking Trustees . . . they're the
criminals."
Imperialism Denounced
The defendants denounced as crimi
nal the role that Stanford and the cor
porations of many of the Trustees play
"in furthering U.S. imperialist domina
tion in Southeast Asia and other devel
oping countries."
The students particularly attacked
these corporations' contributions to de
fense research and their "vested inter
ests" in the Vietnam war.
The Trustees were further criticized
for their membership in America's
"ruling class" which "controls the bulk
of U.S. wealth, and, therefore, political
power."
"The Trustees have a class interest to
preserve," stated defendant Jim Shoch,
and contended that the Trustees often
use the University to "further their own
class interests."
He continued that, "this is why
we're out to destroy."
"The differences between us and the
Trustees are not ones of communica
tion, Schach summarized, but definite
political, ideological, and non-negotiable
differences."
War Involvement Attacked
Defendant David Pugh presented a
lengthly description of the studies con
ducted by SRI, departments in the Uni
versity, and the corporations of the
Trustees, relating to chemical and bio
logical warfare, counterinsurgency in
Thailand, the Vietnam War, and military
research in general.
"Unless we start to act against these
things," Pugh stated, "there's going to
be a hell of a lot of hunger, illiteracy,
and a lot more people are going to die."

The defendants explained their justi
fication of confrontation politics.
"We know our differences have to be
resolved by force," declared Shoch. "No
one would listen to Stanford SDS until
we disrupted the Board meeting . . .
"We've been charged by the Trustees
that we threatened violence, yet they're
making decisions which further the vio
lence of the Vietnam war.
"If we had played by their rules,"
Shoch added, "we would have napalmed
them.
"We're going to get our demands
aired by whatever means necessary."
The verdict of the SJC should be dis
closed by the end of the week.
A more detailed account of the hear
ing will appear in tomorrow's Daily.
