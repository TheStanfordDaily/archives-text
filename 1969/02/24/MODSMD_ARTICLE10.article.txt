# Sports Scene
## Ups And Downs 
### 
On what was potentially one of the outstanding
sports weekends of the year, Stanford athletic teams
threw it in reverse, and dropped some extremely
important contests. There were victories, but the
defeats were most prominent and all heartbreakers.
The great swim team lost their undefeated status
at the hands of Yale, and the basketball team,
coming off two exciting wins reverted to their old
luckless form and blew a big lead in the last minute
to lose to Washington State. Rugby was a different
story, as the powerful ruggers came back from last
week's loss to UCLA to beat Cal, 18-8.
The rugby win gave the Indians a commanding
lead in the two-match series with Cal for the Big
Scrum Axe. The Axe, now held by Stanford, goes to
the team with the highest point total for the two
games. The deciding contest will be next Friday at
Berkeley.
Dick Ragsdale, Jim Kaufmann, and Pat "Red
Menace" Preston led the Card attack and
overpowered the Bears for their sixth win of the
year against only one loss.
Friday night proved tragic for Tribe pool prestige.
A peaked Yale swimming team knocked off
visiting Stanford by a decisive 71-42 in a ragged
anticlimax to the Indians' victory over USC a week
before.
The Eli's cracked Santa Clara's American record
in the 400 medley relay, handling the distance in
3:28.6 in the opening event of the meet. At least
half the events were won with the fastest times
registered in the country this season.
Yale sprinted down and shaved for the meet, and
the harvest of great performances was a rich one.
John Nelson took both the 1000 and 500 freestyles.
Steve Job won the 100 free and anchored both of
Yale's winning relays, throwing in a 45.2 to ice the
free relay.
Robin Waples also had a winning share in two
relays and won the 50 in 21.3. Dave Johnson
burned the 200 IM in 1:56.7 to snatch the race
away from Stanford's John Ferris. Ed Bettendorf's
52.7 backstroke relay leadoff and 1:57.5 200
backstroke both marked top national times.
Both Yale and Stanford's freestyle relays (3:07.6
and 3:08.1) beat the previous national best.
Stanford swimmers, who traditionally save the
all-or-nothing shave down—sprint down peak for the
NCAA's, swam generally better than they did
against USC but fell decisively short of the Yale
pace.
Luis Nicolao won the 200 free for Stanford with
the nation's top time of 1:44.3 and anchored the
free relay in 46.1.
At Pullman, Washington, it looked as if the
Stanford cagers were going to win again. But with
an 11 point deficit at half, the Cougars managed to
make it close, and finally pull it out, 69-68, on a
jumper by Rick Erickson with only :48 remaining.
WSU sub Blaine Ellis who is averaging .6 a game
in Pac-8 play, hit 13 in the last seven minutes, for
the victors. Don Griffin hit 16, but only four in the

second half, and he fouled out in the closing
moments of the contest.
Mai McElwain (11) also left early, and the last
minute scoring was up to Dennis O'Neill (13), Mike
Michel (13), and Bill Palmer (7).
The Indians against lost the cliffhanger.
Tonight, Stanford will play in Seattle against
Washington, and will attempt to salvage a split for
the series. The Huskies evened their conference
record Saturday at 5-5 by murdering Cal, 85-65.
Then it is home again, and practice awaiting the
arrival of UCLA Friday. Saturday afternoon is the
Inaugural game for Maples Pavilion against USC.
Individual game Stanford Student tickets are now
on sale at the Dept. of Athletics Ticket Booth for
the UCLA and USC basketball games. Tickets are
$1.00 each. A current quarter student body card
must be presented for each ticket purchased. No
more than four student body cards may be
presented by each student. Only those cards which
have not been punched for season tickets will be
honored.
Spirits were dampened on the baseball team this
weekend, as well.
Baseball Coach Ray Young had no comment last
night on reports that he was planning to dismantle
the Sunken Diamond Stadium and use the lumber
to build an ark.
The varsity endured its firth straight rainout on
Saturday as wet grounds forced postponement of a
scheduled double-header with Santa Clara here. One
of the games has been rescheduled as a single
contest at 2:30 this afternoon—weather permitting,
of course.
