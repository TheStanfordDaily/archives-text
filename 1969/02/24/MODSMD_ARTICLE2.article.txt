# Responsibility In Society
## Convocation On Role Of Science 
### DOUG ANDERSON 
A Stanford convocation to "face the
question of the role of science and its
responsibility in society" has been
scheduled for Tuesday, March 4.
The convocation parallels similar
convocations to be held throughout the
country on that day, and is organized
by a group of graduate students.
The idea for the convocation
originally grew out of call by MIT physi
cists for "a day of concern" about
government-supported scientific re
search. Their call has prompted convo
cations throughout the country at 40
different campuses, including Cornell,
Berkeley and Harvard.
The Stanford convocation does not
call for a work stoppage, or strike. "Our
purpose is not to dramatize opposition
to any set of policies outside the
scientific -technological community,"
stated Paul Grobstein, spokesman for
the national Committee for March 4.
"We wish instead to add new impetus
to the discussion within that com
munity on certain problems directly
concerning scientists—and on the more
general issue of the wider responsibili
ties of scientists and engineers.
"We hope to have the active involve
ment of both the scientific and non
scientific community in this effort."
The convocation will consist of after
noon and evening meetings in three
parts. At one o'clock there will be a
meeting in Memorial Church where four
addresses will be made concerning (1)
anti-ballistic missiles, (2) the value of
science and federal funding, (3) there

lation between science, industry, and
military needs, and (4) the implications
of new developments in biology as they
relate to man's concept of self and his
future being.
These addresses will be followed by a
series of panel and small group dis
cussions centered around the themes of
the talks. There will be at least one
seminar for each of these topics in ad
dition to several seminars concerned
with chemical warfare, population and
pollution control, and the role of the
scientist as a political force.
Following these seminars, the groups
will reconvene in Mem Chu at 7:30 p.m.
for an open discussion on the issues
raised during the day and a closing ad
dress.

Thus far, members of the entire Stan
ford scientific community have been
contacted to lend support. Sponsors in
clude: Prof. Joshua Lederberg and Prof.
Arthur Konrberg of the medical school,
Prof. Donald Kennedy and others in
biology; Prof. Leonard Schiff, physics;
Prof. David Gilbarg and others in math;
Provost Richard Lyman, Prof. Wolfgang
Sanofsky and Pfof. Sidney Drell of
SLAC; and Dean B. Davie Napier of the
Chapel.
"Scientists are feeling an increased
desire to participate in social decision
making," said Grobstein. "There is a de
sire, therefore, to bridge the gap be
tween scientists and non-scientists and
bring all of the sciences together for dis
cussion on these topics."

of "closing the door to communication." He griped that "they're not interested in our educa

scientific -technological community,"
stated Paul Grobstein, spokesman for
the national Committee for March 4.
"We wish instead to add new impetus
to the discussion within that com
munity on certain problems directly
concerning scientists—and on the more
general issue of the wider responsibili
ties of scientists and engineers.
"We hope to have the active involve
ment of both the scientific and non
scientific community in this effort."
The convocation will consist of after
noon and evening meetings in three
parts. At one o'clock there will be a
meeting in Memorial Church where four
addresses will be made concerning (1)
anti-ballistic missiles, (2) the value of
science and federal funding, (3) there

lation between science, industry, and
military needs, and (4) the implications
of new developments in biology as they
relate to man's concept of self and his
future being.
These addresses will be followed by a
series of panel and small group dis
cussions centered around the themes of
the talks. There will be at least one
seminar for each of these topics in ad
dition to several seminars concerned
with chemical warfare, population and
pollution control, and the role of the
scientist as a political force.
Following these seminars, the groups
will reconvene in Mem Chu at 7:30 p.m.
for an open discussion on the issues
raised during the day and a closing ad
dress.

Thus far, members of the entire Stan
ford scientific community have been
contacted to lend support. Sponsors in
clude: Prof. Joshua Lederberg and Prof.
Arthur Konrberg of the medical school,
Prof. Donald Kennedy and others in
biology; Prof. Leonard Schiff, physics;
Prof. David Gilbarg and others in math;
Provost Richard Lyman, Prof. Wolfgang
Sanofsky and Pfof. Sidney Drell of
SLAC; and Dean B. Davie Napier of the
Chapel.
"Scientists are feeling an increased
desire to participate in social decision
making," said Grobstein. "There is a de
sire, therefore, to bridge the gap be
tween scientists and non-scientists and
bring all of the sciences together for dis
cussion on these topics."

OPEN THE DOOR—During Friday's SJC hearing, defendant Marc Heller accused the Trustees
of "closing the door to communication." He griped that "they're not interested in our educa
tion. They wouldn't even come to this hearing."
A Stanford convocation to "face the
question of the role of science and its
responsibility in society" has been
scheduled for Tuesday, March 4.
The convocation parallels similar
convocations to be held throughout the
country on that day, and is organized
by a group of graduate students.
The idea for the convocation
originally grew out of call by MIT physi
cists for "a day of concern" about
government-supported scientific re
search. Their call has prompted convo
cations throughout the country at 40
different campuses, including Cornell,
Berkeley and Harvard.
The Stanford convocation does not
call for a work stoppage, or strike. "Our
purpose is not to dramatize opposition
to any set of policies outside the
scientific -technological community,"
stated Paul Grobstein, spokesman for
the national Committee for March 4.
"We wish instead to add new impetus
to the discussion within that com
munity on certain problems directly
concerning scientists—and on the more

ties of scientists and engineers.
