Election results for the seats to be
filled on the Education Council as well
as referenda from last weeks balloting
will not be released until late Monday.
The announcement was made by
election commissioner Bob Debs last
night.
According to Debs, "we haven't been
able to transcribe and run he data into
the computer. We are trying and this is
all we can do."
The ballots were key punched and
transcribed into computer data. Debs
said the data memory bank is not big
enough to handle the demands of the
program.
