# Pitzer, Faculty Reject Violence
## 
### SUSAN SWARD 
President Kenneth Pitzer last night
issued a statement concerning admini
stration negotiations with the Black Stu
dent Union on twelve BSU demands.
Pitzer's references to "Thursday
afternoon" concern the brief raid on the
Stanford Bookstore by members of the
Stanford black community. During the
five-minute raid glass cases were
smashed, book stands were tipped over
and volumes were strewn across the
floor.
The statement issued by Pitzer on
Sunday follows:
"The absence of any further destruc
tive acts since Thursday afternoon is an
encouraging indication that responsibil
ity and reason are being restored to the
campus. We intend to resume our dis
cussion on the BSU proposals and to
continue holding meetings as long as
there is no return to the atmosphere of
Thursday."
Pitzer concluded that he hoped the
statement indicated that now "we'll get
on with the negotiations."
No Coordination
The raid on Thursday followed an
unsuccessful effort on the part of the
blacks to meet with Pitzer and discuss
the demands. Pitzer and Richard Lyman
were arriving at the President's office in
an effort to meet with the blacks at the
time the bookstore was being raided.
Immediately following the raid, the
bookstore was closedâ€”to be re-opened
today. Damage to materials in the book
store was estimated at approximately
$1,000.
Although it had been rumored that
the BSU was going to make a statement
on Thursday's incident on Sunday
evening, no such statement was forth
coming when The Daily went to press.
End to Violence
The BSU was supposedly to an
nounce that no more violent incidents
like the raid on the bookstore would

occur if discussions with Pitzer on the
BSU demands moved forward at a rea
sonable rate.
At this time no arrests or charges
have been made against participants of
the bookstore raid or against persons
who entered the Union about 1:15 on
Thursday afternoon to take food from
the counters without paying.
In reaction to Thursday's events, on
Friday afternoon the Academic Senate
rejected the use of destructive tactics on
campus and urged continuation of
"Constructive negotiations between the
administration and student minority
groups."
Unanimous Decision
The resolution was adopted without
dissent at a special meeting called by the
Senate Steering Committee. The adop
tion followed lengthly discussion by
faculty representatives. The recolution
proclaimed,
"We reject . . .the use of destructive
tactics in the Stanford environment. We
urge all members of the University com
munity to work for an atmosphere of
reason and responsibility. Only in such a
climate can constructive change and
improvement be achieved in this com
munity."
