# Police Presence
## Berkeley Goals Seem Clouded 
### CRAIG WILSON 
BERKELEY—Things quieted down
measurably at the University of Califor
nia at Berkeley over the weekend as stu
dents and police paused for a respite
from what seemed at times to have be
come a cause with nearly forgotten
goals.
Over the weekend the University
Regents passed the Canaday Resolution
which promises "interim suspension"
for students accused of using force or
threats or of disrupting campus activi
ties.
The issue now is the police and
though the inconsistent chant of "Third
World College" still is heard, one won
ders how many students remember why
police were first called to campus orig
inally.
It's now an all-out war. Two or three
thousand students have banded together
for a number of reasons (and there are
many), bound by the unifying force of a
common "enemy." The result has been
what Governor Reagan calls "guerilla
warfare."
Picketers are still visible, but since
the middle of last week growing num
bers of students have come with violent
disruption in mind as a means and in
some cases as an end in itself.
Communication between the Third

World Liberation Front (TWLF) and the
administration broke down last week.
Chancellor Heyns remains firm in saying
that the student demands, at least in
their present form, are not implement
able. What has occurred since then has
been the presence of club swinging
police armed with mace, tear gas, and
most recently pepper gas.
So the students go each day fully
expecting violence, and getting it. And
the presence of police becomes evident
in pvpr increasing numbers

The atmosphere here seems almost
unreal. It must be experienced to be be
lieved.
Students begin gathering close to
noon at Sather gate, which by now has
become almost a symbol of the move
ment. Picket lines are vaguely delineated
as most students join in a circular path
just inside the gate.
Students often come in pairs, almost
as if one would bring a date to a show.
What this means is questionable, if not
irrelevant, but is a sort of demonstration
within a demonstration.
The police begin to arrive at 11 a.m.
By twelve they begin moving in waves

through the crowd, attempting to keep
the gate passable. At times it's rather
comical. Police form a wedge and the
crowd opens to allow them to pass
through and then closes behind them
immediately.
This frustrates the police and they
raise their sticks and form a solid line
clearing out students as they go. But
what occurs in the process is that the

police have isolated themselves. Stu
dents begin to pelt them with rocks,
stones, eggs and stinkbombs.
The result of all this has been a
standoff, as well as a signal for students
to begin marching in a huge procession
through the campus away from Sather
Gate.
In the past it has been these serpentin-
