# Police Presence
## Berkeley Goals Seem Clouded 
### CRAIG WILSON 
BERKELEY—Things quieted down
measurably at the University of Califor
nia at Berkeley over the weekend as stu
dents and police paused for a respite
from what seemed at times to have be
come a cause with nearly forgotten
goals.
Over the weekend the University
Regents passed the Canaday Resolution
which promises "interim suspension"
for students accused of using force or
threats or of disrupting campus activi
ties.
The issue now is the police and
though the inconsistent chant of "Third
World College" still is heard, one won
ders how many students remember why
police were first called to campus orig
inally.
It's now an all-out war. Two or three
thousand students have banded together
for a number of reasons (and there are
many), bound by the unifying force of a
common "enemy." The result has been
what Governor Reagan calls "guerilla
warfare."
Picketers are still visible, but since
the middle of last week growing num
bers of students have come with violent
disruption in mind as a means and in
some cases as an end in itself.
Communication between the Third

World Liberation Front (TWLF) and the
administration broke down last week.
Chancellor Heyns remains firm in saying
that the student demands, at least in
their present form, are not implement
able. What has occurred since then has
been the presence of club swinging
police armed with mace, tear gas, and
most recently pepper gas.
So the students go each day fully
expecting violence, and getting it. And
the presence of police becomes evident
in pvpr increasing numbers

The atmosphere here seems almost
unreal. It must be experienced to be be
lieved.
Students begin gathering close to
noon at Sather gate, which by now has
become almost a symbol of the move
ment. Picket lines are vaguely delineated
as most students join in a circular path
just inside the gate.
Students often come in pairs, almost
as if one would bring a date to a show.
What this means is questionable, if not
irrelevant, but is a sort of demonstration
within a demonstration.
The police begin to arrive at 11 a.m.
By twelve they begin moving in waves

through the crowd, attempting to keep
the gate passable. At times it's rather
comical. Police form a wedge and the
crowd opens to allow them to pass
through and then closes behind them
immediately.
This frustrates the police and they
raise their sticks and form a solid line
clearing out students as they go. But
what occurs in the process is that the

police have isolated themselves. Stu
dents begin to pelt them with rocks,
stones, eggs and stinkbombs.
The result of all this has been a
standoff, as well as a signal for students
to begin marching in a huge procession
through the campus away from Sather
Gate.
In the past it has been these serpentin-

ing processions which have pro
duced such destruction as has oc
curred in University Hall where
nearly every window on the street
side of the first floor has been
broken or cracked. It was here
that the University of California
Board of Regents met last Thurs
day and Friday.
By mid-afternoon the students
had returned to the center of cam
pus. The rock-throwing becomes
more intense. Police attempt to
ward off students, seemingly for
their own protection. From all ap
pearances students are more con
cerned with the presence of the
police than anything else. It seems
to be a battle of self-defense for
the police.
The police are in a rather
dichotomous situation. Their
presence seems to become a
liability—not only to the well
being of the University but for
themselves. While they ostensibly
are trying to protect the Uni
versity, destruction seems to be
come even worse than before.
Police begin clubbing students,
throwing cannisters of tear gas
and seemingly chasing the stu
dents into the streets. Students re
turn with rocks, bottles and near
ly anything else. The police are in
a very offensive position and yet
in a very defensive position at the
same moment.
The result is that as they at
tempt to protect themselves, their
own aggression becomes more ap
parent. Many policemen are seen
returning rocks thrown at them.
Clubbing becomes indiscriminate.
Last Wednesday police chased stu
dents in the Student Union, one
student being pushed through a
large window pane. Others were
clubbed as they tried to move out
of the way.
It's something everyone has
heard or read about. It's a heat of
the moment reaction that one at
tempts to sympathize with. And
yet it is police brutality in the
worst sense. The very pressure of
the police attempting to control
the crowd, has caused the crowd
to become uncontrollable.
It was a rather dramatic
moment last week when the
police en masse left students after
a day of serious trouble. Con
ditions improved almost immedi
ately. Picketing was limited and
most strikers left. The only large
numbers of students remaining
were the spectators who seem to
be everywhere. But it was as if the
issue had been settled - at least for
another day. The police had left.

The cause for protest was elimin
ated.
Obviously it is not that simple.
The Third World College will not
be forgotten. But many questions
remain. How much worse will the j
trouble become. Is there in fact a
causal-effect relationship between
the Third World demands and stu- j
dent violence or is the violence
something which has come about I
as a separate issue from the Third
World College?
That violence, or at least mass
student support, is something the
movement needs is unquestioned.
One suspects that it is this very
need which caused the TWLF ,
leaders to attempt to block off
Sather Gate in the first place,
when the movement was young.
It may even be that it was an
effort to bring police on campus,
to give white's something to iden
tify with; to unify with blacks.
The point is, the lines of students
actively supporting the strike are
not clearly defined.
The withdrawal of police to
morrow might prove such a great
victory for the majority of the
demonstrators that at the same
time the Third World would lose
momentum. At the least TWLF is
feeding on what is happening in
the streets. Before police came on
campus, student support, at least
actively was a unknown quantity.
But now that the cause seems to
be a common one, support ap
pears widespread.
But there are many issues here
and many factions represented.
Black Studies is a major issue, but
it certainly is not the only one—
and at the moment it seems at
times to be almost an excuse
rather than a reason.

It's something everyone has
heard or read about. It's a heat of
the moment reaction that one at
tempts to sympathize with. And
yet it is police brutality in the
worst sense. The very pressure of
the police attempting to control
the crowd, has caused the crowd
to become uncontrollable.
It was a rather dramatic
moment last week when the
police en masse left students after
a day of serious trouble. Con
ditions improved almost immedi
ately. Picketing was limited and
most strikers left. The only large
numbers of students remaining
were the spectators who seem to
be everywhere. But it was as if the
issue had been settled - at least for
another day. The police had left.

The cause for protest was elimin
ated.
Obviously it is not that simple.
The Third World College will not
be forgotten. But many questions
remain. How much worse will the j
trouble become. Is there in fact a
causal-effect relationship between
the Third World demands and stu- j
dent violence or is the violence
something which has come about I
as a separate issue from the Third
World College?
That violence, or at least mass
student support, is something the
movement needs is unquestioned.
One suspects that it is this very
need which caused the TWLF ,
leaders to attempt to block off
Sather Gate in the first place,
when the movement was young.
It may even be that it was an
effort to bring police on campus,
to give white's something to iden
tify with; to unify with blacks.
The point is, the lines of students
actively supporting the strike are
not clearly defined.
The withdrawal of police to
morrow might prove such a great
victory for the majority of the
demonstrators that at the same
time the Third World would lose
momentum. At the least TWLF is
feeding on what is happening in
the streets. Before police came on
campus, student support, at least
actively was a unknown quantity.
But now that the cause seems to
be a common one, support ap
pears widespread.
But there are many issues here
and many factions represented.
Black Studies is a major issue, but
it certainly is not the only one—
and at the moment it seems at
times to be almost an excuse
rather than a reason.
BERKELEY—Things quieted down
measurably at the University of Califor
nia at Berkeley over the weekend as stu
dents and police paused for a respite
from what seemed at times to have be
come a cause with nearly forgotten
goals.
Over the weekend the University
Regents passed the Canaday Resolution
which promises "interim suspension"
for students accused of using force or
threats or of disrupting campus activi
ties.
The issue now is the police and
though the inconsistent chant of "Third
World College" still is heard, one won
ders how many students remember why
police were first called to campus orig
inally.
It's now an all-out war. Two or three
thousand students have banded together
for a number of reasons (and there are
many), bound by the unifying force of a
common "enemy." The result has been
what Governor Reagan calls "guerilla
warfare."
Picketers are still visible, but since
the middle of last week growing num
bers of students have come with violent
disruption in mind as a means and in
some cases as an end in itself.
Communication between the Third

World Liberation Front (TWLF) and the
administration broke down last week.
Chancellor Heyns remains firm in saying
that the student demands, at least in
their present form, are not implement
able. What has occurred since then has
been the presence of club swinging
police armed with mace, tear gas, and
most recently pepper gas.
So the students go each day fully
expecting violence, and getting it. And
the presence of police becomes evident
in pvpr increasing numbers

The atmosphere here seems almost
unreal. It must be experienced to be be
lieved.
Students begin gathering close to
noon at Sather gate, which by now has
become almost a symbol of the move
ment. Picket lines are vaguely delineated
as most students join in a circular path
just inside the gate.
Students often come in pairs, almost
as if one would bring a date to a show.
What this means is questionable, if not
irrelevant, but is a sort of demonstration
within a demonstration.
The police begin to arrive at 11 a.m.
By twelve they begin moving in waves

through the crowd, attempting to keep
the gate passable. At times it's rather
comical. Police form a wedge and the
crowd opens to allow them to pass
through and then closes behind them
immediately.
This frustrates the police and they
raise their sticks and form a solid line
clearing out students as they go. But
what occurs in the process is that the

police have isolated themselves. Stu
dents begin to pelt them with rocks,
stones, eggs and stinkbombs.
The result of all this has been a
standoff, as well as a signal for students
to begin marching in a huge procession
through the campus away from Sather
Gate.

to be a battle of self-defense for
the police.
The police are in a rather
dichotomous situation. Their

Police begin clubbing students,
throwing cannisters of tear gas
and seemingly chasing the stu

The result is that as they at

own aggression becomes more ap

returning rocks thrown at them.

ing processions which have pro
duced such destruction as has oc
curred in University Hall where
nearly every window on the street
side of the first floor has been
broken or cracked. It was here
that the University of California
Board of Regents met last Thurs
day and Friday.
By mid-afternoon the students
had returned to the center of cam
pus. The rock-throwing becomes
more intense. Police attempt to
ward off students, seemingly for
their own protection. From all ap
pearances students are more con
cerned with the presence of the
police than anything else. It seems
to be a battle of self-defense for
the police.
The police are in a rather
dichotomous situation. Their
presence seems to become a
liability—not only to the well
being of the University but for
themselves. While they ostensibly
are trying to protect the Uni
versity, destruction seems to be
come even worse than before.
Police begin clubbing students,
throwing cannisters of tear gas
and seemingly chasing the stu
dents into the streets. Students re
turn with rocks, bottles and near
ly anything else. The police are in
a very offensive position and yet
in a very defensive position at the
same moment.
The result is that as they at
tempt to protect themselves, their
own aggression becomes more ap
parent. Many policemen are seen
returning rocks thrown at them.
Clubbing becomes indiscriminate.
Last Wednesday police chased stu
dents in the Student Union, one
student being pushed through a
large window pane. Others were
clubbed as they tried to move out
of the way.
It's something everyone has
heard or read about. It's a heat of
the moment reaction that one at
tempts to sympathize with. And
yet it is police brutality in the
worst sense. The very pressure of
the police attempting to control
the crowd, has caused the crowd
to become uncontrollable.
It was a rather dramatic
moment last week when the
police en masse left students after
a day of serious trouble. Con
ditions improved almost immedi
ately. Picketing was limited and
most strikers left. The only large
numbers of students remaining
were the spectators who seem to
be everywhere. But it was as if the
issue had been settled - at least for
another day. The police had left.

The cause for protest was elimin
ated.
Obviously it is not that simple.
The Third World College will not
be forgotten. But many questions
remain. How much worse will the j
trouble become. Is there in fact a
causal-effect relationship between
the Third World demands and stu- j
dent violence or is the violence
something which has come about I
as a separate issue from the Third
World College?
That violence, or at least mass
student support, is something the
movement needs is unquestioned.
One suspects that it is this very
need which caused the TWLF ,
leaders to attempt to block off
Sather Gate in the first place,
when the movement was young.
It may even be that it was an
effort to bring police on campus,
to give white's something to iden
tify with; to unify with blacks.
The point is, the lines of students
actively supporting the strike are
not clearly defined.
The withdrawal of police to
morrow might prove such a great
victory for the majority of the
demonstrators that at the same
time the Third World would lose
momentum. At the least TWLF is
feeding on what is happening in
the streets. Before police came on
campus, student support, at least
actively was a unknown quantity.
But now that the cause seems to
be a common one, support ap
pears widespread.
But there are many issues here
and many factions represented.
Black Studies is a major issue, but
it certainly is not the only one—
and at the moment it seems at
times to be almost an excuse
rather than a reason.
BERKELEY—Things quieted down
measurably at the University of Califor
nia at Berkeley over the weekend as stu
dents and police paused for a respite
from what seemed at times to have be
come a cause with nearly forgotten
goals.
Over the weekend the University
Regents passed the Canaday Resolution
which promises "interim suspension"
for students accused of using force or
threats or of disrupting campus activi
ties.
The issue now is the police and
though the inconsistent chant of "Third
World College" still is heard, one won
ders how many students remember why
police were first called to campus orig
inally.
It's now an all-out war. Two or three
thousand students have banded together
for a number of reasons (and there are
many), bound by the unifying force of a
common "enemy." The result has been
what Governor Reagan calls "guerilla
warfare."
Picketers are still visible, but since
the middle of last week growing num
bers of students have come with violent
disruption in mind as a means and in
some cases as an end in itself.
Communication between the Third

World Liberation Front (TWLF) and the
administration broke down last week.
Chancellor Heyns remains firm in saying
that the student demands, at least in
their present form, are not implement
able. What has occurred since then has
been the presence of club swinging
police armed with mace, tear gas, and
most recently pepper gas.
So the students go each day fully
expecting violence, and getting it. And
the presence of police becomes evident
in pvpr increasing numbers

The atmosphere here seems almost
unreal. It must be experienced to be be
lieved.
Students begin gathering close to
noon at Sather gate, which by now has
become almost a symbol of the move
ment. Picket lines are vaguely delineated
as most students join in a circular path
just inside the gate.
Students often come in pairs, almost
as if one would bring a date to a show.
What this means is questionable, if not
irrelevant, but is a sort of demonstration
within a demonstration.
The police begin to arrive at 11 a.m.
By twelve they begin moving in waves

through the crowd, attempting to keep
the gate passable. At times it's rather
comical. Police form a wedge and the
crowd opens to allow them to pass
through and then closes behind them
immediately.
This frustrates the police and they
raise their sticks and form a solid line
