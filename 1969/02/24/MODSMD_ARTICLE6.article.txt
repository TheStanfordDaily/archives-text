# Pitzer And The Blacks: The Great Misunderstanding
## 
### PHILIP TAUBMAN 
Where was Kenneth Pitzer at 2 p.m. last
Thursday?
A crowd of several hundred students, most
from the Black Student Union (BSU),was clus
tered in and about the President's Office in
Building 1. They expected Pitzer to appear
momentarily for a meeting with BSU leaders.
At 2:35 p.m. Pitzer still had not arrived. Word
spread among the crowd that he was due "in two
or three minutes."
Ten minutes later the president was not at
Building 1.
Left In Disgust
The crowd left in disgust. Five minutes later,
about 15 students swept into the Stanford Book
store, smashed glass cases, threw bookcases to
the floor, and scattered volumes across the store.
The raid lasted two minutes. By 3 p.m., only
stunned observers remained congregated by the
bookstore and in White Plaza.
Almost simultaneously with the lightning raid,
a Volkswagen microbus braked to a halt in front
of the Law School behind Building 1. Pitzer and
Provost Richard Lyman walked through the Law
School and on into Building 1. Only the presi
dent's staff was waiting.
The 1.3 miles from 512 Gerona Road to
Building 1 will never be longer. At 2 p.m. Pitzer
was at 512 Gerona, the on-campus home of Fred
Glover, his executive assistant, waiting for word
from his office about the possibility of meeting
with BSU leaders.
Pit'/.er Didn't Know
Pitzer, however, did not believe he was late
for an appointment with the BSU. Therein lies
the cause of crisis on Thursday afternoon.
A chronology of events on Thursday reveals
that a massive communications failure occured
between Pitzer and the BSU, and even between
Pitzer and his top administrative aides.
Trouble began before noon. Two BSU leaders,
Nate Kirtman and Leo Bazile, met at 10 a.m.

with Pitzer and Lyman to discuss the 12 de
mands presented by the BSU on February 4
during a noon rally in White Plaza.
Earlier Dale Rejected
The meeting date had been set by Pitzer and
the BSU leaders after the BSU had rejected three
earlier dates last week and the week before. The
BSU evidently postponed the earlier offers by
Pitzer to more fully prepare for their discussions
with the President.
According to Lyman, the Thursday morning
meeting progressed in a "very business-like man
ner." Lyman said late Thursday afternoon that,
"We discussed very practical and detailed ques
tions and there seemed to be agreement on many
noints."

bnortly betore noon, I'itzer declared he had a
luncheon appointment at the faculty club with
deans of the schools. The lunch is a monthly
affair, scheduled weeks in advance. Kirtman and
Bazile protested that their meeting with Pitzer
should continue through lunch. Pitzer claims
Kirtman was told about the lunch when the
meeting was arranged.
Pitzer said he could not cancel his other ap
pointment, but offered to meet with the BSU
leaders the next afternoon at 2. They agreed to
the meeting. Pitzer then left for the faculty club
as Kirtman and Bazile headed toward White Plaza
for a noon rally scheduled by the BSU.
At the rally Bazile announced Pitzer's decision
to lunch at the faculty club. He declared, "I say
that Chancellor Heyns has lunch engagements.
President Hayakawa does also . . . but if the shit
gets thick enough they cancel them."
He then proposed a choice to the assembly:
Did they want to discuss what they would say to
Pitzer on Friday or should they go talk to him
immediately?

The mass of students, nearly 400, appeared to
waver for a moment. A number of students
headed toward the president's office. The crowd
followed, chanting, "We want Pitzer." They
arrived at the office about 12:40, crowding into
the president's quarters.
The group discovered Pitzer had departed and
quickly set out toward the faculty club. They
entered the club and swarmed about the court
yard and halls. The chants continued outside the
door to the faculty dining room.
Pitzer stepped out and spoke to the students.
He said, "I was available to meet last week. It
was the BSU that choose to wait until this week.
We have agreed to meet again tomorrow after
noon." He then again refused to meet with the
demonstrators later Thursday afternoon, and dis
appeared back into the dining room.
Might IMeet A t 2
Assistant Provost James Simmons remained
with the crowd, and, after a few moments, de
clared to the students that he thought Pitzer
would meet with the BSU that afternoon (Thurs
day) at 2. Simmons immediately returned to the
dining room in search of Pitzer to persuade the
president to meet at 2 p.m.
Pitzer was gone. He had left the faculty club
by a side door. Glover later reported Pitzer left
the faculty club fearing bodily harm from the
demonstrators. Pitzer says he left to remove any
focus for crowd action. Glover claims he and
Pitzer were followed by several students as they
departed and therefore decided not to seek
refuge at either Pitzer's office or home. They
drove to Glover's house on Gerona Rd.
Unaware of Pitzer's destination, Simmons
immediately drove to Pitzer's home on campus.
When he arrived, Mrs. Pitzer was on the phone
speaking to her husband. Simmons spoke to
Pitzer and explained that he ought to make a
meeting at 2 o'clock. Pitzer OK'd the plan with
the condition that an atmosphere exist suitable
to reasonable discussion.

During Simmons' chase after Pitzer, the crowd
had left the faculty club and arrived at Tresidder
Union about 1:15. They massed into the cafe
teria section, freely taking drink and food. The
Union later valued the food and drink at a $100
loss.
Simmons and Bill Wyman, associate dean of
students, meanwhile left Pitzer's house and drove
to the Union. After talking to students and BSU
leaders, Simmons phoned Pitzer at Glover's
house, this time advising him to cancel the 2 p.m.
meeting because the crowd was in a dangerous
mood. Pitzer told Simmons to cancel the meet
ing.
About 1:45 p.m., the crowd, completely un
aware of either call by Simmons, marched back
to Pitzer's office. BSU leaders were met there by
Simmons who told them the president would not
meet at the scheduled hour. There was discussion
about Pitzer's decision during which Simmons
and Wyman decided that if all demonstrators
remained outside the offices, a meeting could be
held. The BSU leaders asked students to clear
Building 1. It was cleared after a few minutes'
delay.
Communication Lacking
At this point, all communications broke
down. It was now about 2:30. No one had told
the crowd about Pitzer's conversations with Sim
mons and his double change of plans. The crowd
thought Pitzer was consciously not appearing for
a 2 p.m. appointment. The building was cleared
between 2:15 and 2:30. The crowd around the
building was growing increasingly impatient and
angry.
Upstairs, once the building had been cleared,
Wyman asked a secretary to immediately dial
Pitzer's number so he and Simmons could ask the
president to rush back to his office.
The line was busy. Glover's house has only
one phone. Wyman and Simmons waited for 10
minutes before the call went through. Simmons
spoke first, urgently advising Pitzer to come to

his office. Simmons told him the building had
been cleared and discussions could take place.
Pitzer agreed. Subsequently he spoke to Wyman
and Bernard Gunther, a law professor.
'Come Without Delay'
As Pitzer talked, Simmons told the crowd the
president was on his way and would arrive in 10
minutes. It was about 2:35. Pitzer was still on
the phone. Wyman, realizing Pitzer had to rush,
returned to the phone and told Pitzer that he had
to come without delay. The conversation ended.
The crowd now expected Pitzer any minute.
BSU leaders decided to wait five more minutes.
At the deadline, the time was extended several
more minutes. Finally, Bazile announced he was
leaving and others could do what they wanted.
The angry crowd walked to White Plaza as
Pitzer and Lyman were driving to Building 1.
Students raided the bookstore as Pitzer reached
his office.
Not Informed
The demonstrators were never informed about
Pitzer's whereabouts and his triple decision
changes. They were never told about the phone
delay in reaching Pitzer and the 10 minute drive
from Glover's house. They knew only that the
president was late, very late for a scheduled
meeting and they were furious that he hadn't
come.
Pitzer was totally unaware that his alterations
in plans had not been relayed to the students. He
assumed they realized he did not intend to meet
at 2 p.m. and that his eventual decision to come
was a special effort on his part, not a last minute
rush to an already delayed meeting.
Perhaps Richard Lyman could have driven his
microbus faster. Yet by that time speed could
not catch up with lost contact and misunder
standing.
It was too late to run because people on both
sides had forgotten to walk.

Where was Kenneth Pitzer at 2 p.m. last

A crowd of several hundred students, most
from the Black Student Union (BSU),was clus

was the BSU that choose to wait until this week.
We have agreed to meet again tomorrow after
noon." He then again refused to meet with the
demonstrators later Thursday afternoon, and dis
appeared back into the dining room.
Might IMeet A t 2
Assistant Provost James Simmons remained
with the crowd, and, after a few moments, de
clared to the students that he thought Pitzer
would meet with the BSU that afternoon (Thurs
day) at 2. Simmons immediately returned to the
dining room in search of Pitzer to persuade the
president to meet at 2 p.m.
Pitzer was gone. He had left the faculty club
by a side door. Glover later reported Pitzer left
the faculty club fearing bodily harm from the
demonstrators. Pitzer says he left to remove any
focus for crowd action. Glover claims he and
Pitzer were followed by several students as they
departed and therefore decided not to seek
refuge at either Pitzer's office or home. They
drove to Glover's house on Gerona Rd.
Unaware of Pitzer's destination, Simmons
immediately drove to Pitzer's home on campus.
When he arrived, Mrs. Pitzer was on the phone
speaking to her husband. Simmons spoke to
Pitzer and explained that he ought to make a
meeting at 2 o'clock. Pitzer OK'd the plan with
the condition that an atmosphere exist suitable
to reasonable discussion.

During Simmons' chase after Pitzer, the crowd
had left the faculty club and arrived at Tresidder
Union about 1:15. They massed into the cafe
teria section, freely taking drink and food. The
Union later valued the food and drink at a $100
loss.
Simmons and Bill Wyman, associate dean of
students, meanwhile left Pitzer's house and drove
to the Union. After talking to students and BSU
leaders, Simmons phoned Pitzer at Glover's
house, this time advising him to cancel the 2 p.m.
meeting because the crowd was in a dangerous
mood. Pitzer told Simmons to cancel the meet
ing.
About 1:45 p.m., the crowd, completely un
aware of either call by Simmons, marched back
to Pitzer's office. BSU leaders were met there by
Simmons who told them the president would not
meet at the scheduled hour. There was discussion
about Pitzer's decision during which Simmons
and Wyman decided that if all demonstrators
remained outside the offices, a meeting could be
held. The BSU leaders asked students to clear
Building 1. It was cleared after a few minutes'
delay.
Communication Lacking
At this point, all communications broke
down. It was now about 2:30. No one had told
the crowd about Pitzer's conversations with Sim
mons and his double change of plans. The crowd
thought Pitzer was consciously not appearing for
a 2 p.m. appointment. The building was cleared
between 2:15 and 2:30. The crowd around the
building was growing increasingly impatient and
angry.
Upstairs, once the building had been cleared,
Wyman asked a secretary to immediately dial
Pitzer's number so he and Simmons could ask the
president to rush back to his office.
The line was busy. Glover's house has only
one phone. Wyman and Simmons waited for 10
minutes before the call went through. Simmons
spoke first, urgently advising Pitzer to come to

his office. Simmons told him the building had
been cleared and discussions could take place.
Pitzer agreed. Subsequently he spoke to Wyman
and Bernard Gunther, a law professor.
'Come Without Delay'
As Pitzer talked, Simmons told the crowd the
president was on his way and would arrive in 10
minutes. It was about 2:35. Pitzer was still on
the phone. Wyman, realizing Pitzer had to rush,
returned to the phone and told Pitzer that he had
to come without delay. The conversation ended.
The crowd now expected Pitzer any minute.
BSU leaders decided to wait five more minutes.
At the deadline, the time was extended several
more minutes. Finally, Bazile announced he was
leaving and others could do what they wanted.
The angry crowd walked to White Plaza as
Pitzer and Lyman were driving to Building 1.
Students raided the bookstore as Pitzer reached
his office.
Not Informed
The demonstrators were never informed about
Pitzer's whereabouts and his triple decision
changes. They were never told about the phone
delay in reaching Pitzer and the 10 minute drive
from Glover's house. They knew only that the
president was late, very late for a scheduled
meeting and they were furious that he hadn't
come.
Pitzer was totally unaware that his alterations
in plans had not been relayed to the students. He
assumed they realized he did not intend to meet
at 2 p.m. and that his eventual decision to come
was a special effort on his part, not a last minute
rush to an already delayed meeting.
Perhaps Richard Lyman could have driven his
microbus faster. Yet by that time speed could
not catch up with lost contact and misunder
standing.
It was too late to run because people on both
sides had forgotten to walk.

Vews Anolysis
Where was Kenneth Pitzer at 2 p.m. last
Thursday?
A crowd of several hundred students, most
from the Black Student Union (BSU),was clus
tered in and about the President's Office in
Building 1. They expected Pitzer to appear
momentarily for a meeting with BSU leaders.
At 2:35 p.m. Pitzer still had not arrived. Word
spread among the crowd that he was due "in two
or three minutes."
Ten minutes later the president was not at
Building 1.
Left In Disgust
The crowd left in disgust. Five minutes later,
about 15 students swept into the Stanford Book
store, smashed glass cases, threw bookcases to
the floor, and scattered volumes across the store.
The raid lasted two minutes. By 3 p.m., only
stunned observers remained congregated by the
bookstore and in White Plaza.
Almost simultaneously with the lightning raid,
a Volkswagen microbus braked to a halt in front
of the Law School behind Building 1. Pitzer and
Provost Richard Lyman walked through the Law
School and on into Building 1. Only the presi
dent's staff was waiting.
The 1.3 miles from 512 Gerona Road to
Building 1 will never be longer. At 2 p.m. Pitzer
was at 512 Gerona, the on-campus home of Fred
Glover, his executive assistant, waiting for word
from his office about the possibility of meeting
with BSU leaders.
Pit'/.er Didn't Know
Pitzer, however, did not believe he was late
for an appointment with the BSU. Therein lies
the cause of crisis on Thursday afternoon.
A chronology of events on Thursday reveals
that a massive communications failure occured
between Pitzer and the BSU, and even between
Pitzer and his top administrative aides.
Trouble began before noon. Two BSU leaders,
Nate Kirtman and Leo Bazile, met at 10 a.m.

with Pitzer and Lyman to discuss the 12 de
mands presented by the BSU on February 4
during a noon rally in White Plaza.
Earlier Dale Rejected
The meeting date had been set by Pitzer and
the BSU leaders after the BSU had rejected three
earlier dates last week and the week before. The
BSU evidently postponed the earlier offers by
Pitzer to more fully prepare for their discussions
with the President.
According to Lyman, the Thursday morning
meeting progressed in a "very business-like man
ner." Lyman said late Thursday afternoon that,
"We discussed very practical and detailed ques
tions and there seemed to be agreement on many
noints."

bnortly betore noon, I'itzer declared he had a
luncheon appointment at the faculty club with
deans of the schools. The lunch is a monthly
affair, scheduled weeks in advance. Kirtman and
Bazile protested that their meeting with Pitzer
should continue through lunch. Pitzer claims
Kirtman was told about the lunch when the
meeting was arranged.
Pitzer said he could not cancel his other ap
pointment, but offered to meet with the BSU
leaders the next afternoon at 2. They agreed to
the meeting. Pitzer then left for the faculty club
as Kirtman and Bazile headed toward White Plaza
for a noon rally scheduled by the BSU.
At the rally Bazile announced Pitzer's decision
to lunch at the faculty club. He declared, "I say
that Chancellor Heyns has lunch engagements.
President Hayakawa does also . . . but if the shit
gets thick enough they cancel them."
He then proposed a choice to the assembly:
Did they want to discuss what they would say to
Pitzer on Friday or should they go talk to him
immediately?

The mass of students, nearly 400, appeared to
waver for a moment. A number of students
headed toward the president's office. The crowd
followed, chanting, "We want Pitzer." They
arrived at the office about 12:40, crowding into
the president's quarters.
The group discovered Pitzer had departed and
quickly set out toward the faculty club. They
entered the club and swarmed about the court
yard and halls. The chants continued outside the
door to the faculty dining room.
Pitzer stepped out and spoke to the students.
He said, "I was available to meet last week. It
was the BSU that choose to wait until this week.
We have agreed to meet again tomorrow after
noon." He then again refused to meet with the
demonstrators later Thursday afternoon, and dis
appeared back into the dining room.

Pitzer's whereabouts and his triple decision
changes. They were never told about the phone
delay in reaching Pitzer and the 10 minute drive
from Glover's house. They knew only that the
president was late, very late for a scheduled
meeting and they were furious that he hadn't
come.
Pitzer was totally unaware that his alterations
in plans had not been relayed to the students. He
assumed they realized he did not intend to meet
at 2 p.m. and that his eventual decision to come
was a special effort on his part, not a last minute
rush to an already delayed meeting.
Perhaps Richard Lyman could have driven his
microbus faster. Yet by that time speed could
not catch up with lost contact and misunder
standing.
It was too late to run because people on both
sides had forgotten to walk.

Vews Anolysis
Where was Kenneth Pitzer at 2 p.m. last
Thursday?
A crowd of several hundred students, most
from the Black Student Union (BSU),was clus
tered in and about the President's Office in
Building 1. They expected Pitzer to appear
momentarily for a meeting with BSU leaders.
At 2:35 p.m. Pitzer still had not arrived. Word
spread among the crowd that he was due "in two
or three minutes."
Ten minutes later the president was not at
Building 1.
Left In Disgust
The crowd left in disgust. Five minutes later,
about 15 students swept into the Stanford Book
store, smashed glass cases, threw bookcases to
the floor, and scattered volumes across the store.
The raid lasted two minutes. By 3 p.m., only
stunned observers remained congregated by the
bookstore and in White Plaza.
Almost simultaneously with the lightning raid,
a Volkswagen microbus braked to a halt in front
of the Law School behind Building 1. Pitzer and
Provost Richard Lyman walked through the Law
School and on into Building 1. Only the presi
dent's staff was waiting.
The 1.3 miles from 512 Gerona Road to
Building 1 will never be longer. At 2 p.m. Pitzer
was at 512 Gerona, the on-campus home of Fred
Glover, his executive assistant, waiting for word
from his office about the possibility of meeting
with BSU leaders.
Pit'/.er Didn't Know
Pitzer, however, did not believe he was late
for an appointment with the BSU. Therein lies
the cause of crisis on Thursday afternoon.
A chronology of events on Thursday reveals
that a massive communications failure occured
between Pitzer and the BSU, and even between
Pitzer and his top administrative aides.
Trouble began before noon. Two BSU leaders,
Nate Kirtman and Leo Bazile, met at 10 a.m.

with Pitzer and Lyman to discuss the 12 de
mands presented by the BSU on February 4
during a noon rally in White Plaza.
Earlier Dale Rejected
The meeting date had been set by Pitzer and
the BSU leaders after the BSU had rejected three
earlier dates last week and the week before. The
BSU evidently postponed the earlier offers by
Pitzer to more fully prepare for their discussions
with the President.
According to Lyman, the Thursday morning
meeting progressed in a "very business-like man
ner." Lyman said late Thursday afternoon that,
"We discussed very practical and detailed ques
tions and there seemed to be agreement on many
noints."

bnortly betore noon, I'itzer declared he had a
luncheon appointment at the faculty club with
deans of the schools. The lunch is a monthly
affair, scheduled weeks in advance. Kirtman and
Bazile protested that their meeting with Pitzer
should continue through lunch. Pitzer claims
Kirtman was told about the lunch when the
meeting was arranged.
Pitzer said he could not cancel his other ap
pointment, but offered to meet with the BSU
leaders the next afternoon at 2. They agreed to
the meeting. Pitzer then left for the faculty club
as Kirtman and Bazile headed toward White Plaza
for a noon rally scheduled by the BSU.
At the rally Bazile announced Pitzer's decision
to lunch at the faculty club. He declared, "I say
that Chancellor Heyns has lunch engagements.
President Hayakawa does also . . . but if the shit
gets thick enough they cancel them."
He then proposed a choice to the assembly:
Did they want to discuss what they would say to
Pitzer on Friday or should they go talk to him
immediately?

The mass of students, nearly 400, appeared to
waver for a moment. A number of students
headed toward the president's office. The crowd
followed, chanting, "We want Pitzer." They
arrived at the office about 12:40, crowding into
the president's quarters.
The group discovered Pitzer had departed and
quickly set out toward the faculty club. They
entered the club and swarmed about the court
yard and halls. The chants continued outside the
door to the faculty dining room.
Pitzer stepped out and spoke to the students.
He said, "I was available to meet last week. It
was the BSU that choose to wait until this week.
We have agreed to meet again tomorrow after
noon." He then again refused to meet with the
demonstrators later Thursday afternoon, and dis
appeared back into the dining room.
Might IMeet A t 2
Assistant Provost James Simmons remained
with the crowd, and, after a few moments, de
clared to the students that he thought Pitzer
would meet with the BSU that afternoon (Thurs
day) at 2. Simmons immediately returned to the
dining room in search of Pitzer to persuade the
president to meet at 2 p.m.
Pitzer was gone. He had left the faculty club
by a side door. Glover later reported Pitzer left
the faculty club fearing bodily harm from the
demonstrators. Pitzer says he left to remove any
focus for crowd action. Glover claims he and
Pitzer were followed by several students as they
departed and therefore decided not to seek
refuge at either Pitzer's office or home. They
drove to Glover's house on Gerona Rd.
Unaware of Pitzer's destination, Simmons
immediately drove to Pitzer's home on campus.
When he arrived, Mrs. Pitzer was on the phone
speaking to her husband. Simmons spoke to
Pitzer and explained that he ought to make a
meeting at 2 o'clock. Pitzer OK'd the plan with
the condition that an atmosphere exist suitable
to reasonable discussion.

During Simmons' chase after Pitzer, the crowd
had left the faculty club and arrived at Tresidder
Union about 1:15. They massed into the cafe
teria section, freely taking drink and food. The
Union later valued the food and drink at a $100
loss.
Simmons and Bill Wyman, associate dean of
students, meanwhile left Pitzer's house and drove
to the Union. After talking to students and BSU
leaders, Simmons phoned Pitzer at Glover's
house, this time advising him to cancel the 2 p.m.
meeting because the crowd was in a dangerous
mood. Pitzer told Simmons to cancel the meet
ing.
About 1:45 p.m., the crowd, completely un
aware of either call by Simmons, marched back
to Pitzer's office. BSU leaders were met there by
Simmons who told them the president would not
meet at the scheduled hour. There was discussion
about Pitzer's decision during which Simmons
and Wyman decided that if all demonstrators
remained outside the offices, a meeting could be
held. The BSU leaders asked students to clear
Building 1. It was cleared after a few minutes'
delay.
Communication Lacking
At this point, all communications broke
down. It was now about 2:30. No one had told
the crowd about Pitzer's conversations with Sim
mons and his double change of plans. The crowd
thought Pitzer was consciously not appearing for
a 2 p.m. appointment. The building was cleared
between 2:15 and 2:30. The crowd around the
building was growing increasingly impatient and
angry.
Upstairs, once the building had been cleared,
Wyman asked a secretary to immediately dial
Pitzer's number so he and Simmons could ask the
president to rush back to his office.
The line was busy. Glover's house has only
one phone. Wyman and Simmons waited for 10
minutes before the call went through. Simmons
spoke first, urgently advising Pitzer to come to

his office. Simmons told him the building had
been cleared and discussions could take place.
Pitzer agreed. Subsequently he spoke to Wyman
and Bernard Gunther, a law professor.
'Come Without Delay'
As Pitzer talked, Simmons told the crowd the
president was on his way and would arrive in 10
minutes. It was about 2:35. Pitzer was still on
the phone. Wyman, realizing Pitzer had to rush,
returned to the phone and told Pitzer that he had
to come without delay. The conversation ended.
The crowd now expected Pitzer any minute.
BSU leaders decided to wait five more minutes.
At the deadline, the time was extended several
more minutes. Finally, Bazile announced he was
leaving and others could do what they wanted.
The angry crowd walked to White Plaza as
Pitzer and Lyman were driving to Building 1.
Students raided the bookstore as Pitzer reached
his office.

The demonstrators were never informed about
Pitzer's whereabouts and his triple decision
changes. They were never told about the phone

He then proposed a choice to the assembly:
Did they want to discuss what they would say to
Pitzer on Friday or should they go talk to him
immediately?

The mass of students, nearly 400, appeared to
waver for a moment. A number of students
headed toward the president's office. The crowd
followed, chanting, "We want Pitzer." They
arrived at the office about 12:40, crowding into
the president's quarters.
The group discovered Pitzer had departed and
quickly set out toward the faculty club. They
entered the club and swarmed about the court
yard and halls. The chants continued outside the
door to the faculty dining room.
Pitzer stepped out and spoke to the students.
He said, "I was available to meet last week. It
was the BSU that choose to wait until this week.
We have agreed to meet again tomorrow after
noon." He then again refused to meet with the
demonstrators later Thursday afternoon, and dis
appeared back into the dining room.
Might IMeet A t 2
Assistant Provost James Simmons remained
with the crowd, and, after a few moments, de
clared to the students that he thought Pitzer
would meet with the BSU that afternoon (Thurs
day) at 2. Simmons immediately returned to the
dining room in search of Pitzer to persuade the
president to meet at 2 p.m.
Pitzer was gone. He had left the faculty club
by a side door. Glover later reported Pitzer left
the faculty club fearing bodily harm from the
demonstrators. Pitzer says he left to remove any
focus for crowd action. Glover claims he and
Pitzer were followed by several students as they
departed and therefore decided not to seek
refuge at either Pitzer's office or home. They
drove to Glover's house on Gerona Rd.
Unaware of Pitzer's destination, Simmons
immediately drove to Pitzer's home on campus.
When he arrived, Mrs. Pitzer was on the phone
speaking to her husband. Simmons spoke to
Pitzer and explained that he ought to make a
meeting at 2 o'clock. Pitzer OK'd the plan with
the condition that an atmosphere exist suitable
to reasonable discussion.

During Simmons' chase after Pitzer, the crowd
had left the faculty club and arrived at Tresidder
Union about 1:15. They massed into the cafe
teria section, freely taking drink and food. The
Union later valued the food and drink at a $100
loss.
Simmons and Bill Wyman, associate dean of
students, meanwhile left Pitzer's house and drove
to the Union. After talking to students and BSU
leaders, Simmons phoned Pitzer at Glover's
house, this time advising him to cancel the 2 p.m.
meeting because the crowd was in a dangerous
mood. Pitzer told Simmons to cancel the meet
ing.
About 1:45 p.m., the crowd, completely un
aware of either call by Simmons, marched back
to Pitzer's office. BSU leaders were met there by
Simmons who told them the president would not
meet at the scheduled hour. There was discussion
about Pitzer's decision during which Simmons
and Wyman decided that if all demonstrators
remained outside the offices, a meeting could be
held. The BSU leaders asked students to clear
Building 1. It was cleared after a few minutes'
delay.
Communication Lacking
At this point, all communications broke
down. It was now about 2:30. No one had told
the crowd about Pitzer's conversations with Sim
mons and his double change of plans. The crowd
thought Pitzer was consciously not appearing for
a 2 p.m. appointment. The building was cleared
between 2:15 and 2:30. The crowd around the
building was growing increasingly impatient and
angry.
Upstairs, once the building had been cleared,
Wyman asked a secretary to immediately dial
Pitzer's number so he and Simmons could ask the
president to rush back to his office.
The line was busy. Glover's house has only
one phone. Wyman and Simmons waited for 10
minutes before the call went through. Simmons
spoke first, urgently advising Pitzer to come to

his office. Simmons told him the building had
been cleared and discussions could take place.
Pitzer agreed. Subsequently he spoke to Wyman
and Bernard Gunther, a law professor.
'Come Without Delay'
As Pitzer talked, Simmons told the crowd the
president was on his way and would arrive in 10
minutes. It was about 2:35. Pitzer was still on
the phone. Wyman, realizing Pitzer had to rush,
returned to the phone and told Pitzer that he had
to come without delay. The conversation ended.
The crowd now expected Pitzer any minute.
BSU leaders decided to wait five more minutes.
At the deadline, the time was extended several
more minutes. Finally, Bazile announced he was
leaving and others could do what they wanted.
The angry crowd walked to White Plaza as
Pitzer and Lyman were driving to Building 1.
Students raided the bookstore as Pitzer reached
his office.
Not Informed
The demonstrators were never informed about
Pitzer's whereabouts and his triple decision
changes. They were never told about the phone
delay in reaching Pitzer and the 10 minute drive
from Glover's house. They knew only that the
president was late, very late for a scheduled
meeting and they were furious that he hadn't
come.
Pitzer was totally unaware that his alterations
in plans had not been relayed to the students. He
assumed they realized he did not intend to meet
at 2 p.m. and that his eventual decision to come
was a special effort on his part, not a last minute
rush to an already delayed meeting.
Perhaps Richard Lyman could have driven his
microbus faster. Yet by that time speed could
not catch up with lost contact and misunder
standing.
It was too late to run because people on both
sides had forgotten to walk.

Vews Anolysis
Where was Kenneth Pitzer at 2 p.m. last
Thursday?
A crowd of several hundred students, most
from the Black Student Union (BSU),was clus
tered in and about the President's Office in
Building 1. They expected Pitzer to appear
momentarily for a meeting with BSU leaders.
At 2:35 p.m. Pitzer still had not arrived. Word
spread among the crowd that he was due "in two
or three minutes."
Ten minutes later the president was not at
Building 1.
Left In Disgust
The crowd left in disgust. Five minutes later,
about 15 students swept into the Stanford Book
store, smashed glass cases, threw bookcases to
the floor, and scattered volumes across the store.
The raid lasted two minutes. By 3 p.m., only
stunned observers remained congregated by the
bookstore and in White Plaza.
Almost simultaneously with the lightning raid,
a Volkswagen microbus braked to a halt in front
of the Law School behind Building 1. Pitzer and
Provost Richard Lyman walked through the Law
School and on into Building 1. Only the presi
dent's staff was waiting.
The 1.3 miles from 512 Gerona Road to
Building 1 will never be longer. At 2 p.m. Pitzer
was at 512 Gerona, the on-campus home of Fred
Glover, his executive assistant, waiting for word
from his office about the possibility of meeting
with BSU leaders.
Pit'/.er Didn't Know
Pitzer, however, did not believe he was late
for an appointment with the BSU. Therein lies
the cause of crisis on Thursday afternoon.
A chronology of events on Thursday reveals
that a massive communications failure occured
between Pitzer and the BSU, and even between
Pitzer and his top administrative aides.
Trouble began before noon. Two BSU leaders,
Nate Kirtman and Leo Bazile, met at 10 a.m.

with Pitzer and Lyman to discuss the 12 de
mands presented by the BSU on February 4
during a noon rally in White Plaza.
Earlier Dale Rejected
The meeting date had been set by Pitzer and
the BSU leaders after the BSU had rejected three
earlier dates last week and the week before. The
BSU evidently postponed the earlier offers by
Pitzer to more fully prepare for their discussions
with the President.
According to Lyman, the Thursday morning
meeting progressed in a "very business-like man
ner." Lyman said late Thursday afternoon that,
"We discussed very practical and detailed ques
tions and there seemed to be agreement on many
noints."

bnortly betore noon, I'itzer declared he had a
luncheon appointment at the faculty club with
deans of the schools. The lunch is a monthly
affair, scheduled weeks in advance. Kirtman and
Bazile protested that their meeting with Pitzer
should continue through lunch. Pitzer claims
Kirtman was told about the lunch when the
meeting was arranged.
Pitzer said he could not cancel his other ap
pointment, but offered to meet with the BSU
leaders the next afternoon at 2. They agreed to
the meeting. Pitzer then left for the faculty club
as Kirtman and Bazile headed toward White Plaza
for a noon rally scheduled by the BSU.
At the rally Bazile announced Pitzer's decision
to lunch at the faculty club. He declared, "I say
that Chancellor Heyns has lunch engagements.
President Hayakawa does also . . . but if the shit
gets thick enough they cancel them."
He then proposed a choice to the assembly:
Did they want to discuss what they would say to
Pitzer on Friday or should they go talk to him
immediately?

'Come Without Delay'
As Pitzer talked, Simmons told the crowd the
president was on his way and would arrive in 10
minutes. It was about 2:35. Pitzer was still on
the phone. Wyman, realizing Pitzer had to rush,
returned to the phone and told Pitzer that he had
to come without delay. The conversation ended.
The crowd now expected Pitzer any minute.
BSU leaders decided to wait five more minutes.
At the deadline, the time was extended several
more minutes. Finally, Bazile announced he was
leaving and others could do what they wanted.
The angry crowd walked to White Plaza as
Pitzer and Lyman were driving to Building 1.
Students raided the bookstore as Pitzer reached
his office.
Not Informed
The demonstrators were never informed about
Pitzer's whereabouts and his triple decision
changes. They were never told about the phone
delay in reaching Pitzer and the 10 minute drive
from Glover's house. They knew only that the
president was late, very late for a scheduled
meeting and they were furious that he hadn't
come.
Pitzer was totally unaware that his alterations
in plans had not been relayed to the students. He
assumed they realized he did not intend to meet
at 2 p.m. and that his eventual decision to come
was a special effort on his part, not a last minute
rush to an already delayed meeting.
Perhaps Richard Lyman could have driven his
microbus faster. Yet by that time speed could
not catch up with lost contact and misunder
standing.
It was too late to run because people on both
sides had forgotten to walk.
