## Neither Black Nor White 
### Philip Taubman 
If Fred Glover intends to use
his home as the President's Office
in the future, as he did last Thurs
day, he might do well to install an
extra phone.
That is one of the less impor
tant lessons learned from the raid
on the bookstore. Communication
failed at a crucial moment on
Thursday when presidential aides
were unable to reach Kenneth
Pitzer because Glover's one phone
was busy. Pitzer was using Glov
er's home as a temporary office.
Other conclusions to be drawn
from Thursday's procedings are
not so easily spotted and present
problems and questions that are
far less easily solved. They are
problems of style, communication
beyond phone lines, and percep
tion.
It is easy to condemn the ac
tion of raiding the bookstore. It is
equally painless to criticize Pit
zer's activities on Thursday, in
cluding his seeking refuge at
Glover's house. To do either, how
ever, is to assail an obvious target
without considering all the back
ground and facts of Thursday's
drama.
Tracing the day's events by
examining the central points that
catalyzed anger and action, reveals
that there is far more to the prob
lem than any simple attack might
suggest. On the surface, the two
events which evidently riled the
BSU to action were Pitzer's un
willingness to lunch with BSU
leaders and then his failure to ar
rive for a 2 p.m. appointment.
Rejected Offers
To attack Pitzer for these fail
ings is not entirely justified. In
fact, it would seem rather logical
that Pitzer had not planned to
stay for lunch. For two weeks he
had been offering appointments
to the BSU for meetings to discuss
their 12 demands. Three offers
had been rejected. Pitzer could
thus have little cause for viewing
the meeting as an urgent matter.
Secondly, the BSU had an
nounced plans for a noon rally in
White Plaza on Thursday, and, un
less Pitzer had been informed that
Nate Kirtman and Leo Bazile, the
two BSU negotiators, were not
planning to attend the rally the
president can hardly be blamed
for assuming he could keep his
lunch date at the faculty club.
It makes beautiful reason, but
does it make sense in the context
of the Thursday morning meet
ing? Only Pitzer and the BSU
leaders can answer. It is worth
considering that one side or both
may have misjudged the opposite
number just before noon. It is
possible that Kirtman and Bazile
made their point about urgency
with great clarity and that Pitzer
did not perceive their eagerness
and seriousness. An answer here
would cast much light on the
legitimacy of later events.
Blown Communication
The second catalyst for BSU
action is extremely complex and
riddled with blown communica
tion lines. My article on page 1 of
ihis paper indicates that numerous
misunderstandings occured be
tween the BSU and Pitzer on
Thursday. Greatly condensed, the
key problem was that Pitzer
thought he was not missing an ap
pointment at 2 p.m. while the
BSU was furious at his failure to
arrive.
Both feelings are completely
understandable in light of the in
formation Pitzer and the BSU

were hearing about each other's
plans. No one bothered to tell the
crowd outside Pitzer's office that
the president had changed his
mind several times about the 2
p.m. meeting and therefore, at last
word, he did not consider his ab
sence as a snub. Pitzer assumed
the crowd knew of his plans.
Unfortunately, the crowd
knew nothing of the sort. Demon
strators knew only that Pitzer was
late and even when they heard he
was coming, they did not know it
would take him more than 10
minutes to reach his office.
Middlemen
Rather clearly, more than once
on Thursday, the middlemen blew
it. Whoever was relaying plans and
messages from Pitzer to the BSU
and vice versa did an ineffective
job. Not that the conditions were
conducive to good communica
tion by middlemen.
This problem brings the focus
back to another key moment in
the day: the faculty club scene.
Here again it is very difficult to
blame either side for poor moves.
A large crowd of students
swarmed into the club. Pitzer
briefly addressed them and then
fled to Glover's house.
Glover claims that Pitzer left
fearing violence from the stu
dents. It was not a smart move.
Yet to attack Pitzer is asking him
not to be human and not to feel.
The moment was tense and fast
moving. It is easy to sit back
hours later and speculate how a
man should have acted about a
very personal feeling.
Glover's House
Pitzer's next decision, however,
is totally unjustified by heat of
the moment or any other excuse.
He should not have gone to Fred
Glover's house. Since events were
quickly developing and it was very
clear the president would play a
central role, he poorly choose to
travel 10 minutes from his office
to a home with one phone.
This move, more than any
other event on Thursday, crippled
the efforts of middlemen to keep
communications open. The crit
ical delay in reaching Pitzer after
2 p.m. to inform him to rush to
his office was probably the num
ber one roadblock.
The communications gap, and
thus the gap in perception be
tween Pitzer and the demonstra
tors, might be offered as an ex
planation for the explosion in the
bookstore. From the crowd's
point of view, they had waited 40
minutes for the president. Even
when his arrival was promised he

did not appear when they expec
ted. It is impossible to attack the
crowd for being angry. They
reacted naturally to a snub, total
ly unaware Pitzer had no idea he
was snubbing.
Not Black Or White
It should be apparent that
taking sides on Thursday's fiasco
is not a question of black or
white. To the chagrin of law and
order lovers the same holds for
the final actâ€”the bookstore raid.
It can reasonably be posited
that a 40 minutes snub is not just
cause for attacking the bookstore.
Just as reasonably, it can be said
that the response of the Stanford
administration to minority group
problems has been greater and
quicker than many other univer
sities in the country.
Furthermore, it can be argued
persuasively, that even if cause did
exist, raiding the bookstore will
do little to help the black move
ment. Finally, if the goal of black
demands is a better opportunity
for education and Stanford, and
an improvement in that educa
tion, then a lightning raid on the
bookstore seems rather irrelevant
and, in fact, antithetical.
It's all reasonable and has the
ring of truth. True it's liberal too,
so call it liberal truth and logic.
Yet one question remains.
White Logic?
Is it white logic? Is it logic that
cannot understand the psyche and
feelings of blacks because it is a
mind incased in a white body that
has never felt segregation and the
pain of white hate?
I honestly must condemn the
bookstore raid. I believe in my
liberal logic, but I do so in full
knowledge that perhaps there are
things I do not understand and
cannot feel that may have driven
15 blacks to blitz the store.
People may scream that I have
been intimidated by black power.
I can answer only that there is
a limit to any man's understand
ing and before screaming, I sug
gest they examine their own.
