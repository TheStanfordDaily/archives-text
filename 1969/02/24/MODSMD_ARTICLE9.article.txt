Editor, THE DAILY:
While one who sings with his
tongue on fire
Gargles in the rat race choir
Bent out of shape from society's
pliers
Cares not to come up any higher
But rather get you down in the
hole
That he's in
But I mean no harm, not put fault
On anyone that lives in a vault
Bob Dylan
I have often wanted to write
about my disappointments with
Stanford University, but I have
found the task overwhelming.
Overwhelming not because the
many problems are intangible, but
because the framework by which I
view these problems is differ
ent from the majority of Stanford
students. Students are not the
only constituency which is re
sponsible for my disappointments,
but they harbor my hopes for the
future; this then is to you and
only by implication does it reflect
upon the other members of the
university community.
As I look over the foothills to
the bay I see many monuments
that are more Stanford than its
physical presence. I see ignorance
and isolation from the realities of
the world. I see students trapped
in a one-dimensional framework,
lost upon a golden platter and in
love with the good life they de
prive from others. I. see students
voting for and against coercive
action, playing "democracy" in a
world where the loss of humanity
has laughed at this myth, covered
it with crys of poverty. Coercion
in a "democracy" does not cater
to votes, but rides on conscience
above the tyrannical waves of the
majority; it finds its force in the
voice of the world, not in the

blathering of trapped souls.
I see students smoke pot and
then shout for law and order. I see
students refusing to enter debate,
but when action arrives, call for
rational discussion, which they
have willingly avoided. I see stu
dents waiting for the renassiance
of education to bloom from our
two year report, which talks
about everything but education. I
see students crying for a disinter
ested place of learning and still
grubbing for grades; grubbing for
A's and pleasing professors, but
understanding nothing but how to
get A's. I see students crying for
an ivory tower while the univer
sity runs an industrial park, whose
capitalists run the university.
I see students who come to a
BSU rally to be condemned with
out understanding why. I see stu
dents who shout love of their fel
low man, but can't share this with
anyone they can't see and feel. I
see students who I just can't com
municate with because they are
what others have made them; they
refuse to understand their heritage
which they think is the only one
and accept its present manifesta
tion as their God.

I see you sing "it shall ring and
float away, hail Stanford hail",
but even as close as East Palo Alto
its melody will be hated and
frightening in its implications for
the further continuance of oppres
sion. People are not evil within
the context in which they live.
Here you are good people, but
wealth coupled with ignorance is
no virtue. The world is bigger than
you accept; your context is false.
