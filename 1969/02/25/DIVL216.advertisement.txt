On Washington's Birthday
To The BSU
Stand up, A merica,
Father George is.
He's throwing silver dollars
A s he crosses the Delaware;
He's chopping cherry trees
For firewood at Valley Forge;
He's riding a giant white
Horse behind the lines.
Yes, stand proud, A merica,
Your bookstore histories
Will tell you:
When virile George died
(Returning late at night
From the quarters
In the rain on
Poor Martha's plantation).
Satisfied, he freed his slaves.
