# Students Back Credit For ROTC; Favor Quarter System Retention
## 
### CRAIG WILSON 
Stanford students have voted by a
decisive margin to retain academic
credit for part of the ROTC program on
campus.
The vote was 2106 to 1397 and came
as part of the delayed results of the
ASSU student election held last week.
The ROTC vote comes on the heels
of the recommendation made just two
weeks before by the majority report of
the Ad Hoc Senate Committee on
ROTC which recommended denying
academic credit for ROTC courses.
The student sampling also voted
strongly in favor of most resolutions
relating to the SES report rejecting only
the possible change from a quarter to a
semester system.
In addition the sampling favored the
legalization of marijuana and voted in
favor of the Legislative Charter as

approved by the Committee of 15.
The election also revealed the names
of the forty people from the various
departments who will form the
Education Council.
The resolution passed by the
students endorsed academic credit and
said in part "we believe that ROTC has
a legitimate place on campus and
deserves support and credit from the
University for those parts of the
program that are of genuine academic
interest."
Reaction to the vote from various
areas was immediate.
Colonel Robert Thomas of the
Department of Military Science said
that the vote "shows a great deal of
student interest in creating those
programs they feel are valid and of some
interest to a segment of the student
body.
"Because it is a large turnout. . . it's
got to be considered representative.
"I'm pleasantly surprised. It is a
higher vote in favor of ROTC than I
expected.
"It shows a just concern for the
rights of others by the student body.
ROTC should be here for those who
want to participate."
Student Body President Denis Hayes
had a different reaction.
Hayes called the vote "virtually
meaningless."
He said that the "resolution was
vague. It is difficult to determine what
it means."
He added that he felt that the
resolution was worded that it urges
credit for those parts of the program

that warrant credit. "But who
determines what warrants credit?"
Harvey Hukari of the Young
Americans for Freedom said that the
vote "indicates that the people who
authorized the majority report are out
of touch with students interests. It is a
reflection of the manner in which the
committee was selected."
The second resolution supporting a
change from a quarter system to a
semester system for undergraduates was
defeated by a margin of 2712 to 718. A
related issue which urged that a reading
periods be scheduled in each academic
term prior to the final examination was
passed 2878 to 642.
Students voted substantially in favor
of being able to take on unlimited
number of "pass-fail" courses by a vote
of 2625 to 918.
Essay examinations were seen as
being more valuable than objective
exams. The vote was 2016 to 1250. The
vote supporting the findings of the SES
report was okayed by a vote of 2533 to
741.
In addition the move that General
Studies requirements should be
abandoned altogether was abandoned.
The vote was 2394 to 999.
Students voted in favor of approval
of the Revised Legislative and Judicial
Charter as approved by the Committee
of 15. The voting was 1635 to 484.
In another measure involving the
Judicial Council students voted by a
vote of 1689 in favor to 681 against to
place two chairmen on the Judicial
Council, one from the faculty and one
from the students.

The measure expressing the support
of Stanford University students to
collect delinquent loans was passed
3127 to 202.
In another related SES measure
students voted that no University action
on SES proposals shall be valid unless
meeting with the concurrence of the
ASSU Education Council was passed
2087 to 998.
Students expressed support for
revocation of all legal sanction against
the sale, possession, or use of marijuana.
The tally was 2297 in favor and 1178
against.
In related measures students voted
1857 to 822 to urge the State of
California to "legislate more stringent
penalties for persons convicted of selling
methedrine."
A vote of 2429 to 243 was taken in
favor of "conducting a statewide
program to educate youth to the hazard
of this dangerous drug."
Vice-Provost Herbert Packer, who
chaired the SES report strongly reacted
to the student vote concerning both
measures relating to the semester-system
change and the proposed reading period.
"I think that what it means is that
students were not adequately informed
about a reading period and the change
to a semester system."
Reacting to the Revised Legislative
and Judicial Charter he said that the
vote in the judicial charter was lower
than anything else. "This indicates a
lack of understanding. It was not
