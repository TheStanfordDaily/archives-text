# The 						Tin Drum
## Needed: Teaching Revolution 
### Michael Sweeney 
It would be sad indeed if stu
dents march off to battle over
SES and content themselves with
the destruction of a few silly
course requirements. Yet we see a
great crescendo of student enthus
iasm focused exclusively on the
prospect of new freedoms for the
undergraduate. Freedom from re
quirements, freedom from depart
ments, freedom from grades.
The SES reports are full of
flowery praise for the readiness of
students to learn by themselves.
SES builds the impression that
"freedom" is the marvelous
panacea for the problems of the
Stanford undergraduate. "Our rec
ommendations," trumpets SES,
"are designed to free both teacher
and student of trammels that
restrain the freedom to teach and
to learn."
Obviously, greater choice for
students is a good thing and long
overdue.
Unfortunately, all this verbal
dust about freedom threatens to
obscure the brazen neglect of
undergraduate education at Stan
ford, a neglect that can never be
undone by superficial reform of
the curriculum The neglect is a
direct result of Stanford's emp
hasis on graduate training and re
search. The diseases of academic
parochialism and specialization
afflict most American universities,
and Stanford is among the sickest.
While Stanford's reputation for
scholarly research reaches new
heights, undergraduate teaching
stays at a wretched level. The split
is no coincidence. As SES puts it,
"The faculty of today's univer
sity, for better or worse, consists
of a collection of discipline
oriented specialists." For such men
to survive, neglect of under
graduates has become a necessity.
Taken For Granted
This neglect is so widespread
that practically everyone at Stan
ford, including SES, seems to take
it for granted. It is neglect that
allows gigantic lecture courses to
be taught by incoherent, disorga
nized professors, with reading lists
of pedantic and irrelevent text
books. It is neglect that allows

sprawling "staff" courses to be
taught by incompetent graduate
students. It is neglect that allows
most students to drift through
Stanford without any competent
academic advising.
The SES reports show an
awareness of the problems, but
they show little willingness to
confront them directly. In one
passage, SES speaks of "the best
of what can be made available to
undergraduates within the con
straints of the current academic
situation." The theme of the re
port on Undergraduate Education,
in fact, is the sentence, "The time
has come ... to place upon stu
dents a greater share of the res
ponsibility for profiting from the
University's educational re
sources." Caught up in a rhetoric
of freedom, SES seems blithely
unaware that the whole thrust of
the report could be interpreted as
an attempt to run away from the
plight of undergraduates, instead
of solving it.

Ironically, the most realistic
appraisal of Stanford education is
buried in Appendix 3 of "The
Study and Its Purposes." It is a
statement by an unnamed pro
fessor who left Stanford, and was
asked what he didn't like:
"Stanford recently has been
trying to grow in ways that could
hurt its future. In its haste to ex
pand, it has often emphasized
graduate over undergraduate edu
cation, especially in the various
science departments . . . The
major reason for these faults is
that it does not pay for professors
or instructors to get involved with
undergraduates—it will never lead
to any recognition by the leaders
in the departments."
As this statement implies, a
basic conflict exists between the
values of teaching and the values
of specialized research. The con
flict is present at all the other top
private universities that Stanford
mimics and steals faculty from.
At the University of Chicago,

for instance, students seized the
administration building in protest
against the failure to renew the
contract of Mrs. Marlene Dixon,
an assistant professor of soci
ology. As quoted by the New
York Times, a faculty committee
acknowledged that Mrs. Dixon
was "an energetic, warm, dedi
cated, open and compelling
teacher," but she had not, in their
opinion, demonstrated "incisive
competence for inducing ad
vanced students in the highest
levels of scholarship."
Condemned To Mediocre
The values of that faculty com
mittee are the same values which
condemn undergraduates to medi
ocre teaching at Stanford. They
must be dealt with. The imbalance
of faculty emphasis must be re
dressed.
Despite its daring advocacy of
"freedom," SES has shown that it
lacks the wisdom or courage to
come to grips with Stanford's
teaching-research conflict. A re
vealing example of the failure is
the recommendation on student
evaluation of professors. Any
fundamental teaching reform
would require that teaching abil
ity, as judged by students, be an
explicit criterion for hiring and
promotion.
But the SES report on Govern
ment of the University disagrees:
"A direct student voice and vote
in the faculty selection process
would be inappropriate because
only members of the faculty are
fully qualified to judge the
scholarly credentials of prospec
tive appointees." In the very next
sentence, SES reveals its proclivity
to double-think: "At the same
time, we affirm the relevance of
student opinion about the educa
tional effectiveness of faculty
members."
SES, however, need not be a
distraction from the more urgent
aspects of educational reform. If
students do not dissipate their en
ergies in squabbles over require
ments and other irrelevancies,
they can use certain of the SES
proposals as vehicles for a new
revolution in teaching. One of the
most promising vehicles is the
proposal for a Dean of Undergrad
uate Studies.

dent action.)
