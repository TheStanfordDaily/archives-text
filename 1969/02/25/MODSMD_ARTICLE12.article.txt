## Keep The Draft 
### Art Buchwald 
WASHINGTON—I went over
to my neighbor's house the other
day and found his 21-year-old
son, Jimmy, in the garage working
on picket signs which read "Save
the Draft," "Down With Nixon's
Professional Army" and "Keep
Our Boys 1-A."
You could have knocked me
over with a cattle prod, because
for the last three years Jimmy has
been the most violent critic of the
draft in the neighborhood and has
attended every Dr. Spock rally in
the country.
"What happened?" I asked
him.
"I wised up," Jimmy said.
"Nixon's plan to do away with
the draft, and have a professional
army, is the biggest fraud perpe
trated on the American people.
Either that or he doesn't realize
what he's doing."
"What do you mean?"
"When Nixon first said he was
going to do away with the draft, I
was all for him. But then it hit
me. What would the consequences
of this be? He organizes a profes
sional army and gets excellent pay
for them. The people who are
attracted to the military life join
in droves and you have the best
trained, most devoted, most dedi
cated Army, Navy and Air Force
in the world."
"What's wrong with that?"
"Nothing, at the beginning.
But what happens in 10 years
from now? The professional army
is completely alienated from the
population. They sit around their
barracks and officers' clubs grous
ing about the civilians who don't
know a damn thing about military
affairs. Finally a bunch of
colonels get together and say, 'We
don't have to take guff from the
civilians. We got the hardware. If
they don't listen to us we'll just
have to damn well make them
listen."
"Jimmy, you're not saying that
they'd pull a military coup
d'etat?"
"Why not? How many tanks
does it take to surround the White
House? How many flights would
you have to make over NBC, CBS
and ABC in a fighter plane before
they'd cave in? Even the Pueblo
could capture Washington."
"You've been reading 'Seven
Days in May," I said accusingly.
He denied it. "Do you know
why this country is still a democ
racy, despite the fact it has the

largest military machine in the
world?"
"I would hate to guess."
"Because it has thousands and
thousands of draftees in the ser
vice who hate it. The more people
you have in the service who hate
it, the less chance you will ever
have of the military taking over.
When you pay draftees nothing,
treat them miserably and make
them sorry they ever had to put
on a pair of fatigues, you've got a
built-in 'fail safe' against anyone
ever helping the professional army
officers set up a military dictator
ship."
"So now you're going to organ
ize prodraft demonstrations
throughout the country."
"It's going to be a blow to J.
Edgar Hoover when he hears the
news," I said. "What specifically
made you see the light?"
"Greece,"he said as he started
on a new sign—"Hell Yes—the
Draft Is Best."
