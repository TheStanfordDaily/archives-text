## Goals, Sensitivity 
### Thomas Dee 
Some of us were talking the
other day about something that
has been on our minds for a long
time, about the reasons people
suffer, and the reasons they inflict
pain. After a while we came up
with some ideas that we sincerely
hope will be of interest, and might
arouse some response.
We dealt with three important
terms: goals, suffering, and sensi
tivity. These must be immediately
defined.
A goal is that which a person
strives to achieve for himself or
humanity, capable of the highest
rationalization. Ideally, it arises in
response to a need; for example,
to achieve "self-actualization" or
to find the cure for today's "in
curable" disease.
Suffering we are considering in
the active sense. It is the pain in
flicted on animal or man, on one
self or another by oneself.
Sensitivity is one's awareness
of the pain he is causing; it is
often a matter of degree. One can
recognize that he is causing suffer
ing, or one may even feel physi
cally ill as a result.
What we came vith was

this: A goal can be rationalized,
discussed, and evaluated. The suf
fering resulting from seeking that
goal is totally incapable of ration
alization. Suffering is a definite
fact that cannot be removed by
reason or explanation; it is not
made "right" or "wrong" by such
explanations.
One can become insensitive in
various degrees to suffering caused
or witnessed, but except through
some means of escape (by drugs
or removal or mental control) the
sufferer can not become less sensi
tive to his suffering. We feel that
as much as possible (and this can
not be rationalized either) one
must remain sensitive to the suf
fering he is causing by his actions.
He must constantly be evaluating
his goals, and then within himself
he must then make the decision to
act or not to act.
One must recognize the suffer
ing, or else the goal loses its per
spective and those who suffer,
whether animal or human, lose
their perspective also in the eyes
of the goal-achiever.
Another conclusion: Suffering
self-inflicted is much more easily
recognized than suffering inflicted
on another. Forget the golden rule
momentarily and think in terms
of suffering.
Is it not true that it is easier to
explain away suffering inflicted
on another than it is to rationalize
suffering inflicted on oneself? Is
there a moral difference between
the two? If you are in any way a
moralist is it not less right to in
flict suffering on another than up
on oneself?
Now apply any model subjec
tively to what we have said. All of
us readers have goals, and when
they deal with other people they
cause suffering.
We have formulated, we have
been brought up in, systems
which rationalize the suffering
away, causing tremendous insensi
tivity. The systems are religious,
political, ethical, social, etc., etc.
To even question these systems is
to cause great suffering to those
who espouse them, live off them,
depend upon them.
To destroy these systems, most
of which are innately false, is to
destroy those people along with
the systems. Is the suffering to be
caused worth it?
Don't answer that question
rationally. Feel that question. Do
we feel trapped? Should we suffer
or must we become insensitive?
What does that insensitivity
mean? What do we feel? What do
we think? We have some responsi
bilities. Let's face them.

of which are innately false, is to
destroy those people along with
the systems. Is the suffering to be
caused worth it?
Don't answer that question
rationally. Feel that question. Do
we feel trapped? Should we suffer
or must we become insensitive?
What does that insensitivity
mean? What do we feel? What do
we think? We have some responsi
bilities. Let's face them.
(Tom Dee is a sophomore.

Some of us were talking the
other day about something that
has been on our minds for a long
time, about the reasons people
suffer, and the reasons they inflict
pain. After a while we came up
with some ideas that we sincerely
hope will be of interest, and might
arouse some response.
We dealt with three important
terms: goals, suffering, and sensi
tivity. These must be immediately
defined.
A goal is that which a person
strives to achieve for himself or
humanity, capable of the highest
rationalization. Ideally, it arises in
response to a need; for example,
to achieve "self-actualization" or
to find the cure for today's "in
curable" disease.
Suffering we are considering in
the active sense. It is the pain in
flicted on animal or man, on one
self or another by oneself.
Sensitivity is one's awareness
of the pain he is causing; it is
often a matter of degree. One can
recognize that he is causing suffer
ing, or one may even feel physi
cally ill as a result.
What we came vith was

this: A goal can be rationalized,
discussed, and evaluated. The suf
fering resulting from seeking that
goal is totally incapable of ration
alization. Suffering is a definite
fact that cannot be removed by
reason or explanation; it is not
made "right" or "wrong" by such
explanations.
One can become insensitive in
various degrees to suffering caused
or witnessed, but except through
some means of escape (by drugs
or removal or mental control) the
sufferer can not become less sensi
tive to his suffering. We feel that
as much as possible (and this can
not be rationalized either) one
must remain sensitive to the suf
fering he is causing by his actions.
He must constantly be evaluating
his goals, and then within himself
he must then make the decision to
act or not to act.
One must recognize the suffer
ing, or else the goal loses its per
spective and those who suffer,
whether animal or human, lose
their perspective also in the eyes
of the goal-achiever.
Another conclusion: Suffering
self-inflicted is much more easily
recognized than suffering inflicted
on another. Forget the golden rule
momentarily and think in terms
of suffering.
Is it not true that it is easier to
explain away suffering inflicted
on another than it is to rationalize
suffering inflicted on oneself? Is
there a moral difference between
the two? If you are in any way a
moralist is it not less right to in
flict suffering on another than up
on oneself?
Now apply any model subjec
tively to what we have said. All of
us readers have goals, and when
they deal with other people they
cause suffering.
We have formulated, we have
been brought up in, systems
which rationalize the suffering
away, causing tremendous insensi
tivity. The systems are religious,
political, ethical, social, etc., etc.
To even question these systems is
to cause great suffering to those
who espouse them, live off them,
depend upon them.
To destroy these systems, most
of which are innately false, is to
destroy those people along with
the systems. Is the suffering to be
caused worth it?
Don't answer that question
rationally. Feel that question. Do
we feel trapped? Should we suffer
or must we become insensitive?
