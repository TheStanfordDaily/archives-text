# Letters To The Editor
## Who Speaks? 
### 
Editor, THE DAILY:
Just now it is fashionable to
speak for student power, black
power, faculty power, brown
power, and union power. It is not
quite clear whether the next
"power" move will come from the
janitors, the football squad, the
telephone operators, or the pink
polka-dot men from Mars.
The T/A's tell us they are
underpaid. The BSU says we are
racist. The students complain that
they are graded unfairly. The
ROTC says nobody understands
the military mind. The SDS says
the Biz School and the Engineers
are part of the dirty-minded estab
lishment and must be wiped out
so that Utopia can arrive on sched
ule. The Law students argue that
the review is discriminatory. The
undergrads complain that Psych is
irrelevant. Rafferty and the YAF
want the Left repressed. Admini
strators complain we have so
many committees that nothing
can be done.
What I want o know is, Where
do we get the money to pay for
all these things—from Governor
Reagan, the good fairy or mil
lionaires who believe in burning
down the colleges? What student
ever thought he got a grade that
was too high? How do we run the
world without the electric power,
the tools, the cars, the refriger
ators, the clothes, the heaters, and
all the other things only engineers
and Biz school types are prepared
to make for us? What the heck
does SDS mean by this dandy
Utopia which they have yet to
describe, name, or discuss? How
do we get along without laws—by
killing each other or merely
maiming our neighbors? Is the
ritual of sacrificing victims to the
"gods" an improvement on stud
ies of how man can harness his
emotions for constructive pur
poses? Can society progress by
standing still and repressing all
new ideas?
And for the universities, what I
want to know is. Who speaks for
the freedom for each of us to say
what he thinks without being spit
on, bombed, beat up, or intimi
dated? Who speaks for the pro
gress of the educational process as
a whole? Who speaks for the long
ran ge benefits of man? Who
speaks for love not war on cam
pus? Who listens to an opposing
view? Is the Administration so
self-identified with the system
that it cannot speak to the issues?
Is the faculty tongue-tied? (Now
that would be novel!) Are the
radical students so blood-thirsty
that they can only make demands
that demean, impugn, and even
destroy individuals who have
spent their lives working for the
education of oncoming genera
tions in the best ways they know?
Has the rational thinking gone out
of style entirely?
Isn't it about time someone
paraphrased John Kennedy to ask,
"What can you do for the univer
sity?" Isn't it about time someone
spoke for education, for free
speech, for constructive change by
orderly processes, and for those
students who want a relevant but
also first-class education?
How about you and me?

• Average Student's View
Editor, THE DAILY:
I happened to be in the union
at 1:30 Thursday when a group of
50 to 100 black students and
sympathizers came into Tresidder
Union and made what might be
called a mass raid on the cafeteria.
Under the apparent leadership of
one fellow with a bullhorn, who
shouted something to the effect
of "free food", they proceeded to
pull away a railing of the turnstile
at the side entrance to the counter
area and to drift in and out, bring
ing away whatever food they
liked; hamburgers, apples, sand
wicges, and a banana split. With
all the impotence of the unpre
pared, the employees continued
to man their counters, and the
checkers their cash registers; less
opportunistic clients continued to
pay for their food, and the mass
of studentry in the cafeteria went
on chatting at their tables as if
nothing was happening.
Now I was just a passerby, an
"average" student, with the usual
degree of sympathy to BSU
grievances and no particular
awareness of this day's demonstra
tion or what happened later on;
nevertheless the Tresidder inci
dent made me madder than hell,
and apparently a lot of people felt
the same, although they didn't
show it. "They ought to get the
police and clear the whole bunch
out", were the sort of comments I
heard, and well I might. For to
any bystander, the whole incident
was just a patent and despicable
act of stealing.
To the perpetrators at the time
it looked different, no doubt, but
whatever their point of view, I am
convinced that the whole affair
was actually contrary to the basic
principles of both offenders and
offended alike. The BSU may be
trying to change our society in its
small way here at Stanford, but
surely it is not actually trying to
modify that one basic value of our
society, in fact of all societies,
namely that stealing is wrong.
Any justification of the Tresidder
raid, then, must be given in terms
of the means to an end. And yet

as means the raid was disastrous.
Such an incident paints the BSU
crusade in the colors of theft and
lawlessness. It alienates those like
myself sympathetic to the basic
nature of the demands. It polar
izes people pro and con and
makes administrative opposition
even more bullheaded. And finally
it achieves nothing (unless free
food be an achievement).
Clearly it is a case where indi
viduals that should have known
better acted as a mindless mob,
and it is high time not only for
concerned citizens to protest such
mob action and resist it, but
also—and even more important —
for the participants in that mob to
wise up. May the conscience of
the Stanford community know of
and react to this little incident—
and enough so it really hurts the
perpetrators, that is, so they don't
forget their error. Otherwise both
sides will suffer; the offenders is a
more hostile Stanford commu
nity, and the offended in more
unpleasant incidents of this type.

•Editorial Disappointing
Editor, THE DAILY:
In your commendable efforts
to observe "last Thursday" from
many points of view, you seem to
avoid blaming student confronta
tion tactics. Is it possible that the
problem was not so much the
President being where there was
only one phone—as a crowd which
put him there?
Various groups in the commu
nity have voted in the past to op
pose and deplore coercive con
frontation tactics in our efforts to
make constructive change. It
seems that we've had another
example of why the majority so
voted in each case. I'm disappoint
ed that your editorial concerns are
less for this basic problem than
for the President's being late to an
on-again-off-again meeting which
he had not scheduled in the first
place.
KENNETH M.CUTHBERTSON

P.S. That was Mr. Glover, not I,
pictured in your Friday issue. But
don't fret; we have a pretty good
idea why we are mistaken for each
other so often.
• Presidio And ROTC
Editor, THE DAILY:
The Daily's editorial on the
case of the Presidio 27 was one of
the most eloquent indictments of
the military system in this coun

try that I've seen. It is rather
ironic that the outrage committed
at the Presidio should have occur
red just when Stanford is in the
midst of a debate over ROTC.
One of the more popular
arguments in favor of keeping
ROTC is that it provides "an en
lightened officer corps," made up
of men presumably more humane
than the officers turned out by
the military academies.
The exhaustively documented
accounts of U.S. military activities
in Vietnam, which include satura
tion bombing, the burning of vil
lages, despoiling food crops, tor
turing prisoners, and uprooting
whole populations and herding
them behind barbed wire, make it
clear that so far ROTC graduates
have not "enlightened" the armed
services to any appreciable degree.
It is even just possible that the
Army exerts its influence over the
ROTC graduate before he ever
gets around to changing the
Army.
In any case, continuance of
ROTC at Stanford is not what will
eventually stop the kind of cold
blooded brutality demonstrated in
Vietnam and at the Presidio. On
the contrary, it would simply
mean continued sanction of the
present evils by the University.
Withdrawal of this sanction by
Stanford would be a clearer mes
sage to the Pentagon than any
number of "humane" 2nd Lieu
tenants could ever give.

• Table-Tennis Survival
Editor, THE DAILY:
1 wish to bring to the attention
of the University the survival for
the Stanford Table-Tennis Team,
champion of the Regional Inter
collegiate Table Tennis Tourna
ment.
Stanford University has been
the champion of the Regional
Inter-collegiate Table Tennis
Tournament successively for the
past five years. In this year's
tournament which took place last
Friday and Saturday here, Stan
ford University once again success
fully defended its title and cap
tured the First and Second in
man's single, and First in man's
doubles. Surprise to say that such
campus activity should miss the
interest of The Daily, and not
many people knew about it.
It is unbelievable that a univer
sity that has been the leader of
this sport, does not even have a
place for its members to practice.
The old practice room was in

Tresidder Union game room until
last quarter. For some reasons, the
Table Tennis room was replaced
by a pool room whose former
space was given to a coffee house.
In its desperate struggle for
survival, the Table-Tennis Club
has temporarily borrowed a room
from the Recreation Center loca
ted at the junction between
Bowdoin Street and Pine Hill
Avenue, for every Tuesday eve
ning between 7 and 9 p.m.
A hard year lies ahead in de
fending the championship title.
Stanford University will have to
decide for itself now whether to
lose it or to keep it.

Isn't it about time someone

• Average Student's View
Editor, THE DAILY:
I happened to be in the union
at 1:30 Thursday when a group of
50 to 100 black students and
sympathizers came into Tresidder
Union and made what might be
called a mass raid on the cafeteria.
Under the apparent leadership of
one fellow with a bullhorn, who
shouted something to the effect
of "free food", they proceeded to
pull away a railing of the turnstile
at the side entrance to the counter
area and to drift in and out, bring
ing away whatever food they
liked; hamburgers, apples, sand
wicges, and a banana split. With
all the impotence of the unpre
pared, the employees continued
to man their counters, and the
checkers their cash registers; less
opportunistic clients continued to
pay for their food, and the mass
of studentry in the cafeteria went
on chatting at their tables as if
nothing was happening.
Now I was just a passerby, an
"average" student, with the usual
degree of sympathy to BSU
grievances and no particular
awareness of this day's demonstra
tion or what happened later on;
nevertheless the Tresidder inci
dent made me madder than hell,
and apparently a lot of people felt
the same, although they didn't
show it. "They ought to get the
police and clear the whole bunch
out", were the sort of comments I
heard, and well I might. For to
any bystander, the whole incident
was just a patent and despicable
act of stealing.
To the perpetrators at the time
it looked different, no doubt, but
whatever their point of view, I am
convinced that the whole affair
was actually contrary to the basic
principles of both offenders and
offended alike. The BSU may be
trying to change our society in its
small way here at Stanford, but
surely it is not actually trying to
modify that one basic value of our
society, in fact of all societies,
namely that stealing is wrong.
Any justification of the Tresidder
raid, then, must be given in terms
of the means to an end. And yet

as means the raid was disastrous.
Such an incident paints the BSU
crusade in the colors of theft and
lawlessness. It alienates those like
myself sympathetic to the basic
nature of the demands. It polar
izes people pro and con and
makes administrative opposition
even more bullheaded. And finally
it achieves nothing (unless free
food be an achievement).
Clearly it is a case where indi
viduals that should have known
better acted as a mindless mob,
and it is high time not only for
concerned citizens to protest such
mob action and resist it, but
also—and even more important —
for the participants in that mob to
wise up. May the conscience of
the Stanford community know of
and react to this little incident—
and enough so it really hurts the
perpetrators, that is, so they don't
forget their error. Otherwise both
sides will suffer; the offenders is a
more hostile Stanford commu
nity, and the offended in more
unpleasant incidents of this type.

•Editorial Disappointing
Editor, THE DAILY:
In your commendable efforts
to observe "last Thursday" from
many points of view, you seem to
avoid blaming student confronta
tion tactics. Is it possible that the
problem was not so much the
President being where there was
only one phone—as a crowd which
put him there?
Various groups in the commu
nity have voted in the past to op
pose and deplore coercive con
frontation tactics in our efforts to
make constructive change. It
seems that we've had another
example of why the majority so
voted in each case. I'm disappoint
ed that your editorial concerns are
less for this basic problem than
for the President's being late to an
on-again-off-again meeting which
he had not scheduled in the first
place.

• Presidio And ROTC
Editor, THE DAILY:
The Daily's editorial on the
case of the Presidio 27 was one of
the most eloquent indictments of
the military system in this coun

try that I've seen. It is rather
ironic that the outrage committed
at the Presidio should have occur
red just when Stanford is in the
midst of a debate over ROTC.
One of the more popular
arguments in favor of keeping
ROTC is that it provides "an en
lightened officer corps," made up
of men presumably more humane
than the officers turned out by
the military academies.
The exhaustively documented
accounts of U.S. military activities
in Vietnam, which include satura
tion bombing, the burning of vil
lages, despoiling food crops, tor
turing prisoners, and uprooting
whole populations and herding
them behind barbed wire, make it
clear that so far ROTC graduates
have not "enlightened" the armed
services to any appreciable degree.
It is even just possible that the
Army exerts its influence over the
ROTC graduate before he ever
gets around to changing the
Army.
In any case, continuance of
ROTC at Stanford is not what will
eventually stop the kind of cold
blooded brutality demonstrated in
Vietnam and at the Presidio. On
the contrary, it would simply
mean continued sanction of the
present evils by the University.
Withdrawal of this sanction by
Stanford would be a clearer mes
sage to the Pentagon than any
number of "humane" 2nd Lieu
tenants could ever give.

• Table-Tennis Survival
Editor, THE DAILY:
1 wish to bring to the attention
of the University the survival for
the Stanford Table-Tennis Team,
champion of the Regional Inter
collegiate Table Tennis Tourna
ment.
Stanford University has been
the champion of the Regional
Inter-collegiate Table Tennis
Tournament successively for the
past five years. In this year's
tournament which took place last
Friday and Saturday here, Stan
ford University once again success
fully defended its title and cap
tured the First and Second in
man's single, and First in man's
doubles. Surprise to say that such
campus activity should miss the
interest of The Daily, and not
many people knew about it.
It is unbelievable that a univer
sity that has been the leader of
this sport, does not even have a
place for its members to practice.
The old practice room was in

Tresidder Union game room until
last quarter. For some reasons, the
Table Tennis room was replaced
by a pool room whose former
space was given to a coffee house.
In its desperate struggle for
survival, the Table-Tennis Club
has temporarily borrowed a room
from the Recreation Center loca
ted at the junction between
Bowdoin Street and Pine Hill
Avenue, for every Tuesday eve
ning between 7 and 9 p.m.
A hard year lies ahead in de
fending the championship title.
Stanford University will have to
decide for itself now whether to
lose it or to keep it.

that they can only make demands
that demean, impugn, and even

students who want a relevant but
also first-class education?
How about you and me?

• Average Student's View
Editor, THE DAILY:
I happened to be in the union
at 1:30 Thursday when a group of
50 to 100 black students and
sympathizers came into Tresidder
Union and made what might be
called a mass raid on the cafeteria.
Under the apparent leadership of
one fellow with a bullhorn, who
shouted something to the effect
of "free food", they proceeded to
pull away a railing of the turnstile
at the side entrance to the counter
area and to drift in and out, bring
ing away whatever food they
liked; hamburgers, apples, sand
wicges, and a banana split. With
all the impotence of the unpre
pared, the employees continued
to man their counters, and the
checkers their cash registers; less
opportunistic clients continued to
pay for their food, and the mass
of studentry in the cafeteria went
on chatting at their tables as if
nothing was happening.
Now I was just a passerby, an
"average" student, with the usual
degree of sympathy to BSU
grievances and no particular
awareness of this day's demonstra
tion or what happened later on;
nevertheless the Tresidder inci
dent made me madder than hell,
and apparently a lot of people felt
the same, although they didn't
show it. "They ought to get the
police and clear the whole bunch
out", were the sort of comments I
heard, and well I might. For to
any bystander, the whole incident
was just a patent and despicable
act of stealing.
To the perpetrators at the time
it looked different, no doubt, but
whatever their point of view, I am
convinced that the whole affair
was actually contrary to the basic
principles of both offenders and
offended alike. The BSU may be
trying to change our society in its
small way here at Stanford, but
surely it is not actually trying to
modify that one basic value of our
society, in fact of all societies,
namely that stealing is wrong.
Any justification of the Tresidder
raid, then, must be given in terms
of the means to an end. And yet

as means the raid was disastrous.
Such an incident paints the BSU
crusade in the colors of theft and
lawlessness. It alienates those like
myself sympathetic to the basic
nature of the demands. It polar
izes people pro and con and
makes administrative opposition
even more bullheaded. And finally
it achieves nothing (unless free
food be an achievement).
Clearly it is a case where indi
viduals that should have known
better acted as a mindless mob,
and it is high time not only for
concerned citizens to protest such
mob action and resist it, but
also—and even more important —
for the participants in that mob to
wise up. May the conscience of
the Stanford community know of
and react to this little incident—
and enough so it really hurts the
perpetrators, that is, so they don't
forget their error. Otherwise both
sides will suffer; the offenders is a
more hostile Stanford commu
nity, and the offended in more
unpleasant incidents of this type.

•Editorial Disappointing
Editor, THE DAILY:
In your commendable efforts
to observe "last Thursday" from
many points of view, you seem to
avoid blaming student confronta
tion tactics. Is it possible that the
problem was not so much the
President being where there was
only one phone—as a crowd which
put him there?
Various groups in the commu
nity have voted in the past to op
pose and deplore coercive con
frontation tactics in our efforts to
make constructive change. It
seems that we've had another
example of why the majority so
voted in each case. I'm disappoint
ed that your editorial concerns are
less for this basic problem than
for the President's being late to an
on-again-off-again meeting which
he had not scheduled in the first
place.

• Presidio And ROTC
Editor, THE DAILY:
The Daily's editorial on the
case of the Presidio 27 was one of
the most eloquent indictments of
the military system in this coun

try that I've seen. It is rather
ironic that the outrage committed
at the Presidio should have occur
red just when Stanford is in the
midst of a debate over ROTC.
One of the more popular
arguments in favor of keeping
ROTC is that it provides "an en
lightened officer corps," made up
of men presumably more humane
than the officers turned out by
the military academies.
The exhaustively documented
accounts of U.S. military activities
in Vietnam, which include satura
tion bombing, the burning of vil
lages, despoiling food crops, tor
turing prisoners, and uprooting
whole populations and herding
them behind barbed wire, make it
clear that so far ROTC graduates
have not "enlightened" the armed
services to any appreciable degree.
It is even just possible that the
Army exerts its influence over the
ROTC graduate before he ever
gets around to changing the
Army.
In any case, continuance of
ROTC at Stanford is not what will
eventually stop the kind of cold
blooded brutality demonstrated in
Vietnam and at the Presidio. On
the contrary, it would simply
mean continued sanction of the
present evils by the University.
Withdrawal of this sanction by
Stanford would be a clearer mes
sage to the Pentagon than any
number of "humane" 2nd Lieu
tenants could ever give.

• Table-Tennis Survival
Editor, THE DAILY:
1 wish to bring to the attention
of the University the survival for
the Stanford Table-Tennis Team,
champion of the Regional Inter
collegiate Table Tennis Tourna
ment.
Stanford University has been
the champion of the Regional
Inter-collegiate Table Tennis
Tournament successively for the
past five years. In this year's
tournament which took place last
Friday and Saturday here, Stan
ford University once again success
fully defended its title and cap
tured the First and Second in
man's single, and First in man's
doubles. Surprise to say that such
campus activity should miss the
interest of The Daily, and not
many people knew about it.
It is unbelievable that a univer
sity that has been the leader of
this sport, does not even have a
place for its members to practice.
The old practice room was in

Tresidder Union game room until
last quarter. For some reasons, the
Table Tennis room was replaced
by a pool room whose former
space was given to a coffee house.
In its desperate struggle for
survival, the Table-Tennis Club
has temporarily borrowed a room
from the Recreation Center loca
ted at the junction between
Bowdoin Street and Pine Hill
Avenue, for every Tuesday eve
ning between 7 and 9 p.m.
A hard year lies ahead in de
fending the championship title.
Stanford University will have to
decide for itself now whether to
lose it or to keep it.

Just now it is fashionable to
speak for student power, black
power, faculty power, brown
power, and union power. It is not
quite clear whether the next
"power" move will come from the
janitors, the football squad, the
telephone operators, or the pink
polka-dot men from Mars.
The T/A's tell us they are
underpaid. The BSU says we are
racist. The students complain that
they are graded unfairly. The
ROTC says nobody understands
the military mind. The SDS says
the Biz School and the Engineers
are part of the dirty-minded estab

so that Utopia can arrive on sched
ule. The Law students argue that
the review is discriminatory. The
undergrads complain that Psych is
irrelevant. Rafferty and the YAF
want the Left repressed. Admini
strators complain we have so
many committees that nothing
can be done.
What I want o know is, Where

• Average Student's View
Editor, THE DAILY:
I happened to be in the union
at 1:30 Thursday when a group of
50 to 100 black students and
sympathizers came into Tresidder
Union and made what might be
called a mass raid on the cafeteria.
Under the apparent leadership of
one fellow with a bullhorn, who
shouted something to the effect
of "free food", they proceeded to
pull away a railing of the turnstile
at the side entrance to the counter
area and to drift in and out, bring
ing away whatever food they
liked; hamburgers, apples, sand
wicges, and a banana split. With
all the impotence of the unpre
pared, the employees continued
to man their counters, and the
checkers their cash registers; less
opportunistic clients continued to
pay for their food, and the mass
of studentry in the cafeteria went
on chatting at their tables as if
nothing was happening.
Now I was just a passerby, an
"average" student, with the usual
degree of sympathy to BSU
grievances and no particular
awareness of this day's demonstra
tion or what happened later on;
nevertheless the Tresidder inci
dent made me madder than hell,
and apparently a lot of people felt
the same, although they didn't
show it. "They ought to get the
police and clear the whole bunch
out", were the sort of comments I
heard, and well I might. For to
any bystander, the whole incident
was just a patent and despicable
act of stealing.
To the perpetrators at the time
it looked different, no doubt, but
whatever their point of view, I am
convinced that the whole affair
was actually contrary to the basic
principles of both offenders and
offended alike. The BSU may be
trying to change our society in its
small way here at Stanford, but
surely it is not actually trying to
modify that one basic value of our
society, in fact of all societies,
namely that stealing is wrong.
Any justification of the Tresidder
raid, then, must be given in terms
of the means to an end. And yet

as means the raid was disastrous.
Such an incident paints the BSU
crusade in the colors of theft and
lawlessness. It alienates those like
myself sympathetic to the basic
nature of the demands. It polar
izes people pro and con and
makes administrative opposition
even more bullheaded. And finally
it achieves nothing (unless free
food be an achievement).
Clearly it is a case where indi
viduals that should have known
better acted as a mindless mob,
and it is high time not only for
concerned citizens to protest such
mob action and resist it, but
also—and even more important —
for the participants in that mob to
wise up. May the conscience of
the Stanford community know of
and react to this little incident—
and enough so it really hurts the
perpetrators, that is, so they don't
forget their error. Otherwise both
sides will suffer; the offenders is a
more hostile Stanford commu
nity, and the offended in more
unpleasant incidents of this type.

•Editorial Disappointing
Editor, THE DAILY:
In your commendable efforts
to observe "last Thursday" from
many points of view, you seem to
avoid blaming student confronta
tion tactics. Is it possible that the
problem was not so much the
President being where there was
only one phone—as a crowd which
put him there?
Various groups in the commu
nity have voted in the past to op
pose and deplore coercive con
frontation tactics in our efforts to
make constructive change. It
seems that we've had another
example of why the majority so
voted in each case. I'm disappoint
ed that your editorial concerns are
less for this basic problem than
for the President's being late to an
on-again-off-again meeting which
he had not scheduled in the first
place.
KENNETH M.CUTHBERTSON

• Presidio And ROTC
Editor, THE DAILY:
The Daily's editorial on the
case of the Presidio 27 was one of
the most eloquent indictments of
the military system in this coun

try that I've seen. It is rather
ironic that the outrage committed
at the Presidio should have occur
red just when Stanford is in the
midst of a debate over ROTC.
One of the more popular
arguments in favor of keeping
ROTC is that it provides "an en
lightened officer corps," made up
of men presumably more humane
than the officers turned out by
the military academies.
The exhaustively documented
accounts of U.S. military activities
in Vietnam, which include satura
tion bombing, the burning of vil
lages, despoiling food crops, tor
turing prisoners, and uprooting
whole populations and herding
them behind barbed wire, make it
clear that so far ROTC graduates
have not "enlightened" the armed
services to any appreciable degree.
It is even just possible that the
Army exerts its influence over the
ROTC graduate before he ever
gets around to changing the
Army.
In any case, continuance of
ROTC at Stanford is not what will
eventually stop the kind of cold
blooded brutality demonstrated in
Vietnam and at the Presidio. On
the contrary, it would simply
mean continued sanction of the
present evils by the University.
Withdrawal of this sanction by
Stanford would be a clearer mes
sage to the Pentagon than any
number of "humane" 2nd Lieu
tenants could ever give.

• Table-Tennis Survival
Editor, THE DAILY:
1 wish to bring to the attention
of the University the survival for
the Stanford Table-Tennis Team,
champion of the Regional Inter
collegiate Table Tennis Tourna
ment.
Stanford University has been
the champion of the Regional
Inter-collegiate Table Tennis
Tournament successively for the
past five years. In this year's
tournament which took place last
Friday and Saturday here, Stan
ford University once again success
fully defended its title and cap
tured the First and Second in
man's single, and First in man's
doubles. Surprise to say that such
campus activity should miss the
interest of The Daily, and not
many people knew about it.
It is unbelievable that a univer
sity that has been the leader of
this sport, does not even have a
place for its members to practice.
The old practice room was in

Tresidder Union game room until
last quarter. For some reasons, the
Table Tennis room was replaced
by a pool room whose former
space was given to a coffee house.
In its desperate struggle for
survival, the Table-Tennis Club
has temporarily borrowed a room
from the Recreation Center loca
ted at the junction between
Bowdoin Street and Pine Hill
Avenue, for every Tuesday eve
ning between 7 and 9 p.m.
A hard year lies ahead in de
fending the championship title.
Stanford University will have to
decide for itself now whether to
lose it or to keep it.

Just now it is fashionable to
speak for student power, black
power, faculty power, brown
power, and union power. It is not
quite clear whether the next
"power" move will come from the
janitors, the football squad, the
telephone operators, or the pink
polka-dot men from Mars.
The T/A's tell us they are
underpaid. The BSU says we are
racist. The students complain that
they are graded unfairly. The
ROTC says nobody understands
the military mind. The SDS says
the Biz School and the Engineers
are part of the dirty-minded estab
lishment and must be wiped out
so that Utopia can arrive on sched
ule. The Law students argue that
the review is discriminatory. The
undergrads complain that Psych is
irrelevant. Rafferty and the YAF
want the Left repressed. Admini
strators complain we have so
many committees that nothing
can be done.
What I want o know is, Where
do we get the money to pay for
all these things—from Governor
Reagan, the good fairy or mil
lionaires who believe in burning
down the colleges? What student
ever thought he got a grade that
was too high? How do we run the
world without the electric power,
the tools, the cars, the refriger
ators, the clothes, the heaters, and
all the other things only engineers
and Biz school types are prepared
to make for us? What the heck
does SDS mean by this dandy
Utopia which they have yet to
describe, name, or discuss? How
do we get along without laws—by
killing each other or merely
maiming our neighbors? Is the
ritual of sacrificing victims to the

self-identified with the system
that it cannot speak to the issues?
Is the faculty tongue-tied? (Now
that would be novel!) Are the
radical students so blood-thirsty
that they can only make demands
that demean, impugn, and even
destroy individuals who have
spent their lives working for the
education of oncoming genera
tions in the best ways they know?
Has the rational thinking gone out
of style entirely?
Isn't it about time someone
paraphrased John Kennedy to ask,
"What can you do for the univer
sity?" Isn't it about time someone
spoke for education, for free
speech, for constructive change by
orderly processes, and for those
students who want a relevant but
also first-class education?
How about you and me?

• Average Student's View
Editor, THE DAILY:
I happened to be in the union
at 1:30 Thursday when a group of
50 to 100 black students and
sympathizers came into Tresidder
Union and made what might be
called a mass raid on the cafeteria.
Under the apparent leadership of
one fellow with a bullhorn, who
shouted something to the effect
of "free food", they proceeded to
pull away a railing of the turnstile
at the side entrance to the counter
area and to drift in and out, bring
ing away whatever food they
liked; hamburgers, apples, sand
wicges, and a banana split. With
all the impotence of the unpre
pared, the employees continued
to man their counters, and the
checkers their cash registers; less
opportunistic clients continued to
pay for their food, and the mass
of studentry in the cafeteria went
on chatting at their tables as if
nothing was happening.
Now I was just a passerby, an
"average" student, with the usual
degree of sympathy to BSU
grievances and no particular
awareness of this day's demonstra
tion or what happened later on;
nevertheless the Tresidder inci
dent made me madder than hell,
and apparently a lot of people felt
the same, although they didn't
show it. "They ought to get the
police and clear the whole bunch
out", were the sort of comments I
heard, and well I might. For to
any bystander, the whole incident
was just a patent and despicable
act of stealing.
To the perpetrators at the time
it looked different, no doubt, but
whatever their point of view, I am
convinced that the whole affair
was actually contrary to the basic
principles of both offenders and
offended alike. The BSU may be
trying to change our society in its
small way here at Stanford, but
surely it is not actually trying to
modify that one basic value of our
society, in fact of all societies,
namely that stealing is wrong.
Any justification of the Tresidder
raid, then, must be given in terms
of the means to an end. And yet

as means the raid was disastrous.
Such an incident paints the BSU
crusade in the colors of theft and
lawlessness. It alienates those like
myself sympathetic to the basic
nature of the demands. It polar
izes people pro and con and
makes administrative opposition
even more bullheaded. And finally
it achieves nothing (unless free
food be an achievement).
Clearly it is a case where indi
viduals that should have known
better acted as a mindless mob,
and it is high time not only for
concerned citizens to protest such
mob action and resist it, but
also—and even more important —
for the participants in that mob to
wise up. May the conscience of
the Stanford community know of
and react to this little incident—
and enough so it really hurts the
perpetrators, that is, so they don't
forget their error. Otherwise both
sides will suffer; the offenders is a
more hostile Stanford commu
nity, and the offended in more
unpleasant incidents of this type.

•Editorial Disappointing
Editor, THE DAILY:
In your commendable efforts
to observe "last Thursday" from
many points of view, you seem to
avoid blaming student confronta
tion tactics. Is it possible that the
problem was not so much the
President being where there was
only one phone—as a crowd which
put him there?
Various groups in the commu
nity have voted in the past to op
pose and deplore coercive con
frontation tactics in our efforts to
make constructive change. It
seems that we've had another
example of why the majority so
voted in each case. I'm disappoint
ed that your editorial concerns are
less for this basic problem than
for the President's being late to an
on-again-off-again meeting which
he had not scheduled in the first
place.

pictured in your Friday issue. But
don't fret; we have a pretty good
idea why we are mistaken for each
other so often.
• Presidio And ROTC
Editor, THE DAILY:
The Daily's editorial on the
case of the Presidio 27 was one of
the most eloquent indictments of
the military system in this coun

try that I've seen. It is rather
ironic that the outrage committed
at the Presidio should have occur
red just when Stanford is in the
midst of a debate over ROTC.
One of the more popular
arguments in favor of keeping
ROTC is that it provides "an en
lightened officer corps," made up
of men presumably more humane
than the officers turned out by
the military academies.
The exhaustively documented
accounts of U.S. military activities
in Vietnam, which include satura
tion bombing, the burning of vil
lages, despoiling food crops, tor
turing prisoners, and uprooting
whole populations and herding
them behind barbed wire, make it
clear that so far ROTC graduates
have not "enlightened" the armed
services to any appreciable degree.
It is even just possible that the
Army exerts its influence over the
ROTC graduate before he ever
gets around to changing the
Army.
In any case, continuance of
ROTC at Stanford is not what will
eventually stop the kind of cold
blooded brutality demonstrated in
Vietnam and at the Presidio. On
the contrary, it would simply
mean continued sanction of the
present evils by the University.
Withdrawal of this sanction by
Stanford would be a clearer mes
sage to the Pentagon than any
number of "humane" 2nd Lieu
tenants could ever give.

• Table-Tennis Survival
Editor, THE DAILY:
1 wish to bring to the attention
of the University the survival for
the Stanford Table-Tennis Team,
champion of the Regional Inter
collegiate Table Tennis Tourna
ment.
Stanford University has been
the champion of the Regional
Inter-collegiate Table Tennis
Tournament successively for the
past five years. In this year's
tournament which took place last
Friday and Saturday here, Stan
ford University once again success
fully defended its title and cap
tured the First and Second in
man's single, and First in man's
doubles. Surprise to say that such
campus activity should miss the
interest of The Daily, and not
many people knew about it.
It is unbelievable that a univer
sity that has been the leader of
this sport, does not even have a
place for its members to practice.
The old practice room was in

Tresidder Union game room until
last quarter. For some reasons, the
Table Tennis room was replaced
by a pool room whose former
space was given to a coffee house.
In its desperate struggle for
survival, the Table-Tennis Club
has temporarily borrowed a room
from the Recreation Center loca
ted at the junction between
Bowdoin Street and Pine Hill
Avenue, for every Tuesday eve
ning between 7 and 9 p.m.
A hard year lies ahead in de
fending the championship title.
Stanford University will have to
decide for itself now whether to
lose it or to keep it.
TIAN-YEE-LAM

Editor, THE DAILY:
Just now it is fashionable to
speak for student power, black
power, faculty power, brown
power, and union power. It is not
quite clear whether the next
"power" move will come from the
janitors, the football squad, the
telephone operators, or the pink
polka-dot men from Mars.
The T/A's tell us they are
underpaid. The BSU says we are
racist. The students complain that
they are graded unfairly. The
ROTC says nobody understands
the military mind. The SDS says
the Biz School and the Engineers
are part of the dirty-minded estab
lishment and must be wiped out
so that Utopia can arrive on sched
ule. The Law students argue that
the review is discriminatory. The
undergrads complain that Psych is
irrelevant. Rafferty and the YAF
want the Left repressed. Admini
strators complain we have so
many committees that nothing
can be done.
What I want o know is, Where
do we get the money to pay for
all these things—from Governor
Reagan, the good fairy or mil
lionaires who believe in burning
down the colleges? What student
ever thought he got a grade that
was too high? How do we run the
world without the electric power,
the tools, the cars, the refriger
ators, the clothes, the heaters, and
all the other things only engineers
and Biz school types are prepared
to make for us? What the heck
does SDS mean by this dandy
Utopia which they have yet to
describe, name, or discuss? How
do we get along without laws—by
killing each other or merely
maiming our neighbors? Is the
ritual of sacrificing victims to the
"gods" an improvement on stud
ies of how man can harness his
emotions for constructive pur
poses? Can society progress by
standing still and repressing all
new ideas?
And for the universities, what I
want to know is. Who speaks for
the freedom for each of us to say
what he thinks without being spit
on, bombed, beat up, or intimi
dated? Who speaks for the pro
gress of the educational process as
a whole? Who speaks for the long
ran ge benefits of man? Who
speaks for love not war on cam
pus? Who listens to an opposing
view? Is the Administration so
self-identified with the system
that it cannot speak to the issues?
Is the faculty tongue-tied? (Now
that would be novel!) Are the
radical students so blood-thirsty
that they can only make demands
that demean, impugn, and even
destroy individuals who have
spent their lives working for the
education of oncoming genera
tions in the best ways they know?
