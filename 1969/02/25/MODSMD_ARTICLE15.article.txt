## Berkeley Violence--Forced Dilemma? 
### Bruce H. Petri 
February -:u: iierKeii'y —
Today I was tear-gassed ad
nauseum. At last! After reading so
much about riots and student
police confrontations and seeing
so many gory pictures, I wanted
to be a part of the melee. Not to
contribute to it, but to see, ob
serve, make notes, mentally digest
them and form an informed
opinion about (if not all such con
frontations) at least one such
brouhaha.
For three hours strikers at
Berkeley marched through class
room buildings, threw cherry
bombs, urged others to join the
march, and demanded an immed
iate acceptance of their demands.
A few days ago I sat in the stu
dent union when they marched
through; suddenly, someone must
have said something or done
something (one would hope there
was some provocation or the re
sulting action would be a symp
tom of insanity) and the strikers
smashed windows, threw trays on
the ground, and one striker hurled
a chair through the air. Luckily,
no one was hit.
In any case, today's action
simmered during hours of bursting
cherry bombs, which sometimes
exploded dangerously close to
policemen's faces (they had hel
mets and vizors). Any fool could
see that the police kept looking
for the culprits among the
hundreds of students, at least half
of whom were onlookers like
myself, either reportorial curious,
or sadistic ("If they're going to
bash someone's skull in, send me
an invitation").
Finally, it happened. A police
man saw one of the students
throw a cherry bomb and lit out
after him to arrest him. The stu
dent split, and fast. From one end

of the plaza to the other they
raced, the crowd separating to
make way for them. The demon
strator headed for a group of
supporters. The Red Sea divided
for him and immediately closed
again; unable to check his gait, the
cop ran into them, then between
them. But by that time, the
demonstrator had disappeared.
The crowd cheered his victory
from the pig ("Oink, oink," etc.).
Meanwhile, I held fast to the
place I had been standing in for
almost three hours; a heightened
portion of the cement retaining
wall by the steps of the main ad
ministration building (Sproul) in
front of which all this was hap
pening.
Meanwhile, other demonstra
tors had overturned two paddy
wagons on the other side of the
building and although the news
reports say that only the police
used tear gas, I could almost swear
that the first bomb was either a
stink or tear-gas bomb thrown by
a demonstrator (they have used
them off and on during the last
four weeks). The simple reason: it
was sitting on Sproul steps, where
policemen had been stationed and
its stink was driving the policemen
from an area they had previously
held. If the police were using the
tear gas at that point, why would
they have it thrown or planted in
their own ranks? It wasn't hurting
the students and was only hurting
them. Fortunately, the wind was
blowing the smoke away from me,
so that although the tear-gas
bomb was only fifteen or twenty
feet away, I could still see all the
action clearly, and without
nausea.
Then hell broke loose. I saw
the second tear gas cannister fly
into the police ranks in back of
me; how the early news reports
can picture these cannisters as
ones thrown by police (at police!)
is beyond me. In any case, soon
there were three stink bombs be
hind me and the police did start
using tear gas and throwing the
others back into the mass of
people in front of me and a game
began of seeing which side could
keep the gas bombs among the
opposition.
There will no doubt be hund
reds or even thousands of students
who will complain about the tear
gas; but I don't complain one
whit. First of all, I'm not sure that
the police used it first. Second, a
lot of the demonstrators had
come prepared with make-shift
gas masks and whatnot and
avowed that they would provoke

such a confrontation. Third, it
was an exhilarating experience,
albeit an unpleasant one.
When I think of the meetings
of the strikers, how totally un
democratic they are, how little
talk there has been about minor
ity rights ever since the police
came on campus, and how much
talk there has been about shutting
down the university by student
power, I have become convinced
of the inexperience of the modern
student in traditional politics and
his desire to have instead a politics
of confrontation—especially since
with politics of confrontation,
tactics are devised on the spot ac
cording to how one feels at the
moment. It is really a politics of
emotion versus the traditional
politics of logic (not that there
aren't shadings).
It is curious that students who
are the offspring of a democratic
society should also be so inter
ested in non-democratic means. I
have spoken at different meetings
held by various radical organiza
tions, but no one is interested in
the implementation of what they
wish to have. They just want
whatever it is as soon as they can.
One thought about this attitude is
that perhaps it has been greatly
encouraged by the TV commer
cials which produce instant love

upon gargling the right mouth
wash, or furnish a beautiful,
trouble-free existence by swallow
ing the manufacturer's tablet (not
to mention the programs which
make impossible missions solvable
in a half hour or hour). There are
so many illogicalities at the basis
of their extreme demands that the
strikers lose support for any sen
sible demands which they have.
The demonstrators also force
the situation into as much of an
all one-way, all the other dilemma
as they can. It has not been
adequately reported how the
strikers broke the law not only by
blocking free access on a public
thoroughfare (the main entrance
to the university, no less) but also
by beating anyone, including eld
erly ladies, who tried to cross the
picket line. The point is not that
some people were foolish enough
to try to cross the picket line, but
that the picket line was illegal
The strikers clearly do not wish to
use legal means to get what they
want; and in many cases, they do
not even know what they really
want in any concrete sense.
All they know is that they
want a confrontation; and that
they are getting.
