# Yale Prof, Harold Lasswell, Discusses 'Policy Sciences'
## 
### SIGOURNEY WEAVER 
What are "the policy sci
ences"? Who are the policy
makers? Harold D. Lasswell, Pro
fessor of Law and Political Sci
ence at Yale University, believes
that every field from political
science to religion can act as a
science in developing policy to
deal with the fundamental prob
lems of man in society.
You, I, and Billy Graham, if we
are all authorities on particular
aspects of human relations, may
throw off the bonds of our spe
cializations and work together to
realize more fully the dignity of
man. We can all be "policy
makers."
In a lecture sponsored by the
Political Science Department at
Tresidder Union last Thursday,

Professor Lasswell spoke on "The
Prospects of the Policy Sciences."
The term "the policy sciences"
was coined by Professor Laswell
and his colleagues following World
War II to describe a configurative
approach to the problems of
society. Only recently, however,
have the effects of this despecial
izing emphasis been discernible.
The orientation of the policy
sciences facilitates "the creative
exchange" of different specializa
tions, making possible the ac
cumulation of all relevant know
ledge for the perusal of those
shaping policy. Much emphasis
was placed by Professor Lasswell
on the necessity of expanding the
procedures through which perti
nent information is mobilized.
Then policy goals must be clari
fied, trends must be noted, alter
natives assessed constantly and
finally plans for action may be
implemented to shape the future
"by exerting influence on trends
that flow from the past into the
present."

Professor Lasswell spoke about
his recent participation in an ex
periment set in a mental hospital
in which the policy sciences ap
proach revealed the existence of
"power-sharing" among the in
mates, thus showing how the
insight of political scientists may
aid psychiatrists in understanding
the social development of their
patients.
Professor Lasswell described
the inmates as "a large number of
refugees from a society whose
values they had rejected." "How
do you assist and clarify the devel

opment of subcultures in today's
society?" asked Lasswell, express
ing the kind of far-reaching con
cern that earned him the title of
"master of all the social sciences
and pioneer in each."
Optimistic conerning the
future effects of the policy sci
ences, Professor Lasswell was
delighted to see an increasing
concern of universities and profes
sional groups with what their
social positions and roles entail.
At Yale processes are being devel
oped in which one may realistical
ly inspect the state of existing
social structures in the society of
the future and perceive how they
should be modified and improved.
He also heralded greater inter
national cooperation in dealing
with social problems. Proposals
are being considered at this time
to found world academies and
universities to mobilize trans-
all available knowledge.

What are "the policy sci
ences"? Who are the policy
makers? Harold D. Lasswell, Pro
fessor of Law and Political Sci
ence at Yale University, believes
that every field from political
science to religion can act as a
science in developing policy to
deal with the fundamental prob
lems of man in society.
You, I, and Billy Graham, if we
are all authorities on particular
aspects of human relations, may
throw off the bonds of our spe
cializations and work together to
realize more fully the dignity of
man. We can all be "policy
makers."
In a lecture sponsored by the
Political Science Department at
Tresidder Union last Thursday,

Professor Lasswell spoke on "The
Prospects of the Policy Sciences."
The term "the policy sciences"
was coined by Professor Laswell
and his colleagues following World
War II to describe a configurative
approach to the problems of
society. Only recently, however,
have the effects of this despecial
izing emphasis been discernible.
The orientation of the policy
sciences facilitates "the creative
exchange" of different specializa
tions, making possible the ac
cumulation of all relevant know
ledge for the perusal of those
shaping policy. Much emphasis
was placed by Professor Lasswell
on the necessity of expanding the
procedures through which perti
nent information is mobilized.
Then policy goals must be clari
fied, trends must be noted, alter
natives assessed constantly and
finally plans for action may be
implemented to shape the future
"by exerting influence on trends
that flow from the past into the
present."
Will Aid Psychiatrists
Professor Lasswell spoke about
his recent participation in an ex
periment set in a mental hospital
in which the policy sciences ap
proach revealed the existence of
"power-sharing" among the in
mates, thus showing how the
insight of political scientists may
aid psychiatrists in understanding
the social development of their
patients.
Professor Lasswell described
the inmates as "a large number of
refugees from a society whose
values they had rejected." "How
do you assist and clarify the devel

opment of subcultures in today's
society?" asked Lasswell, express
ing the kind of far-reaching con
cern that earned him the title of
"master of all the social sciences
and pioneer in each."
Optimistic conerning the
future effects of the policy sci
ences, Professor Lasswell was
delighted to see an increasing
concern of universities and profes
sional groups with what their
social positions and roles entail.
At Yale processes are being devel
oped in which one may realistical
ly inspect the state of existing
social structures in the society of
the future and perceive how they
should be modified and improved.
He also heralded greater inter
national cooperation in dealing
with social problems. Proposals
are being considered at this time
to found world academies and
universities to mobilize trans-
all available knowledge.
