# Ram's Head Presents 'Tom Paine,' Paul Foster's Off-Off Broadway Play
## 
### ROBIN LAKE 
Wednesday through Saturday
of this week Ram's Head will pre
sent Tom Paine in the Nitery. Paul
Foster's play is a prime example
of the new movement in Amer
ican theater, as exemplified by
The Living Theatre and Off-Off
Broadway.
For the who, how, where and
why of the latter I recommend 8
Plays from Off-Off Broadway
available at the Bookstore. I quote
from Michael Smith's introduc
tion: "Off-Off Broadway .. .is
amateur theatre done largely by
professionals. It is theatre with no
resources but the most sophisti
cated audience in America. It is
both casual community theatre
and dedicated experimental the
atre. It is proposing an alternative
to an established theatre which
hardly knows it exists . . .an alter
native to the established theatre
rather than a way into it."
This was written in 1966 and
the movement has flourished.
Tom Paine will give us an oppor

tunity to find out what all the
noise is about.
In his introduction to the Ever
green text of Tom Paine, Tom
O'Horgan, who has directed all of
Foster's plays, states:
"I am trying to remember what
it was first like to read the script
of Tom Paine of course, my senses
are not virgin to the plays of Paul
Foster . . .so it is impossible for
me to get to where your inno
cence may be. But the thought of
the reader (audience) having to
crack the script (production)
unforewarned is somewhat dis
turbing.
"The play was developed con
jointly with the La Mama Troupe
and myself, as director . . .The
terrain of Foster's work is not
easy to know. His theater im
pulses seem to spring from earlier
times and are mixed with new in
vention; they bear little relation
ship to the recent past; they never
impose a secondary reality, but
instead deal directly with the con
frontation of the audience.
"Choice and chance have al
ways played a large part in art,
whether it has been in interpreta
tions or in procedure, and in the
current theater, choice and chance

have recently been re-instated in a
place of dignity. In Tom Paine,
Foster has explored deeply into
this territory and the sense of
chance operates fully. By offering
the actors improvisational 'seed
lines' which are to be planted in a
body of improvised movements,
and initiating freely improvised
discussion of the play, in which,
in our production, the audiences
were encouraged to participate,
the audience is presented with
three levels of theatrical reality:
The level of the text, which is
tightly set down by the author to
be performed exactly as written;
the improvisational level, which
freely uses the seed lines; and the

third level of open discussion.
"Another example of the audi
ence's choice comes from Foster's
view of the protagonist. Foster
has deliberately chosen as hero a
character who is beyond em
pathy . . .who was at once one of
our greatest heroes and made by
some into an archvillain. Foster
has divided this controversial per
sonality into a real self and a
reputation. This inaccessibility
works inversely, forcing audiences
to fill the vacuum where the
nature of the traditional theatrical
hero usually is. The result is pro
foundly disturbing." O'Horgan
ends his introduction with a call
to judge for ourselves.

of Tom Paine of course, my senses
are not virgin to the plays of Paul
Foster . . .so it is impossible for
me to get to where your inno
cence may be. But the thought of
the reader (audience) having to
crack the script (production)
unforewarned is somewhat dis
turbing.
"The play was developed con
jointly with the La Mama Troupe
and myself, as director . . .The
terrain of Foster's work is not
easy to know. His theater im
pulses seem to spring from earlier
times and are mixed with new in
vention; they bear little relation
ship to the recent past; they never
impose a secondary reality, but
instead deal directly with the con
frontation of the audience.
"Choice and chance have al
ways played a large part in art,
whether it has been in interpreta
tions or in procedure, and in the
current theater, choice and chance

have recently been re-instated in a
place of dignity. In Tom Paine,
Foster has explored deeply into
this territory and the sense of
chance operates fully. By offering
the actors improvisational 'seed
lines' which are to be planted in a
body of improvised movements,
and initiating freely improvised
discussion of the play, in which,
in our production, the audiences
were encouraged to participate,
the audience is presented with
three levels of theatrical reality:
The level of the text, which is
tightly set down by the author to
be performed exactly as written;
the improvisational level, which
freely uses the seed lines; and the

third level of open discussion.
"Another example of the audi
ence's choice comes from Foster's
view of the protagonist. Foster
has deliberately chosen as hero a
character who is beyond em
pathy . . .who was at once one of
our greatest heroes and made by
some into an archvillain. Foster
has divided this controversial per
sonality into a real self and a
reputation. This inaccessibility
works inversely, forcing audiences
to fill the vacuum where the
nature of the traditional theatrical
hero usually is. The result is pro
foundly disturbing." O'Horgan
ends his introduction with a call
to judge for ourselves.
Wednesday through Saturday
of this week Ram's Head will pre
sent Tom Paine in the Nitery. Paul
Foster's play is a prime example
of the new movement in Amer
ican theater, as exemplified by
The Living Theatre and Off-Off
Broadway.
For the who, how, where and
why of the latter I recommend 8
Plays from Off-Off Broadway
available at the Bookstore. I quote
from Michael Smith's introduc
tion: "Off-Off Broadway .. .is
amateur theatre done largely by
professionals. It is theatre with no
resources but the most sophisti
cated audience in America. It is
both casual community theatre
and dedicated experimental the
atre. It is proposing an alternative
to an established theatre which
hardly knows it exists . . .an alter
native to the established theatre
rather than a way into it."
This was written in 1966 and
the movement has flourished.
Tom Paine will give us an oppor

tunity to find out what all the
noise is about.
In his introduction to the Ever
green text of Tom Paine, Tom
O'Horgan, who has directed all of
Foster's plays, states:
