Some of the worthy but lesser
known pictures of Welles, Fields,
Godard and Satyajit Ray are
among the films being shown on
campus this week.
On Tuesday and Wednesday in
Geology 320, Clive Miller is pre
senting Orson Welles' The Lady
from Shanghai, and I Was a Male
War Bride. Lady from Shanghai, a
wonderful mess of a film, con
cludes with Welles' famed Hall of
Mirrors sequence. I Was a Male
War Bride is a funny war-time
comedy directed by Howard
Hawks and starring Cary Grant
and Ann Sheridan.
The Blue Angel, this week's
Western Civ film in Cubberley on
Tuesday at 4:15 and 7:30 and
Wednesday at 4:15 was, in 1929,
one of the first important sound
features. As directed by Joseph
von Sternberg, the picture seems
somewhat somber and melodra
matic, but Marlene Dietrich's
sultry rendition of "Falling in
Love Again" made her an inter
national star.
This week's I-Center film, Devi,
was directed by Satyajit Ray, the
only Indian filmmaker of note in
the West. The film is apt to be
somewhat wearying but Pauline
Kael describes it as "a great exper
ience . . the greatest Indian film
ever made." It will be shown on
Thursday in Cubberley.
The comedy flick at Tresidder
on Friday is Million Dollar Legs
starring W.C. Fields. One of the
master's better pictures, it was
described in 1932 by Motion
Picture Herald as containing "slap
stick hpllv-laughs, damnfW,! non

sense, chases; they're all there,
plus a load of gags that can't fail
to provoke howls of laughter."
Showing with it is the Laurel and
Hardy short, The Music Box, for
which the team won an Academy
Award.
The Burmese Harp is the
Japanese film this Friday at Cub
berley. Directed by Kon Ichikawa,
the film concerns a Japanese sol
dier who remains behind after the
war to bury his dead countrymen.
A number of contemporary
classic underground films will be
shown in Geology-320 on Friday
at 11 PM. Scorpio Rising, one of
the few experimental films to
have had wide distribution, was
made by Kenneth Anger "to in
voke the breaking away from and
purging of the old 'sin-sickened'
age of violence, destruction and
death, leading to resurrection in
the new age." In Robert Breers'
Fist Fight, every frame is an isola
ted image, and Robert Nelsen's
The Off-Handed Jape is a "how to
act absurdity." Also showing are
Ron Rice's Senseless, "filmed in
super antirealism" and Stan
VanDerßeek's See Saw Seems.
Jean-Luc Godard's 1961 pic
ture Une Femme Est Une Femme
is Saturday's French film at Tres
idder. Shot in color and techni
scope, the film is "... a comedy
of abruptly changing moods, veer
ing from farce to near tragedy and
full of the usual odd quirks and
allusions to Godard's favorite dir
ectors . . ." It stars Anne Karina,
Jean-Paul Bemondo and Jean-
Claude Brialy.
The flick at Mem Aud this Sun
day is The Russians Are Coming.

described in 1932 by Motion
Picture Herald as containing "slap
stick hpllv-laughs, damnfW,! non

sense, chases; they're all there,
plus a load of gags that can't fail
to provoke howls of laughter."
Showing with it is the Laurel and
Hardy short, The Music Box, for
which the team won an Academy
Award.
The Burmese Harp is the
Japanese film this Friday at Cub

dier who remains behind after the

A number of contemporary
classic underground films will be
shown in Geology-320 on Friday
at 11 PM. Scorpio Rising, one of
the few experimental films to
have had wide distribution, was
made by Kenneth Anger "to in
voke the breaking away from and
purging of the old 'sin-sickened'
age of violence, destruction and
death, leading to resurrection in
the new age." In Robert Breers'
Fist Fight, every frame is an isola
ted image, and Robert Nelsen's
The Off-Handed Jape is a "how to
act absurdity." Also showing are
Ron Rice's Senseless, "filmed in
super antirealism" and Stan
VanDerßeek's See Saw Seems.
Jean-Luc Godard's 1961 pic
ture Une Femme Est Une Femme
is Saturday's French film at Tres
idder. Shot in color and techni
scope, the film is "... a comedy
of abruptly changing moods, veer
ing from farce to near tragedy and
full of the usual odd quirks and
allusions to Godard's favorite dir
ectors . . ." It stars Anne Karina,
Jean-Paul Bemondo and Jean-
Claude Brialy.
The flick at Mem Aud this Sun
day is The Russians Are Coming.

On Tuesday and Wednesday in
Geology 320, Clive Miller is pre
senting Orson Welles' The Lady
from Shanghai, and I Was a Male
War Bride. Lady from Shanghai, a
wonderful mess of a film, con
cludes with Welles' famed Hall of
Mirrors sequence. I Was a Male
War Bride is a funny war-time
comedy directed by Howard
Hawks and starring Cary Grant
and Ann Sheridan.
The Blue Angel, this week's
Western Civ film in Cubberley on
Tuesday at 4:15 and 7:30 and
Wednesday at 4:15 was, in 1929,
one of the first important sound
features. As directed by Joseph
von Sternberg, the picture seems
somewhat somber and melodra
matic, but Marlene Dietrich's
sultry rendition of "Falling in
Love Again" made her an inter
national star.
This week's I-Center film, Devi,
was directed by Satyajit Ray, the

ever made." It will be shown on
Thursday in Cubberley.
The comedy flick at Tresidder
on Friday is Million Dollar Legs
starring W.C. Fields. One of the
master's better pictures, it was
described in 1932 by Motion
