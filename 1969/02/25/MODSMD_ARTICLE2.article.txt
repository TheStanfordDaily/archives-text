# Rice Students Protesting Over President's Selection
## 
### MARSHALL KILDUFF 
A Group of 1200 Rice University
students and faculty members demon
strated Saturday against the appoint
ment of a successor to President
Kenneth Pitzer.
180 out of 325 faculty members ex
pressed their disapproval of the appoin
tee, University of Chattanooga president
William H. Masterson, on the grounds
that a student-faculty advisory commit
tee, set up to help select a successor to
Pitzer, was not consulted in the move.
In a similar move the Rice student
body passed a resolution on Saturday
by a 951 to 7 margin stating, "The
students of Rice University vigorously
protest and cannot accept the proced
ures used to select the new presi
dent . . . We emphatically request that
the appointment be reconsidered after
appropriate consultation with the stu
dent-faculty presidential committee."
Committee Not Consulted
The controversy stems from a deci
sion of the trustees to name a faculty
screening committee to help a trustee
committee in finding a new president.
The six-man faculty committee then de
cided on its own to include three stu
dents.
The trustees approved on Feb. 14
Masterson's selection. Last Thursday,
when the announcement was formally
made, both the faculty and the students

on the advisory committee were upset
that there had been no consultation.
Trustees Admit Mistake
Robert C. Allen, vice-chairman of the
board of trustees, told the faculty at a
meeting on Friday night, "I can tell
from my heart, that we the board pro
ceeded in good faith. We made an
honest mistake. But I urge you to give
Masterson what every man deserves—a
chance."
When asked by the student-faculty
committee why they had not been con
sulted, Allen replied, "There just isn't
anything I can say to this. On the part
of the Board, we did not think that this
was a correct procedure in this matter."
Dr. Masterson is a Rice graduate and
former dean of humanities at Rice until
he resigned in 1966 to become president
of Chattanooga.
Masterson Unaccepted
A group of 13 student body officers
met with Masterson for five hours dur
ing the weekend. They announced that
his selection was unacceptable. They
declared, "Dr. Masterson has refused
any further meetings with this group or
with the student-faculty committee on
presidential selection.
"This group can only interpret this
action by Dr. Masterson as a refusal to
consider the crucial issue of due pro
cess."
An administration spokesman re

sponded, "They're arguing procedure.
There is only one group that, is legally
authorized to appoint a president and
tha group has acted. This current con
troversy is after the fact."
At a press conference on Sunday,
Masterson stated that he would not re
sign from his new position. However,
later he added, "I would go to the board
of trustees and discuss what is best for
the university" if it appeared that pro
tests and demonstrations were to con
tinue over his selection.
A trustee spokesman admitted that
the board had made a mistake, but the
board reaffirmed their decision to select
Masterson, a former Rice professor.
Pitzer, who was appointed also
amidst much criticism that students
were not consulted in his selection,
commented, "It is partly a misunder
standing. It is most unfortunate that
they didn't seek the advice of the fac
ulty and the students."
According to ASSU president Denis
Hayes, there is speculation that Master
son represents the trustees' desire to see
Rice remain a "regional" college and
not become "national." In their view,
Rice should remain closely attuned to
the specific needs of the region, and not
try to adjust to countrywide educa
tional trends. For example, urban
studies would be ignored in favor of
agriculture.

When asked by the student-faculty
committee why they had not been con
sulted, Allen replied, "There just isn't
anything I can say to this. On the part
of the Board, we did not think that this
was a correct procedure in this matter."
Dr. Masterson is a Rice graduate and
former dean of humanities at Rice until
he resigned in 1966 to become president
of Chattanooga.
Masterson Unaccepted
A group of 13 student body officers
met with Masterson for five hours dur
ing the weekend. They announced that
his selection was unacceptable. They
declared, "Dr. Masterson has refused
any further meetings with this group or
with the student-faculty committee on
presidential selection.
"This group can only interpret this
action by Dr. Masterson as a refusal to
consider the crucial issue of due pro
cess."
An administration spokesman re

sponded, "They're arguing procedure.
There is only one group that, is legally
authorized to appoint a president and
tha group has acted. This current con
troversy is after the fact."
At a press conference on Sunday,
Masterson stated that he would not re
sign from his new position. However,
later he added, "I would go to the board
of trustees and discuss what is best for
the university" if it appeared that pro
tests and demonstrations were to con
tinue over his selection.
A trustee spokesman admitted that
the board had made a mistake, but the
board reaffirmed their decision to select
Masterson, a former Rice professor.
Pitzer, who was appointed also
amidst much criticism that students
were not consulted in his selection,
commented, "It is partly a misunder
standing. It is most unfortunate that
they didn't seek the advice of the fac
ulty and the students."
According to ASSU president Denis
Hayes, there is speculation that Master
son represents the trustees' desire to see
Rice remain a "regional" college and
not become "national." In their view,
Rice should remain closely attuned to
the specific needs of the region, and not
try to adjust to countrywide educa
tional trends. For example, urban
studies would be ignored in favor of
agriculture.
A Group of 1200 Rice University
students and faculty members demon
strated Saturday against the appoint
ment of a successor to President
Kenneth Pitzer.
180 out of 325 faculty members ex
pressed their disapproval of the appoin
tee, University of Chattanooga president
William H. Masterson, on the grounds
that a student-faculty advisory commit
tee, set up to help select a successor to
Pitzer, was not consulted in the move.
In a similar move the Rice student
body passed a resolution on Saturday
by a 951 to 7 margin stating, "The
students of Rice University vigorously
protest and cannot accept the proced
ures used to select the new presi
dent . . . We emphatically request that
the appointment be reconsidered after
appropriate consultation with the stu
dent-faculty presidential committee."
Committee Not Consulted
The controversy stems from a deci
sion of the trustees to name a faculty
screening committee to help a trustee
committee in finding a new president.
The six-man faculty committee then de
cided on its own to include three stu
dents.
The trustees approved on Feb. 14
Masterson's selection. Last Thursday,
when the announcement was formally
made, both the faculty and the students

on the advisory committee were upset
that there had been no consultation.
Trustees Admit Mistake
Robert C. Allen, vice-chairman of the
board of trustees, told the faculty at a
meeting on Friday night, "I can tell
from my heart, that we the board pro
ceeded in good faith. We made an
honest mistake. But I urge you to give
Masterson what every man deserves—a
chance."
