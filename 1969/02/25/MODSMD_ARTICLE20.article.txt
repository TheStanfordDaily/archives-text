# Education Discussed By Black Journalist
## 
### SHARI LEWIS 
The Black liberation movement
is aimed at gaining autonomous
control of grammar and high
schools and not to taking over col
lege campuses, a noted Black
journalist said Wednesday in a
speech on "Black Liberation: The
Schools as Battleground."
"The doctrine is this," Robert
Maynard told an almost all-white
audience. "A people who seek
their liberation from a colonialist
system must control what is
taught to its young . . .demanding
a place for Black children in a
white school system is an admis
sion of inherent Black inferior
ity."
He added that Black education
must be Black oriented in order to
interrupt the current forces of
self-abnegation and give the child
a sense of pride and self-respect.

One member of the audience
asked Maynard why, if the "separ
ate but equal" Plessy decision of
the Supreme Court was unaccept
able before 1954, the Blacks
themselves are advocating essen
tially the same doctrine in 1969.
"It all rests in the key word
control," Maynard replied, Even
in New York where the quality of
education is good, he noted, there
is no pressure on the educator to
gear the curriculum to the chil
dren to make sure they are being
reached.
Maynard's main point was that
there must be this sensitivity to
the educational needs of the chil
dren. One cannot excuse the inef
fectiveness of the system by say
ing that Black children can't learn
because their attention span is
shorter than that of while chil
dren.

He emphasized the inherent
fallacy of this approach by quot
ing a Black author. "Why is it
White children can sit and listen
to rhetoric all day and dig it? Why
is it that Black children sit all day
long and listen to records and dig
it? Is their attention span short
er?"
Maynard pointed out that the
schools are also important, in the
search for a national Black iden
tity. They raise an issue around
which Blacks can rally because of
the clear-cut community interest
involved.
It is "almost as though a peo
ple in search of a mountain are
scouring the plains for pebbles,"
he suggested. "Schools are, in a
cosmic sense, pebbles . . .They are
the pebbles with which Blacks can
build a mountain of self-respect."
