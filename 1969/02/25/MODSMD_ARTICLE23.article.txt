# 'Fortas' Play Opens Today
## 
### 
Stanford's Theatre of the
Congressional Record will present
"The Fortas Debate" today and
March 4.
During the summer President
Johnson submitted the name of
his old friend, Abe Fortas, to re
place Earl Warren as Chief Justice
of the Supreme Court. A move to
block the nomination was begun
immediately by freshman Senator
Robert Griffin.
Mike Mansfield introduced the
procedural motion to take up the
nomination on September 24 and
threatened filibuster the next day.
During the five days before tbe
vote on cloture, an alliance of
conservative Republicans and
Southern Democrats attacked the
philosophy of Justice Fortas and
the entire Warren Court.
John Harris, a junior involved
in planning the presentation, said,
"If someone comes at 4:30, leaves
for dinner and returns at 7:30, he
will still get a very good idea of
what the Senate is all about."
