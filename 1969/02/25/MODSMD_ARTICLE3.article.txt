# Bookstore Incident Investigated
## Pitzer, BSU Continue Negotiations 
### 
President Pitzer met yesterday with
representatives of the Black Student
Union (BSU) as the Dean of Students
Office started a fact-finding investi
gation of Thursday's Bookstore inci
dent, which caused losses now estimated
at more than $6,000.
Six demands were covered in the
talks with the remainder to be discussed
today and next week. According to BSU
co-chairman Leo Bazile, "The BSU is
leading."
Pitzer commented, "We intend to
resume our discussion on the BSU pro
posals and to continue holding meetings
as long as there is no return to the
atmosphere of Thursday."

The BSU Executive Committee
signed a statement Monday stating "it is
our position that so long as Pitzer mani
fests 'good faith' in these negotiations,
yielding positive results, we will not en
courage or condone acts of destruction
on this campus.
"We reserve the right to determine
when that 'good faith' has been vio
lated."
Besides Pitzer, participants in a two
hour session Monday morning included
Provost Richard Lyman, Assistant Pro
vost James Simmons, BSU Co-Chairmen
Nathaniel Kirtman and Leo Bazile, and
BS"' members Johnie Scott and Art
Wilson.

Pitzer had no immediate comment
on progress of the talks, but indicated
they would continue "until we cover all
the territory." Representatives of the
Mexican-American Student Confedera
tion attended a second session with the
BSU Monday afternoon. "Where the in
terests of the two groups are separate
rather than over-lapping, we will discuss
the corresponding questions with each
group," Pitzer said.
Dean of Students Joel Smith said one
purpose of the fact-finding investigation
is to determine whether disciplinary
action can be initiated. Two student
photographers who witnessed the Book
store rampage reported their film was
forcibly confiscated by participants.
Immediately after the incident,
which reportedly involved whites as well
as blacks, several persons in the store
indicated they were unable to identify
the assailants.
Ivan Sanderson, assistant oookstore
manager, placed a "very preliminary"
estimate of losses at $6,449. This total
includes $1787 in merchandise, $1812
in damaged fixtures, $1600 in normal
payroll not recovered from sales, and
$1250 in additional payroll for cleaning
up. It does not include nearly two
dozen broken glass shelves.
Discounts usually given customers
may be reduced or temporarily elimin
ated to make up for the losses. The
bookstore, which now has sales of
nearly $3 million a year has experienced
theft losses of about one percent
annually, about in line with other
college bookstores.
At a special meeting Friday the Sen

ate of the Academic Council con
demned the use of destructive tactics on
campus and urged that "constructive
negotiations" continue between the Ad
ministration and minority student
groups.
The faculty representatives pledged
their willingness "to work toward the
fulfillment of the academic objectives
that emerge from these discussions. We
reject, however, the use of destructive
tactics in the Stanford environment. We
urge all members of the University com
munity to work for an atmosphere of
reason and responsibility. Only in such a
climate can constructive change and im
provement be achieved in this com
munity."
In a separate voice vote they sup
ported the Administration "in its con
tinuing efforts toward current negotia
tions and toward the maintenance of an
atmosphere for constructive change."
BSU Statement
"In our continuing efforts to resolve
many of those obstacles, both academic
and social, facing the Afro-American
student here at Stanford University, it is
the position of the Executive Steering
Committee, BSU, that we do not en
courage nor do we condone acts of des
truction on the campus. This we do as a
show of "Good Faith" on our parts. We
reserve, however, the right to determine
when that "Good Faith" has been vio
lated.
"We found the results of yesterday's
negotiations with the Administration in
the persons of President Pitzer and Pro
vost Lyman to be in the spirit of this
"Good Faith." We admonish the stu
dent body of Stanford University, there
fore, to observe our truce period while
we pursue these efforts.
"History has shown that within the
confines of White America it has only
been with demonstrations of force that
the WASP power elite has been able to
enter into a spirit of unanimity with the
people. This is a sad commentary, but
nonetheless a true one. We hope that
there will exist no further need for such
demonstrations as occured last Thurs
day. So long as we have the cooperation
of the Administration and University,
therefore, we hope we will not be
forced again to illustrate our needs in
such fashion as Thursday."

Committee, BSU, that we do not en
courage nor do we condone acts of des
truction on the campus. This we do as a
show of "Good Faith" on our parts. We
reserve, however, the right to determine
when that "Good Faith" has been vio
lated.
"We found the results of yesterday's
negotiations with the Administration in
the persons of President Pitzer and Pro
vost Lyman to be in the spirit of this
"Good Faith." We admonish the stu
dent body of Stanford University, there
fore, to observe our truce period while
we pursue these efforts.
"History has shown that within the
confines of White America it has only
been with demonstrations of force that
the WASP power elite has been able to
enter into a spirit of unanimity with the
people. This is a sad commentary, but
nonetheless a true one. We hope that
there will exist no further need for such
demonstrations as occured last Thurs
day. So long as we have the cooperation
of the Administration and University,
therefore, we hope we will not be
forced again to illustrate our needs in
such fashion as Thursday."
President Pitzer met yesterday with
representatives of the Black Student
Union (BSU) as the Dean of Students
Office started a fact-finding investi
gation of Thursday's Bookstore inci
dent, which caused losses now estimated
at more than $6,000.
Six demands were covered in the
talks with the remainder to be discussed
today and next week. According to BSU
co-chairman Leo Bazile, "The BSU is
leading."
Pitzer commented, "We intend to
resume our discussion on the BSU pro
posals and to continue holding meetings
as long as there is no return to the
atmosphere of Thursday."

The BSU Executive Committee
signed a statement Monday stating "it is
our position that so long as Pitzer mani
fests 'good faith' in these negotiations,
yielding positive results, we will not en
courage or condone acts of destruction
on this campus.
"We reserve the right to determine
when that 'good faith' has been vio
lated."
Besides Pitzer, participants in a two
hour session Monday morning included
Provost Richard Lyman, Assistant Pro
vost James Simmons, BSU Co-Chairmen
Nathaniel Kirtman and Leo Bazile, and
BS"' members Johnie Scott and Art
Wilson.

Pitzer had no immediate comment
on progress of the talks, but indicated
they would continue "until we cover all
the territory." Representatives of the
Mexican-American Student Confedera
tion attended a second session with the
BSU Monday afternoon. "Where the in
terests of the two groups are separate
rather than over-lapping, we will discuss
the corresponding questions with each
group," Pitzer said.
Dean of Students Joel Smith said one
purpose of the fact-finding investigation
is to determine whether disciplinary
action can be initiated. Two student
photographers who witnessed the Book
store rampage reported their film was
forcibly confiscated by participants.
Immediately after the incident,
which reportedly involved whites as well
as blacks, several persons in the store
indicated they were unable to identify
the assailants.
Ivan Sanderson, assistant oookstore
manager, placed a "very preliminary"
estimate of losses at $6,449. This total
includes $1787 in merchandise, $1812
in damaged fixtures, $1600 in normal
payroll not recovered from sales, and
$1250 in additional payroll for cleaning
up. It does not include nearly two
dozen broken glass shelves.
Discounts usually given customers
may be reduced or temporarily elimin
ated to make up for the losses. The
bookstore, which now has sales of
nearly $3 million a year has experienced
theft losses of about one percent
annually, about in line with other
college bookstores.
At a special meeting Friday the Sen

ate of the Academic Council con
demned the use of destructive tactics on
campus and urged that "constructive
negotiations" continue between the Ad
ministration and minority student
groups.
The faculty representatives pledged
their willingness "to work toward the
fulfillment of the academic objectives
that emerge from these discussions. We
reject, however, the use of destructive
tactics in the Stanford environment. We
urge all members of the University com
munity to work for an atmosphere of
reason and responsibility. Only in such a
climate can constructive change and im
provement be achieved in this com
munity."
In a separate voice vote they sup
ported the Administration "in its con
tinuing efforts toward current negotia
tions and toward the maintenance of an
atmosphere for constructive change."

At a special meeting Friday the Sen

ate of the Academic Council con
demned the use of destructive tactics on
campus and urged that "constructive
negotiations" continue between the Ad
ministration and minority student
groups.
The faculty representatives pledged
their willingness "to work toward the
fulfillment of the academic objectives
that emerge from these discussions. We
reject, however, the use of destructive
tactics in the Stanford environment. We
urge all members of the University com
munity to work for an atmosphere of
reason and responsibility. Only in such a
climate can constructive change and im
provement be achieved in this com
munity."
In a separate voice vote they sup
ported the Administration "in its con
tinuing efforts toward current negotia
tions and toward the maintenance of an
atmosphere for constructive change."
BSU Statement
"In our continuing efforts to resolve
many of those obstacles, both academic
and social, facing the Afro-American
student here at Stanford University, it is
the position of the Executive Steering
Committee, BSU, that we do not en
courage nor do we condone acts of des
truction on the campus. This we do as a
show of "Good Faith" on our parts. We
reserve, however, the right to determine
when that "Good Faith" has been vio
lated.
"We found the results of yesterday's
negotiations with the Administration in
the persons of President Pitzer and Pro
vost Lyman to be in the spirit of this
"Good Faith." We admonish the stu
dent body of Stanford University, there
fore, to observe our truce period while
we pursue these efforts.
"History has shown that within the
confines of White America it has only
been with demonstrations of force that
the WASP power elite has been able to
enter into a spirit of unanimity with the
people. This is a sad commentary, but
nonetheless a true one. We hope that
there will exist no further need for such
demonstrations as occured last Thurs
day. So long as we have the cooperation
of the Administration and University,
therefore, we hope we will not be
forced again to illustrate our needs in
such fashion as Thursday."
