# Tentative End To Strike At SF State Announced
## 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO (AP)-An
agreement to end a teacher's strike at
San Francisco State College was
announced Monday, but no one would
predict when the teachers would return
to work.
The agreement, by Local 1352 of the
American Federation of Teachers, on
strike since Jan. 6, makes no mention of
a minority student strike which has
disrupted the campus since Nov. 6.
The AFT claims 400 members among
the 1,200 persons on the college
faculty, but only about 200 are striking.
Victor van Bourg, AFT attorney, said
the teachers would not return "if there
is not peace on campus."
Acting President S.I. Hayakawa said
he was a "little unsure" of what the
agreement meant, particularly in regard
to a "peaceful and free academic
atmosphere.
"It would be a pleasure to be assured
that the strike is really over, but I am
not yet sure that this is really the case."
Meetings between the Third World
Liberation Front, representing striking
students, and a committee apponted by
Acting President S.I. Hayakawa
continued Monday, but with no
indications of progress.

Roger Alvardo, leader of the TWLF,
said: "I don't think there will be any
peace or tranquility or any harmonious
academic environment until the TWLF
strike is settled."
Announcement of the settlement was
made at a news conference called by
San Francisco Mayor Joseph Alioto.
Alioto said the action would permit
the 18,000-student campus to return to
near normal conditions soon.
"We can handle the student strike.
We can handle it by ordinary means. A
teacher's strike was something special,"
Alioto said.
Hayakawa, in a statement made
shortly before the agreement was
announced, indicated the college was
ready to present the teachers with an
ultimatum.
This ultimatum, he said, could
include withdrawal of classes taught by
striking teachers from the curriculum
and canceling of an offer to rehire all
ousted union teachers.
The agreement was ratified last
Thursday by AFT members, Van Bourg
said.
The State College Board of Trustees
is expected to act on the agreement
Tuesday.
