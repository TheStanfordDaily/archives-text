# 'Proud Of What We Did'
## SJC Hearings Conclude 
### 
Last Friday's Student Judicial Coun
cil Hearing in effect, did not put the
student defendants on trial. The de
fendants, mostly SDS members, put
American society on trial.
What began as a hearing of the justifi
cation of defendants for disrupting last
month's Trustee meeting proved to be a
detailed statement of radical philoso
phy.
What was supposed to be the group's
defense of their actions soon turned
into a scathing attack of the University,
the Board of Trustees, and American
politics, and U.S. society in general.
What was intended to be a trial of
the accused became one of the most sig
nificant opportunities in a long time for

the defendants to publicize and gain
support for their beliefs.
Motivation Important
"1 don't think the real and only issue
was whether we disrupted the
Trustees," stated defendant Jim Shoch.
"We care about our motivation which is
our politics . . .a political and ideologi
cal stance that is fundamentally op
posed to that of the Trustees."
In an almost six-hour display of
unity and commitment, the defendants
stressed the urgency of making their be
liefs heard, "by any means necessary,"
and their presentation reflected the con
clusion of SDS leader, Fred Cohen, who
declared, "We're proud of what we did,
and we'd to it again."
Their motivational explanation, en
titled "Twenty-nine Souls in Search of
an Ideology" commenced by the dis
tribution of a large number of eclairs
and cakes. According to one defendant,
"We were accused of eating some of the
Trustee's eclairs, and we want to show
that we don't think eclairs are such a big
deal."
No Trustees Present
Eight Trustees were requested to at
tend the hearing, and although five re
sponded by letter, none arrived in
person.
"Trustee Arthur C. Stewart sent us a
letter," griped defendant Christa Mrak,
"which reads, '(I) was disappointed to
learn that the Council was still con
ducting hearings . . .' "I infer from this
that they're much more interested in
the outcome of these hearings than they
are in the proceedings . . .and obviously
not too interested in what these de
fendants are all about . . .

"I also infer," Miss Mrak continued,
"that the same mentality that considers
it's their prerogative not to attend these
hearings is the mentality that allowed
them to consider a meeting of students
to question open meetings as a dis
ruption, and that they have a right to
keep their meetings closed.
Concerns Different
" . . .Student concerns," Miss Mrak
complained, "are not the concerns of
the Trustees . . ."They have yet to face
up to the issues we've raised—or their
students," she added.
Miss Mrak further complained that
students have "no means of sanctioning
the Trustees activities, questioning their
ideologies, or their priorities in running
this university. "They're responsible to
no one . .
She referred to Trustee Dean
Watkins' testimony that he is not re
sponsible to students. "They don"t have
to listen," "much less act."
Different Role For University
Defendant Jim Shoch voiced further
complaint with the University, "We'd
like to see the University assume the
role of a critical institution, criticizing
existing deficiencies in society," Shoch
stated, instead of "perpetuating the rule
in America of one class at the expense
of the many other classes."
"The ruling class," he explained,
"controls the bulk of the wealth, and,
therefore the bulk of the power, and
fills the slots of political power." The
Trustees "are all fabulously wealthy
men . . .and through their power .. .
they set the educational atmosphere at
Stanford . . .
