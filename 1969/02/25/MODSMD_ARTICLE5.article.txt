# 'Proud Of What We Did'
## SJC Hearings Conclude 
### 
Last Friday's Student Judicial Coun
cil Hearing in effect, did not put the
student defendants on trial. The de
fendants, mostly SDS members, put
American society on trial.
What began as a hearing of the justifi
cation of defendants for disrupting last
month's Trustee meeting proved to be a
detailed statement of radical philoso
phy.
What was supposed to be the group's
defense of their actions soon turned
into a scathing attack of the University,
the Board of Trustees, and American
politics, and U.S. society in general.
What was intended to be a trial of
the accused became one of the most sig
nificant opportunities in a long time for

the defendants to publicize and gain
support for their beliefs.
Motivation Important
"1 don't think the real and only issue
was whether we disrupted the
Trustees," stated defendant Jim Shoch.
"We care about our motivation which is
our politics . . .a political and ideologi
cal stance that is fundamentally op
posed to that of the Trustees."
In an almost six-hour display of
unity and commitment, the defendants
stressed the urgency of making their be
liefs heard, "by any means necessary,"
and their presentation reflected the con
clusion of SDS leader, Fred Cohen, who
declared, "We're proud of what we did,
and we'd to it again."
Their motivational explanation, en
titled "Twenty-nine Souls in Search of
an Ideology" commenced by the dis
tribution of a large number of eclairs
and cakes. According to one defendant,
"We were accused of eating some of the
Trustee's eclairs, and we want to show
that we don't think eclairs are such a big
deal."
No Trustees Present
Eight Trustees were requested to at
tend the hearing, and although five re
sponded by letter, none arrived in
person.
"Trustee Arthur C. Stewart sent us a
letter," griped defendant Christa Mrak,
"which reads, '(I) was disappointed to
learn that the Council was still con
ducting hearings . . .' "I infer from this
that they're much more interested in
the outcome of these hearings than they
are in the proceedings . . .and obviously
not too interested in what these de
fendants are all about . . .

"I also infer," Miss Mrak continued,
"that the same mentality that considers
it's their prerogative not to attend these
hearings is the mentality that allowed
them to consider a meeting of students
to question open meetings as a dis
ruption, and that they have a right to
keep their meetings closed.
Concerns Different
" . . .Student concerns," Miss Mrak
complained, "are not the concerns of
the Trustees . . ."They have yet to face
up to the issues we've raised—or their
students," she added.
Miss Mrak further complained that
students have "no means of sanctioning
the Trustees activities, questioning their
ideologies, or their priorities in running
this university. "They're responsible to
no one . .
She referred to Trustee Dean
Watkins' testimony that he is not re
sponsible to students. "They don"t have
to listen," "much less act."
Different Role For University
Defendant Jim Shoch voiced further
complaint with the University, "We'd
like to see the University assume the
role of a critical institution, criticizing
existing deficiencies in society," Shoch
stated, instead of "perpetuating the rule
in America of one class at the expense
of the many other classes."
"The ruling class," he explained,
"controls the bulk of the wealth, and,
therefore the bulk of the power, and
fills the slots of political power." The
Trustees "are all fabulously wealthy
men . . .and through their power .. .
they set the educational atmosphere at
Stanford . . .
"lt's crucial to know whether
the University is used by the
Trustees to further their own class
interest." Shoch asserted, "yes,
they do."
(Shoch's further statement on
the topic, "This is what we're out
to destroy" was incorrectly
quoted in yesterday's Daily.)
Defense Contracts
He went on to point out that
most of the Trustees through their
ties with corporations are en
gaging in numerous defense con
tracts.
"Stanford as a whole helps to
aid and abet U.S. imperialist
domination in Southeast Asia . . .
and in Latin America . . .and in
doing so, helps to perpetuate
death and oppression."
"The differences between us
and the Trustees are not ones of
communication," Shoch stated,
"but definite political, ideological,
and non-negotiable
differences ..."
For me to be satisfied, the
Trustees would have to cease to
exist either as a body or ultimate
ly as the leaders of the military
oriented corporations that they
head.
"We know our differences have
to be resolved by force," Shoch
concluded. "Rational dialogue
isn't the answer, we have to show
that the nature of class rule, the
nature of power, makes confron
tation a vital necessity to effect
change . . .or to expose the issues
that we're talking about."
"No one would listen to Stan
ford SDS until we disrupted the
Board meeting.. .We've been
charged by the Trustees that we
threatened violence yet they're
making decisions which further
the violence of the Vietnam war."
Napalm
"If we had played by their
rules, we would have napalmed
them." "We're going to get our
demands aired by whatever means
necessary, Shoch asserted. "Our
actions are not reprehensible but
in fact, morally obligatory and in
cumbent upon us to do—and we'll
do them if we think they'll be ef
fective."
"Violence," continued Alan
Christelow in a later presentation,
"results from the insistence of the
dominant powers that the hier
archical distance between them
and us is going to be maintained."
He further pointed out that
"when confrontation is sup
pressed, then it becomes violent."
"We'd like to see a truly demo
cratic, participatory society,"
Shoch added, where decisions are
made by people affected by those
decisions, where human needs are
valued over profits."
Ruling Class Evils
Shoch, Virginia Linsley, and
George Rinehardt went further
into the evils of the ruling class,
great disparities of wealth and
poverty in this country, op

pression of the minorities and the
poor. The defendants also ex
tensively criticized Stanford as an
educational institution.
In a discussion of the Uni
versity and the student, defendant
Marc Heller complained that "this
university really isn't interested in
my education; the Trustees are in
terested in furthering their own
interests . . .the administration
wants equilibrium . . .to have the
thing run smoothly . . .the faculty
is interested in their own research,
their own professional advance
ment; where does that leave me?
"The Trustees," asserted
Heller, "aren't interested in our
education . . .they wouldn't even
come to this hearing. They're not
going to come here and make this
institution relevant to us."
The next part of the presen
tation dealt specifically with the
defendant's complaints of U.S.
foreign policy.
"Our fundamental assump
tion," continued Hal Hamilton, is
"that American involvement is
diametrically opposed to the
interests of Southeast Asian and
their world people . . ." "Most
underdeveloped countries are
masses of hungry, starving
people," Hamilton explained.
"Both military involvements
and foreign aid bolster friendly
governments in these countries
but they tie them to our interests
. . .When people attempt to take
control of their own economy for
their own social needs," he con
cluded, "they are opposed by our
military such as in Vietnam."
Veteran Indignant
Veteran Rod Williams, who
spent two years in Vietnam spoke
indignantly of U.S. involvement
there. "The first question the
villagers wanted to know of me
was 'What was my government's
business there? He wasn't inter
ested in politics . . .he was inter
ested in feeding his family . . .
"If this is such a great fucking
American machine," Williams de
manded "why haven't those
people b een crushed? Because
they're fighting for something
that maybe a lot of you fucking
people don't believe in and that's
freedom."
Fighting For Land
"They're fighting for their
land," the veteran shouted. "They
want to feed their families . . .
"I wasn't radicalized by my
two year stay in Vietnam, I was
radicalized when I got back and
looked at your people. What the
fuck have you done? Nothing."
"I walked into a Trustee meet
ing, Williams stated finally,"I
wanted to ask them, How much
money have you made on this war?
What have you done with that
money? What have you done for
my family? Nothing."
Moral Outrage
Defendant David Pugh con
tended emphatically, "Our re
sponse to Vietnam is moral out

rage. The same values, which led
us to oppose the schrapnel being
lodged in people's bodies and the
napalming have led us to oppose
the whole god damn system of ex
ploitation of the third world."
And Stanford is knee-deep not
only in Vietnam, but in the whole
imperialist system," he declared.
Sum mary
In summary, informal defense
counselor, Doron Weinberg dis
cussed the guilt of the defendants
and their alleged violation of the
campus demonstration policy.
"The law is supposed to judge
both students and Trustees
impartially . . .but that's not
true . . he stated.
"The law is no more value free
than anything else in this society
and the law is, in fact, the tool of
the Trustees ..."
Weinberg emphasized, "The
fact that you (the Council) have
to uphold the law as it exists,"
Weinberg contended, "you have
already put yourself on the side of
the Trustees and against the stu
dents ..."
He concluded, "If that's the
law, then 'yes,' we broke it, but
join us; break it with us, because
that's where justice is."
