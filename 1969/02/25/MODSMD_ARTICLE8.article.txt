# Uncle Ken's Converted Rice

"I can tell you from the heart, that we
the board proceded in good faith. We made
an honest mistake (in not consulting the
student-faculty committee). But I urge you
to give Masterson what every man de
serves—a chance."—Robert C. Allen, vice
chairman of the Rice University board of
Trustees.
Trustee power strikes again, this time at
Rice University, the former domain of
Kenneth Pitzer. The Rice trustees have ap
pointed a new president, William H. Master
son. Unfortunately the trustees failed to
consult a student-faculty presidential
search committee prior to selecting Master
son.
The result is crisis at Rice. The normally
sedate Houston campus is in an uproar over
the selection as 1200 students and faculty
members marched on Masterson's first
press conference last weekend. It is ironic
that through no fault of his own, Pitzer's
arrival at Stanford and departure from Rice
both created a flurry of antagonism toward
trustee power.
Apparently the Rice board did not learn
from mistakes of the Stanford board, just
as the Stanford trustees acted without con
sideration of student concerns. For two
groups of supposedly political people, the
record is pitifully poor.
The Stanford board, at least, consulted a
faculty search committee before appointing
Pitzer. It's late and redundant to note they
entirely missed checking student opinion.
The Rice board seemed to begin its
search with some wisdom. A joint student

faculty search committee was established.
Students appeared to have a voice and Rice
indicated lessons had been learned from
Stanford.
A brief victory. The Rice board has now
created a massive mess for itself and its new
President. Perhaps it will be a health cure.
Once again, trustees may discover the en
lightened path only after demonstrations
and furor.
Yet why must it always be the route of
dramatic demonstration and crisis? Students
for a Democratic Society (SDS) claim that
trustees are evil men, but have rarely found
them to be at fault for lack of adeptness in
their profession. They are damn good at
making money. Trustees must be brillant
businessmen, but experience at Stanford
and Rice all too clearly illustrates that busi
ness sense has little relation to intelligence
and understanding of a university environ
ment.
It is extremely difficult to grasp the
notion that middle age men could act in
total ignorance of unrest among students
today. Do these men not read? They need
only look at CBS news to get a faint under
standing that college students are seeking
increased power. Is there no child rebelling
in their homes or the homes of neighbors?
Corporate capitalism turns off SDS. Ap
parently, it turns off intelligence among
corporate capitalists. We support the stu
dent and faculty of Rice in their battle
against the Middle Ages.
Must Rice boil before it's properly
cooked?
