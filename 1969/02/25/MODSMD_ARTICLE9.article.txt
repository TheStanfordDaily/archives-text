# Two Minutes Of Haight
## Rapping On A Rainy Friday 
### Tim Haight 
Rainy Friday. The day after
rainy Thursday. Two days after
rainy Wednesday. You get the
idea. But this Friday is special, for
it celebrates the confluence of
Our Founder's birthday (you
know, George, who crossed the
Delaware on Christmas, thereby
inspiring the Tet offensive) and
the work week.
You know it's a holiday. You
can park on the oval in front of
Quad at one in the afternoon,
only fifty yards or so away. The
grey light gives dignity to the
Hacienda Gothic halls. Nobody
around. That visit between the
BSU and Pitzer, after Thursday's
fracas, is behind closed doors, if at
all.
Something is going on, though.
Bill Wyman hustles past "la cara
vane verte" into Building Ten.
Denis Hayes sprints across White
Plaza, heading toward Quad. He
nods as he passes. My God! Has he
aged that much in six months? He
looked like Senator Fulbright.
And he forgot his raincoat. The
banker never wears a mac in the
falling rain. Very strange.
Tresidder is alive, as usual.

Going inside is like skin diving in
Hawaii, warm, wet, full of flora
and fauna. Mostly well-dressed
high school kids, striking poses.
Too heavy. Back outside.
And lo! Up on the back ter
race, a high school debate tourna
ment. All becomes clear, as mem
ories descend. Card files, brief
cases, suits and ties, lines in front
of numbers, tables for registra
tion, for judges.
Damn The Losers
I went through that, although
at USC and UCLA, not Stanford.
You get up and rap about some
subject. You argue each side, al
ternatively, round by round.
Somebody wins, somebody loses.
You get points, trophies, chances
to go to bigger contests. If you get
a lot of points, they read it at high
school graduation. The audience
claps, although they were told not
to, because of the people who
have "nothing" to be clapped at
for. But your parents clap, so
others join in. Damn the losers.
Back on down the Quad.
Coming down on Geology Corner
from the Daily offices, more
debaters hustling along. They look
at the room numbers, calculate,
and head off in another direction.
No raincoats here, either. Strange.
Memories: Once I thought the
good life was holding a briefcase,
hurrying down corridors to the
next challenge, like Isabel in her
dark carriage. God.
Behind Mem Chu. Three male
debaters, walking the same way as
the others, striding, in a hurry,
looking for their room. Suddenly
one of them shouts, "There it is
MEN!" The imagination races.
They enter the men's room,
spread out their card files and
notes atop the urinals, and begin
their presentations.
Flesli Under Arches
Inner Quad again. Jim Sayre
and an equally strangely-dressed
friend (you know, pants with
psychedelic stripes, army jacket
with "VC" sewn on the sleeve, a
sash, I think), passing out mimeo
graphed sheets to some liberation
festival to protest early closing at
Tresidder. We rap. He is a piece of
flesh under the stone arches.
Up through the Law Annex to
the Moot Court Room. The SDS

trial. The place is deserted, and
then a room full of funky people.
It looks like the scene in "Law
rence of Arabia," when the con
gress met to found the Arab state.
Dogs, kids, guitars, three or four
ties around the necks of faculty
judges. You can't tell the defend
ants from the judges or audience
without a highly alienated score
card.
Some chick is rapping about
how when she was a freshman, she
tolerated everybody. And every
body tolerated her back. So she
was alone. And somehow she
mentioned dancing school, where
she was told that no matter how
bad the male partner was, she had
to follow his lead. And how he,
poor soul, was just following
directions himself.
A Big Circle
Another waterfall of images.
That dancing school in New York.
We were all wearing suits at
school, anyway, but for the danc
ing class after school, we had to
bring white gloves. Like it was
obscene to touch flesh, or we
weren't trusted to wash. And we
all danced in a big circle, like on
the freeway, and we had to sit
with our legs crossed at the ank
les, when we sat around the walls.
David Pugh went through the
same thing, only he got his white
gloves dirty throwing snowballs.
Now he's on trial, for not dancing
in the circle, not crossing his legs.
Remember Eldridge Cleaver, talk
ing about the twist, and how it
was white people trying to get
back to their bodies, halfway
there—away from the patterns on
the floor, but still twisting like
metronomes?
Another defendant read from
the "Welcome to Stanford" (or
whatever) book the administra
tion sends to freshmen. Every
body laughed. Challenges, free
dom, the new adventure. Yeah. I
remember rapping to my high
school girlfriend, the night we
stayed together at Stanford, be
fore I started Pre-Reg Week, about
the tall Eucalyptus trees, and how
they reached up for truth. I'm
embarassed even remembering.
The hearing goes on. The kids
are articulate, but then I'm biased.
I split after Dave Pugh does the

horror story bit about Rambo,
gas, strategic hamlets, electronic
gear, Staley, and so on. I've heard
a hippie friend who was a doctor
in Vietnam tell of the eviscerated
Vietnamese civilians and the
American soldiers who boasted of
butchering them, too.
Outside the rain is still falling.
There is no indication the hearing
is going on. Three of the astrolog
ical elements are there—earth,
water, air. Where is fire? Up on
Haste and Telegraph this week.
Who knows where tomorrow?

Tresidder is alive, as usual.

Going inside is like skin diving in
Hawaii, warm, wet, full of flora
and fauna. Mostly well-dressed
high school kids, striking poses.
Too heavy. Back outside.
And lo! Up on the back ter
race, a high school debate tourna
ment. All becomes clear, as mem
ories descend. Card files, brief
cases, suits and ties, lines in front
of numbers, tables for registra
tion, for judges.
Damn The Losers
I went through that, although
at USC and UCLA, not Stanford.
You get up and rap about some
subject. You argue each side, al
ternatively, round by round.
Somebody wins, somebody loses.
You get points, trophies, chances
to go to bigger contests. If you get
a lot of points, they read it at high
school graduation. The audience
claps, although they were told not
to, because of the people who
have "nothing" to be clapped at
for. But your parents clap, so
others join in. Damn the losers.
Back on down the Quad.
Coming down on Geology Corner
from the Daily offices, more
debaters hustling along. They look
at the room numbers, calculate,
and head off in another direction.
No raincoats here, either. Strange.
Memories: Once I thought the
good life was holding a briefcase,
hurrying down corridors to the
next challenge, like Isabel in her
dark carriage. God.
Behind Mem Chu. Three male
debaters, walking the same way as
the others, striding, in a hurry,
looking for their room. Suddenly
one of them shouts, "There it is
MEN!" The imagination races.
They enter the men's room,
spread out their card files and
notes atop the urinals, and begin
their presentations.
Flesli Under Arches
Inner Quad again. Jim Sayre
and an equally strangely-dressed
friend (you know, pants with
psychedelic stripes, army jacket
with "VC" sewn on the sleeve, a
sash, I think), passing out mimeo
graphed sheets to some liberation
festival to protest early closing at
Tresidder. We rap. He is a piece of
flesh under the stone arches.
Up through the Law Annex to
the Moot Court Room. The SDS

trial. The place is deserted, and
then a room full of funky people.
It looks like the scene in "Law
rence of Arabia," when the con
gress met to found the Arab state.
Dogs, kids, guitars, three or four
ties around the necks of faculty
judges. You can't tell the defend
ants from the judges or audience
without a highly alienated score
card.
Some chick is rapping about
how when she was a freshman, she
tolerated everybody. And every
body tolerated her back. So she
was alone. And somehow she
mentioned dancing school, where
she was told that no matter how
bad the male partner was, she had
to follow his lead. And how he,
poor soul, was just following
directions himself.
A Big Circle
Another waterfall of images.
That dancing school in New York.
We were all wearing suits at
school, anyway, but for the danc
ing class after school, we had to
bring white gloves. Like it was
obscene to touch flesh, or we
weren't trusted to wash. And we
all danced in a big circle, like on
the freeway, and we had to sit
with our legs crossed at the ank
les, when we sat around the walls.
David Pugh went through the
same thing, only he got his white
gloves dirty throwing snowballs.
Now he's on trial, for not dancing
in the circle, not crossing his legs.
Remember Eldridge Cleaver, talk
ing about the twist, and how it
was white people trying to get
back to their bodies, halfway
there—away from the patterns on
the floor, but still twisting like
metronomes?
Another defendant read from
the "Welcome to Stanford" (or
whatever) book the administra
tion sends to freshmen. Every
body laughed. Challenges, free
dom, the new adventure. Yeah. I
remember rapping to my high
school girlfriend, the night we
stayed together at Stanford, be
fore I started Pre-Reg Week, about
the tall Eucalyptus trees, and how
they reached up for truth. I'm
embarassed even remembering.
The hearing goes on. The kids
are articulate, but then I'm biased.
I split after Dave Pugh does the

horror story bit about Rambo,
gas, strategic hamlets, electronic
gear, Staley, and so on. I've heard
a hippie friend who was a doctor
in Vietnam tell of the eviscerated
Vietnamese civilians and the
American soldiers who boasted of
butchering them, too.
Outside the rain is still falling.
There is no indication the hearing
is going on. Three of the astrolog
ical elements are there—earth,
water, air. Where is fire? Up on
Haste and Telegraph this week.
Who knows where tomorrow?

Rainy Friday. The day after
rainy Thursday. Two days after
rainy Wednesday. You get the
idea. But this Friday is special, for
it celebrates the confluence of
Our Founder's birthday (you
know, George, who crossed the
Delaware on Christmas, thereby
inspiring the Tet offensive) and
the work week.
You know it's a holiday. You
can park on the oval in front of
Quad at one in the afternoon,
only fifty yards or so away. The
grey light gives dignity to the
Hacienda Gothic halls. Nobody
around. That visit between the
BSU and Pitzer, after Thursday's
fracas, is behind closed doors, if at
all.
Something is going on, though.
Bill Wyman hustles past "la cara
vane verte" into Building Ten.
Denis Hayes sprints across White
Plaza, heading toward Quad. He
nods as he passes. My God! Has he
aged that much in six months? He
looked like Senator Fulbright.
And he forgot his raincoat. The
banker never wears a mac in the

Back on down the Quad.
Coming down on Geology Corner
from the Daily offices, more
debaters hustling along. They look
at the room numbers, calculate,
and head off in another direction.
No raincoats here, either. Strange.
Memories: Once I thought the
good life was holding a briefcase,
hurrying down corridors to the
next challenge, like Isabel in her
dark carriage. God.
Behind Mem Chu. Three male
debaters, walking the same way as
the others, striding, in a hurry,
looking for their room. Suddenly
one of them shouts, "There it is
MEN!" The imagination races.
They enter the men's room,
spread out their card files and
notes atop the urinals, and begin
their presentations.
Flesli Under Arches
Inner Quad again. Jim Sayre
and an equally strangely-dressed
friend (you know, pants with
psychedelic stripes, army jacket
with "VC" sewn on the sleeve, a
sash, I think), passing out mimeo
graphed sheets to some liberation
festival to protest early closing at
Tresidder. We rap. He is a piece of
flesh under the stone arches.
Up through the Law Annex to
the Moot Court Room. The SDS

trial. The place is deserted, and
then a room full of funky people.
It looks like the scene in "Law
rence of Arabia," when the con
gress met to found the Arab state.
Dogs, kids, guitars, three or four
ties around the necks of faculty
judges. You can't tell the defend
ants from the judges or audience
without a highly alienated score
card.
Some chick is rapping about
how when she was a freshman, she
tolerated everybody. And every
body tolerated her back. So she
was alone. And somehow she
mentioned dancing school, where
she was told that no matter how
bad the male partner was, she had
to follow his lead. And how he,
poor soul, was just following
directions himself.
A Big Circle
Another waterfall of images.
That dancing school in New York.
We were all wearing suits at
school, anyway, but for the danc
ing class after school, we had to
bring white gloves. Like it was
obscene to touch flesh, or we
weren't trusted to wash. And we
all danced in a big circle, like on
the freeway, and we had to sit
with our legs crossed at the ank
les, when we sat around the walls.
David Pugh went through the
same thing, only he got his white
gloves dirty throwing snowballs.
Now he's on trial, for not dancing
in the circle, not crossing his legs.
Remember Eldridge Cleaver, talk
ing about the twist, and how it
was white people trying to get
back to their bodies, halfway
there—away from the patterns on
the floor, but still twisting like
metronomes?
Another defendant read from
the "Welcome to Stanford" (or
whatever) book the administra
tion sends to freshmen. Every
body laughed. Challenges, free
dom, the new adventure. Yeah. I
remember rapping to my high
school girlfriend, the night we
stayed together at Stanford, be
fore I started Pre-Reg Week, about
the tall Eucalyptus trees, and how
they reached up for truth. I'm
embarassed even remembering.
The hearing goes on. The kids
are articulate, but then I'm biased.
I split after Dave Pugh does the

horror story bit about Rambo,
gas, strategic hamlets, electronic
gear, Staley, and so on. I've heard
a hippie friend who was a doctor
in Vietnam tell of the eviscerated
Vietnamese civilians and the
American soldiers who boasted of
butchering them, too.
Outside the rain is still falling.
There is no indication the hearing
is going on. Three of the astrolog
ical elements are there—earth,
water, air. Where is fire? Up on
Haste and Telegraph this week.
Who knows where tomorrow?

Rainy Friday. The day after
rainy Thursday. Two days after
rainy Wednesday. You get the
idea. But this Friday is special, for
it celebrates the confluence of
Our Founder's birthday (you
know, George, who crossed the
Delaware on Christmas, thereby
inspiring the Tet offensive) and
the work week.
You know it's a holiday. You
can park on the oval in front of
Quad at one in the afternoon,
only fifty yards or so away. The
grey light gives dignity to the
Hacienda Gothic halls. Nobody
around. That visit between the
BSU and Pitzer, after Thursday's
fracas, is behind closed doors, if at
all.
Something is going on, though.
Bill Wyman hustles past "la cara
vane verte" into Building Ten.
Denis Hayes sprints across White
Plaza, heading toward Quad. He
nods as he passes. My God! Has he
aged that much in six months? He
looked like Senator Fulbright.
And he forgot his raincoat. The
banker never wears a mac in the
falling rain. Very strange.
Tresidder is alive, as usual.

Going inside is like skin diving in
Hawaii, warm, wet, full of flora
and fauna. Mostly well-dressed
high school kids, striking poses.
Too heavy. Back outside.
And lo! Up on the back ter
race, a high school debate tourna
ment. All becomes clear, as mem
ories descend. Card files, brief
cases, suits and ties, lines in front
of numbers, tables for registra
tion, for judges.
Damn The Losers
I went through that, although
at USC and UCLA, not Stanford.
You get up and rap about some
subject. You argue each side, al
ternatively, round by round.
Somebody wins, somebody loses.
You get points, trophies, chances
to go to bigger contests. If you get
a lot of points, they read it at high
school graduation. The audience
claps, although they were told not
to, because of the people who
have "nothing" to be clapped at
for. But your parents clap, so
others join in. Damn the losers.
