Good news for
Indians fj
on the go m
Whenever you're off and flying in the Western United
States, Western Airlines offers you a way to save
money. Lots of it.
If you haven't reached your 22nd birthday and
hold an Airline Youth Identification Card (available
from us or any other airline), you're set for flying
on a standby basis. It's a rare flight where you'll
be left standing by, but you save up to 50%.
That's one-half off the regular Coach fare.
In other words, you can fly round trip for the
price of one way.
So when you head for home, or whereverthe
anchorage act i° n is. 9° w ' th Western—the money-saver!
