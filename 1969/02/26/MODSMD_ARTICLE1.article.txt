# BSU Meetings Going Well
## 
### 
Black Student Union leaders met
with the administration again yesterday
in their continuing discussions of the
twelve BSU demands.
"Extremely good progress" is being
made in the talks, according to Assistant
Provost James E. Simmons, although
the two sides have still not discussed all
of the demands.
"The atmosphere has returned to
what it was before Thursday," when
about fifteen militant blacks rampaged
through the Bookstore causing more
than $6000 in damage after President
Kenneth S. Pitzer failed to appear for a
meeting as the BSU expected, Simmons
added.
The talks are being conducted with
"a sense of mutual respect and good
faith," he noted.
Although discussions should con
tinue for some time, a preliminary state
ment is expected soon. Simmons said he
could "forsee some joint announcement
for the public by the end of the week."
The next meeting is scheduled for
Friday morning, at which time a possi
ble statement will be discussed.
"Both of us, the administration and
the BSU, have gone off to do our home
work," the assistant provost said,
"There are answers that are needed,
statistics to be found, departments to be
checked with."
