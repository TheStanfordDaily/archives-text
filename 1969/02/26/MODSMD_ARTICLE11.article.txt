# New ROTC Dilemma
## 
### 
Last week Stanford students voted for
ROTC, and the rhetoric of "student
power" may soon be coming from unusual
sources. (New YAF slogan: "Power to the
people"?)
The "student power" movement has
always been a part of the world, or so our
elders never tire of reminding us. It all hap
pened before, in the past. With a knowing
smile, they quote to us student demands
from the turn of the century or from clas
sical times in Greece. It's just going through
a stage, a phase, they chant. At Sproul Hall
in 1964, Mario Savio summarized the view
point: "As bureaucrat, the administrator
believes that nothing new happens."
The surge of student power over the last
few years was new and different. Its exper
iences began with the Free Speech Move
ment at Berkeley. Some theoretical under
pinnings came from an August 1966 SDS
position paper by Carl Davidson.
More than two years ago, Davidson
called for students to participate in the
decisions affecting their lives. Then, "stu
dent power" was an SDS slogan. Davidson's
position paper said "the issue for us is 'stu
dent control." One of his suggestions was
agitation for a given counter-curriculum
not on its merits, but on the grounds that
students participated in its design. The
system would not be able to accomodate a
democratic challenge.
As an indication of how times have
changed, at Columbia University last
spring, there was a split between those
white students who wished "to restruc
ture" the university and those who wished
"to liberate" the university. Among SDS

members there is now a strong inclination
to regard "student power" as co-optation
into the system. Such are the ironies of
history.
Among other things, the voting last
week at Stanford indicates that the radicals
have not convinced other students that
ROTC should be banned. The sentiment of
the students who voted is not entirely
clear, because of ambiguity in referendum
wording. Its phraseology brought under
one umbrella advocates of "use of campus
facilities" and advocates of academic
credit.
An interesting dilemma arises for Pres
ident Pitzer who, according to Stanford's
Founding Grant, holds ultimate power over
curriculum. He might be inclined to sup
port ROTC, pointing out the possibility of
military takeover if a significant civilian
element is not present to counterbalance
the military mentality. (The historical evi
dence on this issue is mixed, in our opin
ion.)
In the near future, we may see Pitzer
using "student power" against the faculty,
though this is extremely doubtful in light
of Pitzer's strong faculty orientation.
On the other hand, ROTC supporters
may try to use "faculty power" against the
Academic Senate. A move is now on to
have the Academic Council consider ROTC
in hopes that the larger body might over
rule the Senate.
We continue to stand behind the con
clusions of the ROTC majority report. The
purposes of ROTC are incompatible with
the purposes of the University. For once,
we are against student power.

As an indication of how times have
changed, at Columbia University last
spring, there was a split between those
white students who wished "to restruc
ture" the university and those who wished
"to liberate" the university. Among SDS

members there is now a strong inclination
to regard "student power" as co-optation
into the system. Such are the ironies of
history.
Among other things, the voting last
week at Stanford indicates that the radicals
have not convinced other students that
ROTC should be banned. The sentiment of
the students who voted is not entirely
clear, because of ambiguity in referendum
wording. Its phraseology brought under
one umbrella advocates of "use of campus
facilities" and advocates of academic
credit.
An interesting dilemma arises for Pres
ident Pitzer who, according to Stanford's
Founding Grant, holds ultimate power over
curriculum. He might be inclined to sup
port ROTC, pointing out the possibility of
military takeover if a significant civilian
element is not present to counterbalance
the military mentality. (The historical evi
dence on this issue is mixed, in our opin
ion.)
In the near future, we may see Pitzer
using "student power" against the faculty,
though this is extremely doubtful in light
of Pitzer's strong faculty orientation.
On the other hand, ROTC supporters
may try to use "faculty power" against the
Academic Senate. A move is now on to
have the Academic Council consider ROTC
in hopes that the larger body might over
rule the Senate.
We continue to stand behind the con
clusions of the ROTC majority report. The
purposes of ROTC are incompatible with
the purposes of the University. For once,
we are against student power.
Last week Stanford students voted for
ROTC, and the rhetoric of "student
power" may soon be coming from unusual
sources. (New YAF slogan: "Power to the
people"?)
The "student power" movement has
always been a part of the world, or so our
elders never tire of reminding us. It all hap
pened before, in the past. With a knowing
smile, they quote to us student demands
from the turn of the century or from clas
sical times in Greece. It's just going through
a stage, a phase, they chant. At Sproul Hall
in 1964, Mario Savio summarized the view
point: "As bureaucrat, the administrator
believes that nothing new happens."
The surge of student power over the last
few years was new and different. Its exper
iences began with the Free Speech Move
ment at Berkeley. Some theoretical under
pinnings came from an August 1966 SDS
position paper by Carl Davidson.
More than two years ago, Davidson
called for students to participate in the
decisions affecting their lives. Then, "stu
dent power" was an SDS slogan. Davidson's
position paper said "the issue for us is 'stu
dent control." One of his suggestions was
agitation for a given counter-curriculum
not on its merits, but on the grounds that
students participated in its design. The
system would not be able to accomodate a
democratic challenge.
