## Soto House Protest 
### 
Editor, THE DAILY:
We the undersigned students
and faculty members of Soto
House believe that the murder of
Richard Bunch at the San
Francisco Presidio in October of
1968—a murder implicitly sanc
tioned by the Army by virtue of
the leave-of-absence and increase
in pay given to the assailant of
Richard Bunch—is appalling.
Moreover, we believe that the "sit
in" staged by 27 soldiers at the
Presidio in protest to this murder
was a sensitive and courageous act
of service to America's highest
ideals. The charge of mutiny and
the combined sentence of 45
years hard labor meted out to the
first three soldiers can only be
classified as criminal persecution
beneath the veil of legal prosecu
tion.
We believe that the grave prece
dent established by these crimes
of the American military impels
President Pitzer, the Academic
Senate, and LASSU to take a
strong stand on this issue.
We furthermore believe that
LASSU should provide funds to
send President Pitzer, Student
President Dennis Hayes, and the
President of the Academic Senate
to Washington so that they may
present a personal protest to Presi
dent Nixon and Under-secretary
of Defense Packard on the murder
of Richard Bunch and the per
secution of his colleagues.

• End Of Youth Fare?
Editor, THE DAILY:
A couple of weeks ago a Civil
Aeronautics Board examiner
decided that the airlines' youth
fares are discriminatory against
full fare passengers and thus
should be discontinued. A board
decision in the near future will
decide whether or not you will be
able to see many parts of the
country you couldn't afford to
visit otherwise, and whether or
not it will cost many of you up to
$200 or $300 more per year to
attend Stanford. DO SOME
THING ABOUT IT! It's already
rather late, but write your Sen
ator, Representative (or anybody
in Congress. All you need is his
name and 'Wash., D.C.') or one of
these CAB members:
Chairman: Charles S. Murphy

Vice-Chairman: Robert T.
Murphy
G. Joseph Minetti
Whitney Gilliland
John Adams
at: Civil Aeronautics Board
Universal Building
Wash., D.C. 20428
If you're like most people I
know, you won't give a damn
now. And when the youth fares
are abolished you'll start your
bitching. But then maybe you can
afford the extra $200 a year ... I
can't.

•Punish Violators
Editor, THE DAILY:
Occasionally it is necessary to
make moral judgments public for
the sake of their form as well as
their content. Thursday's raid
upon the bookstore and cafeteria,
by members of the BSU, was both
stupid and immoral. Those who
participated are simply violence
enchanted primitives. They should
be identified and appropriately
punished.
Under other circumstances, no
one with a well functioning
cerebral cortex would doubt these
judgments. It is vastly depressing,
however, to notice the extent to
which the hysteria of this moment
has made obvious judgments seem
somehow sinister. Stanford's aca
demic community, if other
campuses offer any guide, will act
as something of an uncritical
apologist for the BSU. Friday and
Monday's Daily offer a dreary
prospectus of the imbecilic rhe
toric that is and will be invoked in
their defense. Friday's editorial,
which under any critical standards
must rank as a masterpiece of ir
relevant waffling, considers the
BSU's "precisely controlled act" ]
and then manages to suggest the
responsibility for that act resides
with President Pitzer and not the
BSU. Connoisseurs will notice in
this defense some structural
resemblances to Mayor Daley's
justification of the Chicago police
on the general grounds of provo
cation. Student leaders under
standably have not had time to
concoct truly gorgeous justifica
tions, but they did quite nicely on
short notice. Their general line
was that President Pitzer's delay
constituted some sort of 'in

human' offense to which the
bookstore raid was an appropriate
response. And even those writers
willing to venture a tentative and
ginerly murmur of disapproval
were careful to so qualify their
remarks that the resulting sting
was negligible at best.
There is little reason to sup
pose that future comments will be
any less disingenuous, fatuous and
inane. The inability to react criti
cally to demands and actions of
angry black men and women is
something of a general debility
that touches all academic com
munities. One is always aston
ished, however, at the depth of
this debility; at the adroitness
with which academics manage to
become apologists. No doubt I
will be widely thought to have
sunk into the Egyptian night of
racism for holding these views.
But this is only because under the
current employment of the term,
a racist is simply one who insists
on dismissing color in evaluating
conduct.
