# The 						Tin Drum
## Ed Council's Power 
### Michael Sweeney 
Tomorrow the newly-elected
ASSU Educational Council will sit
down with the Faculty Senate to
begin consideration of the pro
posals of the Study of Education
at Stanford (SES).
Never before have students
been able to make decisions about
the educational policies of this
University.
Never before have students had
so favorable an opportunity to
alter the distribution of power at
Stanford.
The Council, created at the
invitation of the Faculty Senate
itself, has a written promise that
the Senate will seek a negotiated
compromise to all disputes be
tween the two bodies. Moreover,
the Council enters into the delib
erations with a resounding 2087
to 998 vote by the student body
that "no University action on
(SES) proposals shall be valid un
less it meets with the concurrence
of the ASSU Education Council."
Could Blow It
Yet the Council could easily
blow it.
Dissension and confusion
within the 44-member Council
could cause it to fritter away the
initiative. Petty disputes with the
faculty could sap the Council's
energy. An impatient, short
sighted approach could win a few
curricular reforms but leave un
touched the departments' stran
glehold on education. Like Ham
let, the Council could lunge
through the arras at the King and
end up stabbing Polonius.
The key to the Council's suc
cess or failure will be its sense of
priorities. At this moment in time,
the SES debate within the faculty
is confused. The traditional log
rolling between interest groups is
barely underway. If it knows pre
cisely what it wants, the Council
can exploit this fluid situation and
exercise great power.
Undergraduate Bean
I believe the Council should
attach highest priority to the SES
recommendation for the new
position of Dean of Undergrad
uate Studies. In the words of SES,
"Stanford needs what it has never
had: a steady focus on its educa
tion of undergraduates, support
ing and maintaining what is good,
aiding in the renovation of what is
inadequate, stimulating and assist
ing educational innovation."
SES proposes that a "distin
guished teacher of undergrad
uates" be hired for this job, and
given a wide range of powers.
"The talents called for by the pro
posed post of Dean of Undergrad
uate Studies are not primarily

managerial or bureaucratic," says
the draft of the SES report on the
Government of the University.
"Rather, they include tact, educa
tional sensitivity, and the ability
to minimize resistance to change."
Most students will find it hard
to get excited about a proposal
for a new bureaucrat when so
many more appealing ideas are
floating around—like a General
Education College, Freshman
Tutorials, self-designed majors,
and so on. But all those proposals
strike at the symptoms of poor
education, not at the cause. More
over, many of the SES reforms
could flounder without strong
leadership from a Dean of Under
graduate Studies.
To Improve Teaching
In yesterday's Daily I argued
that neglect of undergraduate
teaching was Stanford's principal
failing. Only a revision in the
structure of university govern
ment can begin to counter the
forces which cause the neglect of
teaching. SES says as much.
The new Dean would supervise
the directors of Admissions,
Financial Aids, Freshman Tutor
ials, and the General Education
college, working with a single
faculty-student Committee on
Undergraduate Studies. To clear
the way for the new Dean, SES
asks that the job of Director of
General Studies, and the General
Studies Committee, be abolished.
Real power in academia means
money and hiring. In several
enigmatic sentences in the govern
ment report, SES says this: "He
(the Dean) should play a role in
the budgetary process so as to
ensure that the needs of under
graduate studies are given ade
quate recognition.
"He should participate in the
appointments process, preferably
as a member of the (H&S)
School's Committee on Appoint
ments and Promotions .. .
Budgetary leverage and personal
leadership will be required to sus
tain the enhanced attention to the
education of undergraduates that
is so clearly called for."
Clearly, the proposal for a
Dean of Undergraduate Studies
could turn out to be nothing or
everything. It will be nothing if
the faculty emasculates the job. It
could be everything if students,
through the ASSU Education
Council, win real power for the
Dean.
First of all, the Dean must not
be submerged into the staff of the
Dean of Humanities and Sciences,
where he can be continually by
passed .

Secondly, he must be equipped
with a large budget of his own for
guerrilla warfare activities against
faculty negligence. One such activ
ity would be setting up new, inter
disciplinary courses. Another
would be the funding of an active,
reliable Course Review and
teacher evaluation survey—we
must have clear-cut statistical data
on teaching before we can insist
that it be the primary criterion for
promotion.
Teaching Records
Thirdly, the Dean must have
the power to make sure that de
partments scrutinize teaching
records before granting tenure.
Fourthly, the Dean must have
a major voice in the allocation of
funds for undergraduate teaching
by departments. He must be able

to make bad things happen to a
department that offers bad under
graduate courses, and he must be
able to make good things happen
to the few departments that work
hard on their undergraduate
teaching. In bureaucratic terms,
this means the Dean of Under
graduate Studies must win a sep
arate and equal voice in budgetary
planning with the Dean of Hu
manities and Sciences.
With a cool head, the Council
can ensure that Stanford will have
a strong, independent Dean of
Undergraduate Studies. Then the
battle will shift to the selection of
the Dean. Only an intense effort,
using whatever persuasive mea
sures necessary, will guarantee
selection of a strong Dean with his
sympathies in the right place.
Then, and only then, will the
Council make a start in reversing
the anti-educational degeneration
of Stanford University.

The key to the Council's suc

can exploit this fluid situation and
exercise great power.
Undergraduate Bean
I believe the Council should
attach highest priority to the SES
recommendation for the new
position of Dean of Undergrad
uate Studies. In the words of SES,
"Stanford needs what it has never
had: a steady focus on its educa
tion of undergraduates, support
ing and maintaining what is good,
aiding in the renovation of what is
inadequate, stimulating and assist
ing educational innovation."
SES proposes that a "distin
guished teacher of undergrad
uates" be hired for this job, and
given a wide range of powers.
"The talents called for by the pro
posed post of Dean of Undergrad
uate Studies are not primarily

managerial or bureaucratic," says
the draft of the SES report on the
Government of the University.
"Rather, they include tact, educa
tional sensitivity, and the ability
to minimize resistance to change."
Most students will find it hard
to get excited about a proposal
for a new bureaucrat when so
many more appealing ideas are
floating around—like a General
Education College, Freshman
Tutorials, self-designed majors,
and so on. But all those proposals
strike at the symptoms of poor
education, not at the cause. More
over, many of the SES reforms
could flounder without strong
leadership from a Dean of Under
graduate Studies.
To Improve Teaching
In yesterday's Daily I argued
that neglect of undergraduate
teaching was Stanford's principal
failing. Only a revision in the
structure of university govern
ment can begin to counter the
forces which cause the neglect of
teaching. SES says as much.
The new Dean would supervise
the directors of Admissions,
Financial Aids, Freshman Tutor
ials, and the General Education
college, working with a single
faculty-student Committee on
Undergraduate Studies. To clear
the way for the new Dean, SES
asks that the job of Director of
General Studies, and the General
Studies Committee, be abolished.
Real power in academia means
money and hiring. In several
enigmatic sentences in the govern
ment report, SES says this: "He
(the Dean) should play a role in
the budgetary process so as to
ensure that the needs of under
graduate studies are given ade
quate recognition.
"He should participate in the
appointments process, preferably
as a member of the (H&S)
School's Committee on Appoint
ments and Promotions .. .
Budgetary leverage and personal
leadership will be required to sus
tain the enhanced attention to the
education of undergraduates that
is so clearly called for."
Clearly, the proposal for a
Dean of Undergraduate Studies
could turn out to be nothing or
everything. It will be nothing if
the faculty emasculates the job. It
could be everything if students,
through the ASSU Education
Council, win real power for the
Dean.
First of all, the Dean must not
be submerged into the staff of the
Dean of Humanities and Sciences,
where he can be continually by
passed .

Secondly, he must be equipped
with a large budget of his own for
guerrilla warfare activities against
faculty negligence. One such activ
ity would be setting up new, inter
disciplinary courses. Another
would be the funding of an active,
reliable Course Review and
teacher evaluation survey—we
must have clear-cut statistical data
on teaching before we can insist
that it be the primary criterion for
promotion.
Teaching Records
Thirdly, the Dean must have
the power to make sure that de
partments scrutinize teaching
records before granting tenure.
Fourthly, the Dean must have
a major voice in the allocation of
funds for undergraduate teaching
by departments. He must be able

to make bad things happen to a
department that offers bad under
graduate courses, and he must be
able to make good things happen
to the few departments that work
hard on their undergraduate
teaching. In bureaucratic terms,
this means the Dean of Under
graduate Studies must win a sep
arate and equal voice in budgetary
planning with the Dean of Hu
manities and Sciences.
With a cool head, the Council
can ensure that Stanford will have
a strong, independent Dean of
Undergraduate Studies. Then the
battle will shift to the selection of
the Dean. Only an intense effort,
using whatever persuasive mea
sures necessary, will guarantee
selection of a strong Dean with his
sympathies in the right place.
Then, and only then, will the
Council make a start in reversing
the anti-educational degeneration
of Stanford University.

The Council, created at the

the Council enters into the delib

that "no University action on

tional sensitivity, and the ability
to minimize resistance to change."
Most students will find it hard
to get excited about a proposal
for a new bureaucrat when so
many more appealing ideas are
floating around—like a General
Education College, Freshman
Tutorials, self-designed majors,
and so on. But all those proposals
strike at the symptoms of poor
education, not at the cause. More
over, many of the SES reforms
could flounder without strong
leadership from a Dean of Under
graduate Studies.
To Improve Teaching
In yesterday's Daily I argued
that neglect of undergraduate
teaching was Stanford's principal
failing. Only a revision in the
structure of university govern
ment can begin to counter the
forces which cause the neglect of
teaching. SES says as much.
The new Dean would supervise
the directors of Admissions,
Financial Aids, Freshman Tutor
ials, and the General Education
college, working with a single
faculty-student Committee on
Undergraduate Studies. To clear
the way for the new Dean, SES
asks that the job of Director of
General Studies, and the General
Studies Committee, be abolished.
Real power in academia means
money and hiring. In several
enigmatic sentences in the govern
ment report, SES says this: "He
(the Dean) should play a role in
the budgetary process so as to
ensure that the needs of under
graduate studies are given ade
quate recognition.
"He should participate in the
appointments process, preferably
as a member of the (H&S)
School's Committee on Appoint
ments and Promotions .. .
Budgetary leverage and personal
leadership will be required to sus
tain the enhanced attention to the
education of undergraduates that
is so clearly called for."
Clearly, the proposal for a
Dean of Undergraduate Studies
could turn out to be nothing or
everything. It will be nothing if
the faculty emasculates the job. It
could be everything if students,
through the ASSU Education
Council, win real power for the
Dean.
First of all, the Dean must not
be submerged into the staff of the
Dean of Humanities and Sciences,
where he can be continually by
passed .

Secondly, he must be equipped
with a large budget of his own for
guerrilla warfare activities against
faculty negligence. One such activ
ity would be setting up new, inter
disciplinary courses. Another
would be the funding of an active,
reliable Course Review and
teacher evaluation survey—we
must have clear-cut statistical data
on teaching before we can insist
that it be the primary criterion for
promotion.
Teaching Records
Thirdly, the Dean must have
the power to make sure that de
partments scrutinize teaching
records before granting tenure.
Fourthly, the Dean must have
a major voice in the allocation of
funds for undergraduate teaching
by departments. He must be able

to make bad things happen to a
department that offers bad under
graduate courses, and he must be
able to make good things happen
to the few departments that work
hard on their undergraduate
teaching. In bureaucratic terms,
this means the Dean of Under
graduate Studies must win a sep
arate and equal voice in budgetary
planning with the Dean of Hu
manities and Sciences.
With a cool head, the Council
can ensure that Stanford will have
a strong, independent Dean of
Undergraduate Studies. Then the
battle will shift to the selection of
the Dean. Only an intense effort,
using whatever persuasive mea
sures necessary, will guarantee
selection of a strong Dean with his
sympathies in the right place.
Then, and only then, will the
Council make a start in reversing
the anti-educational degeneration
of Stanford University.

Tomorrow the newly-elected
ASSU Educational Council will sit
down with the Faculty Senate to
begin consideration of the pro
posals of the Study of Education
at Stanford (SES).
Never before have students
been able to make decisions about
the educational policies of this
University.
Never before have students had
so favorable an opportunity to
alter the distribution of power at
Stanford.
The Council, created at the
invitation of the Faculty Senate
itself, has a written promise that
the Senate will seek a negotiated
compromise to all disputes be
tween the two bodies. Moreover,
the Council enters into the delib
erations with a resounding 2087
to 998 vote by the student body
that "no University action on
(SES) proposals shall be valid un
less it meets with the concurrence
of the ASSU Education Council."
Could Blow It
Yet the Council could easily
blow it.
Dissension and confusion
within the 44-member Council
could cause it to fritter away the
initiative. Petty disputes with the
faculty could sap the Council's
energy. An impatient, short
sighted approach could win a few
curricular reforms but leave un
touched the departments' stran
glehold on education. Like Ham
let, the Council could lunge
through the arras at the King and
end up stabbing Polonius.
The key to the Council's suc
cess or failure will be its sense of
priorities. At this moment in time,
the SES debate within the faculty
is confused. The traditional log
rolling between interest groups is
barely underway. If it knows pre
cisely what it wants, the Council
can exploit this fluid situation and
exercise great power.
Undergraduate Bean
I believe the Council should
attach highest priority to the SES
recommendation for the new
position of Dean of Undergrad
uate Studies. In the words of SES,
"Stanford needs what it has never
had: a steady focus on its educa
tion of undergraduates, support
ing and maintaining what is good,
aiding in the renovation of what is
inadequate, stimulating and assist
ing educational innovation."
SES proposes that a "distin
guished teacher of undergrad
uates" be hired for this job, and
given a wide range of powers.
"The talents called for by the pro
posed post of Dean of Undergrad
uate Studies are not primarily

managerial or bureaucratic," says
the draft of the SES report on the
Government of the University.
"Rather, they include tact, educa
tional sensitivity, and the ability
to minimize resistance to change."
Most students will find it hard
to get excited about a proposal
