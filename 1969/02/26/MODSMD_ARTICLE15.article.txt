## ACT Chekhov Masterful 
### GARY SCHMIDGALL 
A powerful, sensitive pro
duction of The Three Sisters by
Anton Chekhov premiered at the
Geary Theater in San Francisco
Wednesday night.
Chekhov has sealed the fate of
many directors, who sink into the
sentimental ooze which pervades
his plays. Too often, the anti
macassar is the hallmark of
modern productions of Chekhov.
But William Ball, Director of
the American Conservatory
Theater (ACT) and the director of
this production, has avoided the
pitfalls and masterfully exposed
the virtues of The Three Sisters.
Ball has taught us to expect co
hesive, personal approaches to the
plays he directs (Hamlet being a
painful example), and we are not
betrayed by this addition to his
long list of credits.
If one discounts the cluttered
ugliness of a fin de siecle parlor
and the Victorian costumery, the
world of The Three Sisters is
much like our own: somnolent
apathy in the face of social holo
caust, the confrontation of social
problems with rhetoric, the cult
of youth, and all the little de
bilities which result from the in
ability to communicate.
Ball concentrates on these cur
rent values in the play. It is so
easy to satisfy oneself with the

symbolism of the three sisters'
wistful, hopeless longing to return
to Moscow, but Ball has recog
nized that there is more to the
play than is contained in Chek
hov's often heavy-handed symbol
ism.
The result for the audience is a
dramatic experience more poig
nant and moving (and less senti
mental and timid) than we must
usually put up with in modern
renderings of Chekhov.
"Here you know everybody,
everybody knows you," says one
of the characters, "and yet you
are a strangei —a stranger and lone
ly." If I may venture a guess, this
is the central value of Ball's ap
proach, and he vivifies this theme
ingeniously.
Contemporary Play
The play is also ultimately
about the horrible social claustro
phobia induced by reticence—the
fear or inability to communicate.
As one character says,"It is ob
vious, one of us is not understand
ing the other." The play is em
phatically one for our time.
The Three Sisters also tells of
the brutal ways our daily lives
mock our illusions. Toward the
end of the play, a Colonel says,
"In the past, mankind was given
up to wars, life was entirely given
up to marching, invasions,
victories.

But that's all past history —and
has left a tremendous void which,
as yet we have found no way to
fill. Mankind is seeking passionate
ly for a way to fill this void, and
will, of course, find it."
The Three Sisters should re
main on the stage as long as there
is more mockery than truth in this
speech. With a subtle vengeance,
the play is one for our time.
The company again acts as a
single dramatic organism—almost
a necessity for Chekhov. ACT has
really put a family into the
Prozorov parlor. The three sisters
(Angela Paton, Michael Learned,
Kitty Winn) are uniformly con
vincing; it would be ungallant and
picayunish to choose among
them.
Paul Shenar has shed the
vestiges of mannerism which were
pampered in Albee's Tiny Alice
and makes a fine, chick en-chested
Baron Tusenbach. John Shuck's
portrayal of the manic-depressive
Captain is clever; William Patter
son as the old army doctor is,
designedly, a bit overblown.
The Three Sisters will remain
in the repertory at least through
April; if timing is a problem you
have no excuse. If unpleasant
memories of previous Chekhov
performances is your excuse, you
are doing Chekhov and ACT an
injustice.

rent values in the play. It is so
easy to satisfy oneself with the

symbolism of the three sisters'
wistful, hopeless longing to return
to Moscow, but Ball has recog
nized that there is more to the
play than is contained in Chek
hov's often heavy-handed symbol
ism.
The result for the audience is a
dramatic experience more poig
nant and moving (and less senti
mental and timid) than we must
usually put up with in modern
renderings of Chekhov.
"Here you know everybody,
everybody knows you," says one
of the characters, "and yet you
are a strangei —a stranger and lone
ly." If I may venture a guess, this
is the central value of Ball's ap
proach, and he vivifies this theme
ingeniously.
Contemporary Play
The play is also ultimately
about the horrible social claustro
phobia induced by reticence—the
fear or inability to communicate.
As one character says,"It is ob
vious, one of us is not understand
ing the other." The play is em
phatically one for our time.
The Three Sisters also tells of
the brutal ways our daily lives
mock our illusions. Toward the
end of the play, a Colonel says,
"In the past, mankind was given
up to wars, life was entirely given
up to marching, invasions,
victories.

But that's all past history —and
has left a tremendous void which,
as yet we have found no way to
fill. Mankind is seeking passionate
ly for a way to fill this void, and
will, of course, find it."
The Three Sisters should re
main on the stage as long as there
is more mockery than truth in this
speech. With a subtle vengeance,
the play is one for our time.
The company again acts as a
single dramatic organism—almost
a necessity for Chekhov. ACT has
really put a family into the
Prozorov parlor. The three sisters
(Angela Paton, Michael Learned,
Kitty Winn) are uniformly con
vincing; it would be ungallant and
picayunish to choose among
them.
Paul Shenar has shed the
vestiges of mannerism which were
pampered in Albee's Tiny Alice
and makes a fine, chick en-chested
Baron Tusenbach. John Shuck's
portrayal of the manic-depressive
Captain is clever; William Patter
son as the old army doctor is,
designedly, a bit overblown.
The Three Sisters will remain
in the repertory at least through
April; if timing is a problem you
have no excuse. If unpleasant
memories of previous Chekhov
performances is your excuse, you
are doing Chekhov and ACT an
injustice.
A powerful, sensitive pro
duction of The Three Sisters by
Anton Chekhov premiered at the
Geary Theater in San Francisco
Wednesday night.
Chekhov has sealed the fate of
many directors, who sink into the
sentimental ooze which pervades
his plays. Too often, the anti
macassar is the hallmark of
modern productions of Chekhov.
But William Ball, Director of
the American Conservatory
Theater (ACT) and the director of
this production, has avoided the
pitfalls and masterfully exposed
the virtues of The Three Sisters.
Ball has taught us to expect co
hesive, personal approaches to the
plays he directs (Hamlet being a
painful example), and we are not
betrayed by this addition to his
long list of credits.
If one discounts the cluttered
ugliness of a fin de siecle parlor
and the Victorian costumery, the
world of The Three Sisters is
much like our own: somnolent
apathy in the face of social holo
caust, the confrontation of social
problems with rhetoric, the cult
of youth, and all the little de
bilities which result from the in
ability to communicate.

rent values in the play. It is so
