## Expert Considers New Left 
### CHARLIE JONAS 
Peking support for a global
New Left movement was substan
tiated by Prof. Klaus Mehnert of
West Germany in his speech at
Tresidder Union last Monday.
Prof. Mehnert prefaced his
remarks by defining the New Left
today as any "spontaneous rising
of students against the established
order, if it is not in a nationalist
framework." Thus, the term
"New Left" becomes global in
nature.
Since the student-worker revolt
in France last May, Prof. Mehnert
stated, China "has applauded such
actions wherever they occur," be
it Japan, Berkeley, or Mexico
City. The Chinese news media
reports that the spirit of Chairman
Mao is behind the uprisings.
That a New Left movement,
directed against the established
regime, exists today can be fur
ther substantiated by the number
of pamphlets published by a
group which opposes the authors
of the New Left literature.
It is Prof. Mehnert's studied
opinion that the New Left move

ment in China today is a direct
outgrowth of Chairman Mao's
Great Cultural Revolution, begun
in the autumn of 1966. Mao
closed the upper grades of high
school and all the universities to
send an estimated 11 million stu
dents "throughout the country to
bring about a new revolution."
Reform Actions
This latest drive toward pure
communism lasted Fix months.
Therefore, between spring 1967
and summer 1968, new revolution
ary committees were established
to replace the old bureaucracy.
This period was characterized by a
paucity of information in the
Western press. The only clear pat
tern that emerged was that the
Army Was playing an increasingly
more important role in the res
toration of order.
It is difficult to see just where
the young Chinese activists wish
to go with their revolutionary
fervor, although a desire to fulfill
the goals of the Great Cultural
Revolution seems likely. They will
not succeed, however, until Mao
or his successors decide to strive

once more for the creation of a
Marxist society untainted by
bourgeois revisionism.
According to Mehnert, the
existence of a New Left presents a
certain semantic difficulty for the
established Left. "The New Left is
also left, and the Old Left cannot
fight the left. That is the dialec
tical difficulty." To solve the
problem, the New Left is referred
to by official Chinese sources as
the "left."

of pamphlets published by a
group which opposes the authors
of the New Left literature.
It is Prof. Mehnert's studied
opinion that the New Left move

ment in China today is a direct
outgrowth of Chairman Mao's
Great Cultural Revolution, begun
in the autumn of 1966. Mao
closed the upper grades of high
school and all the universities to
send an estimated 11 million stu
dents "throughout the country to
bring about a new revolution."
Reform Actions
This latest drive toward pure
communism lasted Fix months.
Therefore, between spring 1967
and summer 1968, new revolution
ary committees were established
to replace the old bureaucracy.
This period was characterized by a
paucity of information in the
Western press. The only clear pat
tern that emerged was that the
Army Was playing an increasingly
more important role in the res
toration of order.
It is difficult to see just where
the young Chinese activists wish
to go with their revolutionary
fervor, although a desire to fulfill
the goals of the Great Cultural
Revolution seems likely. They will
not succeed, however, until Mao
or his successors decide to strive

once more for the creation of a
Marxist society untainted by
bourgeois revisionism.
According to Mehnert, the
existence of a New Left presents a
certain semantic difficulty for the
established Left. "The New Left is
also left, and the Old Left cannot
fight the left. That is the dialec
tical difficulty." To solve the
problem, the New Left is referred
to by official Chinese sources as
the "left."
