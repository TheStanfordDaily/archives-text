# Rightists Discuss Seven Proposals
## 
### JUDY LANSING 
The "Community of the
Right" proposals, the destruction
of copies of the Arena, and the
attempt to have more conservative
voices heard on campus were dis
cussed at the Stanford Young
Republicans meeting last Thurs
day night.
The "Community of the
Right" includes members of YAF,
YR's and the Arena, a conserva
tively oriented paper.
Harvey H. Hukari Jr., chairman
of the YAF and editor of the
Arena, explained the motives for
the seven negotiable proposals
which were presented to President
Pitzer last Monday.
Prevent Violence
Hukari said that the first pro
posal denied the use of university
facilities to student organizations
which employ violence. Its intent
was to put pressure on the uni
versity to manifest their dislike of
violence.
The second proposal referred
to the suspension of students who
interfere or disrupt the judicial
council. Hukari said that the peo
ple who were being tried now
"were attempting to make a
mockery out of the judicial pro
cedure."
The "Community of the
Right" recommended the recruit
ment of more conservative profes
sors in the humanities and sci
ences. Hukari explained that there
is only one conservative professor
in economics, one to two in his
tory and none in political science.
Sponsors Attacked
He spoke against the "radical
liberal clique" of freshman spon
sors, stating that the present sys
tem perpetuated continuance of
the radical trend. He proposed
that this system be changed.
Hukari exphasized that conser
vatives deserve campus office
space. He explained that no office
room is given to the YAF, Arena,
or Project Help, a tutorial project
sponsored by the YR's in Moun
tain View. The YR's have one half
of a desk in the ASSU office.
Hukari noted that legal advice
would be sought on many of the
proposals. He gave the example
that twelve Columbia University
Board of Trustees are presently
being tried in the State Supreme
Court for being too lenient with
protestors.
Hukari said, "We want to put
every legal pressure we can on this
university to make sure this stays
a completely free university."
He was optimistic about the
seriousness the proposals have
been given. He explained that
they didn't use violence and that
the proposals were being consi

dered as seriously as any of those
of the radical groups on campus.
He said that they walked in
peacefully and presented negoti
able proposals. "We want to show
that it can work," Hukari added.
Arena Destroyed
Mike Kuhl added a resolution
that was voted on and approved
unanimously by the members
present. The resolution read:
"The Stanford Young Republi
cans go on record as expressing
their shock and indignation over
the wanton destruction of issues
of the Arena."
Kuhl explained, "Hundreds of
copies of this paper have been
destroyed each Friday over the
past month by numerous individ
uals, including one of the distri
butors of the Stanford Daily."
Kuhl added that the Young
Republicans should "urge Presi
dent Pitzer, members of the Uni
versity Administration, student
government officials and the en
tire University community to
forthrightly insure that the Arena
can continue to be distributed
safely on the Stanford campus.
Bill Boyd, President of the
YR's urged the members to be
come active in university activi
ties. He asked the members,
"There are more than three hun
dred members here at Stanford,
yet how many do anything?" He
added, "I'm sick and tired of
seeing nothing but student radi
cals on important committees
here at Stanford."
He encouraged members to
work to get conservative opinions
and votes in LASSU. He expressed
his desire to have a LASSU
speaker elected who "isn't a Yale
Braunstein."
Boyd gave the example that
questions needed to be raised
about the fairness of the allot
ment of LASSU funds. He ex
plained the need for conservatives
to be in LASSU to raise these
questions.
Boyd said, "Moderates would
get a piece of this action if not the
majority of it." He added, "Your
viewpoint is as important as SDS
or the Young Democrats."

He said that they walked in
peacefully and presented negoti
able proposals. "We want to show
that it can work," Hukari added.
Arena Destroyed
Mike Kuhl added a resolution
that was voted on and approved
unanimously by the members
present. The resolution read:
"The Stanford Young Republi
cans go on record as expressing
their shock and indignation over
the wanton destruction of issues
of the Arena."
Kuhl explained, "Hundreds of
copies of this paper have been
destroyed each Friday over the
past month by numerous individ
uals, including one of the distri
butors of the Stanford Daily."
Kuhl added that the Young
Republicans should "urge Presi
dent Pitzer, members of the Uni
versity Administration, student
government officials and the en
tire University community to
forthrightly insure that the Arena
can continue to be distributed
safely on the Stanford campus.
Bill Boyd, President of the
YR's urged the members to be
come active in university activi
ties. He asked the members,
"There are more than three hun
dred members here at Stanford,
yet how many do anything?" He
added, "I'm sick and tired of
seeing nothing but student radi
cals on important committees
here at Stanford."
He encouraged members to
work to get conservative opinions
and votes in LASSU. He expressed
his desire to have a LASSU
speaker elected who "isn't a Yale
Braunstein."
Boyd gave the example that
questions needed to be raised
about the fairness of the allot
ment of LASSU funds. He ex
plained the need for conservatives
to be in LASSU to raise these
questions.
Boyd said, "Moderates would
get a piece of this action if not the
majority of it." He added, "Your
viewpoint is as important as SDS
or the Young Democrats."
The "Community of the
Right" proposals, the destruction
of copies of the Arena, and the
attempt to have more conservative
voices heard on campus were dis
cussed at the Stanford Young
Republicans meeting last Thurs
day night.
The "Community of the
Right" includes members of YAF,
YR's and the Arena, a conserva
tively oriented paper.
Harvey H. Hukari Jr., chairman
of the YAF and editor of the
Arena, explained the motives for
the seven negotiable proposals
which were presented to President
Pitzer last Monday.
Prevent Violence
Hukari said that the first pro
posal denied the use of university
facilities to student organizations
which employ violence. Its intent
was to put pressure on the uni
versity to manifest their dislike of
violence.
The second proposal referred
to the suspension of students who
interfere or disrupt the judicial
council. Hukari said that the peo
ple who were being tried now
"were attempting to make a
mockery out of the judicial pro
cedure."
The "Community of the
Right" recommended the recruit
ment of more conservative profes
sors in the humanities and sci
ences. Hukari explained that there
is only one conservative professor
in economics, one to two in his
tory and none in political science.
Sponsors Attacked
He spoke against the "radical
liberal clique" of freshman spon
sors, stating that the present sys
tem perpetuated continuance of
the radical trend. He proposed
that this system be changed.
Hukari exphasized that conser
vatives deserve campus office
space. He explained that no office
room is given to the YAF, Arena,
or Project Help, a tutorial project
sponsored by the YR's in Moun
tain View. The YR's have one half
of a desk in the ASSU office.
Hukari noted that legal advice
would be sought on many of the
proposals. He gave the example
that twelve Columbia University
Board of Trustees are presently
being tried in the State Supreme
Court for being too lenient with
protestors.
Hukari said, "We want to put
every legal pressure we can on this
university to make sure this stays
a completely free university."
He was optimistic about the
seriousness the proposals have
been given. He explained that
they didn't use violence and that
the proposals were being consi

dered as seriously as any of those
of the radical groups on campus.
He said that they walked in
peacefully and presented negoti
able proposals. "We want to show
