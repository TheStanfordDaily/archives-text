# Malcolm X And UCSC

### LANG ATWOOD 
SANTA CRUZâ€”"EI-Hajj Malik
El-Shabazz was willing to go any
where, anytime, to talk to anyone
if he thought it would further
understanding," began Professor
J. Herman Blake of the University
of California at Santa Cruz
(UCSC) at a memorial celebration
last Friday in a downtown Santa
Cruz park.
El-Hajj Malik El-Shabazz, or
Malcom X, founded the Muslim
Mosque Inc. after breaking with
Elijah Muhammed's Nation of
Islam. He worked to unite blacks
and whites in a great brotherhood
of man until shotgunned to death
in 1965. Friday's gathering of
blacks and whites, students and
community members indicated
that his ideas continue to live.
UC's Santa Cruz campus,
nestled among the redwoods over
looking the town of Santa Cruz
and the Pacific Ocean, is a testing
ground for a new concept of edu
cation combining the best features
of a small college and a large uni
versity.
The university is structured
around its colleges. Each college ,

has its own dormitories, class
rooms, student facilities and
dining rooms. They are small
units, of about 600 students each,
designed to aleviate the"I am
number 16811520" feeling of a
large university.
There are presently four
colleges, all sharing the same
central library, athletic and ad
ministrative facilities.
Each college has its own name
and academic area and the recent
effort to have the college
scheduled to open in 1972 de
clared an ethnic studies college
and named after Malcom X has
brought a new awareness and re
sponsibility to the "country club"
atmosphere at UCSC.
The Committee for the College
of Malcom X, a voluntary organi
zation of UCSC students and
faculty members, has led a cam
paign designed to convince the
Board of Regents.
In addition to the Black Stu
dent Union (BSU), support for
the concept has come from the
Chicano Liberation Committee,
the Third World Political Alliance,
the Students for a Democratic

Society, the Student Mobilization
Committee and the entire Merrill
College faculty. A petition en
dorsing the proposal gathered over
1500 signatures out of the student
body of 2600.
On February 12, the faculty
senate voted to create a minority
studies college as College VII and
passed a resolution stating that
"Malcom X would be appropriate
ly commemorated by the use of
his name for College Seven."
Rich Townsend, a leader of the
UCSC BSU, explained that the
final decision regarding the name
of the college rested with the
Board of Regents and that there
was no indication yet of how they
felt or when they would act. He
expressed optimism however, in
view of the recent faculty senate
action.
In the park Friday, Prof. Blake
asked the assembled group to bow
their heads in a minute of silent
tribute. In closing, he read from
the eulogy in Price Cobb's Black
Rage, "We have a prince, our own
black shining prince, who was
not afraid to die for those who
loved him."
