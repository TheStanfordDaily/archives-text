# Hayes Will Submit Another Constitution
## 
### 
ASSU President Denis Hayes will
introduce yet another ASSU Consti
tution to the Legislature tomorrow
night that could be voted on during
registration Spring Quarter.
The new constitution calls for a
41-member Senate and more financial
autonomy for the Association.
The 41-member Senate would be
chosen by the Hare system of propor
tional representation, under the same
distribution as recent elections for the
Education Council with delegates
chosen by school for upperclassmen and
graduate students and delegates chosen
from among undeclared undergraduates.
Hayes said yesterday he was intro
ducing the constitution after several
other proposals have failed in the past
to garner the two-thirds majority neces
sary for passage in order "to get a strong
student sounding" during registration.
"I don't want this one to be defeated
by one-third of a percentage point,"
Hayes remarked.
Except for the size of the Senate and
provisions concerning a Committee of
Nominations, the Constitution is sub
stantially the same as previous consti
tutions.
The 7-member Committee on

Nominations, similar to the one recently
constituted by LASSU, would be
chaired by the ASSU President and all
nominations would be confirmed by a
majority of the Senate.
The constitution also provides for
student-controlled level of student fees.
The constitution defeated last fall in
cluded a 21-member Senate, assessment
of ASSU fees by the student body,
financial autonomy and a Bill of Rights.
