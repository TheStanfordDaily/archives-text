# Stanford Students Arrested During Paris Demonstration
## 
### JAMES PERLOFF Daily Foreign Correspondent 
Three Stanford students were
arrested in Paris last week for
failure to disperse when ap
proached by a squad of riot po
lice. The students were in Paris
during a Stanford-in-Britain field
trip to the French capital.
The students were released the
next morning.
One of the three later com
mented, "The police were blun
deringly inefficient. It was kind of
interesting at first, but after a
while it got to be a real drag."
The remaining 80 students on
the field trip also found Paris in
teresting: most of them saw for
the first time what a serious revo
lution would look like.
The group saw the Boulevard
St. Michel (the center of the stu
dent quarter) filled with helmeted
riot police, more than three hun
dred of them patrolling a three
quarter mile stretch of road.
"The demonstrating students
made the SDS look like a group of

amateurs out protesting because it
is the thing to do," commented
Peter Muhs, a sophomore from
Carmel.
"The police remembered last
May's student-worker coalition
which nearly toppled de Gaulle's
government," Muhs continued.
"They were afraid that even a
small demonstration could erupt
into another revolution.
"There were no signs of admin
istrators going around asking for
people's names and requesting
them to disperse."
Muhs was referring to Associ
ate Dean Willard Wyman's actions
at the Faculty Club SDS-Trustees
confrontation.
Failure To Run
The students arrested were
detained because they had failed
to run away from a police squad.
They had merely walked.
The occasion for the massed
police force was a faculty sit-in at
the Sorbonne, protesting police
informers within their ranks and
the failure of the Minister of
Education to meet with them.

After about 6 hours of sitting in,
they were ousted by police.
The next night there were no
police at all on the "Boul Mich."
The three students who were
arrested found that once in the
paddy wagon the French police
were not quite as efficient. They
were taken to three different sta
tions, changing cells nearly a
dozen times. One of their captors
would bang a metal cup on the
cell door every time they tried to
sleep.

After being released at 5:30
a.m. the students went to Les
Halles, Paris' famous night mar
ket. "The only thing I was wor
ried about," said one of the three
"was that I might be too tired to
go to the Louvre the next morn
ing."
Only foreigners were arrested
that night: the French students
knew enough by then to run when
the police approached.
