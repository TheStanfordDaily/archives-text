# Harpist At Adelfa
## 
### 
Grainne Yeats, one of Ireland's
most distinguished harpists, and
her husband Michael Yeats, the
son of poet W. B. Yeats, will be
guests in residence of Adelfa
House of Lagunita from February
26th to March 4th.
Grainne will give a concert on
Wednesday, February 26th at 8
P.M. in Bishop Auditorium in the
Business School. Her program in
cludes pieces written by the early
Irish minstrel-harpists, love songs,
folk ballads from Ireland and the
Continent, as well as a number of
contemporary song cycles written
especially for her by leading Irish
composers. Her voice and her harp
blend together to carry melodies
that are not soon forgotten.
Tickets are on sale at Tresidder
Union and will be sold at the
door.
Michael Yeats, her husband, is
an Irish Senator who is equally
conversant in Irish history and
patriotism, the role of the ballad
in Irish history, and the role of
music in the works of his father.
In informal conversations,
Michael and Grainne inevitably
engage in running commentary on
the vagaries of American life: bill
boards along freeways, 31 flavors
at Swensons', the high speed of
American life, etc.
