# Trouble Up North
## Cagers Blow Two, Prepare For Lew 
### FRED MANN 
It was another one of those
weekends, only this time longer
and worse than ever.
Stanford's varsity basketball
team left for Washington on Fri
day and faced WSU on Saturday
night. They lost. On the Sabath
they rested, and Monday night
played Washington. They lost.
Stanford's luck on the road is
even worse than their luck at

home. Many times they have
dropped a pair of games to home
teams, but this time it was differ
ent.
The way they lost them is not
to be believed.
Against the Cougars, they lost
an 11 point lead with three and
one half minutes left in the game.
The Tribe missed three layups and
gave away the ball four times in
that time span.

Don Griffin added only four
points in the second half. He had
a total of 16. Griff also drew the
first technical foul of his varsity
career, and fouled out of the
game.
Spirits on the club were ob
viously dowi. as they waited for
Washington. But the Huskies were
only 5-5 in league, and posed less
of a problem than did WSU.
The Indians started well and
then dropped behind in the first

half. A late rally closed the gap to
32-25 at intermission.
In the final stanza, Coach
Howie Dallmar's team continued
to gain and seemed to have the
momentum needed for victory.
With just 9:45 left in the game,
the Huskies pulled a switch. The
effective tight man-to-man de
fense that they had been using all
game and throughout the previous
meeting of the teams was drop
ped. Washington went to a zone

and controlled the ball on offense.
The Stanford penetration was
stopped and the Cards had to rely
on outside shots. It did not work.
The usually effective visitors
hit the coldest spell ever recorded
in the continental United States,
and lost the game by 23 points.
During the last ten minutes of
the contest, the University of
Washington outscored Stanford,
24-3.
The Indians finished, hitting a
dismal 27 percent from the field.
At the free throw line, they were
not much better, canning only 13
of 25. The Huskies hit 43 percent,
took more shots, and nailed 10-13
from the line.
For the first time in ages, Grif
fin did not lead the Stanford
scoring. He finished with 11,
while Mai McElwain led every
body with 19. Mike Michel made
5, Bill Palmer and Dennis O'Neill,
4 apiece, and Bill Halligan 2, in
the lowest scoring efforts of the
season.
With Griffin canning only 27
for the weekend, he will be hard
pressed to break the single season
scoring record of 540 set by Art
Harris. He now was 451 with
three games to play.

STARTING FIVE—The Stanford Dollies hacked up hy the hand may prove to
be the only rcdeaming factor for the Farm in the UCLA game this Friday
night- The Tribe team does not stand much of a chance of winning, hut the
half time show at Maples beats any other.
It was another one of those
weekends, only this time longer
and worse than ever.
Stanford's varsity basketball
team left for Washington on Fri
day and faced WSU on Saturday
night. They lost. On the Sabath
they rested, and Monday night
played Washington. They lost.
Stanford's luck on the road is
even worse than their luck at

home. Many times they have
dropped a pair of games to home
teams, but this time it was differ
ent.
The way they lost them is not
to be believed.
Against the Cougars, they lost
an 11 point lead with three and
one half minutes left in the game.
The Tribe missed three layups and
gave away the ball four times in
that time span.

Don Griffin added only four
points in the second half. He had
a total of 16. Griff also drew the
first technical foul of his varsity
career, and fouled out of the
game.
Spirits on the club were ob
viously dowi. as they waited for
Washington. But the Huskies were
only 5-5 in league, and posed less
of a problem than did WSU.
The Indians started well and
then dropped behind in the first

half. A late rally closed the gap to
32-25 at intermission.
In the final stanza, Coach
Howie Dallmar's team continued
to gain and seemed to have the
momentum needed for victory.
With just 9:45 left in the game,
the Huskies pulled a switch. The
effective tight man-to-man de
fense that they had been using all
game and throughout the previous
meeting of the teams was drop
ped. Washington went to a zone

and controlled the ball on offense.
The Stanford penetration was
stopped and the Cards had to rely
on outside shots. It did not work.
The usually effective visitors
hit the coldest spell ever recorded
in the continental United States,
and lost the game by 23 points.
During the last ten minutes of
the contest, the University of
Washington outscored Stanford,
24-3.
The Indians finished, hitting a
dismal 27 percent from the field.
At the free throw line, they were
not much better, canning only 13
of 25. The Huskies hit 43 percent,
took more shots, and nailed 10-13
from the line.
For the first time in ages, Grif
fin did not lead the Stanford
scoring. He finished with 11,
while Mai McElwain led every
body with 19. Mike Michel made
5, Bill Palmer and Dennis O'Neill,
4 apiece, and Bill Halligan 2, in
the lowest scoring efforts of the
season.
With Griffin canning only 27
for the weekend, he will be hard
pressed to break the single season
scoring record of 540 set by Art
Harris. He now was 451 with
three games to play.
