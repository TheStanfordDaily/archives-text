# Barbarians Beaten In Dual Disaster
## 
### TOM HEALY 
Yale overwhelmed the previously undefeated Stanford swimmers
last weekend, 71-42, in a run away. The Elis ran up the most startling
score since the Super Bowl, by winning 11 of 13 events, and breaking
four team and one national record.
Most observers from Indian Coach Jim Gaughran on down
expected a close meet with victory probably hinging on the final
relay. As it turned out, Yale clinched the win in the tenth event to the
delight of their numerous partisans, the dismay of Stanford's handful,
and the surprise of the pollsters who ranked Yale only fourth in the
nation.
The superiority of the Elis on Friday night was partially due to a
different training regimen by them. Yale peaked for this meet, and
"shaved down" to chop off seconds from their previous seasonal
bests. Stanford does not peak and shave until the NCAA
championships in March.
Coach Moriarty of Yale will be accomplishing no mean feat if he
can keep his team at this high level of performance for the next five
weeks before the NCAA's in Indiana.
The setting for the meet was the Payne Witney Gym in New Haven.
Stanford came to the meet with a reputation, fostered by the Yale
Daily News (priceâ€”15 cents) as "an athletic factory," whose team
members were proficient only at their respective sports, basket
weaving, and allied arts.
To their chagrin, New Haven offered very few outlets for their
plebeian propensities. In recognition of his humble background, John
Ferris wore a T-shirt inscribed "The Barbarians Have Landed." But
even in the face of such blatant jock-ism, Yale's scholar athletes would
not be intimidated.
They entered the pool-deck to a resounding cheer from the 3,500
spectators who surrounded the swimming area. The stands are
designed something like an indoor Roman circus, with row atop row
almost straight up. This design resulted in a substantial amplification
of a partisan spirit hardly in need of amplification.
After the record-setting medley relay, it was fairly clear that the
Yale team in the water that night was a far cry from the team that
emerged on paper. When Yale set three team records in the next four
wins, the meet was won.
The Elis were not satisfied with merely winning and extending
their 48 meet skein; they seemed determined to put on the most
devastating exhibition in dual meet history. They may well have done
just that.
Having relegated Stanford stars Bob Ferris and Pete Siebert to seconds
and thirds where firsts and seconds had seemed within reach, Yale
won the last seven events.
The national championships are coming up and the Indians could
hardly ask for more motivation for revenge than was provided them
Friday night.
This year Yale has a good shot at the championship. (Last year, the
Yale Daily News called Yale's "the best damn swimming team in the
country," preferring to ignore the fact that the NCAA does not treat
swimming and diving as discrete championship competitions.)
However, on the basis of performances turned in by Tribe
swimmers in the past, the tables could be turned in some events, and
the past-peak Elis denied the championship once again.
Que sera. In New Haven, having the smartest swimming team is
solace enough.
