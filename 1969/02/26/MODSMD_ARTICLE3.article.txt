# Rice President Quits In Conciliatory Gesture
## 
### 
In response to combined student and
faculty protest, Rice University presi
dent-designate William H. Masterson re
signed yesterday.
In a letter to the Rice board of
governors, Masterson explained, "I do
not believe it to be in the best interests
of the university for me to undertake
the duties of the university in the midst
of the controversy relating to my ap
pointment."
On Monday students, graduate stu
dents, and faculty voted to determine
whether they approved or disapproved
of the method used in selecting Master
son and secondly if they approved of
the choice by the board of governors.
To Avoid Dissension
The results of the poll were not an
nounced, but student association presi
dent Warren Skaaren and interim presi
dent William Gordon presented the
totals to two unidentified members of
the board of governors. According to
one student who ran a polling station,
the turnout was "astounding" in com
parison to previous votes.
Masterson is a Rice graduate and
former dean of humanities at Rice until
he resigned in 1966 to become president
of the University of Chattanooga.
In his statement to the governors,
Masterson also said that accepting the
post of president "would create un
necessary dissension among the uni
versity community of governors, facul
ty, students, and staff. Entirely upon
my initiative and responsibility, there
fore, I submit my resignation effective
this date (Feb. 25)."
"Statesmanship" Lauded
Yesterday evening Gordon, the chair
men of every department, student
leaders, and members of the student
faculty advisory committee on presi
dential selection sent Masterson a tele
gram that said in part, "The faculty and

students of Rice University . . . wish to
express their deep gratitude for your
statesmanship in the action you have
taken with regard to the university's
dilemma."
The controversy began when the
board of governors announced Master
son as there choice to succeed Kenneth
Pitzer, but the board neglected to in
form the faculty advisory committee
that they had appointed earlier to aid
them in the search.
During last weekend student body
officers met with Masterson for five
hours. They announced afterwards that
they found his selection was unaccept
able.
Reconsiders Decision
Robert C. Allen, vice-chairman of the
board of governors told a faculty meet
ing Friday night, "I can tell you from
the heart that we the board proceeded
in good faith. We made an nc-nest mis
take. But I urge you to give Masterson
what every man deserves—a chance."
180 out of 325 faculty members ex
pressed their disapproval of the appoint
ment on the groups that the student
faculty committee was not consulted in
the move.
Last Saturday the Rice student body
passed a resolution by a 951 to 7 margin
stating, "The students of Rice Uni
versity vigorously protest and cannot
accept the procedures used to select the
new president . . . We emphatically re
quest that the appointment be recon
sidered after appropriate consultation
with the student faculty presidential
committee."
At a press conference on Sunday,
Masterson stated that he would not re
sign from his new position. However,
later he added, "I would go to the
board . . . and discuss what is best for
the university" if it appeared that pro
test and demonstrations were to con
tinue over his selection.

Pitzer, but the board neglected to in
form the faculty advisory committee
that they had appointed earlier to aid
them in the search.
During last weekend student body
officers met with Masterson for five
hours. They announced afterwards that
they found his selection was unaccept
able.
Reconsiders Decision
Robert C. Allen, vice-chairman of the
board of governors told a faculty meet
ing Friday night, "I can tell you from
the heart that we the board proceeded
in good faith. We made an nc-nest mis
take. But I urge you to give Masterson
what every man deserves—a chance."
180 out of 325 faculty members ex
pressed their disapproval of the appoint
ment on the groups that the student
faculty committee was not consulted in
the move.
Last Saturday the Rice student body
passed a resolution by a 951 to 7 margin
stating, "The students of Rice Uni
versity vigorously protest and cannot
accept the procedures used to select the
new president . . . We emphatically re
quest that the appointment be recon
sidered after appropriate consultation
with the student faculty presidential
committee."
At a press conference on Sunday,
Masterson stated that he would not re
sign from his new position. However,
later he added, "I would go to the
board . . . and discuss what is best for
the university" if it appeared that pro
test and demonstrations were to con
tinue over his selection.
In response to combined student and
faculty protest, Rice University presi
dent-designate William H. Masterson re
signed yesterday.
In a letter to the Rice board of
governors, Masterson explained, "I do
not believe it to be in the best interests
of the university for me to undertake
the duties of the university in the midst
of the controversy relating to my ap
pointment."
On Monday students, graduate stu
dents, and faculty voted to determine
whether they approved or disapproved
of the method used in selecting Master
son and secondly if they approved of
the choice by the board of governors.
To Avoid Dissension
The results of the poll were not an
nounced, but student association presi
dent Warren Skaaren and interim presi
dent William Gordon presented the
totals to two unidentified members of
the board of governors. According to
one student who ran a polling station,
the turnout was "astounding" in com
parison to previous votes.
Masterson is a Rice graduate and
former dean of humanities at Rice until
he resigned in 1966 to become president
of the University of Chattanooga.
In his statement to the governors,
Masterson also said that accepting the
post of president "would create un
necessary dissension among the uni
versity community of governors, facul
ty, students, and staff. Entirely upon
my initiative and responsibility, there
fore, I submit my resignation effective
this date (Feb. 25)."
"Statesmanship" Lauded
Yesterday evening Gordon, the chair
men of every department, student
leaders, and members of the student
faculty advisory committee on presi
dential selection sent Masterson a tele
gram that said in part, "The faculty and

students of Rice University . . . wish to
express their deep gratitude for your
statesmanship in the action you have
taken with regard to the university's
dilemma."
The controversy began when the
board of governors announced Master
son as there choice to succeed Kenneth
Pitzer, but the board neglected to in
form the faculty advisory committee
that they had appointed earlier to aid
them in the search.
