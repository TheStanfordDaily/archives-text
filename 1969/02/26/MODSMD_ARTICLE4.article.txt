# Resistance, New Politics Group To Sponsor Presidio March, Vigil
## 
### RANDAL SAMSTAG 
Community response to the current
military trials of the 27 Presidio "muti
neers" appears to be crystallizing.
The Stanford committee for New
Democratic Politics, in cooperation with
the Resistance, is asking concerned citi
zens to show their distress at the con
duct of the trials in non-violent prayer
vigil at the gates of the Presidio from 8
p.m. through the night of March 4 and
through March 5.

The vigil will conclude a two-day
march beginning next Monday, March 3,
in White Plaza after a noontime rally.
Dean of the Chapel B. Davie Napier has
agreed tentatively to speak at the rally.
The marchers from Palo Alto will
join the members of the War Resisters
League of San Francisco who began a
150 mile trek from Carmel to the Pre
sidio yesterday. The WRL will be ar
riving in Palo Alto on Sunday night.
Non-Violent Protest
The marchers will quarter in San
Mateo Monday evening at the San
Mateo Peace Center. The conclusion of
the trek from San Mateo on Tuesday
will come with a candle light march
through the streets of San Francisco to
the Presidio.
David Jones, chairman of the Com
mittee for New Democratic Politics,
emphasizes that the protest will be non
violent and in the same spirit as the
original "mutiny". He says, "We are not
going to resist a value system that rests
on force and coercion with coercion."
Both Stanford groups will be distrib
uting leaflets this week informing the
community of the purposes of the
march.
Paul Rupert of the United Christian

Ministry and the Resistance adds,
"Since many in Santa Clara county are
dependent on Department of Defense
contracts, we would like people to ask
themselves just what their own relation
is to the military system."
Informal Meeting
Rupert asks all people interested
either in doing leafleting or joining the
march to come to the Clubhouse on
Thursday afternoon at 4:00 for an in
formal meeting.
The Resistance will be attempting to
reach area high school students and
local citizens in their leaflet campaign
this week. They stress that the current
trials are no exception but a purely
typical example of military justice.
Says Jones, "The Army's overkill
imprisonment for one-quarter of a life
time—raises important questions. They
are big questions and they implicate all
silent Americans."
Students are asked to sign up for the
march and vigil at the Committee for
New Democratic Politics desk in the
ASSU offices. The Palo Alto Resistance
office, 327-3108, and Paul Rupert at
University extension 3114 can offer
additional information.

march beginning next Monday, March 3,
in White Plaza after a noontime rally.
Dean of the Chapel B. Davie Napier has
agreed tentatively to speak at the rally.
The marchers from Palo Alto will
join the members of the War Resisters
League of San Francisco who began a
150 mile trek from Carmel to the Pre
sidio yesterday. The WRL will be ar
riving in Palo Alto on Sunday night.
Non-Violent Protest
The marchers will quarter in San
Mateo Monday evening at the San
Mateo Peace Center. The conclusion of
the trek from San Mateo on Tuesday
will come with a candle light march
through the streets of San Francisco to
the Presidio.
David Jones, chairman of the Com
mittee for New Democratic Politics,
emphasizes that the protest will be non
violent and in the same spirit as the
original "mutiny". He says, "We are not
going to resist a value system that rests
on force and coercion with coercion."
Both Stanford groups will be distrib
uting leaflets this week informing the
community of the purposes of the
march.
Paul Rupert of the United Christian

Ministry and the Resistance adds,
"Since many in Santa Clara county are
dependent on Department of Defense
contracts, we would like people to ask
themselves just what their own relation
is to the military system."
Informal Meeting
Rupert asks all people interested
either in doing leafleting or joining the
march to come to the Clubhouse on
Thursday afternoon at 4:00 for an in
formal meeting.
The Resistance will be attempting to
reach area high school students and
local citizens in their leaflet campaign
this week. They stress that the current
trials are no exception but a purely
typical example of military justice.
Says Jones, "The Army's overkill
imprisonment for one-quarter of a life
time—raises important questions. They
are big questions and they implicate all
silent Americans."
Students are asked to sign up for the
march and vigil at the Committee for
New Democratic Politics desk in the
ASSU offices. The Palo Alto Resistance
office, 327-3108, and Paul Rupert at
University extension 3114 can offer
additional information.
Community response to the current
military trials of the 27 Presidio "muti
neers" appears to be crystallizing.
The Stanford committee for New
Democratic Politics, in cooperation with
the Resistance, is asking concerned citi
zens to show their distress at the con
duct of the trials in non-violent prayer
vigil at the gates of the Presidio from 8
p.m. through the night of March 4 and
through March 5.

The vigil will conclude a two-day
march beginning next Monday, March 3,
in White Plaza after a noontime rally.
