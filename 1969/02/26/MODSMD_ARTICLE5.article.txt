# Honors AFT Strike At SJS
## Picket Line Stops Sanford 
### SUSAN SWARD 
In a commencement address he was
to have presented at San Jose State
College January 31, Nevitt Sanford de
clared, "I see no reason to expect peace
and quiet, or an end to unrest, on our
campuses until basic reforms have been

carried out. . . The times favor as well
as require reform."
Approximately two hours before
Sanford, professor of psychology and
education here, was due in the robing
room at San Jose, it was decided that
Sanford would not cross the American
Federation of Teachers' (AFT) picket
line thrown up around the campus.
Picket Line Debated
Sanford had informed the president
of the state college, Dr. Robert Clark,
several days earlier that he could not "in
all good conscience" cross the AFT
picket line. The AFT then debated
among its own members whether to
continue the picket line or to allow San
ford to speak—since his speech was seen
basically as a support of the striking
teachers' cause.
Two hours before robing time the
AFT concluded that it would keep the
picket line in operation. Dr. Clark pro
ceeded to introduce Sanford during the
commencement exercises. The President
explained to the audience that Sanford
felt he could not cross the AFT picket
line and give the address. The announce
ment was greated by more boos than by
applause, according to Sanford.
A Legitimate Cause
"I don't have a rigid policy of never
crossing a picket line," Sanford ex
plianed to the Daily. "It depends on the
individual merits of the case. It's been
my impression that what the AFT is
after—particularly at San Francisco
State—is quite legitimate. And I was par
ticularly moved by the lack of publicity
of the situation."
Sanford admitted that another influ
ential factor coloring his decision was
that a lot of his "former students are in
the AFT at San Francisco and San Jose,
and they would have been terribly let
down if I'd crossed the picket line."
AFT Concerned
The professor of psychology and
education is particularly serious when
he discusses the situation at San Fran
cisco State. "The AFT teachers there
seem to be seriously concerned with im
proving education. The people on strike
there appear to be most likely to sup
port the kind of education I am inter
ested in supporting."
Sanford noted that his speech was
"intended to clarify the striking
teachers' stand at San Jose. In the
speech I was attempting an analysis of
what's going on in higher education in
California today."
Clarifies Refusal
Though Sanford read a shortened
version of his speech over a local radio
station, the local media did not mako

much of the fact that he had refused to
cross the AFT picket line. This lack of
publicity disturbed Sanford because he
had hoped the media would pick up his
refusal and in the process clarify some
of the under-lying issues in the San Jose
State strike.
In the commencement address that
was never presented, Sanford lashes out
against academic men and women who
are "interested primarily in teaching
their specialties to the brightest students
they can find." This segment of the
academic world is "supported by indus
trial and governmental interests who re
gard students as human resources, and
by citizens who see vocation training as
the means by which their children can
go up in the world."
Loosening Academic Structure
Turning to the question of minority
programs, Sanford observed, "In present
circumstances programs for minority
group . . . are necessary to meet the dis
tinctive needs of people who are being
discriminated against. . . The most ex
citing thing about the movement for
minority programs is that they have a
real chance of loosening up the mono
lithic academic structure I have been
complained about. .."
Sanford is currently holding two
posts in the academic world. He is the
Director of the Human Problems Insti
tute at Stanford and President of the
Wright Institute at Berkeley.

NO SPFFCII—Prof. Nevitt Satiford never gave
a scheduled commencement address at San
Jose State last month because he refused to
cross an AFT picket line there.
In a commencement address he was
to have presented at San Jose State
College January 31, Nevitt Sanford de
clared, "I see no reason to expect peace
and quiet, or an end to unrest, on our
campuses until basic reforms have been

carried out. . . The times favor as well
as require reform."
Approximately two hours before
Sanford, professor of psychology and
education here, was due in the robing
room at San Jose, it was decided that
Sanford would not cross the American
Federation of Teachers' (AFT) picket
line thrown up around the campus.
Picket Line Debated
Sanford had informed the president
of the state college, Dr. Robert Clark,
several days earlier that he could not "in
all good conscience" cross the AFT
picket line. The AFT then debated
among its own members whether to
continue the picket line or to allow San
ford to speak—since his speech was seen
basically as a support of the striking
teachers' cause.
Two hours before robing time the
AFT concluded that it would keep the
picket line in operation. Dr. Clark pro
ceeded to introduce Sanford during the
commencement exercises. The President
explained to the audience that Sanford
felt he could not cross the AFT picket
line and give the address. The announce
ment was greated by more boos than by
applause, according to Sanford.
A Legitimate Cause
"I don't have a rigid policy of never
crossing a picket line," Sanford ex
plianed to the Daily. "It depends on the
individual merits of the case. It's been
my impression that what the AFT is
after—particularly at San Francisco
State—is quite legitimate. And I was par
ticularly moved by the lack of publicity
of the situation."
Sanford admitted that another influ
ential factor coloring his decision was
that a lot of his "former students are in
the AFT at San Francisco and San Jose,
and they would have been terribly let
down if I'd crossed the picket line."
AFT Concerned
The professor of psychology and
education is particularly serious when
he discusses the situation at San Fran
cisco State. "The AFT teachers there
seem to be seriously concerned with im
proving education. The people on strike
there appear to be most likely to sup
port the kind of education I am inter
ested in supporting."
Sanford noted that his speech was
"intended to clarify the striking
teachers' stand at San Jose. In the
speech I was attempting an analysis of
what's going on in higher education in
California today."
Clarifies Refusal
Though Sanford read a shortened
version of his speech over a local radio
station, the local media did not mako

much of the fact that he had refused to
cross the AFT picket line. This lack of
publicity disturbed Sanford because he
had hoped the media would pick up his
refusal and in the process clarify some
of the under-lying issues in the San Jose
State strike.
In the commencement address that
was never presented, Sanford lashes out
against academic men and women who
are "interested primarily in teaching
their specialties to the brightest students
they can find." This segment of the
academic world is "supported by indus
trial and governmental interests who re
gard students as human resources, and
by citizens who see vocation training as
the means by which their children can
go up in the world."
Loosening Academic Structure
Turning to the question of minority
programs, Sanford observed, "In present
circumstances programs for minority
group . . . are necessary to meet the dis
tinctive needs of people who are being
discriminated against. . . The most ex
citing thing about the movement for
minority programs is that they have a
real chance of loosening up the mono
lithic academic structure I have been
complained about. .."
