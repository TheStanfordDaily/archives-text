# Pitzer Holds ROTC Fate, Credit Conflict Continues
## 
### THOMAS C. DAWSON 
Considerable disagreement has sur
faced over the exact meaning of the stu
dent referendum on ROTC released
yesterday, but it appears that President
Pitzer, rather than the Trustees, will
have the final say on the status of
ROTC at Stanford.
Backers of the referendum see the
three to two ratio approving the referen
dum as an indication of student senti
ment for the retention of ROTC as a
credit activity while opponents of
ROTC see the vote as "virtually mean
ingless" because of the vague wording of
the proposition.
Senate-Student Debates
The Academic Senate two weeks ago
voted to remove credit from ROTC at
Stanford and to refer to a committee

the exact future status of ROTC on the
campus.
The student referendum called for
continued ROTC presence at Stanford
and "credit from the university for all
those parts of the program that are of
genuine academic interest." A student
faculty committee appointed to look
into the role of ROTC at Stanford had
previously recommended both loss of
credit and virtual expulsion of the pro
gram from campus.
Trustees In Advisory Role
The student body and the faculty
thus appear to find themselves adopting
somewhat contradictory positions.
There has been some speculation that
the Trustees, who apparently favor re
tention of ROTC on campus, might be
called upon to resolve the conflict.
This, however, is unlikely because
the Founding Grant of the University
delegates to the University President the
power "to prescribe and enforce the
course of study." According to Trustee
Dean Watkins, this precludes the
Trustees from any role in deciding the
fate of ROTC "other than an advisory
role."
Petition Pending
Contacted last night, Pitzer agreed
with Watkin's interpretation of the
Founding Grant, adding that this inter
pretation had only been brought to his
attention recently.
It may be a while before President
Pitzer is called on to decide the fate of
ROTC, however, because the decision of
the Academic Senate can be appealed to
the Academic Council by a petition of
fifty professors.
According to the Constitution of the
Academic Senate, a decision of the
Senate may be appealed to the council,
composed of all professors at or above
the assistant professor level. Such an
appeal must take place within three
weeks of the Senate action which means
that eight days remain for an appeal
petition to be filed.
Vice-Provost E. Howard Brooks a
member of the pro-ROTC minority on
the ROTC committee, said that while he
had not seen any appeal petition, he
understood that one was circulating.
Asked about the petition Col. Thomas
said he had never seen any petition
though he, too, believed some petitions
are circulating. Col. Ramey said he
hadn't seen any petitions either.
The decision of the Academic Coun
cil (or senate) is not binding on the
President, but Pitzer is very likely to go
along with the wishes of the faculty as
expressed by either the Senate or Coun
cil.
Whether the Academic Council
would take a different stand from the

ate is open to question, but Brooks
â€ž ,terday said, "I doubt the Academic
Council would overturn the Senate's de
cision."
As for the significance of the student
referendum Brooks said, "A student
vote has to be taken as advisory since
the power (to decide on credit) is in the
hands of the faculty."
Naval ROTC head Col. Robert
Thomas agreed with Brooks saying,
"Traditionally and historically matters
of academic credit have rested with the
faculty."
Academic Senate chairman Leonard
Schiff stated, "If you take it (the stu
dent referendum) literally, it doesn't
conflict with what the Senate voted,"
though he conceded that the referen
dum did give "an indication of the stu
dents not being prepared to go as far as
the committee."
Schiff also contended that the Senate
vote was a more accurate mirror of his
constituency, the faculty, than the
referendum was of the student body,
"The Academic Senate is a represen
tative body and so far has pretty well
mirrored the feelings of the council."
He also pointed out that the Senate vote
was "more decisive than the students."
Referendum Unclear
ROTC Committee majority member
Anne Kostelantz commented on the am
biguity of the referendum saying, "It is
unclear to me what they thought they
were voting for. It is not at all clear to
me that the majority report and the stu
dent vote are at variance. Some wrinkles
exist that can be straightened out by
communication and conversation."
Concerning credit for ROTC, the
young English professor said, "The
referendum said 'appropriate academic
credit' and the Senate decided no credit
was appropriate."
Other professors had differing esti
mation of the significance of the refer
endum. Col. Thomas viewed the referen
dum as "definitely a disavowal of the
majority report and the majority's feel
ing that ROTC is incompatible with the
University."
He said he felt "this student voice is
a representative one and this should
have some impact on the faculty in try
ing to reach some acceptable solution."
Trustee Watkins said he believed the
Senate vote showed "wishful thinking"
on the part of the faculty "following
the fad" of Ivy League colleges who
have recently abolished credit for
ROTC. He said the student referendum
showed "the students are in the real
world while the faculty isn't."
President Pitzer, asked about the sig
nificance of the referendum, stated last
night "ROTC is an activity here in part
on the assumption that students want it.
The referendum indicates that the
majority of students want it available
and that's significant."
He also revealed that he has been
making inquiries among the eastern Ivy
League colleges and at the Defense De
partment as to what sort of a program
might be worked out that would keep
ROTC on campus while satisfying facul
ty complaints.
Trustee chairman W. Parmer Fuller
echoed a similar sentiment saying, "At
the last Trustee meeting I suggested that
Stanford and other private colleges get
together with the Department of De
fense and draw up a program for those
students who wish it. The student refer
endum proves that a majority of stu
dents agree."
