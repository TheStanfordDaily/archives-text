# Greek Week Begins
## 
### 
Yesterday's highly successful blood
drive marked the beginning of Greek
Week, an annual activity of the Inter-
Fraternity Council (IFC) at Stanford.
Also included in the week's program
are the traditional Chariot Races,
Queen's Games Shiffazz, Presidential
Banquet, and the IFC Ball.
The purpose of Greek Week, as
summed up by IFC Social Chairman
Ray Hermann, is two-fold. Primarily, it
affords the 24 fraternities an oppor
tunity to get together in friendly, social
competition, to have a little fun, and to
get to know one another a bit better.
"The second 'theme' involves fra
ternities in relation to the entire campus
community," said Hermann. He cited
the blood drive and the Presidential
Banquet as manisfestations of this.
Events Scheduled
The blood drive has enrolled about
160 donors and is still accepting dona
tions. Persons wanting to contribute
should inquire at the Clubhouse. The
blood will go into the ASSU blood
bank, to provide free blood for students
who need transfusions.
Each fraternity, at the start of Greek
Week, selects a queen who participates
in the Chariot Races, Queen's Games,
and IFC Ball. At the Ball, the IFC
Queen will be crowned on the basis of
points accumulated by her house in the
various events.
The Chariot Races are scheduled for
Wednesday noon on Lasuen Mall (be
hind Dink). Each queen races in a make
shift chariot drawn by two fraternity
members. In addition to the normal
race, there is a separate category judged
on humor, in which nearly anything
goes.
Fraternity and Faculty Meet
Thursday evening, fraternity Presi
dents will meet with members of the ad

ministration and faculty, among them
Dean of Students Joel Smith, at the
President's Banquet. "The banquet is an
excellent opportunity to get acquainted
with men who are interested in fra
ternities and who might like to spend an
occasional evening at a house," said Her
mann.
At the Queen's Games on Friday
afternoon at Huddart Park in Woodside,
queens vie for points in a number of
games and contests, while the spectators
participate in general shiffazz.
Games will include a 3-legged race
egg toss, and a chugging contest. The
Sponge Cake will provide music for the
infamous annual Gross Dance Contest.
The entire campus is invited to the
Games, which will last from 2:00 until
5:30.
The semi-formal IFC Ball will be held
this Saturday evening at the Galleon
Club in Alameda, and features two
bands, the Chicago Typewriter and the
Oranj Wedj. Fraternity members may
obtain tickets from their house social
chairman.
The discussions on fraternities which
were scheduled for Wednesday evening
were cancelled after it was decided that
they would be redundant in light of the
recent SES discussions.

ministration and faculty, among them

occasional evening at a house," said Her
mann.

recent SES discussions.
Yesterday's highly successful blood
drive marked the beginning of Greek
Week, an annual activity of the Inter-
Fraternity Council (IFC) at Stanford.
Also included in the week's program
are the traditional Chariot Races,
Queen's Games Shiffazz, Presidential
Banquet, and the IFC Ball.
The purpose of Greek Week, as
summed up by IFC Social Chairman
Ray Hermann, is two-fold. Primarily, it
affords the 24 fraternities an oppor
tunity to get together in friendly, social
competition, to have a little fun, and to
get to know one another a bit better.
"The second 'theme' involves fra
ternities in relation to the entire campus
community," said Hermann. He cited
the blood drive and the Presidential
Banquet as manisfestations of this.
Events Scheduled
The blood drive has enrolled about
160 donors and is still accepting dona
tions. Persons wanting to contribute
should inquire at the Clubhouse. The
blood will go into the ASSU blood
