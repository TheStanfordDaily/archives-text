## Join, Help Presidio Protest 
### Paul Rupert 
I sometimes think Stanford
history does repeat itself. A while
back SDS broke up a trustees'
meeting, it is alleged. The Aca
demic Senate and most everyone
else condemned coercion and vio
lence. I wrote a column about
coercion and violence at the Pre
sidio, urging those who were so
appalled at violence to take this
opportunity to extend their out
rage beyond the confines of their
placid country club. There were
hardly any takers.
Since then at least three things
have happened. Three of the
"mutineers" have gotten fifteen
years of hard labor. The Stanford
Bookstore suffered "violence and
disruption." And right on
schedule, the Academic Senate
and much of the community has
righteously condemned "the use
of destructive tactics in the Stan
ford environment." (emphasis
added)
Lest I disrupt the inevitable
cycle, I feel called upon to point
to another opportunity to express
our peaceful sentiments in some
one else's very real interest. While
negotiations go on here between
the BSU and the administration,
and the judicial council ponders
the fate of SDS'ers, some people
are walking from Carmel to the
Presidio to protest the sentencing
of the three mutineers.
The walk may not go through
the Stanford campus. If you wish

to join it or to help leaflet along
part of the route, you may have
to leave Stanford and go to some
foreign point—like Sunnyvale,
Redwood City, or Palo Alto.
Those are places where violence
and disruption are more common,
where men are often drafted,
where powerlessness is more, evi
dent than here.
In most respects, it is a world
different from Stanford—where
privilege is not so widespread or
comfort and leisure so universal.
But the people there have very
common feelings like outrage,
sympathy, pride and fear. It is not
always easy, but it is usually possi
ble to talk to them. Since we have
a chance, it would be a shame to
blow it.
Narcissism
I recall that when 1 was here as
an undergraduate, I seldom left
the campus for anything but en
tertainment. It didn't occur to me
that there was much to learn out
there. But after a year away in
Chicago and the lesser bastions of
the Midwest, returning to Stan

ford impressed upon me the nar
cissims of Stanford life.
It is sad, but all too clear that
the university breeds a petty
world. Its concern is with the
world in rhetoric, but seldom in
action. The university becomes
for most of us an interlude be
tween suburbias, a white-collar
factory between white-collar fac
tories.
What I am asking is simply that
people in this community, who
have signed petitions and written
congressmen and showed a very
real anger at the Presidio "justice"
go with us into the larger com
munity for a few days or a few
hours to talk to people about
what we see going on. We can talk
with high school kids about the
army and the draft, with adults
about their defense jobs.
Chance To Learn
It will be no solution to any
thing, it probably won't stop
these sentences —it certainly won't
stop the army. And in many ways,
it will be depressing, given the
enormity of the problems. But for
those of us who are students and

teachers, it might be a chance to
learn and teach. And if we're
really lucky, it might be just the
first time we leave Stanford.
Watch for our organizational
meeting. Come leaflet the high
school, church, or shopping center
of your choice. A lot of people
are on trial.
