## Might Doesn't Make Right 
### Skip Provandie 
When the SDS uses disruptive
tactics, they have an ideological
purpose-they are fighting for a
highly moral cause, and their
righteousness provides them with
the opportunity and ability to
break any law or rule they deem
unfair or oppressive.
They are trying to rid the
country of all the improprieties of
our society. They are revolting
against the status quo, for they
know what is wrong, even though
they have not yet decided what is
right. In the words of Chairman
Mao, destruction must preceed
construction.
Meanwhile, the Right has re
acted through mimicry of tactics,
but only insofar as yelling. They
have yet to sit-in at the Union or
disrupt a Trustee meeting. They
have chanted at the SDS, and
while two wrongs do not make a
right, it is at least partially justi
fied for the SDS has suspended all
rules of proper conduct. They
have, in effect, cut down all the
laws to get at the Devil, only to
see the Devil turn on them when
they no longer have a shield to
protect them. Sir Thomas More
would be very unhappy.
SDS Claims Foul
The SDS claims foul—that at
least they have an ideology and a
reason for their actions, while the

Right has only righteous indig
nation; That is a weak attempt at
justification, for the SDS's re
actions to SRI and AEL have been
little more than righteous indig
nation.
The SDS has claimed they
know what is wrong and will break
any law, or try to cut them down,
in an attempt not to rectify the
situation but to destroy the of
fending stature, institution, or in
dividual. And where do they get
their justification? According to
The Daily, it is the American
Revolution.
Surely justification for violence
can come from a more recent
source than that. Let us glance just
five years into the past: Dallas,
November 22, 1963. There, Lee
Harvey Oswald, disagreeing with
President John F. Kennedy on his
actions dealing with the Bay of
Pigs, decided to suspend the laws
and determine what was right for
everyone else.
Sirhan Sirhan
On June 5, 1968, Sirhan Sirhan
decided that Senator Robert
Kennedy was too much in favor
of Israel and took the law into his
own hands, for he, too, knew
what was right and wrong.
Now the SDS, employing the
same type of logic for violence,
has determined that it knows
what is right, and is in the midst

of trying to destroy not an indivi
dual, but an institution.
Who knows how many men
will die violently at the hands of
assassins who know what justice
is. Tolkien's Gandalf sums up that
type of justice very well, "Many
that live deserve death. And some
that die deserve life. Can you give
it to them? Then do not be too
eager to deal out death in judge
ment."
How Many Kennedys?
How many John and Bobby
Kennedys are going to have to die
before violence overwhelms us all?
Once the movement is in motion,
who has the power to stop it? If
violence becomes the word of
today, ten years from now what
will be the password?
It takes great strength to wield
destructive power and not be cor
rupted, and not simply replace the
destroyed system with something
more terrible. The overthrow of
the Dark Lord is admirable, but
not if it is followed by another;
there was no gain when the defeat
of the Czar yielded Lenin. When
Hindenburg's weakness lead to
Hitler, and Batista's incompetence
brought Castro.
Might makes Right? Tell that
to Czechoslovakia.
