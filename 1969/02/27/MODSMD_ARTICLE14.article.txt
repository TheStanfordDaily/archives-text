## Protests Rejection Of 'Negotiable Requests' 
### 
Editor, THE DAILY:
Under the headline "Stanford's
Right Makes Requests," I read
that:
Acting Dean Halsey L. Royden
rejected last night any proposal
which would use "political views
as any sort of criterion for ap
pointing professors. We really try
to bend over backwards to ap
point faculty with expertise in
teaching ability and research
skills," he added. "And political
beliefs have very little to do with
that selection."
Royden noted that selection is
really a departmental concern,
with the President's office serving
as a review mechanism over the
recommendations.
Regardless of the substantive
merit of the conservative students'
case, or of your own reaction, I
wish to protest your cavalier re
jection of this "negotiable re
quest," especially after the solici
tous attention displayed by the
Administration in dealing with

"non-negotiable demands" pre
sented by other student groups.
In view of the Administration's
stated policy of attempting to per
suade students that their sug
gestions and requests will receive
due and thoughtful consideration,
your outright rejection, made on
the very day on which the re
quests were submitted, and with
no hint of consultation with
either faculty or other officers of
the Administration, is disturbing.
This inconsistent treatment is
the more shocking that you did
not, to my knowledge, oppose the
recent appointment by students
of a Marxist professor (to which I
am most certainly not objecting)
on the grounds that "selection of
professors is really a departmental
concern," nor did you reject out
right the demand of the Black
Students' Union for the appoint
ment of black professors in every
department (which, of course,
does deserve serious consider
ation) on the grounds that profes

sorial appointments are made ex
clusively on the basis of "ex
pertise in teaching ability and re
search skills."
In view of these apparent
double standards, it isn't really
surprising, is it, if conservative stu
dents feel that a "deplorable im
balance of political and philo
sophic perspectives" does indeed
exist, and that these perspectives
are not welcome at Stanford.
More generally, if your in
tention was to strengthen the stu
dents' belief that the only way to
make their voice heard by the Ad
ministration is through a dis
ruptive and obnoxious show of
power, you have certainly suc
ceeded.
I strongly urge you to recon
sider your stand, not in the sense
that the substantive requests of
the YAF be granted rather than
rejected, but in the sense that a
decision, positive or negative, be
made only after this request has
received the same attention, con

sideration, and courtesy as has
been extended by the Adminis
tration to demands coming from
other student quarters.

If President Ptizer and his Ad

factory end to these grossly unfair

Editor, THE DAILY:
Judging from the February
20th Daily's coverage of the panel
discussion on "The Problems and
Prospects of Graduate Education
in America,"the members of the
panel are guilty of drawing vast
generalizations that are not at all
justified (a crime not too infre
quent on today's campuses).
Apparently drawing from their
own limited spheres of unpleasant
experiences, they suggest that
. . Graduates are acquiring a
specialty which is neither relevant
nor constructive for society's
needs." From my own experi
ences in the sciences, I cannot
agree with that generalization—
and I am sure that many other
graduate students would disagree
also. A large portion of graduate
research in the sciences is directly
related to the most pressing needs
of our society: population con
trol, medical research, synthetic
materials to bolster dwindling
natural resources, just to name the
most obvious problems directly
concerning the scientist. If the
panel members were referring to
specific areas of graduate work
(political science, for example), I
suggest that they exercise their
tongues with more precision.
The panel's tendency to over
generalize is further evidenced by
their conclusions regarding a grad
uate student's need to "play up to
the profs" and their tendency "to
look at teaching chores as an
evil." The first of these generaliza
tions perhaps reveals some inter
personal difficulties of the
panelists rather than difficulties
necessarily limited to graduate
education. The student-professor
relationship is analogous (but not
equivalent) to mpst foreman -

worker relations. The second
statement again refers to a prob
lem not limited to graduate edu
cation. How many people find
jobs which are totally pleasant in
all respects? Moreover, a great
many of my colleagues would dis
agree that teaching in introduc
tory coureses (i.e., "teaching jobs
the faculty refuse") is unprofit
able and an evil chore.
The conclusions of this panel
emphasize the need to exercise
caution in extrapolating from
limited experience to vast, non
sensical generalizations.

Editor, THE DAILY:
Judging from the February
20th Daily's coverage of the panel
discussion on "The Problems and
Prospects of Graduate Education
in America,"the members of the
panel are guilty of drawing vast
generalizations that are not at all
justified (a crime not too infre
quent on today's campuses).
Apparently drawing from their
own limited spheres of unpleasant
experiences, they suggest that
. . Graduates are acquiring a
specialty which is neither relevant
nor constructive for society's
needs." From my own experi
ences in the sciences, I cannot
agree with that generalization—
and I am sure that many other
graduate students would disagree
also. A large portion of graduate
research in the sciences is directly
related to the most pressing needs
of our society: population con
trol, medical research, synthetic
materials to bolster dwindling
natural resources, just to name the
most obvious problems directly
concerning the scientist. If the
panel members were referring to
specific areas of graduate work
(political science, for example), I
suggest that they exercise their
tongues with more precision.
The panel's tendency to over
generalize is further evidenced by
their conclusions regarding a grad
uate student's need to "play up to
the profs" and their tendency "to
look at teaching chores as an
evil." The first of these generaliza
tions perhaps reveals some inter
personal difficulties of the
panelists rather than difficulties
necessarily limited to graduate
education. The student-professor
relationship is analogous (but not
equivalent) to mpst foreman -

worker relations. The second
statement again refers to a prob
lem not limited to graduate edu
cation. How many people find
jobs which are totally pleasant in
all respects? Moreover, a great
many of my colleagues would dis
agree that teaching in introduc
tory coureses (i.e., "teaching jobs
the faculty refuse") is unprofit
able and an evil chore.
The conclusions of this panel
emphasize the need to exercise
caution in extrapolating from
limited experience to vast, non
sensical generalizations.

Under the headline "Stanford's
Right Makes Requests," I read
that:
Acting Dean Halsey L. Royden
rejected last night any proposal
which would use "political views
as any sort of criterion for ap
pointing professors. We really try
to bend over backwards to ap
point faculty with expertise in
teaching ability and research
skills," he added. "And political
beliefs have very little to do with
that selection."
Royden noted that selection is
really a departmental concern,
with the President's office serving
as a review mechanism over the
recommendations.
Regardless of the substantive
merit of the conservative students'
case, or of your own reaction, I
wish to protest your cavalier re
jection of this "negotiable re
quest," especially after the solici
tous attention displayed by the
Administration in dealing with

"non-negotiable demands" pre
sented by other student groups.
In view of the Administration's
stated policy of attempting to per
suade students that their sug
gestions and requests will receive
due and thoughtful consideration,
your outright rejection, made on
the very day on which the re
quests were submitted, and with
no hint of consultation with
either faculty or other officers of
the Administration, is disturbing.
This inconsistent treatment is
the more shocking that you did
not, to my knowledge, oppose the
recent appointment by students
of a Marxist professor (to which I
am most certainly not objecting)
on the grounds that "selection of
professors is really a departmental
concern," nor did you reject out
right the demand of the Black
Students' Union for the appoint
ment of black professors in every
department (which, of course,
does deserve serious consider
ation) on the grounds that profes

sorial appointments are made ex
clusively on the basis of "ex

In view of these apparent

graduate students would disagree
also. A large portion of graduate
research in the sciences is directly
related to the most pressing needs
of our society: population con
trol, medical research, synthetic
materials to bolster dwindling
natural resources, just to name the
most obvious problems directly
concerning the scientist. If the
panel members were referring to
specific areas of graduate work
(political science, for example), I
suggest that they exercise their
tongues with more precision.
The panel's tendency to over
generalize is further evidenced by
their conclusions regarding a grad
uate student's need to "play up to
the profs" and their tendency "to
look at teaching chores as an
evil." The first of these generaliza
tions perhaps reveals some inter
personal difficulties of the
panelists rather than difficulties
necessarily limited to graduate
education. The student-professor
relationship is analogous (but not
equivalent) to mpst foreman -

worker relations. The second
statement again refers to a prob
lem not limited to graduate edu
cation. How many people find
jobs which are totally pleasant in
all respects? Moreover, a great
many of my colleagues would dis
agree that teaching in introduc
tory coureses (i.e., "teaching jobs
the faculty refuse") is unprofit
able and an evil chore.

emphasize the need to exercise
caution in extrapolating from
limited experience to vast, non

Editor, THE DAILY:
For the edification of Prof.

"truly gorgeous justification" for
the BSU's recent defilement of a

The justification is you Mr.

Editor, THE DAILY:
Under the headline "Stanford's
Right Makes Requests," I read
that:
Acting Dean Halsey L. Royden
rejected last night any proposal
which would use "political views
as any sort of criterion for ap
pointing professors. We really try
to bend over backwards to ap
point faculty with expertise in
teaching ability and research
skills," he added. "And political
beliefs have very little to do with
that selection."
Royden noted that selection is
really a departmental concern,
with the President's office serving
as a review mechanism over the
recommendations.
Regardless of the substantive
merit of the conservative students'
case, or of your own reaction, I
wish to protest your cavalier re
jection of this "negotiable re
quest," especially after the solici
tous attention displayed by the
Administration in dealing with

"non-negotiable demands" pre
sented by other student groups.
In view of the Administration's
stated policy of attempting to per
suade students that their sug
gestions and requests will receive
due and thoughtful consideration,
your outright rejection, made on
the very day on which the re
quests were submitted, and with
no hint of consultation with
either faculty or other officers of
the Administration, is disturbing.
This inconsistent treatment is
the more shocking that you did
not, to my knowledge, oppose the
recent appointment by students
of a Marxist professor (to which I
am most certainly not objecting)
on the grounds that "selection of
professors is really a departmental
concern," nor did you reject out
right the demand of the Black
Students' Union for the appoint
ment of black professors in every
department (which, of course,
does deserve serious consider
ation) on the grounds that profes

sorial appointments are made ex
clusively on the basis of "ex
pertise in teaching ability and re
search skills."
In view of these apparent
double standards, it isn't really
surprising, is it, if conservative stu
dents feel that a "deplorable im
balance of political and philo
sophic perspectives" does indeed
exist, and that these perspectives
are not welcome at Stanford.
More generally, if your in
tention was to strengthen the stu
dents' belief that the only way to
make their voice heard by the Ad
ministration is through a dis
ruptive and obnoxious show of
power, you have certainly suc
ceeded.
I strongly urge you to recon
sider your stand, not in the sense
that the substantive requests of
the YAF be granted rather than
rejected, but in the sense that a
decision, positive or negative, be
made only after this request has
received the same attention, con

sideration, and courtesy as has
been extended by the Adminis
tration to demands coming from
other student quarters.
