# BSU To Sponsor Fashion Show
## 
### 
Because modeling teaches self
confidence and poise, it is a good
basis for any career, believes Lula
Briggs, founder of Media Masters,
a black-owned agency for fashion
models.
Her agency will make its col
lege debut at Stanford at 7 p.m.
Sunday, Mar. 2, in Dinkelspiel
Auditorium. The two and a half
hour fashion show will be spon
sored by the Black Student
Union. Five BSU models will also
participate wearing African
clothes. Jay Payton, television
comedian, will serve as master of
ceremonies. Miss Briggs hopes that
this will become an annual college
event involving many Bay Area
campuses.
"I had modeled for eight years
in the Bay Area, and discovered
how hard it was for a black
woman to get a job at some of the
i large San Francisco stores," Miss
â–  Briggs notes. "I decided to found
an agency so that the public
I would know there are qualified
| black models."
In addition to the agency

which she started by herself, with
out outside financial aid, Miss
has started a fashion
school. Located at 1577 East
Santa Clara St. in San Jose, the
school will open in February.
Classes in make up, voice and dic
tion, visual poise (how to move
gracefully), wardrobe and styling
will be offered to teen-agers and
women of all ages.
Both the school and agency are
open to women of all races. "We
have 10 models now including a
Caucasion, a Filipino, and a
Mexican girl," Miss Briggs notes.
