# Ski Clubs Arrange Five-Day 'Carnival'
## 
### 
The Mills College and Stanford
ski clubs are sponsoring a five day
"winter carnival" on the sunny
slopes of Heavenly Valley from
March 15 to HI.
The carnival will include lift
tickets for five days, lodging for
four nights, most meals, and a
dance with Mills on Saturday
night featuring the "Chicago
Typewriter". The price for the
carnival will be $65.
The present ski conditions are
rated as excellent with 24 feet of
snow, and all indications are that
the snow will remain good. The
carnival is open to everyone in the
community.

Groups can be organized for
special lodging and a cost reduc
tion. Tickets are now on sale at
the ski club desk in the ASSU
office, and the deadline is Satur
day, March 1.
The ski club also plans a
"spring weekend" for the first
weekend in April at Squaw Val
ley. The charge will be $28 for two
days of skiing, two nights, two
breakfasts, and two dinners. For
ski club members the cost will be
considerably less.
The ski club cabin is also avail
able now, over the vacation, and
in April for those who want an
inexpensive place to stay near
Squaw Valley.
