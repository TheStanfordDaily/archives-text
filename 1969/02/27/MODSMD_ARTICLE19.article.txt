# Studies With Cats Support Theory For Schizophrenia
## 
### 
A Stanford University neuro
physiologist reports that studies
of dreaming cats lend support to a
tempting theory that schizophre
nia is the result of a biochemical
defect in the patient.

Dr. William C. Dement, profes
sor of psychiatry and pioneer in
sleep and dream research, believes
that an abnormality in the func
tion of an essential brain chemical
called serotonin gives rise to
abnormal behavior by allowing
patients to dream while awake.
Using a new drug which pre
vents the brain from producing
serotonin, Dr. Dement causes cats
to hallucinate, attack other cats,
and behave with the curious
mixture of normality and abnor
mality observed in persons with
severe mental illness.
Brain wave recordings of the
cats show the electrical pattern
during the abnormal behavior to
be identical to that of cats which
are dreaming while asleep.
Although Dr. Dement is cau
tious about the new finding, he
feels that dream and sleep re
search has moved a step closer to
understanding psychotic illnesses
in human beings.
"After a long and tortuous
climb, we appear to have emerged
upon high ground, and before us
extends a wide vista in which our
research goals . . .are clearly vis
ible," he reports in the current
issue of Stanford M.D., the maga
zine of the Stanford Medical
Alumni Association.
Dr. Dement and other research
ers have previously shown that
dreaming in humans and animals
occurs during a particular stage of
sleep which appears in humans I
with monotonous regularity every
90 minutes throughout the night.
During these dreaming periods
the sleeper seems to shift his eyes
to view or scan the unfolding
panorama of his dream world in
much the same way that he would
examine situations in the real
world. This nocturnal phenom
enon, called rapid eye movement
or REM sleep, is believed by re
searchers to be essential to well
being.
Past studies by Dr. Dement I
have shown that depriving a per-1
son of REM sleep can cause'
mental changes similar to those of |
severe mental illness. The studies |
have also established that normal ;
persons deprived of REM sleep for
a number of consecutive nights
will spend practically the whole
time dreaming when they are al
lowed to sleep without interrup
tion.
This is called a rebound effect!
and it is believed to be the mech
anism which allows the body to J
compensate for loss of the essen-1
tial dreaming or REM sleep.
Dr. Dement's most recent dis
covery with administering the l
drug to cats is that the animals do
not rebound when they are de
prived of REM sleep. He believes
this is because their need to dream
is satisfied by their dreaming
while awake as expressed by hal
lucinations and abnormal behav
ior.

Still another dramatic finding
reported last year in the Archives
of General Psychiatry reinforces
Dr. Dement's theory.
A Stanford study, conducted
by Drs. Vincent Zarcone, George
Gulevich, Kazuo Azumi, and
Terry Pivik, showed that actively
ill schizophrenic patients failed to
show the rebound effect when
deprived of dreaming.
"In all our years of studying
the effect of REM sleep depriva
tion in normal human volunteers,
cats, rats, and mice, and even a
monkey or two we had never
failed to observe this compensa
tory elevation or rebound in REM
sleep," writes Dr. Dement.
The important finding was con
firmed by further studies of
actively ill schizophrenics and,
moreover, it was demonstrated
that if the same patients were
deprived of dreaming when they
were not actively psychotic, then
the deprivation was followed by a
substantial compensatory rebound
as in normal persons.

and it is believed to be the mech
anism which allows the body to J
compensate for loss of the essen-1
tial dreaming or REM sleep.
Dr. Dement's most recent dis
covery with administering the l
drug to cats is that the animals do
not rebound when they are de
prived of REM sleep. He believes
this is because their need to dream
is satisfied by their dreaming
while awake as expressed by hal
lucinations and abnormal behav
ior.

Still another dramatic finding
reported last year in the Archives
of General Psychiatry reinforces
Dr. Dement's theory.
A Stanford study, conducted
by Drs. Vincent Zarcone, George
Gulevich, Kazuo Azumi, and
Terry Pivik, showed that actively
ill schizophrenic patients failed to
show the rebound effect when
deprived of dreaming.
"In all our years of studying
the effect of REM sleep depriva
tion in normal human volunteers,
cats, rats, and mice, and even a
monkey or two we had never
failed to observe this compensa
tory elevation or rebound in REM
sleep," writes Dr. Dement.
The important finding was con
firmed by further studies of
actively ill schizophrenics and,
moreover, it was demonstrated
that if the same patients were
deprived of dreaming when they
were not actively psychotic, then
the deprivation was followed by a
substantial compensatory rebound
as in normal persons.
A Stanford University neuro
physiologist reports that studies
of dreaming cats lend support to a
tempting theory that schizophre
nia is the result of a biochemical
defect in the patient.

Dr. William C. Dement, profes
sor of psychiatry and pioneer in
sleep and dream research, believes
that an abnormality in the func
tion of an essential brain chemical
called serotonin gives rise to
abnormal behavior by allowing
patients to dream while awake.
Using a new drug which pre
vents the brain from producing
serotonin, Dr. Dement causes cats
to hallucinate, attack other cats,
and behave with the curious
mixture of normality and abnor
mality observed in persons with
severe mental illness.
Brain wave recordings of the
cats show the electrical pattern
during the abnormal behavior to
be identical to that of cats which
are dreaming while asleep.
Although Dr. Dement is cau
tious about the new finding, he
feels that dream and sleep re
search has moved a step closer to
understanding psychotic illnesses
in human beings.
"After a long and tortuous
climb, we appear to have emerged
upon high ground, and before us
extends a wide vista in which our
research goals . . .are clearly vis
ible," he reports in the current
issue of Stanford M.D., the maga
zine of the Stanford Medical
Alumni Association.
Dr. Dement and other research
ers have previously shown that
dreaming in humans and animals
occurs during a particular stage of
sleep which appears in humans I
with monotonous regularity every
90 minutes throughout the night.
During these dreaming periods
the sleeper seems to shift his eyes
to view or scan the unfolding
panorama of his dream world in
much the same way that he would
examine situations in the real
world. This nocturnal phenom
enon, called rapid eye movement
or REM sleep, is believed by re
searchers to be essential to well
being.
Past studies by Dr. Dement I
have shown that depriving a per-1
son of REM sleep can cause'
mental changes similar to those of |
severe mental illness. The studies |
have also established that normal ;
persons deprived of REM sleep for
a number of consecutive nights
will spend practically the whole
time dreaming when they are al
lowed to sleep without interrup
tion.
This is called a rebound effect!
and it is believed to be the mech
anism which allows the body to J
compensate for loss of the essen-1
tial dreaming or REM sleep.
