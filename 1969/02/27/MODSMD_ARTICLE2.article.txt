# Student Demonstrations Plague Many Campuses

Demonstrations continued at college
campuses around the nation yesterday as
elected officials supported hard-line
action against militant protestors.
Two Negro colleges—Wiley College in
Marshall, Tex., and Stillman College in
Tuscaloosa, Ala.—were shut down
Wednesday in the wake of student
demonstrations.
At Wiley, a 75-student Methodist
institution, Dr. T. Winston Cole,
president of the school, had ordered all
students off the grounds by noon. His
order came after students failed to
remove barricades at administration and
classroom buildings.
Demonstrators have demanded Cole's
resignation. Cole said a meeting of
trustees was being setup to discuss plans
for reopening.
Stillman remained closed with fewer
than 25 dissenting students inside the
student union building, which they
locked from the inside. The students
were protesting cafeteria service and
alleged discourteous treatment by some
faculty members at the 800-student
school.
At the University of California, a fire
bomb was thrown into Haviland Hall on
the Berkeley campus early Wednesday,
causing minor damage. Three small fires
broke out outside athletic department
offices late Tuesday night.
Ysidro Macias, Third World
Liberation leader, told a rally of 350
students Tuesday: "We're going to close
it down, whether by striking peacefully
or whether we have to burn the s.o.b.
down."
Claremont Bombing
Meanwhile, college officials hid out
members of the Black Students Union in
fear the students might unjustly be
accused of setting bombs that exploded
Tuesday in two buildings of the
Claremont Colleges.
The homemade bombs burst within
minutes of each other.
Dr. Mark H. Curtis, provost of the
Claremont Colleges, said about 65
minority students found new lodgings
"with our assistance" because it was
feared the students would become targets
for retaliation.
The campus has been the scene in the

past few months of an emotional debate
between the militant Negro group and
the administration over implementation
of a black studies program and admission
of more minority students.
In California, state college trustees
voted 15-2 Wednesday for a new method
of faculty appeals from discipline cases.
The action leaves San Francisco State
College with authority to reinstate the
teachers.
Gov. Reagan voted with the majority
but urged a resolution to reject "the
widespread assumption that negotiations
have taken place." Reagan said Tuesday
that trustees could not legally negotiate
with striking college teachers.
Reagan's resolution was adopted 14-4.
However, Reagan noted that,"l think
it's time to say once and for all there will
be no negotiations" with anyone who
uses or threatens force on college
campuses.
SF State Settlement
Reagan referred to a reported
settlement of a San Francisco State
College teachers' strike worked out
between the American Federation of
Teachers faculty union and a college
trustees' committee.
"I don't see how I could vote in favor
of it at all," Reagan said of the reported
settlement. "I don't recognize that any
negotiations can take place with strikers
who are striking illegally."
On Tuesday, San Francisco Mayor
Joseph Alioto accused Reagan of
sabotaging long efforts to settle the
teachers'strike.
The Republican governor's actions
and comments constitute "an incredible
disservice to law and order in San
Francisco," the Democratic mayor told
reporters in the Capitol. He said it
amounts of "sabotage."
He called Reagan's position "clearly
untenable."
Yesterday Assembly Democrats voted
to support a tentative settlement of the
San Francisco State College teachers'
strike, and accused Gov. Reagan of
making a political issue.
The Democrats said the agreement
should bring peace to the troubled
campus, and thus be welcomed by
everyone.

However, Reagan has said he opposes
the settlement and that the small group
of college system trustees who worked it
out did so without authority from the
full board.
In Washington, the executive
committee of the National Governors
Conference gave support Wednesday to a
"get tough" policy to end disruptions on
the nation's university campuses.
