# Students Begin Work On Black Studies Major Here
## 
### 
Thirteen Stanford sophomores
and juniors have become the first
undergraduate majors in African
and Afro-American studies at
Stanford.
The group, which includes
eight blacks and five whites, is be
lieved to be the first to start de
gree work in this field at a major
private American university.
At least two other Bay Area
institutions—Merritt College in
Oakland and San Francisco City
College—already have degree pro
grams in this field.
Yale and Harvard recently an
nounced plans to organize Afro-
American programs, but Stan
ford's is the first to become oper
ational.
President Kenneth S. Pitzer has
called the new program "a small
step toward rectifying centuries of
social, educational, and political
inertia" affecting black Ameri
cans.
The new interdepartmental
major will be supervised by a
student-faculty committee headed
by Prof. James L. Gibbs Jr.,
anthropology.
As an interdepartmental major,
the new program will enable stu
dents to combine training in a tra
ditional academic discipline with
work in African and Afro-
American studies.
When asked why they chose
the new major, most students in
dicated they were primarily inter
ested in the Afro-American aspect
of the program, which they see as
helping them to find a better
sense of personal identity and to
ameliorate social problems.
Leo Bazile a transfer from Mer
ritt College who serves as co
chairman of the Stanford Black
Student Union, said: "In order to
move ahead, you must know
where you came from."
James Parker said: "The rape
of the black man from Africa,
where he knew how to govern em
pires, erect cities, cultivate fields,
mine metals, weave cotton, and
forge steel, and the process by
which he was turned into another
man's machine is one of the most

interesting transformations in
history . . .
"The American Negro has a de
finable and legitimate historical
tradition, no matter how painful
and inhuman . . .Afro-American
studies is one of the ways to make
my education relevant, not only
to myself but also to other
people . . .
"As long as black men and
white men let themselves be
sealed away in the materialized
tower of the past, they will be
alienated, not only from each
other but from themselves
and . . .from the present."
Deborah Howard wants to
study Afro-American literature as
a key to the history of how Afri
cans became Afro-Americans
through use of the English
language.
Judy Johnson says she seeks a
program "which permits freedom
to find and develop my black self.
I seek to know the past so that I
may best be able to grapple with
the problems of the black versus
white tomorrow."
Dan Clement, a member of
Delta Upsilon fraternity now
serving as an intern with Washing
ton, D.C. Councilman John A.
Nevius, says: "This crisis (of race
relations) constitutes the toughest
challenge ever to face our
country. Its solution or non
solution will project into our
future with more influence than
any other factor, assuming there is
no nuclear war."
Anthony B. Rogers, who plans
to become a high school teacher,
said: "Education must prepare a
person to take a place in society
or give him the means to change
that society if he is incapable of
accepting the society as it is."
John I. Zarwan, a transfer from
Grinnell College who has worked
two summers with the State De
partment, says"the role of the
white student in the human rights
struggle today is primarily not so
much to work in Afro-American
communities as to educate the
white community."
Victor Leipzig, another student

at Stanford in France, admits that
"as an American boy from the
clean white California suburbs,
my understanding of other cul
tures is pretty thin." He is inter
ested in a possible law career and
public service. "This can only be
performed successfully by a per
son with an understanding of
America's primary domestic prob
lem."
Kinsey Haffner says he hopes
his studies may lead to overseas
work with the foreign service or
Agency for International Develop
ment.
Loudin J. Beam II says the new
major will "further stimulate my
desire to learn more by helping
me recognize the potential and
position of blacks, by instilling
more pride in being black, by
creating a new self-awareness, and
by increasing my understanding of
the many problems of my
people."
The Stanford program will pro
vide each student with an adviser
who is both a member of the
faculty in the department with
which the student is affiliated and
a scholar in African or Afro-
American studies.
It will involve 15 faculty mem
bers, with student enrollment like
ly to expand during 1969-70.
Participants will be required to
take 50 units of credit in African
and Afro-American courses, slight
ly more than one-fourth of the
180 credits required for a bache
lor's degree.
