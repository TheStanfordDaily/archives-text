# Mr. DeYoung:
## Machines are in... People out... Net: Massive social disorientation 
### 
Dear Mr. DeYoung:
There is evidence that we of the
mid-twentieth century are
engaged in a social and
economic revolution equal in
magnitude and in impact to the
industrial revolution of the
mid-eighteenth century.
Instead of hand tools giving
way to power-driven machines,
though, man-run machines are
giving way to computer-run
machines. Many phases of
business and industry which
once depended exclusively on
human effort (e.g. accounting,
quality control, purchase
ordering, and even sales) are
already showing the intrusion
of computers. Someday,
machine-computer-computer
machine complexes may
eliminate most human
participation in industry.
Such change will produce
several significant results
(they've already started!):
1. The rapid decrease in need
for unskilled and semi-skilled
labor.
2. The ever accelerating need to
retrain personnel to move
from obsolete jobs to newly
created ones.
3. The requirement that
those frequent technological
retraining periods be with
full pay (i.e. elimination of a
job should not produce
unemployment).
4. The need for economic
stability with nearly 100% of our
labor force employed. (The
need for 3%-5% unemployment
is not directly evident.)
5. The increasing emphasis on
service industries. As
proportionately more people
are involved in research,
teaching, counseling, etc.,
our society will lose its
production-consumption basis.
What are you, an American
businessman, doing to avoid
massive social disorientation,
such as was experienced in
nineteenth century England in
the wake of the industrial
revolution, as we shift to a
service-oriented society? How
will the excluded millions
start to feel and to become a
benefiting part of the changing
society?
Yours truly,
T?-'* j 3 y

Dear Mr. Bookspan:
The fear that human beings will
be made obsolete by machines,
and the prospects of a resulting
massive social disorientation,
has prompted cries of alarm
since the harnessing of steam
power and the invention of the
mechanical loom.
These traditional forebodings
have become increasingly vocal
in some quarters with the
continuously wider applications
of automation. As the litany
goes: Automated machines
controlled by computers are
self-adjusting, repairing, and
programming without human
labor . . . can outperform any
worker at the task undertaken,
and likely outthink him as well.
Inevitably more and more
workers will be replaced with
each progressively
sophisticated generation of
computer complexes, and
unemployment will rise to
crisis proportions.
Historically these fears have
proven groundless, and there
is no reasonable basis to
conclude any catastrophic
developments in the future with
increased automation.
There is no end to the needs of
human beings as they have
more disposal income and more
leisure time. Without
automation, we would not have
had the capacity to fulfill the
demands of a constantly
increasing standard of living.
As a matter of fact, while
automation does cause
displacement, it does not cause
significant unemplo ymen t.
Quite to the contrary,
automation has created more
jobs than it has destroyed. The
development of the computer
is a good example. Actually,
there is greater employment
now than would have been the
case if the technological
advances brought about by
automation had not occurred.
This is illustrated by industry's
experience during the ten-year
period ending in 1965.

Approximately 58-million
additional jobs were created,
while some 50-million jobs were
eliminated, leaving a net gain
of 8-million positions.
Significantly, technology in a
large measure prompted the
job gain, but was not the major
cause of job losses. Rather this
resulted more from increased
wage rates occasioned by
statute and agreements
negotiated with unions, and for
the most part affected unskilled
jobs, as might be expected.
The displacement, or
redeployment, of workers
resulting from automation
certainly is no cause for alarm.
Quite frequently, people are
released from lower-paying
jobs and advance to better
paying positions, all brought
about by automation.Most
firms applying newly available
technologies retrain and place
their employees in new
positions, and invariably
experience the need for
additional personnel as well.
For the most part this means an
upgrading of skills along with
an increased income-earning
potential, and expanded
employment.
Compare the significant
increase in the total work

force of over 70-million, with
average earnings of $2.50 per
hour, to that of 63-million in
1955 whose hourly earnings
averaged $2.00 (equivalent
1965 dollars). In other words,
wage rates and employment
both rose during a decade that
witnessed considerable
automated innovations.
Aside from these bare-bones
statistical facts, the impact of
automation is measurable in
other terms; namely, the
increasing release of man from
dawn-to-dark drudgery.
Through the utilization of
machines in lieu of brute force
to increase productivity,
significantly greater numbers
have been able to shift to
exciting new occupations that
mean for them larger incomes
and fuller lives. A vast spectrum
of new activities through
increasing applications of
automation is profoundly
affecting our whole mode of
life. The future potential is as
great as man's imaginative
intelligence can develop.
Sincerely,
