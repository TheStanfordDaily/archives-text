# Senate, Student Group To Hold Joint Meeting
## 
### MARGARET McGAUGHEY 
The Student Education Council and
the Academic Senate will hold their first
joint meeting in Bishop Auditorium of
the Business School at 3:15 today to
begin consideration of the Study of
Education at Stanford (SES) recommen
dations.
The discussion today will center on a
broad philosophical definition of edu
cation as it applies to the university
requirement that students have a basic
course in both writing and historical
studies. Definite proposals relating to
the requirements will not be considered.
A preliminary organizational meeting
of SEC was held yesterday afternoon to
elect a moderator, or chairman, and to
appoint an eight-man steering com
mittee to oversee procedural matters.
Thirteen names were nominated to serve
on the steering committee. Elections for
the committee will take place tomorrow
night.
The SEC, consisting of 44 represen
tatives of two undergraduate and six
graduate schools, was selected in a stu
dent referendum last week
The chairman is victor von Schlegell,
vice president of ASSU. The group
made it clear that he was elected as a
moderator who should see that all views
are presented, rather than an active par
ticipant in the debates.
Von Schlegell will head the SEC
steering committee and be chairman of
the joint SECâ€”Academic Council meet
ings on alternate weeks.

The proposal for a separate steering
committee for SEC was adopted after
considerable debate as to whether the
committee should deal with procedural
matters only, or act as a separate liason
body as well. The students decided it
should be concerned primarily with SEC
procedure, and not be a separate con
nection between the university com
munity and SEC.
It was originally proposed that ASSU
president Denis Hayes serve ex-officio
on the steering committee. That pro
posal was dropped, but Hayes was one
of the thirteen nominated to the com
mittee.
In addition to the steering com
mittee, it was suggested that a separate
conference committee be selected to
negotiate with representatives of the
faculty Academic Senate in the event
that there be disagreement between the
two bodies. An amendment intro
duced by Michael Sweeney proposed
that members of this committee be
chosen as a whole for each separate
group of negotiations with the faculty
body.
The agenda for today's meeting of
SEC and the Academic Senate will be
very closely controlled by the agenda
established by the Floor Management
committee. After each of a series of
speakers there will be 30 minutes of
open discussion. Each speaker, however,
will be allotted only three minutes.
