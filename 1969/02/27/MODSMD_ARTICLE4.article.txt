# Entire Faculty To Decide On ROTC Credit Status
## 
### MICHAEL KUHL 
The future of the Stanford Reserve
Officers Training Corps (ROTC) pro
gram will come up for consideration be
fore the entire faculty this spring.
A petition, signed by 53 faculty
members, was temporarily presented to
the Secretary of the Academic Senate
Donald Winbigler yesterday morning. It
will be resubmitted this morning, while
other copies will continue to circulate
up until next Thursday's deadline.
The petition urges the Academic
Council to reconsider "the Academic
Senate's decision to eliminate academic
credit for all ROTC courses."
The body is also urged to give "ade
quate consideration . . .to the minority
report of the Ad Hoc Committee to
Study ROTC Credit."
All Faculty Members
The Academic Council includes all
faculty members of assistant professor
or higher stature. Until last spring it was
the sole faculty deliberative body.
Meetings of the larger faculty body
seldom drew more than 150 faculty
members for the monthly meetings.
Over five hundred faculty members
turned out for last spring's controversial
vote which ended the Old Union sit-in.
The Academic Council currently
meets once a month. The next regularly
scheduled meeting is April 4, the first
Friday of spring quarter.
53 Signatures
Dave Brown, sophomore in chemis
try and a member of Army ROTC, gave
Winbigler a copy of the petition signed
by 53 faculty members yesterday. He
withdrew it later to insure that all those
who had signed it were eligible to do so.
Winbigler indicated yesterday that
the Academic Council would probably
not meet earlier than usual to consider
this issue.

Recommendations two and three of
the majority report have been referred
back to committee. This new committee
has not been formed yet, and it is
doubtful that it will be reporting before
the Academic Council meets.
Recommendation two suggests that
"non-credit, required military training
and education should no longer be of
fered on the Stanford campus."
Third Recommendation
The third recommendation would re
quire "all remaining military programs
or acitvities . . .be regulated by the Uni
versity's military programs or general
policy for Stanford Voluntary Organi
zations."
Brown will resubmit his petition
today. Meanwhile, with five or six other
students he hopes to obtain at least 40
other faculty signatures.
"I felt that 25 votes could not possi
bly be representative of a faculty of
nearly 1000 members. When the Aca
demic Senators had so little time to
contact members of their department to
see how to represent them," Brown
noted.
Two-Thirds Sympathetic
Although the petition proceedure
was intended to be operated through
faculty response, Brown said faculty re
action was basically favorable. "60 to
70 percent of the faculty members I
contacted were sympathetic with my
views," he noted.
Brown feels that greater consider
ation should be given to the minority
committee proposal for a joint student
faculty advisory council to pass on the
merits of each ROTC course in regards
to academic content.
"With the fact that ROTC courses
require a lot of work, students with a
full academic load will be discouraged
from taking part in ROTC," he added.

Those faculty members who signed
the petition seemed to agree with
Brown's sentiments about hasty action.
One Academic Senate member who
voted to recommend discontinuing
ROTC credit signed the petition on just
these grounds.
One of the student members of the
ROTC committee who signed the major
ity report strongly disagreed with alle
gations of hastily conceived action.
"We felt that there were members of
the Academic Senate who hadn't read
our report," said Mark Edwards, a
graduate student in history.
"I really feel that we will get a poll
ing of popular opinion rather than a
vote of rational understanding (of the
majority report)," Edwards added.
Assistant Prof, of English Anne
Kostelanetz, who also signed the majori
ty report, said the students vote to re
tain ROTC" on campus has been over
interpreted by various members of the
academic community.
"I think that the students have been
lead to feel that doing away with aca
demic credit is tantamount to doing
away with ROTC," she said.
Any action by the Academic Council
will have to be referred back to the
Academic Senate for reconsideration as
a recommendation.

Third Recommendation
The third recommendation would re
quire "all remaining military programs
or acitvities . . .be regulated by the Uni
versity's military programs or general
policy for Stanford Voluntary Organi
zations."
Brown will resubmit his petition
today. Meanwhile, with five or six other
students he hopes to obtain at least 40
other faculty signatures.
"I felt that 25 votes could not possi
bly be representative of a faculty of
nearly 1000 members. When the Aca
demic Senators had so little time to
contact members of their department to
see how to represent them," Brown
noted.
Two-Thirds Sympathetic
Although the petition proceedure
was intended to be operated through
faculty response, Brown said faculty re
action was basically favorable. "60 to
70 percent of the faculty members I
contacted were sympathetic with my
views," he noted.
Brown feels that greater consider
ation should be given to the minority
committee proposal for a joint student
faculty advisory council to pass on the
merits of each ROTC course in regards
to academic content.
"With the fact that ROTC courses
require a lot of work, students with a
full academic load will be discouraged
from taking part in ROTC," he added.

Those faculty members who signed
the petition seemed to agree with
Brown's sentiments about hasty action.
One Academic Senate member who
voted to recommend discontinuing
ROTC credit signed the petition on just
these grounds.
One of the student members of the
ROTC committee who signed the major
ity report strongly disagreed with alle
gations of hastily conceived action.
"We felt that there were members of
the Academic Senate who hadn't read
our report," said Mark Edwards, a
graduate student in history.
"I really feel that we will get a poll
ing of popular opinion rather than a
vote of rational understanding (of the
majority report)," Edwards added.
Assistant Prof, of English Anne
Kostelanetz, who also signed the majori
ty report, said the students vote to re
tain ROTC" on campus has been over
interpreted by various members of the
academic community.
"I think that the students have been
lead to feel that doing away with aca
demic credit is tantamount to doing
away with ROTC," she said.
Any action by the Academic Council
will have to be referred back to the
Academic Senate for reconsideration as
a recommendation.
The future of the Stanford Reserve
Officers Training Corps (ROTC) pro
gram will come up for consideration be
fore the entire faculty this spring.
A petition, signed by 53 faculty
members, was temporarily presented to
the Secretary of the Academic Senate
Donald Winbigler yesterday morning. It
will be resubmitted this morning, while
other copies will continue to circulate
up until next Thursday's deadline.
The petition urges the Academic
Council to reconsider "the Academic
Senate's decision to eliminate academic
credit for all ROTC courses."
The body is also urged to give "ade
quate consideration . . .to the minority
report of the Ad Hoc Committee to
Study ROTC Credit."
All Faculty Members
The Academic Council includes all
faculty members of assistant professor
or higher stature. Until last spring it was
the sole faculty deliberative body.
Meetings of the larger faculty body
seldom drew more than 150 faculty
members for the monthly meetings.
Over five hundred faculty members
turned out for last spring's controversial
vote which ended the Old Union sit-in.
The Academic Council currently
meets once a month. The next regularly
scheduled meeting is April 4, the first
Friday of spring quarter.
53 Signatures
Dave Brown, sophomore in chemis
try and a member of Army ROTC, gave
Winbigler a copy of the petition signed
by 53 faculty members yesterday. He
withdrew it later to insure that all those
who had signed it were eligible to do so.
Winbigler indicated yesterday that
the Academic Council would probably
not meet earlier than usual to consider
this issue.

Recommendations two and three of
the majority report have been referred
back to committee. This new committee
has not been formed yet, and it is
doubtful that it will be reporting before
the Academic Council meets.
Recommendation two suggests that
"non-credit, required military training
and education should no longer be of
fered on the Stanford campus."
