# Parental Mafia
## Admissions Officers Challenged 
### MARK WEINBERGER 
Attempted bribery, pleas, threats,
and even guns.
It sounds like a Mafia shakedown.
But it isn't. It's the scene in the college
admissions office.
Stanford admission officials meet
many of the same problems that college
admissions offices are facing all across
the country—and then some. On top of
mountains of paperwork, endless inter
views, constant parental harrassment,
and tight deadlines, Stanford officials
must fend off the almost savage compe
tition of 9,000 applicants for 1,400
places in next fall's freshman class.
One method used by devious high
schoolers to emerge victorious in the
admissions struggle at many colleges is
the padding of the admissions appli
cation. Pseudo-projects, outlandish ac
complishments, and tall stories some
times pop up on the application from or
during a personal interview.
However, Stanford finds a minimum
amount of such deception from its ap
plicants, according to Douglas Walker,
director of freshman admissions.
"We actually find very little pad
ding," Walker noted. He explained that
Stanford's admission application—with
forms to be filled out by high school
teacher, counselor, and family friend
tends to keep the applicant's achieve
ments in perspective. "If a kid says he
has done something fantastic, it is usual
ly refuted or substantiated by the high
school. When a student lists something
he has done, the school substantiates it
95 percent of the time."
Electronic Nutcracker
And, as former admissions director
Rixford Snyder notes, "after years of
experience, you can tell which claims on
the part of applicants to discount. Some
go out of their way to join clubs." When
listing these activities on their appli
cations, they put down everything, even
the senior ball decoration committee.

But when these activities are squeezed
down, there's not much there."
Without a doubt, admissions officers
have a hard time believing many of the
things they read on applications these
days. One enterprising applicant, for in
stance, invented an electronic nut
cracker, while another started his own
printing press and underground news
paper. One applicant signed on with a
freighter, "for a year of seasoning," as
Walker put it.
High school students are "throwing
caution to the wind," Walker claims.
"The sky's the limit these days, with
more diversity than ever before." He
cited volunteer work with government
or local enterprises, a sudden interest in
problems of urban development, and an
amazing variety of elective courses being
offered at the high school level. It all
adds up to an emphasis on the unusual,
the out-of-the-ordinary effort on the
part of the Stanford applicant.
Fluff With Fads
Especially on the East Coast, a pat
tern soon emerges. "When one student
finds a new and different activity, many
soon follow" in the extremely compe
titive atmosphere in eastern prep
schools, Walker stated. With such cur
rent "fads" as working in urban slums,
the entire effort tends to become little
more than "fluff to fatten up their ap
plications," he added.
The applications themselves change
over the years to reflect the changing
interests and attitudes of aspiring candi
dates. The current essay question, for
instance, reads, "Describe in your own
handwriting which academic subject in
high school has been most challenging
and stimulating to you and comment on
any individual study or research you
have done in this subject area."
In addition, the admissions infor
mation booklet sent to prospective can
didates includes all essential application
deadlines and information. The pamph

let also lists opportunities in Stanford's
ROTC program.
Pushy Parents
The fiercely competitive atmosphere
also pervades the personal interview at
Stanford, with the pushy parent and the
overly aggresive student the main of
fenders.
"We get plenty of hot shots in here
for interviews," Walker stated. "Some
are really polished, after having gone
through a number of such interviews.
They tend to be overaggressive, over
bearing." Some hopefuls even appear
with scrapbooks in hand, and submit
the interviewer to a lengthly, but most
certainly boring, show.
But by far the worst offender is the
"pushy mother and father. It is the
parents who do all the talking, and even
argue among themselves," Walker said.
They prompt their children with "tell
him about that stamp collection," or
"Don't forget to mention how you
painted aunt's house at the Cape." And
the pushy parent often mentions the
phone call to the old friend trustee that
he plans to make,
The most ironic statement often
comes from the overbearing parent him
self, who sits in on the high schooler's
interview: "We don't want to leave a
stone unturned."
On Her Knees
If this were not enough, perhaps the
most unneeded the most overblown part
of the admissions procedure comes after
the fateful day in April when accept
ances are mailed out. Stanford is invaria
bly flooded by phone calls from angry
parents demanding an explanation for

their child's rejection. Former director
Snyder, a 19-year veteran of the ad
missions wars, recalls one woman who
fell down on her knees and prayed to
the admissions board after her daughter
was turned down.
On another occasion, Snyder left for
an African interview tour the day that
acceptances and rejections were mailed.
In the usual tidal wave of complaints
that soon follow, one irate Ohioan de
manded access to the admissions di
rector. He was told that Snyder was in
Lagos, Nigeria. But a faulty phone con
nection garbled the message, and the
angry father shot back, "Sagos,
Siberia?" Admissions workers still
chuckle over the incident, since it so
aptly fits the the woes of the Stanford
office.
Money Or Murder
Post-admission problems are often
quite serious. In one case, a distraught
mother confronted Snyder in his office,
moaning repeatedly, "You turned down
my daughter." With each passing
moment, the woman's plaints grew
louder and louder, until she pulled a gun
from her purse and trained it on the
startled director. Snyder sat petrified
for several minutes, but finally managed
to wrest the revolver away.
In another case, a father waved his
son's rejection notice before Snyder,
and then said, "Here, this might interest
you more." From his pocket, he pulled
an envelope and plopped it down on
Snyder's desk. It was full of money.
But, of course, it was all in a day's
work in the increasingly-frantic ad
missions scene.
