# LASSU To Consider Another Constitution
## 
### 
The Stanford Student Legislature
(LASSU) will pass on student body
president Denis Hayes' latest
constitution when it meets tonight at
7:30 in Geology Corner.
According to Speaker Yale
Braunstein, LASSU will decide on
whether Hayes' proposed constitution
will go to committee for further study or
whether it should go directly to the ballot
for student consideration.
In addition a group of resolutions have
been put forth dealing with the incidents
at the bookstore and Tresidder Memorial
Union last week.
Included in the proposals is one by
Student Financial Manager David Swift
which mentions no names, or
organizations, and asks for ASSU funds
to pay for the uninsured damage received
in each location.
$700 Uninsured Damage
Estimates are that the uninsured
damage totals $200 at Tresidder and
$500 at the bookstore.

Braunstein has called any sort of
further action "redundant" because of an
earlier resolution passed this year
condemning violence or coercive tactics.
A motion which was made two weeks
ago at the legislature meeting to impeach
Braunstein has received little or no
support.
Schneider Proposal
However representative Jim Schneider
will propose a change of the by-laws
which would drop the necessity of "just
cause" from the article dealing with
impeachment of the speaker. According
to Braunstein, Schneider has circulated
the proposed change by mail to all
members of the legislature.
The legislature will also be asked in a
proposal made by members of Soto
House to appropriate funds to send
President Pitzer, Student President
Denis Hayes and the President of the
Academic Senate to Washington to
present a personal protest to President
Nixon concerning the recent court
proceedings at the Presidio.
