# Inevitable Brutality?
## 
### 
Like the cold rain that has been falling
on Stanford since before we can remember,
military brutality and inhumanity seem in
evitable.
Rain soaks the grave of Richard Bunch,
whose tragedy ended last October. Rain
drums on the roof of the two-story clap
board barracks at the Presidio, where most
of the 27 "mutineers" await trial for pro
testing Richard's death.
It may be naive to think that an end is
possible to the long winter of human suf
fering. As our pragmatist friends are so
quick to point out, we have been killing
each other for thousands of years.
But perhaps there is another kind of
pragmatism. The military establishment
and war itself are no more than the com
pound of many individual decisions.
Each of us has the power to make ex
actly one of those decisions. Our power as
individuals could be viewed as statistically
insignificant. But there have been men, like
Ghandhi and John Kennedy, who called it
infinite.
Each of us is able, for example, to ques
tion the assumptions which guide our soci
ety. Are we, as a nation, threatened by the
rest of the world? Or is it possible that our
political and military paranoia constitute
the greatest danger ever faced by mankind?
Is it necessary for us to justify the kill
ing of Richard Bunch and the destruction

of Vietnam—to sacrifice our humanity—if we
are to survive?
We are conditioned to avoid such ques
tions. It is much easier to accept the reality
provided by high school history texts.
But even in a nation that so easily ac
cepts regimentation of thought, there is a
contradictory streak of vitality. We are
guaranteed the right to think independent
ly, though such thought is made difficult.
And as long as we can think, we can act.
Twenty-seven men at the Presidio found
the strength to do what they thought was
necessary, and they acted with intimate
knowledge of the probable consequences.
Stanford students will have an oppor
tunity to act on behalf of these men, three
of whom have already been sentenced to a
total of 45 years imprisonment.
Several groups have asked us to distrib
ute leaflets in surrounding communities—to
urge citizens to ask'the same questions that
are being asked on the campus. A meeting
to organize this effort will be held at 4:00
this afternoon in the basement of the Club
house.
Support is needed for the nonviolent
march that celebrates the courage of the
27. It will culminate next Tuesday night
with a candlelight procession from San
Mateo to the Presidio.
We urge you to examine your con
science—and to act.

pound of many individual decisions.
Each of us has the power to make ex
actly one of those decisions. Our power as
individuals could be viewed as statistically
insignificant. But there have been men, like
Ghandhi and John Kennedy, who called it
infinite.
Each of us is able, for example, to ques
tion the assumptions which guide our soci
ety. Are we, as a nation, threatened by the
rest of the world? Or is it possible that our
political and military paranoia constitute
the greatest danger ever faced by mankind?
Is it necessary for us to justify the kill
ing of Richard Bunch and the destruction

of Vietnam—to sacrifice our humanity—if we
are to survive?
We are conditioned to avoid such ques
tions. It is much easier to accept the reality
provided by high school history texts.
But even in a nation that so easily ac
cepts regimentation of thought, there is a
contradictory streak of vitality. We are
guaranteed the right to think independent
ly, though such thought is made difficult.
And as long as we can think, we can act.
Twenty-seven men at the Presidio found
the strength to do what they thought was
necessary, and they acted with intimate
knowledge of the probable consequences.
Stanford students will have an oppor
tunity to act on behalf of these men, three
of whom have already been sentenced to a
total of 45 years imprisonment.
Several groups have asked us to distrib
ute leaflets in surrounding communities—to
urge citizens to ask'the same questions that
are being asked on the campus. A meeting
to organize this effort will be held at 4:00
this afternoon in the basement of the Club
house.
Support is needed for the nonviolent
march that celebrates the courage of the
27. It will culminate next Tuesday night
with a candlelight procession from San
Mateo to the Presidio.
We urge you to examine your con
science—and to act.
Like the cold rain that has been falling
on Stanford since before we can remember,
military brutality and inhumanity seem in
evitable.
Rain soaks the grave of Richard Bunch,
whose tragedy ended last October. Rain
drums on the roof of the two-story clap
board barracks at the Presidio, where most
of the 27 "mutineers" await trial for pro
testing Richard's death.
It may be naive to think that an end is
possible to the long winter of human suf
fering. As our pragmatist friends are so
quick to point out, we have been killing
each other for thousands of years.
But perhaps there is another kind of
pragmatism. The military establishment
and war itself are no more than the com
pound of many individual decisions.
Each of us has the power to make ex
actly one of those decisions. Our power as
