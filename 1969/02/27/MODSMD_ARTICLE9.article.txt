## Throwing The Book At Workers 
### Cissie Bonini 
Dear Mom,
My boyfriend has become con
vinced that the concession
machines in the Undergraduate
Coffee Shop have individual dia
bolical personalities. It has be
come an obsession with him to
outwit them and he cuts most of
his classes to "keep his eye on
those rats." For example, he says
the candy machine takes quarters,
gives a 10c bar, and then returns
only a nickel. He feels that the
coffee machine is rigged so that—
when you put your hand in to
take your hot beverage—the boil
ing coffee stream deflects onto
your hand. He says that the sand
wiches in the sandwich machine
are plastic and that the sliding
doors are not constructed to
open.
He has convinced a lot of our
friends and they are working in
shifts waiting for one of the
machines to make a "slip" and
give back more money or give out
a product. This is embarrassing to
me as my father owns the vending
company. What should I do?

Dear Torn,
I think your boyfriend is
wrong about the coffee machine,
but the cigarette machine does
laugh at you when you turn your
back to it and the dollar bill
changer only gives back 57c. I
usually study at night, but will be
glad to take the 9 p.m. to mid
night shift if he is having trouble
filling that spot.
Watchfully yours,
Mom
Dear Mom,
I work on the staff at the
Undergraduate Library. One stu
dent is always checking out two

hour books. When they are due,
he drops them into the Two-hour
hox from the fourth floor of the
library. This is very hard on the
bindings, and we have lost three
library workers with concussions.
We are all wearing pith helmets
now to man the desk, but I think
something should be done about
this. (He says the regulations only
state when the books are due and
say nothing about the method of
returning them.) Headachy

Dear Headachy,
In the interest of charity, dear,

I must say that it is considerate of
the student to get the books in on
time. So many people these days
are indifferent to the needs of
others and it is refreshing to hear
of someone who takes punctuality
seriously. You might look into the
"Hazardous Work" clause of the
Librarians Union. Since it is a
dangerous profession, there may
be some coverage for bodily in
jury. Lovingly,
Morn
Dear Mom,
I write a column for the school

Daily. Whenever I write something
my editor doesn't like, my
column doesn't appear for a week.
Is this freedom of the press?
