The Russians Are Coming,
The Russians Are Coming,
Starring Alan Arkin, Jonathan Winters, Paul Ford, Michael J.
Pollard, Brian Keith
A Russian sub runs aground near a New England town.
Suburban paranoia runs wild as the town arms against the
incipient "rooskie" assault. Arkin makes a great, frightened
Russian subaltern, Winters a befuddled, nagged deputy; Ford
a paranoia-ridden fascist; Pollard a dumb grease monkey; and
Keith, the benevolent (if possible) sheriff, trying to settle the
mess.
Laurel and Hardy will wreck a house before the Russians
come, in "Dirty Work/'
and Garfunkel in "The Graduate"
