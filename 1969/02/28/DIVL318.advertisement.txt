The Low &
the Mighty
Just $199.00 down plus tax and li
cense puts you into a '69 VW (on
36 month plan, $56.47 per month).
A low price for the humble bug.
But if you'd like to live a little —
there's the mighty Porsche Targ'a:
a car that's good enough to race.
(But don't do it on the streets, we
want you around as a customer.)
