# Hayes Threatens To Resign Post

### BILL BANKS 
Student body president Denis Hayes
threatened to resign at last night's
LASSU meeting.
Hayes made the announcement after
â€”'ticn to put his new ASSU
constitution on the ballot was tabled.
Hayes stated that he would be away
trying to raise funds for an experimental
college for the duration of the week and
that he "sincerely hoped" for the
adoption of the constitution, which he
said is the best student legislative
document he has yet seen. If it is not
accepted by the time he returns Hayes
said, "I will resign."
LASSU is not scheduled to meet again
within the next week, and, when the
meeting closed, the motion was still
officially tabled.
Endorsement Urged
Before he left the meeting, Hayes also
asked the senate's endorsement of five
students selected to serve on the new
student-faculty-trustee body, the
University Advisory Committee.
The student appointees are Pat Shea,
Mike Sweeney, Roullette Smith, and Alan
Spector. The fifth student on the fifteen
man committee whose members are
divided evenly among faculty, trustees
and students, is Hayes.
Finally, Hayes submitted a motion to
set the date of the ASSU elections early
in April. His motion was adopted. The
elections will be held April 15 and 16.
Speaker, Yale Braunstein then sought
the senate's endorsement of Ben Wooten
for Chairman of the Finance Committee
and Jeff Kane's candadacy for the Rules
Committee. Wooten's bid was approved,
but Kane's appointment was defeated.
Some Success Achieved
Kane did, however, achieve some
degree of success as LASSU endorsed his
resolution backing the "efforts of the
scientific-technological community" to
widen its awareness of the responsibility
it accepts as it develops newer and more
effective uses of it's skill. The resolution,
as stated by Kane relates to the moral
responsibility of technicians and
scientists to such issues as the war in
Vietnam.

A bill calling for the allotment of
seven hundred dollars to cover the
damage suffered at Tresidder Union and
the Stanford Bookstore on February 20
was introduced by David Swift and
Charles Mansfield.
Swift explained that the students
involved in the disorders, regardless of
other affiliations, were ASSU members.
For this reason, he contended, the ASSU
should assume the responsibility for the
actions.
$200 for Union
The motion allotted two hundred
dollars to Tresidder Union and five
hundred to the bookstore, "in the event
that there is no resititution from other
sources."
Another motion passed allotted one
hundred dollars to an undergraduate
theater group which plans to present a
play entitled Cuchulain later this quarter.
Speaking for the group, Victor von
Schlegell stated that "in an attempt to
vary the usual repertoire, they would like
to offer a feast, which would be part of
the over-all presentation."
The cost of such a feast could not be
covered without raising the price of the
tickets unless the ASSU offered some
financial help.
Also a proposal from the Foreign
Exchange Program drew nineteen
hundred dollars from the ASSU treasury.
The statement from this group explained
that the student exchange to Berlin has
been suspended in the cause of economy
but that the additional funds were
needed to insure the success of the
programs still in operation.
The meeting adjourned at 10:10 p.m.
due to the lack of a quorum. The rapidly
dwindling number of members was,
observed Braunstein, related to the
conspicuous lack of Speech Association
members.
The Speech association has been
attempting for almost six months to
obtain four thousand dollars from the
ASSU. Their porposal, although passed
by the LASSU body, was vetoed by Denis
Hayes.
