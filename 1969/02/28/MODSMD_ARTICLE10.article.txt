# Can't Dismiss Blackness
## 
### Gavin Langmuir 
Professor Berlinski's letter in
The Daily of February 26 states
that members of the BSU who
participated in Thursday's "stupid
and immoral" raid upon the
bookstore and cafeteria "are
simply violence-enchanted
primitives."
After criticizing the failure of
The Daily and white students to
criticize that conduct adequately,
he suggests that he will be
considered a racist because a
person "who insists on dismissing
color in evaluating conduct" is now
considered a racist. Presumably he
is accepting that position and
denying that it is racist.
Must anyone with "a well
functioning cerebral cortex" agree
with his judgments? Is it true that
those members of the BSU are
violence-enchanted primitives? Is
his statement in contradiction with
his position that one should
disregard color? And is that
position valid?
Did Professor Berlinski base his
purportedly factual statement that
these people were enchanted with
violence on a careful observation of
the events? If he did, has he
adequate knowledge of the
individuals involved to assess their
motives and conduct? Did every
individual there possess the
characteristics he attributes to
them in common? From what I saw
and the people I know, I could not
agree with him

The character of his perception
is interesting. "Primitives" is rarely
used to apply to white Americans
(other than certain painters) but is
a standard negative stereotype for
blacks.
When blacks are called
primitives who are enchanted by
violence and engage in stupid and
immoral actions, the charge has an
altogether too familiar ring. Is
Professor Berlinski sure that his
evaluation of their conduct was
uninfluenced by perception of
color?

In any case, is an effort to
dismiss color a sound basis for
either an empirical analysis of
black and white conduct in
America or an ethical judgment
on it.
Any historical or sociological
attempt to understand blacks and
whites and relations between them
in America in the last century or
the last decade without regard to
the significance attributed to
physical differences would be an
amazingly futile exercise. Does
Professor Berlinski wish to deny

that many (most, the vast majority
of) whites react to the color of
blacks and what they feel that
color implies?
Presumably therefore, he only
means that one can make a moral
judgment which rises above
prejudice and applies equally to all.
But to do so is to judge without
reference to the context of the act
and the perceptions of the person
who acts, so that what is stupid and
immoral for one person is stupid
and immoral for anyone else
however different the context.
Does such an absolute standard
apply short of Utopia?
Even to the limited
understanding of a white, it must
be obvious that black men and
women in America have not been
treated sinply as humans but as 4
blacks with all the accompanying
connotations and degradation.
That condition still exists, and
blacks are part of the outside world
as well as that of the university.
To dismiss the relevance of what
it means to be black in America
when making a moral judgment on
people who are black—or white—is
to deny the most obvious moral
problem in America, as well as any
possibility of understanding and
solving the problem.

immoral for one person is stupid
and immoral for anyone else
however different the context.
Does such an absolute standard
apply short of Utopia?
Even to the limited
understanding of a white, it must
be obvious that black men and
women in America have not been
treated sinply as humans but as 4
blacks with all the accompanying
connotations and degradation.
That condition still exists, and
blacks are part of the outside world
as well as that of the university.
To dismiss the relevance of what
it means to be black in America
when making a moral judgment on
people who are black—or white—is
to deny the most obvious moral
problem in America, as well as any
possibility of understanding and
solving the problem.

Professor Berlinski's letter in
The Daily of February 26 states
that members of the BSU who
participated in Thursday's "stupid
and immoral" raid upon the
bookstore and cafeteria "are
simply violence-enchanted
primitives."
After criticizing the failure of
The Daily and white students to
criticize that conduct adequately,
he suggests that he will be
considered a racist because a
person "who insists on dismissing
color in evaluating conduct" is now
considered a racist. Presumably he
is accepting that position and
denying that it is racist.
Must anyone with "a well
functioning cerebral cortex" agree
with his judgments? Is it true that
those members of the BSU are
violence-enchanted primitives? Is
his statement in contradiction with
his position that one should
disregard color? And is that
position valid?
Did Professor Berlinski base his
purportedly factual statement that
these people were enchanted with
violence on a careful observation of
the events? If he did, has he
adequate knowledge of the
individuals involved to assess their
motives and conduct? Did every
individual there possess the
characteristics he attributes to
them in common? From what I saw
and the people I know, I could not
agree with him

The character of his perception
is interesting. "Primitives" is rarely
used to apply to white Americans
(other than certain painters) but is
a standard negative stereotype for
blacks.
When blacks are called
primitives who are enchanted by
violence and engage in stupid and
immoral actions, the charge has an
altogether too familiar ring. Is
Professor Berlinski sure that his
evaluation of their conduct was
uninfluenced by perception of
color?

In any case, is an effort to
dismiss color a sound basis for
either an empirical analysis of
black and white conduct in
America or an ethical judgment
on it.
Any historical or sociological
attempt to understand blacks and
whites and relations between them
in America in the last century or
the last decade without regard to
the significance attributed to
physical differences would be an
amazingly futile exercise. Does
Professor Berlinski wish to deny

that many (most, the vast majority
of) whites react to the color of
blacks and what they feel that
color implies?
Presumably therefore, he only
means that one can make a moral
judgment which rises above
prejudice and applies equally to all.
But to do so is to judge without
reference to the context of the act
and the perceptions of the person
who acts, so that what is stupid and
immoral for one person is stupid
and immoral for anyone else
however different the context.
