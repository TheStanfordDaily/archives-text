# A
						Privileged Minority?

### Hubert Marshall 
As this is written there has been
no public announcement that the
administration intends to file
disciplinary charges agains tthe
students who last Thursday stole
fool at the Union and invaded the
bookstore.
This fact, if it reflects the
administration's intentions, poses
serious questions of policy which
need to be considered by all
members of the Stanford
community.
The basic statute governing
student conduct at Stanford in the
Fundamental Standard which
reads as follows:
"Students are expected to show
both within and without the
University such respect for order,
morality, personal honor, and the
rights of others as is demanded of
good citizens. Failure to observe
this will be sufficient cause for
removal from the University."
I doubt that any of your readers
will care to dispute the assertion
that the theft of over $100 worth
of food from the Union and the
causing of $6,000 in damages in the
bookstore constitute violations of
the Fundamental Standard. How
then can we account for the failure
of the administration to announce
its intention to press charges
against these students, especially in
light of the vigor with which
charges against SDS were pressed
after the meeting of the Trustees
was disrupted?
Double Standard?
That a double standard should
prevail on this campus is a notion
that I think all of us would find
objectionable. Yet is it possible
that a meeting of the Trustees is
regarded as sacrosanct, or
"politically sensitive," while theft
at the Union and destruction in the
bookstore are felt to be
unimportant?
Had SDS members invaded the
bookstore and engaged in wanton
and senseless destruction, would
they have been punished with
nothing more than a slap on the

wrist in the form of an innocuous
resolution passed by the Academic
Senate?
Or is the double standard a
racial one? Is it possible that black
students on this campus have
license to do what whites are
forbidden to do? This is the most
damning of the possible
explanations since it is demeaning
and even degrading to the blacks.
Not Exempt
To my knowledge they have not
asked to be exempted from the
standards required of all other
mmebers of the Standord
community. And to do so without
their request is to adopt the odious
Southern claim that blacks are by
nature irresponsible and that
whites must accommodate
themselves to that unfortunate
fact. No matter how else we fail
surely we must never come to
accept this hateful fallacy. Yet
have we not come close to doing
so?
It may be argued, on the other
hand, that charges would be
pressed if only the guilty could be
identified. But again the handling
of this episode stands in sharp
contrast to the handling of the SDS
incident.
For months every rally of SDS
has been attended by observers
from the administration or the
Faculty Committee on Campus
Disruptions. Pictures of the SDS
members massed in the Faculty
Club outside the Trustees' dining
room reveal so many members of
the Dean's office, representatives
of the Faculty Committee on
Campus Disruptions, and
employees of the News Service and
Office of University Relations that
an outsider might think the
administration was sitting-in at an
SDS meeting!
Why Not BSU?
Why was similar attention not
lavished on the BSU? Surely after
the events that have taken place at
San Francisco State and Berkeley,
we know that the rhetoric of

activist students must be taken
seriously.
Two weeks ago at White Plaza a
spokesman of the BSU twice
asserted to several hundred
listeners that he wasready to kill to
achieve his political ends. Last
Thursday when the BSU invaded
the Faculty Club it was clear that
they were in an ugly mood. Were
members of the Faculty
Committee on Campus Disruptions
called at that time?
Representatives of the Dean of
Students' office? The campus
police?
The BSU crowd reportedly
spent considerable time at the
Union. Did the Manager of the
Union ask them for identification?
Did he call the police? According
to The Daily, Mr. Simmons and
Dean Wyman observed the
students at the Union and advised
Dr. Pitzer to cancel the 2 p.m.
meeting "because the crowd was in
a dangerous mood." Apparently
they knew the theft of food had
taken place.
Did they seek to identify those
who were guilty? Later on a horde
of university officials observed the
crowd in and around President
Pitzer's office. When the crowd left
for the bookstore, why did no
observers follow?
Tunc In
Perhaps one should not give free
reign to the imagination. But can it
be that SDS's idealistic opposition
to university involvement in the
Vietnam war is somehow more
subversive than that BSU's
idealistic pursuit of racial equality
on this campus? Or are
Afro-Americans regarded as more
benign, less dangerous, than
whites? One wonders how late
some people can tune in.
Whatever the explanations, the
consequences for Stanford are of
the utmost seriousness. In good
conscience can the case against the
SDS members be prosecuted if
charges are not also brought against
those who stole food at the Union
and damaged the bookstore?

Will it be possible to induce
faculty and students to serve on the
Student Conduct Legislative
Council if they come to believe
that the regulations they enact will
be enforced against some but not
against others? How can members
of the Stanford Judicial Council
continue in good faith to serve if
they know that a privileged
minority is exempt from the law?
These are questions that all of us
must ponder. I know that
universities by tradition are ill
equipped to protect themselves
from the kinds of assaults that are
being mounted against them.
Surely they are not without
grave defects. But in the long run
they cannot endure if they harbor
in their midst large numbers of
people who reject the liberal values
upon which they are based.
