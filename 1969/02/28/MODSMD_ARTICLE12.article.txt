## No Restraints Placed Upon The SDS 
### 
Editor, THE DAILY:
A few important points are
being overlooked by the SDS in
its long, eloquent (and faithfully
reported) defense of its right to
do whatever it wishes as long as it
is convinced of the need to do so.
The SDS says that the Trus
tees, the government, and all
others who disagree are answer
able to no one, and that the SDS
therefore has no choice but to
engage in physical violence to
bring about change. No violence,
no change; it's that simple.
This is not true. There are
many restraints upon trustees,
governments, and individuals.
Trustees cannot sell "war goods"
to a government that does not
want them. Governments cannot
buy them unless the Congress
approves. Congress will do not so
unless it has a mandate from the
people. An unpopular president
cannot run for re-election if the
voters oppose him. Individuals are
subject to laws. The process is
slow and tedious, but it works.
But there are no restraints
placed upon the SDS, and that is
the heart of the problem (long
ignored by The Daily). The SDS
holds that it is not subject to the
same reasonable campus regula
tions as are other mortals. It says
it should not be expected to obey
laws it does not approve. It says:
"We will stand up and be
counted"—and then screams when
someone starts taking names.
Throw us to the lions, they say,
but first make sure the lions are
toothless.
Finally, what the SDS is sug
gesting is that its judgment and
behavior should be substituted for
the judgment and actions of all
others in positions of authority.
We are so noble, so pure, so
humanitarian, says the SDS, that
everything should go the way we
say—or else.
But I see in the SDS not one
grain of love or decency or objec

tivity. I see only cruelty, intoler
ance and hatred in all its actions.
This is what rings false about that
group: it espouses a better world,
yet it resorts to, and appeals to,
the very worst in mankind.

• Trustee Autonomy
Editor, THE DAILY:
The violent and irresponsible
acts of certain groups of individ
uals in the United States must be
stopped. These people are the
trustees of the nation's univer
sities.
Hopefully by now we are
aware of the intimate ties between
the Stanford trustees and the war
in Vietnam. They remain un
accountable to anyone for their
part in the destruction of the
Vietnamese people. In a letter to
the Judicial Council last Friday,
trustee Dean Watkins noted that
he was responsible to the people
of the world, and to the Stanford
community only in proportion to
its share of the world's popula
tion. Yet Watkins-Johnson, an
electronics firm in the Industrial
Park (whose chairman is our trus
tee), has 65% of its contracts with
the DOD.
Trustee autonomy is not uni
que to Stanford. At Rice the trus
tees appointed a president with
out consultation with the
university community.
A survey just completed by the
Educational Testing Service at
Princeton reveals the gap between
trsutees and their universities.
These statistics are based on
responses from more than 5000
trustees at 500 colleges and uni
versities across the country. For
example, 69% think campus
speakers should be screened, 40%
believe student newspapers should
be censored, and 53% favor
loyalty oaths for professors. Only
8% believe professors should play
a major part in the selection of a

new president, and 64% would ex
clude professors from decisions re
garding academic tenure.
Trustee autonomy is anti
thetical to a democratic society.
Those who make decisions for
others must be held accountable
to those whom those decisions
affect.

• Shoch Misquoted
Editor, THE DAILY:
Every day these things shower
down on me, printed words from
newspapers and neon words
blasted from the television, and it
becomes ever so much harder day
by day to see and hear truth.
The Daily article on the moti
vational hearing would have Jim
Shoch drooling and ranting, bent
on destruction, mindlessly
"against" everything, leading a
pack of frizzy-haired, misguided
Oedipi toward their collective
father images with fire in their
eyes and knives in their teeth. I
heard Jim on Friday and besides
the fact that he is my dear friend,
what he said meant something to
me.
To take the most blatant mis
take in the article, when Jim was
quoted as saying "This is why
we're out to destroy," he actually
said "This is what we're out to
destroy" and he had a very precise
"what" in mind—the university's
complicity with the war industries
and its failure to face up to the
moral stance we all ask of Stan
ford as an educational institution.
If the media is going to play
everybody's go-between, interpre
ting individuals to publics and
public opinion to individuals, the
least to ask of it is objectivity and
accuracy. Do you realize, most
important and saddest of all, that
in this best of all possible worlds,
Jim Shoch cannot even spring to
his own defense against facile
written statements which outline

him unfairly to the Daily readers.
If he called a press conference
to retrieve himself, charging that
the media had maligned and mis
quoted him, everyone listening,
according to his or her politics,
would consider "it"—the whole
spectacle—either petty or pitiful.
Either way, the truth of what Jim
originally said on Friday would be
further buried in the new dirt
kicked up to cover the old.
I hope subsequent articles
about the hearing and other im
portant events will honestly deal
with the issues and not simplify
and distort them

• Bookstore Incident
Editor, THE DAILY:
In the Daily issue of February
25th, the suggestion was made
that the recent damages at the
Stanford Bookstore might be paid
for by temporarily eliminating the
student discount at the store.
I fail to see the logic in that
suggestion. If the investigation of
the incident which is presently
taking place shows that members
of one or more student organiza
tions were responsible for the
damage, then the only just action
is to assess the individuals in
volved, or the organizations to
which they belong. To do less
than this is to establish a policy
whereby the entire student body
continually bears the cost of
destructive acts.
We are all subjected to situa
tions which tend to frustrate, but
I firmly believe that, when identi
fiable, those who take out their
frustrations in destructive actions
affecting the entire university
community should bear the cost
of the damages. The details of
reparations could be worked out
by the duly constituted judicial
bodies on campus.

blasted from the television, and it
becomes ever so much harder day
by day to see and hear truth.
The Daily article on the moti
vational hearing would have Jim
Shoch drooling and ranting, bent
on destruction, mindlessly
"against" everything, leading a
pack of frizzy-haired, misguided
Oedipi toward their collective
father images with fire in their
eyes and knives in their teeth. I
heard Jim on Friday and besides
the fact that he is my dear friend,
what he said meant something to
me.
To take the most blatant mis
take in the article, when Jim was
quoted as saying "This is why
we're out to destroy," he actually
said "This is what we're out to
destroy" and he had a very precise
"what" in mind—the university's
complicity with the war industries
and its failure to face up to the
moral stance we all ask of Stan
ford as an educational institution.
If the media is going to play
everybody's go-between, interpre
ting individuals to publics and
public opinion to individuals, the
least to ask of it is objectivity and
accuracy. Do you realize, most
important and saddest of all, that
in this best of all possible worlds,
Jim Shoch cannot even spring to
his own defense against facile
written statements which outline

him unfairly to the Daily readers.
If he called a press conference
to retrieve himself, charging that
the media had maligned and mis
quoted him, everyone listening,
according to his or her politics,
would consider "it"—the whole
spectacle—either petty or pitiful.
Either way, the truth of what Jim
originally said on Friday would be
further buried in the new dirt
kicked up to cover the old.
I hope subsequent articles
about the hearing and other im
portant events will honestly deal
with the issues and not simplify
and distort them

• Bookstore Incident
Editor, THE DAILY:
In the Daily issue of February
25th, the suggestion was made
that the recent damages at the
Stanford Bookstore might be paid
for by temporarily eliminating the
student discount at the store.
I fail to see the logic in that
suggestion. If the investigation of
the incident which is presently
taking place shows that members
of one or more student organiza
tions were responsible for the
damage, then the only just action
is to assess the individuals in
volved, or the organizations to
which they belong. To do less
than this is to establish a policy
whereby the entire student body
continually bears the cost of
destructive acts.
We are all subjected to situa
tions which tend to frustrate, but
I firmly believe that, when identi
fiable, those who take out their
frustrations in destructive actions
affecting the entire university
community should bear the cost
of the damages. The details of
reparations could be worked out
by the duly constituted judicial
bodies on campus.

Editor, THE DAILY:
A few important points are
being overlooked by the SDS in
its long, eloquent (and faithfully
reported) defense of its right to
do whatever it wishes as long as it
is convinced of the need to do so.
The SDS says that the Trus
tees, the government, and all
others who disagree are answer
able to no one, and that the SDS
therefore has no choice but to
engage in physical violence to
bring about change. No violence,
no change; it's that simple.
This is not true. There are
many restraints upon trustees,
governments, and individuals.
Trustees cannot sell "war goods"
to a government that does not
want them. Governments cannot
buy them unless the Congress
approves. Congress will do not so
unless it has a mandate from the
people. An unpopular president
cannot run for re-election if the
voters oppose him. Individuals are
subject to laws. The process is
slow and tedious, but it works.
But there are no restraints
placed upon the SDS, and that is
the heart of the problem (long
ignored by The Daily). The SDS
holds that it is not subject to the
same reasonable campus regula
tions as are other mortals. It says
it should not be expected to obey
laws it does not approve. It says:
"We will stand up and be
counted"—and then screams when
someone starts taking names.
Throw us to the lions, they say,
but first make sure the lions are
toothless.
Finally, what the SDS is sug
gesting is that its judgment and
behavior should be substituted for
the judgment and actions of all
others in positions of authority.
We are so noble, so pure, so
humanitarian, says the SDS, that
everything should go the way we
say—or else.
But I see in the SDS not one
grain of love or decency or objec

tivity. I see only cruelty, intoler
ance and hatred in all its actions.
This is what rings false about that
group: it espouses a better world,
yet it resorts to, and appeals to,
the very worst in mankind.

• Trustee Autonomy
Editor, THE DAILY:
The violent and irresponsible
acts of certain groups of individ
uals in the United States must be
stopped. These people are the
trustees of the nation's univer
sities.
Hopefully by now we are
aware of the intimate ties between
the Stanford trustees and the war
in Vietnam. They remain un
accountable to anyone for their
part in the destruction of the
Vietnamese people. In a letter to
the Judicial Council last Friday,
trustee Dean Watkins noted that
he was responsible to the people
of the world, and to the Stanford
community only in proportion to
its share of the world's popula
tion. Yet Watkins-Johnson, an
electronics firm in the Industrial
Park (whose chairman is our trus
tee), has 65% of its contracts with
the DOD.
Trustee autonomy is not uni
que to Stanford. At Rice the trus
tees appointed a president with
out consultation with the
university community.
A survey just completed by the
Educational Testing Service at
Princeton reveals the gap between
trsutees and their universities.
These statistics are based on
responses from more than 5000
trustees at 500 colleges and uni
versities across the country. For
example, 69% think campus
speakers should be screened, 40%
believe student newspapers should
be censored, and 53% favor
loyalty oaths for professors. Only
8% believe professors should play
a major part in the selection of a

new president, and 64% would ex
clude professors from decisions re
garding academic tenure.
Trustee autonomy is anti
thetical to a democratic society.
Those who make decisions for
others must be held accountable
to those whom those decisions
affect.

ignored by The Daily). The SDS
holds that it is not subject to the
same reasonable campus regula
tions as are other mortals. It says
it should not be expected to obey
laws it does not approve. It says:
"We will stand up and be
counted"—and then screams when
someone starts taking names.
Throw us to the lions, they say,
but first make sure the lions are
toothless.
Finally, what the SDS is sug
gesting is that its judgment and
behavior should be substituted for
the judgment and actions of all
others in positions of authority.
We are so noble, so pure, so
humanitarian, says the SDS, that
everything should go the way we
say—or else.
But I see in the SDS not one
grain of love or decency or objec

tivity. I see only cruelty, intoler
ance and hatred in all its actions.
This is what rings false about that
group: it espouses a better world,
yet it resorts to, and appeals to,
the very worst in mankind.

• Trustee Autonomy
Editor, THE DAILY:
The violent and irresponsible
acts of certain groups of individ
uals in the United States must be
stopped. These people are the
trustees of the nation's univer
sities.
Hopefully by now we are
aware of the intimate ties between
the Stanford trustees and the war
in Vietnam. They remain un
accountable to anyone for their
part in the destruction of the
Vietnamese people. In a letter to
the Judicial Council last Friday,
trustee Dean Watkins noted that
he was responsible to the people
of the world, and to the Stanford
community only in proportion to
its share of the world's popula
tion. Yet Watkins-Johnson, an
electronics firm in the Industrial
Park (whose chairman is our trus
tee), has 65% of its contracts with
the DOD.
Trustee autonomy is not uni
que to Stanford. At Rice the trus
tees appointed a president with
out consultation with the
university community.
A survey just completed by the
Educational Testing Service at
Princeton reveals the gap between
trsutees and their universities.
These statistics are based on
responses from more than 5000
trustees at 500 colleges and uni
versities across the country. For
example, 69% think campus
speakers should be screened, 40%
believe student newspapers should
be censored, and 53% favor
loyalty oaths for professors. Only
8% believe professors should play
a major part in the selection of a

new president, and 64% would ex
clude professors from decisions re
garding academic tenure.
Trustee autonomy is anti
thetical to a democratic society.
Those who make decisions for
others must be held accountable
to those whom those decisions
affect.

• Shoch Misquoted
Editor, THE DAILY:
Every day these things shower
down on me, printed words from
newspapers and neon words
blasted from the television, and it
becomes ever so much harder day
by day to see and hear truth.
The Daily article on the moti
vational hearing would have Jim
Shoch drooling and ranting, bent
on destruction, mindlessly
"against" everything, leading a
pack of frizzy-haired, misguided
Oedipi toward their collective
father images with fire in their
eyes and knives in their teeth. I
heard Jim on Friday and besides
the fact that he is my dear friend,
what he said meant something to
me.
To take the most blatant mis
take in the article, when Jim was
quoted as saying "This is why
we're out to destroy," he actually
said "This is what we're out to
destroy" and he had a very precise
"what" in mind—the university's
complicity with the war industries
and its failure to face up to the
moral stance we all ask of Stan
ford as an educational institution.
If the media is going to play
everybody's go-between, interpre
ting individuals to publics and
public opinion to individuals, the
least to ask of it is objectivity and
accuracy. Do you realize, most
important and saddest of all, that
in this best of all possible worlds,
Jim Shoch cannot even spring to
his own defense against facile
written statements which outline

him unfairly to the Daily readers.
If he called a press conference
to retrieve himself, charging that
the media had maligned and mis
quoted him, everyone listening,
according to his or her politics,
would consider "it"—the whole
spectacle—either petty or pitiful.
Either way, the truth of what Jim
originally said on Friday would be
further buried in the new dirt
kicked up to cover the old.
I hope subsequent articles
about the hearing and other im
portant events will honestly deal
with the issues and not simplify
and distort them

• Bookstore Incident
Editor, THE DAILY:
In the Daily issue of February
25th, the suggestion was made
that the recent damages at the
Stanford Bookstore might be paid
for by temporarily eliminating the
student discount at the store.
I fail to see the logic in that
suggestion. If the investigation of
the incident which is presently
taking place shows that members
of one or more student organiza
tions were responsible for the
damage, then the only just action
is to assess the individuals in
volved, or the organizations to
which they belong. To do less
than this is to establish a policy
whereby the entire student body
continually bears the cost of
destructive acts.
We are all subjected to situa
tions which tend to frustrate, but
I firmly believe that, when identi
fiable, those who take out their
frustrations in destructive actions
affecting the entire university
community should bear the cost
of the damages. The details of
reparations could be worked out
by the duly constituted judicial
bodies on campus.
J. F. Walkup

Editor, THE DAILY:
A few important points are
being overlooked by the SDS in
its long, eloquent (and faithfully
reported) defense of its right to
do whatever it wishes as long as it
is convinced of the need to do so.
The SDS says that the Trus
tees, the government, and all
others who disagree are answer
able to no one, and that the SDS
therefore has no choice but to
engage in physical violence to
bring about change. No violence,
no change; it's that simple.
This is not true. There are
many restraints upon trustees,
governments, and individuals.
Trustees cannot sell "war goods"
to a government that does not
want them. Governments cannot
buy them unless the Congress
approves. Congress will do not so
unless it has a mandate from the
people. An unpopular president
cannot run for re-election if the
voters oppose him. Individuals are
subject to laws. The process is
slow and tedious, but it works.
But there are no restraints
placed upon the SDS, and that is

least to ask of it is objectivity and
accuracy. Do you realize, most
important and saddest of all, that
in this best of all possible worlds,
Jim Shoch cannot even spring to
his own defense against facile
written statements which outline

him unfairly to the Daily readers.
If he called a press conference
to retrieve himself, charging that
the media had maligned and mis
quoted him, everyone listening,
according to his or her politics,
would consider "it"—the whole
spectacle—either petty or pitiful.
Either way, the truth of what Jim
originally said on Friday would be
further buried in the new dirt
kicked up to cover the old.
I hope subsequent articles
about the hearing and other im
portant events will honestly deal
with the issues and not simplify
and distort them

• Bookstore Incident
Editor, THE DAILY:
In the Daily issue of February
25th, the suggestion was made
that the recent damages at the
Stanford Bookstore might be paid
for by temporarily eliminating the
student discount at the store.
I fail to see the logic in that
suggestion. If the investigation of
the incident which is presently
taking place shows that members
of one or more student organiza
tions were responsible for the
damage, then the only just action
is to assess the individuals in
volved, or the organizations to
which they belong. To do less
than this is to establish a policy
whereby the entire student body
continually bears the cost of
destructive acts.
We are all subjected to situa
tions which tend to frustrate, but
I firmly believe that, when identi
fiable, those who take out their
frustrations in destructive actions
affecting the entire university
community should bear the cost
of the damages. The details of
reparations could be worked out
by the duly constituted judicial
bodies on campus.
