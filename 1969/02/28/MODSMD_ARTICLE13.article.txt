# It's No Joke
## Black History Month Too 
### Dick Gregory 
February is American history
month, it seems, for white Amer
ica. Banks, schools, public build
ings and many offices close twice
during February to commenorate
the birth of two traditional Amer
ican History's most legendary
heroes—George Washington and
Abraham Lincoln. The Father of
our country and the supposed
Healer of its woulds are given
their revered and honored place in
America's official memory.
February is also a month rich
in the history of the black exper
ience in America, although there
is no official recognition at the
national level. Perhaps that fact
partially explains why the nation's
wounds are still bleeding profuse
ly-
Frederick Douglas, a runaway
slave, author, probably the leading
voice of the 19th century aboli
tionist movement, editor of the
famed abolitionist newspaper The
North Star, was born and also
died in the month of February.
This month saw the birth of Dr.
W.E.B Dubois, prolific writer,
noted historian, founder of the
NAACP, certainly the father of
the current mood among black
youth of black identity, black cul
ture and black studies, and Lang
ston Hughes, one of the most
renowned black of letters in this
century.
February is both the month of
black recognition and black assas
sination. Hiram Rhoades Revels of
Mississippi, the first black United
States Senator, took the oath of
office in 1870 during the month
of February. The wise and cour

ageous spokesman of racial truth
in America, Brother Malcolm X,
was murdered on February 21,
1965.
Demand For Black Courses
An increasing national phe
nomenon is the demand of black
youth that black history be taught
in colleges, high schools and grade
schools throughout the land. It is
primarily a northern phenom
enon, since the segregated school
system of the South has long
provided black youth with black
principals, black teachers and a
black curriculum.
Graduates of all-black southern
schools are familiar with the
names and accomplishments of
black men in America—a history
conspicuously eliminated from
the supposedly liberal northern
educational system.
So there is obviously more to
the concept of integration that
physical proximity. School buses
can "bring students together" to
borrow a Nixon phrase, but they
are irrelevant to establishing cul
tural identity and racial pride. The
popular phrase "quality education
through integration" means more
than establishing a physical racial
balance in the public schools. It
means establishing an educational
system which encourages the full
integration of the individual
human being.
Unique History
If a black student is fully ex
posed to his own unique history,
not the degrading history of sla
very but the noble accomplish
ments of his ancestors, that stu
dent will no longer harbor those
feelings of inferiority which the

American system has imposed
upon him. If the white student is
fully exposed to that same black
history, he will no longer be able
to accept his parents' version of
black worth. Such exposure may
show the white student who the
real "nigger" is.
White folks must study black
history to set the record straight.
Traditional American history is a
slanted version of the story of
America. For the black student,
black history is only a prelude to
a more thorough orientation in
black studies.
Black studies must relate the
entire educational process to the
black experience. The only way
for the black student to break out
of the system in America, which
has made him a "nigger" for so
long, is to find out who he is and
where he came from, so that he
himself can determine where he is
going. A man without identity is
like a tree without roots.
Black Accomplishments
The list of black accomplish
ments is long indeed. Look at the
list of black inventors alone.
White America tends only to
think of George Washington
Carver and peanut butter.
But there was also Benjamin
Banneker, who made the first
clock in America, a wooden
"striking" clock, and who laid out
the blue print for the nation's
capitol. Henry Blair was the first
black man to be issued a patent
first for a corn planting machine

and later for a cotton planter.
Dr. Daniel Hale Williams per
formed the first open heart sur
gery. Dr. Charles Drew developed
the techniques for separating and
preserving blood—though he died
of injuries received in an auto
mobile accident because a south
ern hospital would not give blood
transfusions to blacks. Jan Matzel
iger revolutionized the shoe in
dustry with his machine to mass
produce shoes.
Granville T. Woods revolution
ized the railroad industry with his
Synchronous Multiplex Railway
Telegraph. Norbert Rillieux revo
lutionized the sugar-refining in
dustry in the United States, by
inventing a vacuum evaporating
pan which reduced the industry's
dependence upon gang labor and
produced a superior product.
Gas Mask
Elijah McCoy revolutionized
machines, period, by developing a
process for automatic lubrication.
Garrett Morgan invented both the
gas mask and the traffic light.
Andrew Beard invented a coupling
device for railroad cars which pre
vented the maiming or death of
countless railroad workers.
The list of black inventors is
endless and includes such com
mon house-hold items as the dust
pan, the pencil sharpener, the
fountain pen and the paper bag.
Just one more remindei that black
is not only beautiful, but also
creative and inventive and neces
sary for America's survival.
