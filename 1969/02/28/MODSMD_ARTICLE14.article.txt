# Rough Draft
## Prospects For Draft Reform 
### Bill Leland Alan Strain 
There is growing criticism from
the press and the public that the
Military Selective Service Act of
1967 combined with the practice
of the Selective Service System
results in an inequitable,
inefficient, unfair, inconsistent, in
short, intolerable situation. What
are the prospects for change?
Change is promised, but. . .At
the end of the last session of
Congress a large number of
proposals for change remained
unacted upon in the House and
Senate Armed Services
Committees. These committees are
now chaired by Mendell Rivers and
John Stennis. Mendell Rivers is an
old and good friend of General
Hershey. John Stennis appears to
be anything but a draft reformer.
Again, in the present session of
Congress a number of bills have
been sent to committee. George
McGovern and Barry Goldwater
along with others have proposed a
volunteer Army. Ted Kennedy,
Philip Hart, Jacob Javits among
many others have presented
proposals. It is indeed possible that
these bills will never get out of
committee.
The Act of 1967, effective July
1, 1967, must be renewed before
its expiration date of June 30,
1971. There is considerable inertia
to overcome if serious
consideration of change is to come
much earlier than the year before
that date. Prospects for earlier

change gain only slight promise
given the significant amount of
Congressional activity at this date.
Initiative for change could come
from the Executive Office or the
Department of Defense. President
Nixon campaigned on the promise
of a volunteer Army . . .if . . .
when . . .His qualifications on the
volunteer Army proposal are
numerous, perhaps overwhelming.
President Nixon has ordered the
Pentagon to study the question of a
volunteer Army. It is likely that a
report will take most of a year in
formulation. If a volunteer Army
proposal were accepted at that
time, it would still take about two
years to phase in the new system.
Last week Defense Secretary
Melvin Laird said that a lottery
system may be introduced before
the end of the Vietnam war. The
lottery is seen as an intermediary
step toward the volunteer Army.
Again, there is no sense of
immediacy about the lottery, and
the duration of the"intermediary"
step remains to be seen.
If the lottery system is
introduced, the problems of a
prime age group and deferments
must be resolved. Although there
exists no prime age group at this
time, the Act of 1967 does provide
for its creation. The prime age
would be an age group which
would be designated as having
maximum exposure to the draft,
generally understood to be

nineteen year olds.
In other words, if nineteen year
olds were established as the prime
age group, a man would have
maximum exposure to the draft
during the year that he was
nineteen. If he were not drafted
that year, the chances of his being
called in subsequent years would
become very slim.
Furthermore, if a prime age
group were created, a provision
would probably be included so that
men presently deferred who are
under the age of 26 would revert to
the "prime age group" for a period
of one year at the time that their
deferment terminated. It is
understood that the men in the
prime age would be called on the
basis of a lottery and that
deferments would be limited.
In summary, the realization of a
volunteer Army appears extremely
unlikely in the immediate future.
Chances for any significant change
in the next year appear slight.
When change docs come it will
probably be in the direction of a
lottery and a prime age group. If
change is going to come earlier than
June 1971, it will probably be a
result of initiative from the
Pentagon.

years to phase in the new system.
Last week Defense Secretary
Melvin Laird said that a lottery
system may be introduced before
the end of the Vietnam war. The
lottery is seen as an intermediary
step toward the volunteer Army.
Again, there is no sense of
immediacy about the lottery, and
the duration of the"intermediary"
step remains to be seen.
If the lottery system is
introduced, the problems of a
prime age group and deferments
must be resolved. Although there
exists no prime age group at this
time, the Act of 1967 does provide
for its creation. The prime age
would be an age group which
would be designated as having
maximum exposure to the draft,
generally understood to be

nineteen year olds.
In other words, if nineteen year
olds were established as the prime
age group, a man would have
maximum exposure to the draft
during the year that he was
nineteen. If he were not drafted
that year, the chances of his being
called in subsequent years would
become very slim.
Furthermore, if a prime age
group were created, a provision
would probably be included so that
men presently deferred who are
under the age of 26 would revert to
the "prime age group" for a period
of one year at the time that their
deferment terminated. It is
understood that the men in the
prime age would be called on the
basis of a lottery and that
deferments would be limited.
In summary, the realization of a
volunteer Army appears extremely
unlikely in the immediate future.
Chances for any significant change
in the next year appear slight.
When change docs come it will
probably be in the direction of a
lottery and a prime age group. If
change is going to come earlier than
June 1971, it will probably be a
result of initiative from the
Pentagon.
There is growing criticism from
the press and the public that the
Military Selective Service Act of
1967 combined with the practice
of the Selective Service System
results in an inequitable,
inefficient, unfair, inconsistent, in
short, intolerable situation. What
are the prospects for change?
Change is promised, but. . .At
the end of the last session of
Congress a large number of
proposals for change remained
unacted upon in the House and
Senate Armed Services
Committees. These committees are
now chaired by Mendell Rivers and
John Stennis. Mendell Rivers is an
old and good friend of General
Hershey. John Stennis appears to
be anything but a draft reformer.
Again, in the present session of
Congress a number of bills have
been sent to committee. George
McGovern and Barry Goldwater
along with others have proposed a
volunteer Army. Ted Kennedy,
Philip Hart, Jacob Javits among
many others have presented
proposals. It is indeed possible that
these bills will never get out of
committee.
The Act of 1967, effective July
1, 1967, must be renewed before
its expiration date of June 30,
1971. There is considerable inertia
to overcome if serious
consideration of change is to come
much earlier than the year before
that date. Prospects for earlier

change gain only slight promise
given the significant amount of
Congressional activity at this date.
Initiative for change could come
from the Executive Office or the
Department of Defense. President
Nixon campaigned on the promise
of a volunteer Army . . .if . . .
when . . .His qualifications on the
volunteer Army proposal are
numerous, perhaps overwhelming.
President Nixon has ordered the
Pentagon to study the question of a
volunteer Army. It is likely that a
report will take most of a year in
formulation. If a volunteer Army
proposal were accepted at that
time, it would still take about two
years to phase in the new system.
