# Peruvian Politician
## 
### 
Fernando Belaunde Terry,
former president of Peru, will
speak this afternoon at 4:15 in the
large lounge of Tresidder Union on
"The Democratic Experience in
Peru, 1963-68." The lecture is
sponsored by the Stanford Latin
American Studies Association and
the Committee on International
Studies, and is open to the public.
Belaunde, now a professor of
city and regional planning at
Harvard University, entered
Peruvian politics at age 33 as a
member of the Democratic
National Front. He then founded
the Popular Action party and ran
three times on its ticket for the
presidency.
In 1968 Belaunde was ousted by
a military junta headed by Gen.
Velasco Alvarado on the charge of
"selling out" Peru to International
Petroleum Co., a subsidiary of
Standard Oil.
