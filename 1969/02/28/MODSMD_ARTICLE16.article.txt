# Czech Study Trip
## 
### 
Two Stanford students who
were in Czechoslovakia during the
1968 democratization process and
after the Soviet invasion are
organizing a program of study and
travel to Czechoslovakia for the
summer, 1969. Graduates as well as
undergraduatesare eligible.
The program will consist of six
weeks in Czechoslovakia (July 1 to
August 15, approximately). Three
weeks will be spent in Prague,
meeting with top party,
governmental and cultural persons,
and three weeks traveling to other
cities (e.g. Bratislava, capital of
Slovakia) and into the country
side. In order to prepare for the
summer visit, students will be
required to enroll in a directed
reading program on Czechoslovak

history and culture which is to be
given by Professor Jan Triska of the
Political Science Department.
The preparatory course will
carry five units of credit and is
tentatively scheduled for
Wednesdays, 12 noon to 2:00.
Students selected to go to
Czechoslovakia can register for the
course under the title "Directed
Reading in Comparative Politics:
East Europe" (Political Science
129and 229).
Since the number of
participants is limited, persons
interested in more information
should immediately contact Margie
Young (322-5584) or Paul
Bernstein (ext. 4760 or 848-6496
before 10p.m.).
