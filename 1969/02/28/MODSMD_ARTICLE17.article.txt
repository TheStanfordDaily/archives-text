## Tom Paine 
### ROBIN LAKE 
The Ram's Head production of
Paul Foster's Tom Paine was
previewed Tuesday night to a
capacity crowd in the Nittery.The
success of the evening is due in
large measure to the conviction and
vision of director Bob Walter, who
also designed the set and costumes
and at the last moment had to take
over a leading role.
Walter's use of his imaginative
design proved to be the highlight of
the production. All too rarely have
the Nitery facilities been utilized
with such flair.
Gone are the stifling black
drapes and the depressingly sterile
rows of black chairs. You find your
own place in the fire-proofed hay
(or is it straw?).
The experience produced is one
of environmental participation.
While the audience relationship is
more direct, but less provocativp,
than Marat/Sade, it is not as forced
or as necessary as the demands
made by The Living Theatre (or for
that matter the S.F. Interplayers'
current production of Tom Paine.
Relaxed Atmosphere
The atmosphere is dangerously
relaxed. Every effort is made to
provide the audience with
maximum freedom of
spontaneity—equal rights for the
majority whose "own thing" is
silent observation.
I have little to say about
individual members of the
Company, which has named itself
'Water.' Kevin Hart as Tom Paine
achieves one convicing moment of
interest—in his speech on the
guillotine block. TTie Company is
inexperienced but this hardly
seems to matter since they are all at
the same level. They each play
several roles, the most memorable
being Tom Cushing's Louis XVI,
but the respective merits of
performance do not affect the
more important issues.
Nude Sequence
I must congratulate them all on
their conviction in the nightmarish
nude sequence. The scene is
effectively simple in a laser light.
Each audience member must
decide for himself whether the
beauty of the achievement is valid
per se since I find little to
demonstrate the scene's necessity
as an integral part of the show.
The effect is fascinating in its
lyrical boldness and applaudable in
its accomplishment. It does not
seem tacked on, but neither is it
within context. It remains with me
as wholesomely unreal.
Tom Paine is a good example of
the anti-illusionistic trend: the

spectator is constantly being
reminded that he is watching a
theatrical event, not a
representation of outside reality.
This effect is characteristic of the
entire modern theater, not only of
Off-Off Broadway. This
production demonstrates some of
the many varieties of techniques by
which the quasi-alienation effect
may be accomplished.
Theater Tools
Irony, indirection, self-mockery
and the detachment of the "cool"
approach are tools of a
theatricality which can serve as a
barrier against sentimentality and
involvement.
Deliberate formlessness per se
may make a negative point, but
positive comment through the use
of split-focus is one the most
delicate techniques to achieve
onstage with any measure of
success. Here the show founders. It
is almost impossible to expect an
untrained audience to sustain the
required intensity of concentration
and to exert the necessary mental
effort to grasp several impressions
at once for more than a few
moments at a time.
Foster's script continually calls
for deliberate juttapositions of
facts, words and actions. His
awareness of the difficulty of
comprehension is apparent in his
constant use of repetition.
Tangled Threat
Director Walter has tried hard to
hold onto the threat thru the maze;
but the impression remains that he
and his cast are heading in a
dangerous direction, overwhelmed
by the joy of their own
performances. The director needs
to achieve the impossible feat of
regaining perspective. Tom Paine
was created as a vehicle for Tom
O'Horgan and La Mama.
They took "several months to
understand this highly inventive
play." 'Water' has been rehearsing
solidly for two months and will
continue to discover during the
run. The audience has 2 x h hours.
There is a lot to accomplish in a
single exposure.
The first sign of life is the
ensemble's "Gin, Gin, Gin" and, in
fact, the highlights generally
belong to the ensemble and not to
individuals—which is as it should
be. However, the strength of the
'set pieces' tends to expose the
weaker moments of free
improvisation. It is the latter which
will provide the greatest continuing
challenge to the cast as they
negotiate each audience.

drapes and the depressingly sterile
rows of black chairs. You find your
own place in the fire-proofed hay
(or is it straw?).
The experience produced is one
of environmental participation.
While the audience relationship is
more direct, but less provocativp,
than Marat/Sade, it is not as forced
or as necessary as the demands
made by The Living Theatre (or for
that matter the S.F. Interplayers'
current production of Tom Paine.
Relaxed Atmosphere
The atmosphere is dangerously
relaxed. Every effort is made to
provide the audience with
maximum freedom of
spontaneity—equal rights for the
majority whose "own thing" is
silent observation.
I have little to say about
individual members of the
Company, which has named itself
'Water.' Kevin Hart as Tom Paine
achieves one convicing moment of
interest—in his speech on the
guillotine block. TTie Company is
inexperienced but this hardly
seems to matter since they are all at
the same level. They each play
several roles, the most memorable
being Tom Cushing's Louis XVI,
but the respective merits of
performance do not affect the
more important issues.
Nude Sequence
I must congratulate them all on
their conviction in the nightmarish
nude sequence. The scene is
effectively simple in a laser light.
Each audience member must
decide for himself whether the
beauty of the achievement is valid
per se since I find little to
demonstrate the scene's necessity
as an integral part of the show.
The effect is fascinating in its
lyrical boldness and applaudable in
its accomplishment. It does not
seem tacked on, but neither is it
within context. It remains with me
as wholesomely unreal.
Tom Paine is a good example of
the anti-illusionistic trend: the

spectator is constantly being
reminded that he is watching a
theatrical event, not a
representation of outside reality.
This effect is characteristic of the
entire modern theater, not only of
Off-Off Broadway. This
production demonstrates some of
the many varieties of techniques by
which the quasi-alienation effect
may be accomplished.
Theater Tools
Irony, indirection, self-mockery
and the detachment of the "cool"
approach are tools of a
theatricality which can serve as a
barrier against sentimentality and
involvement.
Deliberate formlessness per se
may make a negative point, but
positive comment through the use
of split-focus is one the most
delicate techniques to achieve
onstage with any measure of
success. Here the show founders. It
is almost impossible to expect an
untrained audience to sustain the
required intensity of concentration
and to exert the necessary mental
effort to grasp several impressions
at once for more than a few
moments at a time.
Foster's script continually calls
for deliberate juttapositions of
facts, words and actions. His
awareness of the difficulty of
comprehension is apparent in his
constant use of repetition.
Tangled Threat
Director Walter has tried hard to
hold onto the threat thru the maze;
but the impression remains that he
and his cast are heading in a
dangerous direction, overwhelmed
by the joy of their own
performances. The director needs
to achieve the impossible feat of
regaining perspective. Tom Paine
was created as a vehicle for Tom
O'Horgan and La Mama.
They took "several months to
understand this highly inventive
play." 'Water' has been rehearsing
solidly for two months and will
continue to discover during the
run. The audience has 2 x h hours.
There is a lot to accomplish in a
single exposure.
The first sign of life is the
ensemble's "Gin, Gin, Gin" and, in
fact, the highlights generally
belong to the ensemble and not to
individuals—which is as it should
be. However, the strength of the
'set pieces' tends to expose the
weaker moments of free
improvisation. It is the latter which
will provide the greatest continuing
challenge to the cast as they
negotiate each audience.
The Ram's Head production of
Paul Foster's Tom Paine was
previewed Tuesday night to a
capacity crowd in the Nittery.The
success of the evening is due in
large measure to the conviction and
vision of director Bob Walter, who
also designed the set and costumes
and at the last moment had to take
over a leading role.
Walter's use of his imaginative
design proved to be the highlight of
the production. All too rarely have
the Nitery facilities been utilized
with such flair.
