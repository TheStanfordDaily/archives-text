THE COMPANY, Stanford's undergraduate drama group, will present
four programs of one-act plays on the evenings of March 2-5; as usual,
the productions will be staged in assorted lounges around campus.
Although the plays are noticeably lighter than the highly-regarded
"Marat-Sade" the group put on in the fall, some of them, such as
Albee's "The American Dream" (directed by Mark Vestrich), go well
beyond comedy.
The other plays include "George Washington Crossing the Dela
ware," a hilarious potpourri of parody by Kenneth Koch (directed by
Bonnie Woodworth); "The Hundred and First," a broad satire by
Kenneth Cameron (directed by Matthew Schneiderman); "Superman,"
by cartoonist-playwright Jules Feiffer (directed by Rich Storm); and
two serious short plays by Thornton Wilder, "Hast Thou Considered
my Servant Job" and "Mozart and the Grey Steward" (directed by Bill
Ganz).
The Company is composed primarily of non-drama majors, who act,
direct, and take care of all aspects of production. Admission is always
free. This quarter's one-acts will be presented in various groupings in
the following places:
2—Toyon Lounge, 8:00 p.m.
Monday—March 3—Flo Mo, Gavilan Lounge, 9:30 p.m.
Tuesday—March 4—Alpha Sig fraternity, the new cluster, 9:30 p.m.
Wednesday—March s—Branner dining hall, 9:30 p.m.

A different kind of anti-war film will be shown tonight."THE
BURMESE HARP," directed by Kon Ichikawa, will be presented twice
at 7:30 and 10:00 p.m. in Cubberley Auditorium.
It is the story of a company of Japanese soldiers in Burma who
find that only the magic of song makes the reality of defeat toler
able.
One soldier pledges to sacrifice the return to his homeland to
become a Buddhist monk. He vows to stay beind in Burma to buy
his dead countrymen.
The film analyzes political hostilities among men as it provides
insight into Buddhist thought and character.
Admission is 75c for students and $1 for the general public.

The appointment of a student adviser and the establishment of
special rates for student memberships are part of a new effort to
encourage Stanford students to join the COMMITTEE FOR ART
AT STANFORD. An organization which unites campus and
community in supporting the Museum and Art Department at
Stanford, the Committee for Art purchases works of art for the
Museum, underwrites the Wednesday Evening Art Lecture Series,
and runs the new Gallery Bookshop in the Art Gallery.
Members receive a monthly calendar of Bay Area art activities
and a quarterly Newsletter. They are invited to all lectures, gallery
talks, receptions, and previews sponsored by the Committee for Art.
They are also entitled to a ten percent discount on Bookshop
purchases.
W. Chandler Kirwin, a graduate student in Art History, has
recently agreed to serve as an adviser to the Committee for Art. He
consults with chairman Mrs. Donald Kennedy and the board of
governors on ways to involve students more actively in the
Committee's activities. In one of its first moves in the campaign,
which is also part of a concerted drive to double membership, the
board has established an annual student rate of $7.50, half of the
regular membership fee.
As a bonus for joining the Committee for Art now, the new
member will receive his choice of a signed poster by faculty artists
Keith Boyle, Frank Lohdell, or Nathan Oliveira.
Students seeking additional information about the Committee for
Art may inquire at the Gallery Bookshop or at the Museum.
Membership applications are also available in both places.

The "student" union will be liberated again this Friday night
beginning at 10 p.m. Liberated means FREE. FREE means you
don't pay. FREE food, FREE drink, and FREE music. Bring friends,
flutes, bongos, food to share, and other nice things to improve your
enjoyment. Get there before 10, don't miss the groovy time.
Last Friday night about 200 kids liberated the union from 10 to
midnight. Dancing, fun, and free food were the order of the night.
These students were taking action to protest the autocratic elitist,
undemocratic, stupid decision to close the union at 10 every night.
The union must be responsive to student needs. The people's needs
must take priority over bureaucratic decisions. In view of the union's
sanctions, we feel that we must politely request that the union be
changed.
The union should be run by the students who use it and by the
workers who work there. This anti-bureacratic system could improve
the union immensely. The employees could have higher wages, the
times would be better, and perhaps the union could even become a
neat place. A 50 cent lunch plate would be a good idea, would be
economically feasible, and would be something useful to the people
who are not rich.
