# SEE Considered By SEC, Senate
## 
### 
An appraisal of the existing general
studies program and of changes proposed
by the SES was the focus of the
yesterday's initial session of the student
Education Council and the faculty
Academic Senate.
The discussions dealt with the
philosophy and purpose of general
studies and more specifically, with
University history and writing
requirements.
The meeting marked the first joint
faculty and student discussion of
curriculum planning in Stanford's
history.
A series of students and faculty
members presented their views on aspects
of University studies. Prepared
presentations were followed by open
discussions.
According to Robert Walker,
Chairman of the General Studies
Committee "an introduction to the
history, ideas, and great works of the

world" should be embodied in a good
general education.
Walker also stated that " the function
of the liberal education is to give the
student at least an understanding of what
goes on in the realm of knowledge."
This educational attainment, he
added, is "too important to leave to
chance."
Norton Batkin, a senior in philosophy,
contended that since "education is a
life-long, self-evaluating process," the
student should "largely direct it
himself."
"The University should serve as a
means of guiding education," instead of
confining it "within a strict framework."
Junior Jim Spickard continued by
stating that the "goal of a liberal
education should be to free men's
minds."
Requirements, Spickard continued
are "academically binding," and
although there is liberty in the content of
coursework, students are "bound to the
structure."
"The great drawback of the present
University system," stated physics
professor Walter Meyerhof, "is that it
discourages making mistakes," and
"inhibits free experimentation."
Paul Kocher was sketpical of the
background of incoming freshmen,
stating that most of them are "badly
slighted in history and English" during
their high school training.
Kocher admitted that although the
existing general studies may need
improving, students should initially be
given a "common ground of education."
Junior David Mannheimer believed
that education "should not be a great
accumulation of facts .. . but the
awakening of minds to the possibilities of
learning."
In discussing the proposal that
requirements should include "a one
semester or two-quarter writing course,"
lan Watt, chairman of the English
Department stated that "the department
has proposed that there be established a
requirement in expository writing,"
which exerts "a great deal of endless
pressure in order to change people's
writing habits."
Watt continued that "good writing
should be considered mandatory" not
only by the English department but in
the coursework of all departments.
Senior Jeff Kane, however, contended
that for some students, training in other
forms of communication is "more
relevant to their specific needs," and that
instead of requiring a writing course,
students should be able to choose the
study of other forms of communication
such as public speaking.
Establishing an institute for the
teaching of written communication was
the proposal of assistant speech professor
Arthur Hastings in which "formats could
be arranged to suit individual needs."
Coursework in the institute would not be
required but available to all grade levels.
Concerning the next proposal, that a
one-semester or two-quarter history
course be required, advocate David
Potter, professor of history, stated that
students "must have an understanding of
the past and how the past gives
perspective to the circumstances of
today."
Paul Seaver, director of the Western
Civ. program enumerated the desire of his
staff to "revise the Civ. curriculum to
offer a number of specialized courses
with limited enrollment" to better
facilitate discussions.
