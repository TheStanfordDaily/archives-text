# I-Center Welcomes Japanese, Cultural Exchange Underway
## 
### 
The partially cloudy skies were
showing signs of finally clearing
up. Tired students were saunter
ing back to their dorms from their
last class, while others were scur
rying into UGLY to finish that
two-hour reserved reading before
dinner.

Meanwhile the International
Center was buzzing with excite
ment. Wednesday afternoon, it
was the scene of an Orientation
Tea for the sixteen Japanese ex
change students from Keio Uni
versity in Tokyo. In the midst of
broken English, sheet cake, and
Japanese tea, Keio Committee
members and curious Stanford
students met the visitors and their
host families.
The seven men and nine girls of
the Japanese group arrived in the
United States Sunday afternoon
for their approximately two and a
half month stay in America.
For the remainder of the quar
ter, the students will live with
host families in Portola Valley,
and at the beginning of spring
quarter, the students will move on
campus into dorms and frater
nities that can accommodate
them.
During their stay with their
host families, Keio students will

visit various places in San Fran
cisco and the Bay Area. Their
itinerary next week will take them
on an overnight trip to Yosemite
Natioanl Park, to which all Stan
ford students are invited. Informa
tion for the trip, on March 4 and
5, may be obtained from the
chairman of the host families,
Mrs. Ernest Silver at 851-0651.
The Japanese students will tour
Los Angeles during spring break
and return to Stanford for about
the first six weeks of spring quar
ter to experience life on campus.
At this time they will be offered a
chance to better acquaint them
selves with Stanford and exchange
cultures with its students.
The Keio group consists of
three sophomores, ten juniors,
and three seniors. Besides the five
English literature majors and five
economics majors, there are stu
dents majoring in European his
tory, oriental history, sociology,
law, political science, and library
and information science.
