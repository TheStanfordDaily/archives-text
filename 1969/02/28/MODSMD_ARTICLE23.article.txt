# Impossible Dream?
## Bruins Invade Tonight 
### FRED MANN 
Competitive athletics have held
an honored place in hearts of
Americans for generations.
People have been crowding
arenas, and stadiums to watch
sports events for well over a
century. Teams fight other teams,
and individuals challenge other
individuals in numerous sports
throughout the world. But in the
United States, most agree that the
public interest is due mainly to the
near equality of competitive skill.
On any given day, one team can
beat any other team, and the
chance of upset is always there.
Well, almost always.
The new Maples Pavilion will be
filled for the first time, tonight.
8,000 fans will be cheering on two
university basketball teams. But
this time, few will be present with
the hope of upset in mind.
The top team in college
basketball, the UCLA Bruins will
play the Pac-B's last place team, the
Stanford Indians. Barring a
miracle, UCLA will record win
number 11 in the conference, 23
on the season, and 43 in a row.
This is no reflexion on the
Indian club. No one all year has
been able to beat the Westwooders,
and the only way anyone will is
with a great deal of luck, great
offensive play, and successful ball
control tactics.
In looking at the last two
outings of the Tribe, one could
safely say that Coach Howie
Dallmar's troops don't stand much
of a chance.
Their luck is perhaps the worst
of any group since the people of
California got Ronald Reagan. The
star-crossed team has dropped
eight games in whcih they were
only one point away from their
opponents in the last minute.
Against Washington State, the
Cards missed layups and gave the
ball away four times during the last
few minutes. With the ball went the
game. They have also had trouble
with their shooting of late,
dropping a game to Washington in
which they scored only 45 points.

The odds are great, but the
Indians will do their best. As Coach
Dallmar has said so many times
during the long season, the breaks
may not fall the right way, but the
team never gives up.
Mai McElwain has come back
from ankle problems at the start of
the season to be a consistant
performer. Mai hit 19 points
Monday night against the Huskies.
Don Griffin has of course been
outstanding, and is certain for an
all-league berth. To correct a Daily
story on Wednesday, Griff needs
only 49 more points to reach the
540 mark set by Art Harris last
year. He must average over 16 a
game to become the single-season
record holder.
If he hits over 25 in the final trio
ol contests, he could surpass the
great Hank Luisetti for fourth on
the All-time list.
Sophomores Mike Michel and
Dennis O'Neill have made it on the
varsity. Averaging 7.6 and 7.1
respectively, the two solid players
have been the only pleasant
surprises during the year.

Bill Palmer will face a job in the
game tonight that much bigger men
could not handle. He must deny
Lew Alcindor the middle, and
attempt to grab a few rebounds. At
6-9, he is the smallest pivot man in
the league, but the most dedicated,
and may make UCLA shoot from
outside (which unfortunately
would not hamper UCLA).
After the Bruins leave, the Tribe
will be faced with what will
probably be one of the best games
of the year, against USC.
Victorious down south,
Stanford will be hard pressed to
repeat their performance. Big Ron
Taylor who missed the game in LA
will be ready, and will lead the
Trojans in the 2:00 p.m. game
tomorrow.
SC is 5-5 in the league, in fourth
place, and is one of the most
unpredictable teams in the nation.
In the big one tonight, it will be
the kid against the giant once again.
And if the slingshot is loaded with
anything but a hydrogen bomb, the
giant will remain standing.

make a good showing tonight against mighty UCLA.
