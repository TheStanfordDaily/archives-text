# Ruggers After Axe

### DAVE NOLAND 
Stanford's rugby team got off to a flying start in the annual battle for
the Big Scrum Axe with Cal. The Tribe rolled up an 18-8 win over the
Bears last weekend to take a commanding lead after the first match of
the two-match series.
The Big Scrum Axe, now held by Stanford, goes to the team with the
highest point total for the two games. The deciding contest will be
tomorrow at Berkeley at 1:00 p.m.
The Bears were up for the first match, and came out strongly with an
aggressive early rush. However, after about five minutes, Stanford center
three-quarters Jim Kaufmann broke through for a long run to Cal's five
yard-line. The Bears controlled the ensuing scrum, but Dick Ragsdale
fielded Brian Forbes' kick out of the end zone and lofted a perfect
dropkick over the heads of the amazed Bears for three points.
The Tribe maintained its momentum, and was never really
challenged. After about fifteen minutes, scrum half Tom Pulliam
scooped up a loose ball and stutter-stepped over for a try between the
posts. Leon Hartvickson had set up the score with a towering kick and
jarring tackle of the Bear attempting to field it.
Kaufmann deflated Cal again late in the first half. The Bears had a
good overlapping sweep going, but the speedy sophomore swiped a pass
and broke through. Only a superhuman effort by Forbes prevented him
from going all the way.
Kaufmann and wing Kip Oxman proved to be quite a dynamic duo,
several times clicking for passes that could have been tries but for
Kaufmann's butterfingers.
A 35-yard try penalty kick by Forbes cut the margin to 8-3 at the
half.
Stanford kept the pressure on in the second period. Pat "Red
Menace" Preston grabbed a loose ball near the Cal five and
straight-armed a couple of Bears down out of sight into the turf en route
to the goalline. This reporter fails to see how any mortal could prevent
Preston from getting five yards if he really wanted to. Hartvickson
botted a windy conversion to make it 13-3.
Cal climbed to within five points with a converted try, but Stanford
immediately equalized when the super-keyed Preston blocked a Cal kick
on the goal line and Jack Alustiza fell on it in the end zone.
That final Stanford try made no difference in the match, but it
doubled the Tribe's cushion for tomorrow to a comfortable 10 points.
