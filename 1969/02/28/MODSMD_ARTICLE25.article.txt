# Red-White Meet Starts Track Year
## 
### BROOK THOMAS 
The sound of spiked shoes
slushing over a water-logged
track marks the start of the
annual intra-squad meet today
at 3:00 p.m. at Angell Field.
Payton Jordan's trackmen will
be sharpening up for their
season opener against Fresno
State and Occidental next Sat
urday.
Awaiting their first varsity
competition are many mem
bers of last year's undefeated
frosh team, who will form the
team's nucleus along with
NCAA placers and school
record holders Greg Brock, in
the distances, Pete Boyce, in
the high jump, and Tom Colby,
in the javelin. But while a few
standouts can carry the Tribe
to a high finish in end of the
year invitationals, Jordan looks
for consistent performances to
provide the depth required of a
strong dual meet team.
Leaping to the forefront in

the jumps are two football iron
men, Jim Kaufman and Tom
Massey. These two can cover
four events between them, so if
they round into shape quickly
they could greatly alleviate the
problem of depth. Another
football recruit, George Beuh
ler, will handle the weights,
along with transfer Steve Davis.
Near 60-foot shot putter T.C.
Jones waits out the opening of
the season on an eligibility
ruling.
But as with any young
team, the Indians remain a
team of question marks. Suc
cess depends on newcomers
making a rapid adjustment to
the tough Pac-8 competition
and on a few individuals
coming through with surprise
performances. The sprints are a
case in point. With thirty-seven
points at stake, someone has to
emerge a consistent winner for
Stanford to end the season
with pluses in the win column.
The opportunities begin today.


BOUNDING BO YCE-Stanford's outstanding track team opens competition
today in the Red and White intersquad meet. One of the Tribe's prime hopes
this year is high jumper and co-captain Peter Bovce.
