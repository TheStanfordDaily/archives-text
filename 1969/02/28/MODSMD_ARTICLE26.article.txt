# Tennis Quintet Advances In Norcal Intercollegiates
## 
### 
The Stanford varsity tennis squad is currently in
their first big fight of the year, the Northern
California Intel collegiates at San Jose. Thus far,
through two rounds, five of the Tribe's top six men
have been victorious.
In fact, Stanford has been the winner in 13 of
their first 14 matches.
Coach Dick Gould's Indians are one of four
highly-touted teams battling for the championship.
Despite heavy rains, the Stanford squad squeezed in
enough practices between showers to go to the
tournament in good condition.
The Tribe's singles entries, Dean Schlobohm.
John Spiegel, Stan Pasarell, Chuch Alloo, and Bill
Atkins all won their early matches. Only Paul
Marienthal lost, falling in the second round. He lost
to Larry Parker of Cal, 6-3, 6-1.
Pasarell easily took a first round match from
Bryn Cotton of Sacramento State, 6-1, 6-0. Alloo
won his second round competition 6-1, 6-2, and
Atkins won his, 7-5, 6-1. Both beat Santa Clara
players.
Schlobohm took the measure of Rich Enos of Cal

State Hayward, 6-0, 6-2. Spiegal won his match by
default.
The four top men have waged a real battle for the
No. 1 spot. Schlobohm, the team's No. 2 man for
the past two years, is currently atop the ladder,
followed by last season's No. 1 man, John Spiegel.
Marienthal and Pasarell, both sophomores, could
move up at any time. Pa >arell, potentially one of the
finest players in the country, has been hampered by
a bad muscle pull in his lower back sustained in
January and is still far from top form.
Fresno State, California, San Jose State and
Stanford should engage in a real dogfight for the
Norcal title. The host Spartans have six ranked
players while Fresno State won the NCAA's College
Division last season. Cal has been bolstered by four
sophomores up from last year's frosh team, which
was the top freshmen team in the country.
After the Intercollegiates, the tennis men return
home to face always tough Michigan on Tuesday.
The Wolverines are heavy favorites to capture the
Big Ten title, and are ranked as one of the top squads
in the country.
