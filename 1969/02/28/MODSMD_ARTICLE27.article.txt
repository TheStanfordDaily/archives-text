# Waterlogged Nine Play

### DAN BERNSTEIN 
The previously deceased
Stanford bats performed a major
medical miracle yesterday
afternoon, as the Indians, playing
in the rain-soaked Sunken
Diamond exceeded their total run
output for the last three games in

just seven innings, en route to
pulverizing the San Jose State
Spartans 10-6.
The big story had to be a six-run
third inning which saw the
Stanford sluggers shake off a 4-1
deficit and take a 7-4 lead which
they never relinquished.
With one out in the third, Russ
Tweet singled, went to third on
Mark Marquess' double, and they
both scored on Bobby Boone's
base-hit to left. Ron Shotts and
Hank Snider followed with two
more singles, and after a walk to
Jack Hodges and another hit by
Mike Ammirato, Bob Edie stroked
a triple, sending the last of the six
runs across the plate.
At any rate, the action cooled
considerably after that inning, as a
record number of seven fans and a
handful of major league scouts
hoped that the game would be
called. But it was played in its
entirety, and before it was over the
Stanford pitching, which started
off on the wrong clete, emerged as
another highlight of the game.
Bob Moore started the contest,

and after the first two innings, in
which he was touched for four
runs, he began to throw strikes and
finished with six strikeouts, while
yielding five runs on three hits. Bob
Boone came on in the sixth and
gave up only one run on four hits,
while striking out four. The only
Spartan hitter to damage the
Indian pitching was Igor Papovec,
who went four for five and drove in
half of the San Jose runs.
However his prolific hitting was
matched by some unprolific
pitching by Spartan starter and
loser Sturgess Carlson. Carlson
hurled his way through the
disastrous third inning before he
was finally yanked showing a
decided lack of depth in the San
Jose pitching staff.
It was a hard earned and
well-deserved win for the Indians,
who had been swinging their bats
like feathers for the last three
games. With a 3-1 mark and most of
the rainy season behind them, the
stage is set for what should be an
exciting Pacific-8 season beginning
in Spring quarter.
