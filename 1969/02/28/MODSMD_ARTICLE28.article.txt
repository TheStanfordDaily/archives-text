# Big Time Hockey
## 
### 
The Stanford ice hockey team
will try to improve upon its 3-3
record Tuesday night, as the
puckmen take on Menlo College.
This will be the first intercollegiate
hockey game on the West Coast in
over 20 years. The last one
occurred before World War 11,
when University of California
reigned supreme among Bay Area
ice powers.
The historic encounter will
transpire at the Belmont Iceland.
