# Rough It
## 
### 
The Stanford Department of
Athletics encourages all students to
play pedestrian tonight. Since the
parking lots adjacent to Maples
Pavilion are usually full when the
basketball crowd numbers a
piddling 4500, and since the
inclement weather has pared off
some of the available parking
spaces, there will be one hell of a
tie-up if all good fans drive tonight.
