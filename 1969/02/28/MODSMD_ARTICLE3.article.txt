Compiled From The Associated Press
Governor Reagan moved no closer to a
victory in his struggle against campus
disorders yesterday. Rioting continued at
Berkeley, striking teachers have not
returned to work at San Francisco State
and the Governor's Conference rejected
his resolution.
A day-long series of scuffles between
police and hit-run dissidents kept the
rainy University of California campus in
turmoil Thursday.
About 50 windows were broken and

12 persons arrested, including Ysidro
Macias—who was carried away
unconscious—and Manuel Delgado and
Fernando Garcia.
The three are leaders of the Third
World Liberation Front, a minority
coalition that demands establishment of
an automonous Third World College
under its control.
Close II Down
Earlier, Macias had declared, "We're
going to close it down whether it be by

striking peacefully or by talking or
whether we have to burn thes-o-b down.
The Third World will no longer disavow
any violence."
He was in satisfactory condition with
head wounds. Newsmen at the scene said
he was hit by a policeman's club while
resisting arrest.
Those arrested included one girl,
Lanada Means, 22, head of the campus
American-Indian group. She was charged
with assaulting an officer.
Arrests Total 145
The arrests brought to 145 the
number taken into custody since the
strike began Jan. 26.
Striking teachers at San Francisco
State College, after meeting seven hours
Thursday, were deadlocked on whether
to return to their classrooms because of
the "ambiguity of the situation."
After its closed door meeting, The
American Federation of Teachers set up a
study committee to analyze a proposed
agreement, see if the college will honor it
and whether state college trustees will
ratify it.
Report To Be Made
A report will be made to AFT
memvers at a Sunday night meeting. In
the meantime, teachers will stay off their
jobs for the remainder of this week.
