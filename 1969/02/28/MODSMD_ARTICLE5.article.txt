# Drama Prof Rebillot Fired For 'Disruptive' Influence
## 
### GAIL ANDERSON 
Paul Rebillot, Assistant Prof, of Speech and
Drama, has been dismissed from his position,
effective the end of next quarter.
The decision by Michael Barry, newly
recommended as head of the department, not to
rehire Rebillot has created a stir of controversy
among Speech and Drama students and faculty.
Students petitioned for Barry to be made
director of the department and most support him
in that position. But many also are loyal to
Rebillot as a teacher and friend and have expressed
apprehension as to what Barry's move may mean.
A large number of them, including some who
support Barry's decision, have referred to Rebillot
as "the most exciting teacher at Stanford."
Rebillot, a University of Detroit graduate with
a Master's degree from the University of Michigan,
has acted and directed in theatres across the
country, including one which he built and ran in
Massachusetts. He worked with the Actors'
Workshop in San Francisco for a number of years
and taught at SF State, where he directed the
nationally acclaimed production of Euripides'
Bacchae for five years before coming to Stanford
last fall.
Barry, who is working towards building a strong
department, feels Rebillot's influence is a
"disruptive and destructive" one which could
hinder efforts in that direction. Rebillot's
supporters fear a clamp-down on diversity and on
the kind of self-determined education Rebillot
advocates. Several have written letters and talked
to Barry, objecting to his decision.
Balance Important
Barry's supporters emphasize the importance
of first reaching a balance between differentstyles
of acting and teaching rather than allowing one
view to dominate the department. Rebillot
presently teaches acting to all first-year MFA
candidates and most undergraduates.
Many also feel that since Rebillot was planning
to leave in 1970 anyway, it is wiser to support
Barry, who will be leading the department for a
number of years to come.
The issues raised by students and faculty are

diverse and complex, and mainly of departmental
rather than University-wide interest. Drama
students and faculty held a meeting last week in
which the issues were discussed. But many
students feel the heart of the controversy lies, not
merely in a question of priorities, but also in a
conflict of approaches which directly concerns the
state of the University.
"What is important," says one graduate
student, "is that Paul stands for
self-determination, and a dismissal of the man is a
rejection of the concept."
Dynamism And Commitment
An undergraduate disagrees: "The point is that
the more traditional approaches to drama in this
department are not yet strong enough to hold their
own against Paul's kind of dynamism and
commitment. We just aren't ready for him."
The root of these conflicts seems to lie at least
as much in Rebillot himself as in the intricacies of
administration.
The Daily attempted to discover something of
the man behind the controversy, his ideas on
theatre and on education in an interview with him.
Rebillot describes his primary focus in teaching
as "a synthesis of as many diverse elements in the
arts as possible."
"The theatre in the past century," he says, "has
become a kind of toy of this society, rather than a
necessary element of it. Although it began to
achieve significance in the thirties, that movement
almost inevitably fell apart." This is true because
"every society must provide for its people the
chance to walk, to talk, to dance and to sing; and
when dancing and singing come to be considered
'entertainment,' then the theatre becomes a toy.
"We are now seeing many movement
throughout the country to re-establish the theatre
as a way of life rather than a frill. McLuhan s idea
of the multi-media communication that our
society is growing into calls for image forms of
expression—which is what the theatre is.
'Encounter theatre' is important because it is
creating a new language to replace the language of
the industrial age, a language by which people
relate on a theatrical level.

"Movies and tapes may replace books as
methods of storing knowledge, but the word—the
spoken word of communication—will remain, not
dying but being reborn into a new mode of
communication."
If the theatre fails to realize this trend, he says,
"it will remain a toy—and a nation must discard its
toys as it grows up." The progress of society
presents to the theatre an imperative: grown and
change, or die and be forgotten.
A sign that the theatre is moving in a positive
direction is the fact that the important theatre of
today is "taking place in the streets"—whether
literally, in the radical companies of New York and
San Francisco, or figuratively, in the
environmental theatre of plays like Tom Paine.
The emphasis in this new theatre is on encounter
and communication: an expression by one group
pf people to another.
Ancient Mythical Tradition
In his own work, Rebillot is striving toward this
kind of theatre. He is presently directing Yeats'
Cuchulain cycle (opening March 12)— plays based
on an ancient mythical tradition which become
located in the immediate moment by their
presentation of that tradition. Rebillot explains
his ideas of theatre and society in terms of these
plays.
"Theatre should hold on to the traditions of the
past if they are used to communicate the message
of the future. But if we begin to think that the old
traditions hold all the answers, we need only to
look to history for a refutation. What we must do
is use what is and was in order to get to what is
becoming.
"Change is all we have."
Baile's Strand, one of the Cuchulain plays,
"concerns a king who, in trying to solidify Ireland,
creates a militaristic society that causes a man to
kill his own son. Only an immature society can
cause that.
"As every muth is the same, the myth of the
Cuchulain cycle becomes the myth of our society.
The performance of that myth passes through the
stages of life and into t.hr death of man. That is the
stage our society is in now—the death of a mvth.

But in that dath there is always a new myth being
born. People seeing the performance should then
be able to look at the world and see not only the
facts but the myth behind the facts, and work to
build from its positive aspects a new myth to stop
these destructive elements caused by man's lack of
association with himself and his fellow man.
Education Inseparable
Rebillot's ideas about education are inseparable
from his concepts of the theatre.
"Education, theatre, life are not separate
categories," he emphasizes. "You live what you
speak, what you are, what you study, what you
dream at night. If you divide yourself into
categories, they begin to conflict and to destroy
each othei —and you react to that inner
destruction by destroying the people around
you."
"Since our present society is in desperate fear
of destroying itself—because it has not only the
power but the ambition—it is only in the positive,
constructive elements I see in young people that
there is hope. And since this world will be, must be
their world, the element of self-determination in
building their lives must start almost from the
moment of birth—and certainly from the moment
they enter the discipline of the university.
"A student should not be in college to do time
for a crime he didn't commit.
Emphasis on Students
"The emphasis in the university must be to look
to the students, to see what they want—it's their
life. But it seems that most faculty members don't
want students to lead their own lives. And students
have reinforced this way of thinking by being
passive. They have the feeling that the faculty will
take care of their lives for them—prescribe and
define what they must do in order to 'get an
education.' The point is that the faculty will 'take
care of you' —anyone will if you give them the
power. But that power will be used not for you but
for themselves.
"There is no reason why faculty and students
can't find a new way of relation to each other—on
a personal and human level."
One of the problems here seems to be the

faculty's restrictions on what academic or artistic
"discipline" should be.
"Self-determination," says Rebillot, "means
wanting to be disciplined: for discipline is
something you desire in order to be fully able to
communicate."
The necessity for constant re-creation, both in
the theatre and in education, is encapsulated by
Rebillot in a story he tells about a Japanese flower
arranger who was a guest on a radio program he
directed in Japan.
The woman had achieved one of the highest
degrees of advancement in flower arranging. One
member of the panel on the show asked her, "Why
have you spent so many years studying in order to
create a floral arrangement, when flowers die so
quickly?"
She replied, "That's why."

Baile's Strand, one of the Cuchulain plays,
"concerns a king who, in trying to solidify Ireland,
creates a militaristic society that causes a man to
kill his own son. Only an immature society can
cause that.
"As every muth is the same, the myth of the
Cuchulain cycle becomes the myth of our society.
The performance of that myth passes through the
stages of life and into t.hr death of man. That is the
stage our society is in now—the death of a mvth.

But in that dath there is always a new myth being
born. People seeing the performance should then
be able to look at the world and see not only the
facts but the myth behind the facts, and work to
build from its positive aspects a new myth to stop
these destructive elements caused by man's lack of
association with himself and his fellow man.
Education Inseparable
Rebillot's ideas about education are inseparable
from his concepts of the theatre.
"Education, theatre, life are not separate
categories," he emphasizes. "You live what you
speak, what you are, what you study, what you
dream at night. If you divide yourself into
categories, they begin to conflict and to destroy
each othei —and you react to that inner
destruction by destroying the people around
you."
"Since our present society is in desperate fear
of destroying itself—because it has not only the
power but the ambition—it is only in the positive,
constructive elements I see in young people that
there is hope. And since this world will be, must be
their world, the element of self-determination in
building their lives must start almost from the
moment of birth—and certainly from the moment
they enter the discipline of the university.
"A student should not be in college to do time
for a crime he didn't commit.
Emphasis on Students
"The emphasis in the university must be to look
to the students, to see what they want—it's their
life. But it seems that most faculty members don't
want students to lead their own lives. And students
have reinforced this way of thinking by being
passive. They have the feeling that the faculty will
take care of their lives for them—prescribe and
define what they must do in order to 'get an
education.' The point is that the faculty will 'take
care of you' —anyone will if you give them the
power. But that power will be used not for you but
for themselves.
"There is no reason why faculty and students
can't find a new way of relation to each other—on
a personal and human level."
One of the problems here seems to be the

faculty's restrictions on what academic or artistic
"discipline" should be.
"Self-determination," says Rebillot, "means
wanting to be disciplined: for discipline is
something you desire in order to be fully able to
communicate."
The necessity for constant re-creation, both in
the theatre and in education, is encapsulated by
Rebillot in a story he tells about a Japanese flower
arranger who was a guest on a radio program he
directed in Japan.
The woman had achieved one of the highest
degrees of advancement in flower arranging. One
member of the panel on the show asked her, "Why
have you spent so many years studying in order to
create a floral arrangement, when flowers die so
quickly?"
She replied, "That's why."

FIRED-Visiting Assistant Professor of Specch and
Drama Paul Rchillot has been fired bccause he was a
"disruptive" influence.
Paul Rebillot, Assistant Prof, of Speech and
Drama, has been dismissed from his position,
effective the end of next quarter.
The decision by Michael Barry, newly
recommended as head of the department, not to
rehire Rebillot has created a stir of controversy
among Speech and Drama students and faculty.
Students petitioned for Barry to be made
director of the department and most support him
in that position. But many also are loyal to
Rebillot as a teacher and friend and have expressed
apprehension as to what Barry's move may mean.
A large number of them, including some who
support Barry's decision, have referred to Rebillot
as "the most exciting teacher at Stanford."
Rebillot, a University of Detroit graduate with
a Master's degree from the University of Michigan,
has acted and directed in theatres across the
country, including one which he built and ran in
Massachusetts. He worked with the Actors'
Workshop in San Francisco for a number of years
and taught at SF State, where he directed the
nationally acclaimed production of Euripides'
Bacchae for five years before coming to Stanford
last fall.
Barry, who is working towards building a strong
department, feels Rebillot's influence is a
"disruptive and destructive" one which could
hinder efforts in that direction. Rebillot's
supporters fear a clamp-down on diversity and on
the kind of self-determined education Rebillot
advocates. Several have written letters and talked
to Barry, objecting to his decision.
Balance Important
Barry's supporters emphasize the importance
of first reaching a balance between differentstyles
of acting and teaching rather than allowing one
view to dominate the department. Rebillot
presently teaches acting to all first-year MFA
candidates and most undergraduates.
Many also feel that since Rebillot was planning
to leave in 1970 anyway, it is wiser to support
Barry, who will be leading the department for a
number of years to come.
The issues raised by students and faculty are

diverse and complex, and mainly of departmental
rather than University-wide interest. Drama
students and faculty held a meeting last week in
which the issues were discussed. But many
students feel the heart of the controversy lies, not
merely in a question of priorities, but also in a
conflict of approaches which directly concerns the
state of the University.
"What is important," says one graduate
student, "is that Paul stands for
self-determination, and a dismissal of the man is a
rejection of the concept."
Dynamism And Commitment
An undergraduate disagrees: "The point is that
the more traditional approaches to drama in this
department are not yet strong enough to hold their
own against Paul's kind of dynamism and
commitment. We just aren't ready for him."
The root of these conflicts seems to lie at least
as much in Rebillot himself as in the intricacies of
administration.
The Daily attempted to discover something of
the man behind the controversy, his ideas on
theatre and on education in an interview with him.
Rebillot describes his primary focus in teaching
as "a synthesis of as many diverse elements in the
arts as possible."
"The theatre in the past century," he says, "has
become a kind of toy of this society, rather than a
necessary element of it. Although it began to
achieve significance in the thirties, that movement
almost inevitably fell apart." This is true because
"every society must provide for its people the
chance to walk, to talk, to dance and to sing; and
when dancing and singing come to be considered
'entertainment,' then the theatre becomes a toy.
"We are now seeing many movement
throughout the country to re-establish the theatre
as a way of life rather than a frill. McLuhan s idea
of the multi-media communication that our
society is growing into calls for image forms of
expression—which is what the theatre is.
'Encounter theatre' is important because it is
creating a new language to replace the language of
the industrial age, a language by which people
relate on a theatrical level.

"Movies and tapes may replace books as
methods of storing knowledge, but the word—the
spoken word of communication—will remain, not
dying but being reborn into a new mode of
communication."
If the theatre fails to realize this trend, he says,
"it will remain a toy—and a nation must discard its
toys as it grows up." The progress of society
presents to the theatre an imperative: grown and
change, or die and be forgotten.
A sign that the theatre is moving in a positive
direction is the fact that the important theatre of
today is "taking place in the streets"—whether
literally, in the radical companies of New York and
San Francisco, or figuratively, in the
environmental theatre of plays like Tom Paine.
The emphasis in this new theatre is on encounter
and communication: an expression by one group
pf people to another.
Ancient Mythical Tradition
In his own work, Rebillot is striving toward this
kind of theatre. He is presently directing Yeats'
Cuchulain cycle (opening March 12)— plays based
on an ancient mythical tradition which become
located in the immediate moment by their
presentation of that tradition. Rebillot explains
his ideas of theatre and society in terms of these
plays.
"Theatre should hold on to the traditions of the
past if they are used to communicate the message
of the future. But if we begin to think that the old
traditions hold all the answers, we need only to
look to history for a refutation. What we must do
is use what is and was in order to get to what is
becoming.
"Change is all we have."
Baile's Strand, one of the Cuchulain plays,
"concerns a king who, in trying to solidify Ireland,
creates a militaristic society that causes a man to
kill his own son. Only an immature society can
cause that.
"As every muth is the same, the myth of the
Cuchulain cycle becomes the myth of our society.
The performance of that myth passes through the
stages of life and into t.hr death of man. That is the

students and faculty held a meeting last week in
which the issues were discussed. But many
students feel the heart of the controversy lies, not
merely in a question of priorities, but also in a
conflict of approaches which directly concerns the
state of the University.
"What is important," says one graduate
student, "is that Paul stands for
self-determination, and a dismissal of the man is a
rejection of the concept."
Dynamism And Commitment
An undergraduate disagrees: "The point is that
the more traditional approaches to drama in this
department are not yet strong enough to hold their
own against Paul's kind of dynamism and
commitment. We just aren't ready for him."
The root of these conflicts seems to lie at least
as much in Rebillot himself as in the intricacies of
administration.
The Daily attempted to discover something of
the man behind the controversy, his ideas on
theatre and on education in an interview with him.
Rebillot describes his primary focus in teaching
as "a synthesis of as many diverse elements in the
arts as possible."
"The theatre in the past century," he says, "has
become a kind of toy of this society, rather than a
necessary element of it. Although it began to
achieve significance in the thirties, that movement
almost inevitably fell apart." This is true because
"every society must provide for its people the
chance to walk, to talk, to dance and to sing; and
when dancing and singing come to be considered
'entertainment,' then the theatre becomes a toy.
"We are now seeing many movement
throughout the country to re-establish the theatre
as a way of life rather than a frill. McLuhan s idea
of the multi-media communication that our
society is growing into calls for image forms of
expression—which is what the theatre is.
'Encounter theatre' is important because it is
creating a new language to replace the language of
the industrial age, a language by which people
relate on a theatrical level.

"Movies and tapes may replace books as
methods of storing knowledge, but the word—the
spoken word of communication—will remain, not
dying but being reborn into a new mode of
communication."
If the theatre fails to realize this trend, he says,
"it will remain a toy—and a nation must discard its
toys as it grows up." The progress of society
presents to the theatre an imperative: grown and
change, or die and be forgotten.
A sign that the theatre is moving in a positive
direction is the fact that the important theatre of
today is "taking place in the streets"—whether
literally, in the radical companies of New York and
San Francisco, or figuratively, in the
environmental theatre of plays like Tom Paine.
The emphasis in this new theatre is on encounter
and communication: an expression by one group
pf people to another.
Ancient Mythical Tradition
In his own work, Rebillot is striving toward this
kind of theatre. He is presently directing Yeats'
Cuchulain cycle (opening March 12)— plays based
on an ancient mythical tradition which become
located in the immediate moment by their
presentation of that tradition. Rebillot explains
his ideas of theatre and society in terms of these
plays.
"Theatre should hold on to the traditions of the
past if they are used to communicate the message
of the future. But if we begin to think that the old
traditions hold all the answers, we need only to
look to history for a refutation. What we must do
is use what is and was in order to get to what is
becoming.
"Change is all we have."
Baile's Strand, one of the Cuchulain plays,
"concerns a king who, in trying to solidify Ireland,
creates a militaristic society that causes a man to
kill his own son. Only an immature society can
cause that.
"As every muth is the same, the myth of the
Cuchulain cycle becomes the myth of our society.
The performance of that myth passes through the
stages of life and into t.hr death of man. That is the
stage our society is in now—the death of a mvth.

But in that dath there is always a new myth being
born. People seeing the performance should then
be able to look at the world and see not only the
facts but the myth behind the facts, and work to
build from its positive aspects a new myth to stop
these destructive elements caused by man's lack of
association with himself and his fellow man.
Education Inseparable
Rebillot's ideas about education are inseparable
from his concepts of the theatre.
"Education, theatre, life are not separate
categories," he emphasizes. "You live what you
speak, what you are, what you study, what you
dream at night. If you divide yourself into
categories, they begin to conflict and to destroy
each othei —and you react to that inner
destruction by destroying the people around
you."
"Since our present society is in desperate fear
of destroying itself—because it has not only the
power but the ambition—it is only in the positive,
constructive elements I see in young people that
there is hope. And since this world will be, must be
their world, the element of self-determination in
building their lives must start almost from the
moment of birth—and certainly from the moment
they enter the discipline of the university.
"A student should not be in college to do time
for a crime he didn't commit.
Emphasis on Students
"The emphasis in the university must be to look
to the students, to see what they want—it's their
life. But it seems that most faculty members don't
want students to lead their own lives. And students
have reinforced this way of thinking by being
passive. They have the feeling that the faculty will
take care of their lives for them—prescribe and
define what they must do in order to 'get an
education.' The point is that the faculty will 'take
care of you' —anyone will if you give them the
power. But that power will be used not for you but
for themselves.
"There is no reason why faculty and students
can't find a new way of relation to each other—on
a personal and human level."
One of the problems here seems to be the

faculty's restrictions on what academic or artistic
"discipline" should be.
"Self-determination," says Rebillot, "means
wanting to be disciplined: for discipline is
something you desire in order to be fully able to
communicate."
The necessity for constant re-creation, both in
the theatre and in education, is encapsulated by
Rebillot in a story he tells about a Japanese flower
arranger who was a guest on a radio program he
directed in Japan.
The woman had achieved one of the highest
degrees of advancement in flower arranging. One
member of the panel on the show asked her, "Why
have you spent so many years studying in order to
create a floral arrangement, when flowers die so
quickly?"
She replied, "That's why."

FIRED-Visiting Assistant Professor of Specch and
Drama Paul Rchillot has been fired bccause he was a
"disruptive" influence.
Paul Rebillot, Assistant Prof, of Speech and
Drama, has been dismissed from his position,
effective the end of next quarter.
The decision by Michael Barry, newly
recommended as head of the department, not to
rehire Rebillot has created a stir of controversy
among Speech and Drama students and faculty.
Students petitioned for Barry to be made
director of the department and most support him
in that position. But many also are loyal to
Rebillot as a teacher and friend and have expressed
apprehension as to what Barry's move may mean.
A large number of them, including some who
support Barry's decision, have referred to Rebillot
as "the most exciting teacher at Stanford."
Rebillot, a University of Detroit graduate with
a Master's degree from the University of Michigan,
has acted and directed in theatres across the
country, including one which he built and ran in
Massachusetts. He worked with the Actors'
Workshop in San Francisco for a number of years
and taught at SF State, where he directed the
nationally acclaimed production of Euripides'
Bacchae for five years before coming to Stanford
last fall.
Barry, who is working towards building a strong
department, feels Rebillot's influence is a
"disruptive and destructive" one which could
hinder efforts in that direction. Rebillot's
supporters fear a clamp-down on diversity and on
the kind of self-determined education Rebillot
advocates. Several have written letters and talked
to Barry, objecting to his decision.
Balance Important
Barry's supporters emphasize the importance
of first reaching a balance between differentstyles
of acting and teaching rather than allowing one
view to dominate the department. Rebillot
presently teaches acting to all first-year MFA
candidates and most undergraduates.
Many also feel that since Rebillot was planning
to leave in 1970 anyway, it is wiser to support
Barry, who will be leading the department for a
number of years to come.
The issues raised by students and faculty are

diverse and complex, and mainly of departmental
rather than University-wide interest. Drama
students and faculty held a meeting last week in
which the issues were discussed. But many

have reinforced this way of thinking by being
passive. They have the feeling that the faculty will
take care of their lives for them—prescribe and
define what they must do in order to 'get an
education.' The point is that the faculty will 'take
care of you' —anyone will if you give them the
power. But that power will be used not for you but
for themselves.
"There is no reason why faculty and students
can't find a new way of relation to each other—on
a personal and human level."
One of the problems here seems to be the

faculty's restrictions on what academic or artistic
"discipline" should be.
"Self-determination," says Rebillot, "means
wanting to be disciplined: for discipline is
something you desire in order to be fully able to
communicate."
The necessity for constant re-creation, both in
the theatre and in education, is encapsulated by
Rebillot in a story he tells about a Japanese flower
arranger who was a guest on a radio program he
directed in Japan.
The woman had achieved one of the highest
degrees of advancement in flower arranging. One
member of the panel on the show asked her, "Why
have you spent so many years studying in order to
create a floral arrangement, when flowers die so
quickly?"
She replied, "That's why."

FIRED-Visiting Assistant Professor of Specch and
Drama Paul Rchillot has been fired bccause he was a
"disruptive" influence.
Paul Rebillot, Assistant Prof, of Speech and
Drama, has been dismissed from his position,
effective the end of next quarter.
The decision by Michael Barry, newly
recommended as head of the department, not to
rehire Rebillot has created a stir of controversy
among Speech and Drama students and faculty.
Students petitioned for Barry to be made
director of the department and most support him
in that position. But many also are loyal to
Rebillot as a teacher and friend and have expressed
apprehension as to what Barry's move may mean.
A large number of them, including some who
support Barry's decision, have referred to Rebillot
as "the most exciting teacher at Stanford."
Rebillot, a University of Detroit graduate with
a Master's degree from the University of Michigan,
has acted and directed in theatres across the
country, including one which he built and ran in
Massachusetts. He worked with the Actors'
Workshop in San Francisco for a number of years
and taught at SF State, where he directed the
nationally acclaimed production of Euripides'
Bacchae for five years before coming to Stanford
last fall.
Barry, who is working towards building a strong
department, feels Rebillot's influence is a
"disruptive and destructive" one which could
hinder efforts in that direction. Rebillot's
supporters fear a clamp-down on diversity and on
the kind of self-determined education Rebillot
advocates. Several have written letters and talked
to Barry, objecting to his decision.
Balance Important
Barry's supporters emphasize the importance
of first reaching a balance between differentstyles
of acting and teaching rather than allowing one
view to dominate the department. Rebillot
presently teaches acting to all first-year MFA
candidates and most undergraduates.
Many also feel that since Rebillot was planning
to leave in 1970 anyway, it is wiser to support
Barry, who will be leading the department for a
number of years to come.
The issues raised by students and faculty are

diverse and complex, and mainly of departmental
rather than University-wide interest. Drama
students and faculty held a meeting last week in
which the issues were discussed. But many
students feel the heart of the controversy lies, not
merely in a question of priorities, but also in a
conflict of approaches which directly concerns the
state of the University.
"What is important," says one graduate
student, "is that Paul stands for
self-determination, and a dismissal of the man is a
rejection of the concept."
Dynamism And Commitment
An undergraduate disagrees: "The point is that
the more traditional approaches to drama in this
department are not yet strong enough to hold their
own against Paul's kind of dynamism and
commitment. We just aren't ready for him."
The root of these conflicts seems to lie at least
as much in Rebillot himself as in the intricacies of
administration.
The Daily attempted to discover something of
the man behind the controversy, his ideas on
theatre and on education in an interview with him.
Rebillot describes his primary focus in teaching
as "a synthesis of as many diverse elements in the
arts as possible."
"The theatre in the past century," he says, "has
become a kind of toy of this society, rather than a
necessary element of it. Although it began to
achieve significance in the thirties, that movement
almost inevitably fell apart." This is true because
"every society must provide for its people the
chance to walk, to talk, to dance and to sing; and
when dancing and singing come to be considered
'entertainment,' then the theatre becomes a toy.
"We are now seeing many movement
throughout the country to re-establish the theatre
as a way of life rather than a frill. McLuhan s idea
of the multi-media communication that our
society is growing into calls for image forms of
expression—which is what the theatre is.
'Encounter theatre' is important because it is
creating a new language to replace the language of
the industrial age, a language by which people
relate on a theatrical level.

"Movies and tapes may replace books as
methods of storing knowledge, but the word—the
spoken word of communication—will remain, not
dying but being reborn into a new mode of
communication."
If the theatre fails to realize this trend, he says,
"it will remain a toy—and a nation must discard its
toys as it grows up." The progress of society
presents to the theatre an imperative: grown and
change, or die and be forgotten.
A sign that the theatre is moving in a positive
direction is the fact that the important theatre of
today is "taking place in the streets"—whether
literally, in the radical companies of New York and
San Francisco, or figuratively, in the
environmental theatre of plays like Tom Paine.
The emphasis in this new theatre is on encounter
and communication: an expression by one group
pf people to another.
Ancient Mythical Tradition
In his own work, Rebillot is striving toward this
kind of theatre. He is presently directing Yeats'
Cuchulain cycle (opening March 12)— plays based
on an ancient mythical tradition which become
located in the immediate moment by their
presentation of that tradition. Rebillot explains
his ideas of theatre and society in terms of these
plays.
"Theatre should hold on to the traditions of the
past if they are used to communicate the message
of the future. But if we begin to think that the old
traditions hold all the answers, we need only to
look to history for a refutation. What we must do
is use what is and was in order to get to what is
becoming.
"Change is all we have."
Baile's Strand, one of the Cuchulain plays,
"concerns a king who, in trying to solidify Ireland,
creates a militaristic society that causes a man to
kill his own son. Only an immature society can
cause that.
"As every muth is the same, the myth of the
Cuchulain cycle becomes the myth of our society.
The performance of that myth passes through the
stages of life and into t.hr death of man. That is the
stage our society is in now—the death of a mvth.

But in that dath there is always a new myth being
born. People seeing the performance should then
be able to look at the world and see not only the
facts but the myth behind the facts, and work to
build from its positive aspects a new myth to stop
these destructive elements caused by man's lack of
association with himself and his fellow man.
Education Inseparable
Rebillot's ideas about education are inseparable
from his concepts of the theatre.
"Education, theatre, life are not separate
categories," he emphasizes. "You live what you
speak, what you are, what you study, what you
dream at night. If you divide yourself into
categories, they begin to conflict and to destroy
each othei —and you react to that inner
destruction by destroying the people around
you."
"Since our present society is in desperate fear
of destroying itself—because it has not only the
power but the ambition—it is only in the positive,
constructive elements I see in young people that
there is hope. And since this world will be, must be
their world, the element of self-determination in
building their lives must start almost from the
moment of birth—and certainly from the moment
they enter the discipline of the university.
"A student should not be in college to do time
for a crime he didn't commit.
Emphasis on Students
"The emphasis in the university must be to look
to the students, to see what they want—it's their
life. But it seems that most faculty members don't
want students to lead their own lives. And students
have reinforced this way of thinking by being
passive. They have the feeling that the faculty will
take care of their lives for them—prescribe and
define what they must do in order to 'get an

can't find a new way of relation to each other—on
a personal and human level."

faculty's restrictions on what academic or artistic
"discipline" should be.

communicate."
