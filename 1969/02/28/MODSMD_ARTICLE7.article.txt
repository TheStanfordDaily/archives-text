# Tenure or Talent?

Behind the controversy over the firing of
Paul Rebillot in the Speech and Drama
department (see story, p. 1) looms a much
larger issue which is symptomatic of a
growing hypocrisy in this university, a
widening gulf between ideals professed and
the reality of practice, just at the time when
that gap should be narrowing.
From SDS to BSU to YAF, students are
increasingly professing a desire for the
freedom of self-determination. Behind the
rhetoric of black and radical students'
demands to the University lies a rejection of
the structures and policies imposed by a
power structure whose interests are opposed
to giving students what they want in their
education. Departments are including
students on curriculum committees, the
administration seeks them for search
committees—all supposedly to give students
a greater voice in their education. The SES
reports, in their emphasis on less rigid
requirements and more self-designed
programs, pay homage also to the idea that
the process of education should increasingly
belong to the students.
And all over the University, usually
quietly, departments continue to dismiss
and threaten to dismiss the men who most
completely teach and live that
principle-who also happen to be the men
most valued by their students as teachers.
What's happening?
Paul Rebillot is not an isolated example,
though his case is more blatant than most. A
more usual excuse is the "publish or perish"
syndrome, a catch-all to nab professors who
write novels instead of writing about
novels—or who devote their time to
teaching. In other words, who live by their
own interests and callings instead of by the
intransigent laws of their "academic
discipline." And occasionally there is the
case of some honest fool who forgot to keep
his ideas or opinions to himself until he got
tenure.
On the other hand, if you're a bureaucrat
or a pedant, your chances of fitting into the
Stanford hierarchy are excellent.
The division, of course, is not clearcut.
But it doesn't need to be.
The point is that men who advocate in
word and example the integrity of
self-knowledge and self-direction, men who
are truly teachers, who are in their own ways
striving to eliminate and make students
aware of the boxes and barriers and
categories that destroy education, are being

fired by men who speak of
self-determination for students.
They never seem to get around to asking
the students.
And for the few faculty members who
dare step out of line, either in their own
pursuits or in thinking of education in terms
of what the student wants, all those lovely
phrases about academic freedom become a
hideousjoke.
Behind the professions of scholarship and
standards is the paranoid clinging to
heaped-up traditions that makes
bureaucracy. And somewhere in that
bureaucratic morass, the student is
forgotten, and with him the purposes and
goals of the university.
We would rather think of this hypocrisy
as psychotic than Machiavellian. But in any
case, the prognosis is inevitable: in getting
rid of men like Paul Rebillot, the University
is getting rid of itself. In its ruthless pursuit
of schizophrenia, the University is dying.
There are always carefully presented
reasons of policy, of externally imposed
structure, of standards—all the wavs in
which bureaucracy strives to enforce a
uniformity of mediocrity. The reasons may
seem sound and sensible. But all the
reasonable academic and administrative
excuses that Stanford has to offer cannot
mask that propulsion toward
self-destruction. And the irony is that this
movement is accelerating at the very
moment when the opening of new
possibilities ought to signify a renascence of
education.
At other universities there have been riots
for less cause—and for the same cause. Even
at Stanford there has been at least one case in
which overwhelming student protest has
been instrumental in securing the
reinstatement of a professor. In the case of
Rebillot, many students have written open
letters and talked to the people responsible
for his dismissal. If the situation seems
hopeless, it is only through students'
determination to live their own lives, to
refuse to be told what is "good for them," to
say no to the system that deprives them of
the excitement of true education, that any
hope can be found.
But most of us do nothing but sit back
comfortably, sigh philosophically, and
babble on about an illusory dream called
self-determination, while gulping down a
few more spoonfuls of "education."
And never realizing we're being poisoned.
