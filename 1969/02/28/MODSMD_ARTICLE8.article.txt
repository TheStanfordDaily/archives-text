## Letter From Lebanon 
### Pat Mihaly 
20—Now that
semester finals are over, I thought
it time to make contact with The
Farm, and let you know what's
happening at Stanford-in-Lebanon
with its student body of . . .one.
I arrived in Lebanon in
mid-September, and after living
here for five months I have found
Lebanon to be in many ways a
California in miniature. With the
same general shape (and climate) as
the Golden State, Lebanon is only
about 140 miles long and 40 miles
wide. Driving along its beautiful
Mediterranean coastline is very
much like being on California
Highway 1. And going inland, its
winter ski resorts compare with the
best in the Sierras.
Lebanon has its Sacramento
Valley, too the Bekaa, reknowned
in the Middle East for its delicious
fruits and vegetables. Even the
Redwoods have their counterpart
here in the Cedars of Lebanon,
relics of a prehistoric past.
But this is only Lebanon's
surface. Digging a little deeper we
find that the best adjective for its
capital, Beirut, is "cosmopolitan."
The advertisements are often in
three languages: Arabic, French
and English—and thistri-lingualism
extends to television, the press and
many of the IVi million Lebanese.
Stores selling water pipes and
Persian rugs can be seen next to
others displaying the latest
products of General Electric, and
nightclubs playing the latest Beatle
records often feature a belly dancer
as their main attraction.
The American University of
Beirut — campus of
Stanford-in-Lebanorr—is a perfect
example of this cosmopolitanism.
Situated on a lovely hill in the heart
of Beirut and sloping down to a
Mediterranean beach, A.U.B. is the
campus of some 3600 students
from 65 different countries.

There are around 200 of us
Americans, practically all Junior
Year Abroad students and
graduates. Most of the other
students are from Arab countries as
well as nearby states of Asia and
Africa. A.U.8., whose classes are all
taught in English, is one of the best
universities in the Middle East. It is
the alma mater of many of the
leaders of Asia and Africa and has
the distinction of being a prime
source and major center of many of
the political movements in this
area.
Turning to Lebanon as a whole,
"diversity" is the best adjective.
Throughout its history, Lebanon
has been the refuge of religious and
ethnic minorities—Christian and
Moslem, Jewish and Armenian.
Certainly this adds to the charm
and color of Lebanese culture but
its political result is that Lebanon
lacks the cohesiveness of most
nations of the world. Rather than
feel a common sense of Lebanese
nationalism, the people's loyalties
spread in many directions: Arab
nationalists look to Egypt or Syria,
Maronite Christians look to
France, and many look only to
their small religious or ethnic group
within the country.
This situation changed to an
extent with the Israeli attack on
the Beirut International Airport in
December. I had been in Cairo for a
wek and was on my way to its
airport for my return flight on the
morning of December 29 when I
heard about the attack of the night
before.
The news was so unexpected
that it sounded like an April Fool's
joke though without the humor.
The delay of our flight three hours
sobered me to its reality as did the
charred planes and massive security
forces I saw in Beirut when I finally
arrived.
I kept asking myself why Israel

would do this to the only Arab
country which was no threat to
her—but my questions remained
unanswered. Retaliation against
the Athens incident can only be
acceptable to those who blindly
accept Tel Aviv's word as Truth.
Certainly she had greater thoughts
in mind which made it worth the
risk of denunciation by world
opinion.
The reaction in Lebanon was at
first one of stunned silence and
then of bitter condemnation, both
of Israel and of the Lebanese
government which allowed the
country to be so defenceless.
The student reaction was most
vocal, and strikes lasted for weeks,
but student activity was restricted
to campus grounds since dozens of
soldiers waited outside the
universities' gates, fully armed and
ready for action.
The effect on the government
has so far been mainly a version of
musical chairs though some of the
student demands are under
consideration. Regardless, the
incident has been important in
uniting the Lebanese people,
especially the youth, on one truly
national, truly Lebanese issue.
The emphasis we Americans
place on nationalism can be seen
outwardly in the frequence with
which we see the flag, say the
pledge of allegience, and sign the
national anthem. In a country
which is only 23 years old and
suffering from both the pains of
development and the tensions of
international crisis a genuine
nationalism is even more
important, and is, in the long run,
essential to its very existence.

many of the IVi million Lebanese.
Stores selling water pipes and
Persian rugs can be seen next to
others displaying the latest
products of General Electric, and
nightclubs playing the latest Beatle
records often feature a belly dancer
as their main attraction.
The American University of
Beirut — campus of
Stanford-in-Lebanorr—is a perfect
example of this cosmopolitanism.
Situated on a lovely hill in the heart
of Beirut and sloping down to a
Mediterranean beach, A.U.B. is the
campus of some 3600 students
from 65 different countries.

There are around 200 of us
Americans, practically all Junior
Year Abroad students and
graduates. Most of the other
students are from Arab countries as
well as nearby states of Asia and
Africa. A.U.8., whose classes are all
taught in English, is one of the best
universities in the Middle East. It is
the alma mater of many of the
leaders of Asia and Africa and has
the distinction of being a prime
source and major center of many of
the political movements in this
area.
Turning to Lebanon as a whole,
"diversity" is the best adjective.
Throughout its history, Lebanon
has been the refuge of religious and
ethnic minorities—Christian and
Moslem, Jewish and Armenian.
Certainly this adds to the charm
and color of Lebanese culture but
its political result is that Lebanon
lacks the cohesiveness of most
nations of the world. Rather than
feel a common sense of Lebanese
nationalism, the people's loyalties
spread in many directions: Arab
nationalists look to Egypt or Syria,
Maronite Christians look to
France, and many look only to
their small religious or ethnic group
within the country.
This situation changed to an
extent with the Israeli attack on
the Beirut International Airport in
December. I had been in Cairo for a
wek and was on my way to its
airport for my return flight on the
morning of December 29 when I
heard about the attack of the night
before.
The news was so unexpected
that it sounded like an April Fool's
joke though without the humor.
The delay of our flight three hours
sobered me to its reality as did the
charred planes and massive security
forces I saw in Beirut when I finally
arrived.
I kept asking myself why Israel

would do this to the only Arab
country which was no threat to
her—but my questions remained
unanswered. Retaliation against
the Athens incident can only be
acceptable to those who blindly
accept Tel Aviv's word as Truth.
Certainly she had greater thoughts
in mind which made it worth the
risk of denunciation by world
opinion.
The reaction in Lebanon was at
first one of stunned silence and
then of bitter condemnation, both
of Israel and of the Lebanese
government which allowed the
country to be so defenceless.
The student reaction was most
vocal, and strikes lasted for weeks,
but student activity was restricted
to campus grounds since dozens of
soldiers waited outside the
universities' gates, fully armed and
ready for action.
The effect on the government
has so far been mainly a version of
musical chairs though some of the
student demands are under
consideration. Regardless, the
incident has been important in
uniting the Lebanese people,
especially the youth, on one truly
national, truly Lebanese issue.
The emphasis we Americans
place on nationalism can be seen
outwardly in the frequence with
which we see the flag, say the
pledge of allegience, and sign the
national anthem. In a country
which is only 23 years old and
suffering from both the pains of
development and the tensions of
international crisis a genuine
nationalism is even more
important, and is, in the long run,
essential to its very existence.

20—Now that
semester finals are over, I thought
it time to make contact with The
Farm, and let you know what's
happening at Stanford-in-Lebanon
with its student body of . . .one.
I arrived in Lebanon in
mid-September, and after living
here for five months I have found
Lebanon to be in many ways a
California in miniature. With the
same general shape (and climate) as
the Golden State, Lebanon is only
about 140 miles long and 40 miles
wide. Driving along its beautiful
Mediterranean coastline is very
much like being on California
Highway 1. And going inland, its
winter ski resorts compare with the
best in the Sierras.
Lebanon has its Sacramento
Valley, too the Bekaa, reknowned
in the Middle East for its delicious
fruits and vegetables. Even the
Redwoods have their counterpart
here in the Cedars of Lebanon,
relics of a prehistoric past.
But this is only Lebanon's
surface. Digging a little deeper we
find that the best adjective for its
capital, Beirut, is "cosmopolitan."
The advertisements are often in
three languages: Arabic, French
and English—and thistri-lingualism
extends to television, the press and
many of the IVi million Lebanese.

ethnic minorities—Christian and
Moslem, Jewish and Armenian.
Certainly this adds to the charm
and color of Lebanese culture but
its political result is that Lebanon
lacks the cohesiveness of most
nations of the world. Rather than
feel a common sense of Lebanese
nationalism, the people's loyalties
spread in many directions: Arab
nationalists look to Egypt or Syria,
Maronite Christians look to
France, and many look only to
their small religious or ethnic group
within the country.
This situation changed to an
extent with the Israeli attack on
the Beirut International Airport in
December. I had been in Cairo for a
wek and was on my way to its
airport for my return flight on the
morning of December 29 when I
heard about the attack of the night
before.
The news was so unexpected
that it sounded like an April Fool's
joke though without the humor.
The delay of our flight three hours
sobered me to its reality as did the
charred planes and massive security
forces I saw in Beirut when I finally
arrived.
I kept asking myself why Israel

would do this to the only Arab
country which was no threat to
her—but my questions remained
unanswered. Retaliation against
the Athens incident can only be
acceptable to those who blindly
accept Tel Aviv's word as Truth.
Certainly she had greater thoughts
in mind which made it worth the
risk of denunciation by world
opinion.
The reaction in Lebanon was at
first one of stunned silence and
then of bitter condemnation, both
of Israel and of the Lebanese
government which allowed the
country to be so defenceless.
The student reaction was most
vocal, and strikes lasted for weeks,
but student activity was restricted
to campus grounds since dozens of
soldiers waited outside the
universities' gates, fully armed and
ready for action.
The effect on the government
has so far been mainly a version of
musical chairs though some of the
student demands are under
consideration. Regardless, the
incident has been important in
uniting the Lebanese people,
especially the youth, on one truly
national, truly Lebanese issue.
The emphasis we Americans
place on nationalism can be seen
outwardly in the frequence with
which we see the flag, say the
pledge of allegience, and sign the
national anthem. In a country
which is only 23 years old and
suffering from both the pains of
development and the tensions of
international crisis a genuine
nationalism is even more
important, and is, in the long run,
essential to its very existence.

20—Now that
semester finals are over, I thought
it time to make contact with The
Farm, and let you know what's
happening at Stanford-in-Lebanon
with its student body of . . .one.
I arrived in Lebanon in
mid-September, and after living
here for five months I have found
Lebanon to be in many ways a
California in miniature. With the
same general shape (and climate) as
the Golden State, Lebanon is only
about 140 miles long and 40 miles
wide. Driving along its beautiful
Mediterranean coastline is very
much like being on California
Highway 1. And going inland, its
winter ski resorts compare with the
best in the Sierras.
Lebanon has its Sacramento
Valley, too the Bekaa, reknowned
in the Middle East for its delicious
fruits and vegetables. Even the
Redwoods have their counterpart
here in the Cedars of Lebanon,
relics of a prehistoric past.
But this is only Lebanon's
surface. Digging a little deeper we
find that the best adjective for its
capital, Beirut, is "cosmopolitan."
The advertisements are often in
three languages: Arabic, French
and English—and thistri-lingualism
extends to television, the press and
many of the IVi million Lebanese.
Stores selling water pipes and
Persian rugs can be seen next to
others displaying the latest
products of General Electric, and
nightclubs playing the latest Beatle
records often feature a belly dancer
as their main attraction.
The American University of
Beirut — campus of
Stanford-in-Lebanorr—is a perfect
example of this cosmopolitanism.
Situated on a lovely hill in the heart
of Beirut and sloping down to a
Mediterranean beach, A.U.B. is the
campus of some 3600 students
from 65 different countries.

There are around 200 of us
Americans, practically all Junior
Year Abroad students and
graduates. Most of the other
students are from Arab countries as
well as nearby states of Asia and
Africa. A.U.8., whose classes are all
taught in English, is one of the best
universities in the Middle East. It is
the alma mater of many of the
leaders of Asia and Africa and has
the distinction of being a prime
source and major center of many of
the political movements in this
area.
Turning to Lebanon as a whole,
"diversity" is the best adjective.
