# Two Minutes Of Haight
## Limits Of Academic Freedom 
### Tim Haight 
"We are endlessly being told
that freedom demands responsi
bility. Doesn't academic freedom
require responsibility ?"
—defendant at the SDS-Trus
tees' meeting trial
To many people, academic
freedom may mean the Scholar's
right to pursue whatever path he
chooses in his search for truth,
understanding, knowledge, or
meaning. For this reason, fulfilling
a contract with the Department of
Defense to design a nerve gas is all
right because it adds to our
knowledge.
But we don't have to look far
to see that the academic commu
nity itself has already admitted
the need for limits on academic
freedom. Taking an extreme
example, the Medical School does
not have a concentration camp
annexed to it, although the pos
sibilities for pure research might
be enhanced.
More realistically, most of the
social sciences have established
mechanisms to prohibit harmful
effects from their experiments.
Children in psychology experi
ments may have to obtain parents'
permission slips. Experiments
arrousing anxiety without ade
quate "debriefing" may be
banned.
Subtle Pressures
In addition to these limits on

the means of extending the fron
tiers of knowledge, more subtle
pressures limit the ends them
selves. Usually, these are the laws
of the marketplace, by which the
outside society provides funds for
some kinds of research because it
sees an application, while other
research must be funded by the
University, with the money it can
scrape up. It terms of resources,
one could argue that the academic
freedom of the Department of
Music, with its overcrowded facili
ties, is more limited than that of
the Business School.
A possible analogy is the "con
spiracy in restraint of trade" idea
by which the capital of large cor
porations effectively keeps them
ahead of potential new competi
tors.
In the debate about academic
freedom, then, the question is not
whether any limits at all are to be
imposed, but what those limits
should be. And when we compare
the possible consequences of re
search on strategic hamlets with a
questionable psychological experi
ment, we may well ask whether
the present standards are appro
priate.
Vietnam
How many Vietnamese were
torn from their homes by the re
location plan researched by SRl's
Eugene Staley? How much easier

was it to pursue our air war in
North Vietnam because of the
electronic devices developed by
Stanford professors such as Wil
liam Rambo? If the agony of one
male subject about hi/5 possible
latent homosexuality is grounds
to reject an experiment, why
don't the flaming deaths of Asian
children count for something?
It gets very curious. One might
argue that the ends do not justify
the means, so the pursuit of truth
does not justify a cruel experi
ment. But while the ends do not
justify the means, apparently the
means justify the ends. That is to
say, the process of research in
developing gas is somehow separ
ate from whatever application
that research eventually finds.
Thus, the academician passes the
buck.
But in doing so he is either
stupid or lying. If the Department
of Defense picks up the tab for a
study of poisonous gases, any
scholar should have a pretty good
idea where his research will even
tually go, especially if is it classi
fied so the military are the only
people who see it. So the means
justify the ends, but the ends
don't justify the means. Curiouser
and curiouser.
Humanitarian Vs. Political
Of course, the objections to
bad experiments are on "human-

itarian" grounds, while complaints
about Vietnam are "political".
OK, I'll do my experiment on
fears of homosexuality with con
servatives only, or people who
score high on the F-scale. Or, that
doesn't make any difference?
Then why does it make a differ
ence if the victims of the gas or
relocation or electronic equip
ment are communist and yellow?
In fact, we can get just as upset
about the gassing of a bunch of
sheep in Utah as with the carnage
in Vietnam. Stanford research
helped that one, too. Good thing
the wind was away from Salt Lake
City that day. But in helping
develop that product, a professor
was just doing his academic thing.
What it comes down to is that
the sense of responsiblity in aca
demic freedom is simply a func
tion of who is around to com
plain, compounded with the sup
port or lack of it in the general
community. Our government
dignifies the experiments in death.
Their opponents are dismissed as
"political". But where is the
consistency, the reason, in this
system? Or is Socrates still an
instructor in Western Civ while
Thrasymachos has been made a
trustee?

does not justify a cruel experi
ment. But while the ends do not
justify the means, apparently the
means justify the ends. That is to
say, the process of research in
developing gas is somehow separ
ate from whatever application
that research eventually finds.
Thus, the academician passes the
buck.
But in doing so he is either
stupid or lying. If the Department
of Defense picks up the tab for a
study of poisonous gases, any
scholar should have a pretty good
idea where his research will even
tually go, especially if is it classi
fied so the military are the only
people who see it. So the means
justify the ends, but the ends
don't justify the means. Curiouser
and curiouser.
Humanitarian Vs. Political
Of course, the objections to
bad experiments are on "human-

itarian" grounds, while complaints
about Vietnam are "political".
OK, I'll do my experiment on
fears of homosexuality with con
servatives only, or people who
score high on the F-scale. Or, that
doesn't make any difference?
Then why does it make a differ
ence if the victims of the gas or
relocation or electronic equip
ment are communist and yellow?
In fact, we can get just as upset
about the gassing of a bunch of
sheep in Utah as with the carnage
in Vietnam. Stanford research
helped that one, too. Good thing
the wind was away from Salt Lake
City that day. But in helping
develop that product, a professor
was just doing his academic thing.
What it comes down to is that
the sense of responsiblity in aca
demic freedom is simply a func
tion of who is around to com
plain, compounded with the sup
port or lack of it in the general
community. Our government
dignifies the experiments in death.
Their opponents are dismissed as
"political". But where is the
consistency, the reason, in this
system? Or is Socrates still an
instructor in Western Civ while
Thrasymachos has been made a
trustee?

"We are endlessly being told

—defendant at the SDS-Trus

To many people, academic
freedom may mean the Scholar's
right to pursue whatever path he
chooses in his search for truth,
understanding, knowledge, or
meaning. For this reason, fulfilling
a contract with the Department of
Defense to design a nerve gas is all
right because it adds to our
knowledge.
But we don't have to look far
to see that the academic commu
nity itself has already admitted
the need for limits on academic
freedom. Taking an extreme
example, the Medical School does
not have a concentration camp
annexed to it, although the pos
sibilities for pure research might
be enhanced.
More realistically, most of the
social sciences have established
mechanisms to prohibit harmful
effects from their experiments.
Children in psychology experi
ments may have to obtain parents'
permission slips. Experiments
arrousing anxiety without ade
quate "debriefing" may be
banned.
Subtle Pressures
In addition to these limits on

the means of extending the fron
tiers of knowledge, more subtle
pressures limit the ends them
selves. Usually, these are the laws
of the marketplace, by which the
outside society provides funds for
some kinds of research because it
sees an application, while other
research must be funded by the
University, with the money it can
scrape up. It terms of resources,
one could argue that the academic
freedom of the Department of
Music, with its overcrowded facili
ties, is more limited than that of
the Business School.
A possible analogy is the "con
spiracy in restraint of trade" idea
by which the capital of large cor
porations effectively keeps them
ahead of potential new competi
tors.
In the debate about academic
freedom, then, the question is not
whether any limits at all are to be
imposed, but what those limits
should be. And when we compare
the possible consequences of re
search on strategic hamlets with a
questionable psychological experi
ment, we may well ask whether
the present standards are appro
priate.
Vietnam
How many Vietnamese were
torn from their homes by the re
location plan researched by SRl's
Eugene Staley? How much easier

was it to pursue our air war in
North Vietnam because of the
electronic devices developed by
Stanford professors such as Wil
liam Rambo? If the agony of one
male subject about hi/5 possible
latent homosexuality is grounds
to reject an experiment, why
don't the flaming deaths of Asian
children count for something?
It gets very curious. One might
argue that the ends do not justify
the means, so the pursuit of truth
does not justify a cruel experi
ment. But while the ends do not
justify the means, apparently the
means justify the ends. That is to

freedom. Taking an extreme
example, the Medical School does
not have a concentration camp
annexed to it, although the pos
sibilities for pure research might
be enhanced.
More realistically, most of the
social sciences have established
mechanisms to prohibit harmful
effects from their experiments.
Children in psychology experi
ments may have to obtain parents'
permission slips. Experiments
arrousing anxiety without ade
quate "debriefing" may be
banned.
Subtle Pressures
In addition to these limits on

the means of extending the fron
tiers of knowledge, more subtle
pressures limit the ends them
selves. Usually, these are the laws
of the marketplace, by which the
outside society provides funds for
some kinds of research because it
sees an application, while other
research must be funded by the
University, with the money it can
scrape up. It terms of resources,
one could argue that the academic
freedom of the Department of
Music, with its overcrowded facili
ties, is more limited than that of
the Business School.
A possible analogy is the "con
spiracy in restraint of trade" idea
by which the capital of large cor
porations effectively keeps them
ahead of potential new competi
tors.
In the debate about academic
freedom, then, the question is not
whether any limits at all are to be
imposed, but what those limits
should be. And when we compare
the possible consequences of re
search on strategic hamlets with a
questionable psychological experi
ment, we may well ask whether
the present standards are appro
priate.
Vietnam
How many Vietnamese were
torn from their homes by the re
location plan researched by SRl's
Eugene Staley? How much easier

was it to pursue our air war in
North Vietnam because of the
electronic devices developed by
Stanford professors such as Wil
liam Rambo? If the agony of one
male subject about hi/5 possible
latent homosexuality is grounds
to reject an experiment, why
don't the flaming deaths of Asian
children count for something?
It gets very curious. One might
argue that the ends do not justify
the means, so the pursuit of truth
does not justify a cruel experi
ment. But while the ends do not
justify the means, apparently the
means justify the ends. That is to
say, the process of research in
developing gas is somehow separ
ate from whatever application
that research eventually finds.
Thus, the academician passes the
buck.
But in doing so he is either
stupid or lying. If the Department
of Defense picks up the tab for a
study of poisonous gases, any
scholar should have a pretty good
idea where his research will even
tually go, especially if is it classi
fied so the military are the only
people who see it. So the means
justify the ends, but the ends
don't justify the means. Curiouser
and curiouser.
Humanitarian Vs. Political
Of course, the objections to
bad experiments are on "human-

itarian" grounds, while complaints
about Vietnam are "political".
OK, I'll do my experiment on
fears of homosexuality with con
servatives only, or people who
score high on the F-scale. Or, that
doesn't make any difference?
Then why does it make a differ
ence if the victims of the gas or
relocation or electronic equip
ment are communist and yellow?
In fact, we can get just as upset
about the gassing of a bunch of
sheep in Utah as with the carnage
in Vietnam. Stanford research
helped that one, too. Good thing
the wind was away from Salt Lake
City that day. But in helping
develop that product, a professor
was just doing his academic thing.
What it comes down to is that
the sense of responsiblity in aca
demic freedom is simply a func
tion of who is around to com
plain, compounded with the sup
port or lack of it in the general
community. Our government
dignifies the experiments in death.
Their opponents are dismissed as
"political". But where is the
consistency, the reason, in this
system? Or is Socrates still an
instructor in Western Civ while
Thrasymachos has been made a
trustee?
