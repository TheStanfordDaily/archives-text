# Presidio March Continues, White Plaza Rally Today
## 
### LYNNE McCALLISTER 
Last Tuesday about 300 soldiers were
standing around on a training group at
Fort Ord. A small group of marchers
stopped by the road, holding up "V"
signs and a banner saying "Walk with the
Presidio 27."
The soldiers started to cheer. The
marchers began to sing "We Shall
Overcome" and with the verse "We shall
live in peace" the soldiers joined in. As
the marchers moved on, the soldiers
regrouped and gave them three cheers.
The marchers prefer to be called
"walkers." "We are not the military,"
one of them said. They emphasize the

nonviolent quality of their actions. They
are celebrating the spirit of the 27
soldiers charged with mutiny, who on
Oct. 11 sat down in the Presidio stockade
to protest the shooting of one of their
comrades.
Three days before their protest,
mentally disturbed Richard Bunch had
been shot while running from a work
detail after asking the guard to aim for his
head.
Sentences Inspired Walk
The sentencing of three of the
"mutineers" to 14-16 years
imprisonment inspired the walk from the
Institute of Non-Violence in Carmel to
the Presidio in San Francisco, which the
marchers call "the institute of violence."
Some representatives of the "walkers"
will be speaking at a noon rally today in
White Plaza. Dave Harris, former student
body president and organizer of the
Resistance, will also speak, as will the
organizers of the rally, Paul Rupert, of
the United Christian Ministry and the
Resistance, and Dave Jones, chairman of
the Committee for New Democratic
Politics. B. David Napier will talk at the
rally if he can return in time from a trip to
Tennessee.
Stanford students will be encouraged
to join the "walk" after the rally, and
rides are to be arranged from there. They
will spent Monday night at the Unitarian
Church in San Mateo. At 9:30 a.m., they
will leave from the San Mateo Peace
Center, on Second Ave., and they will be
stopping from 4-6 that afternoon at the
Church of Our Lady of Perpetual Help,
on Wellington St. in Daly City.

Supporters can meet them at either place.
They will be moving at about 2-3 miles an
hour, for those who want to join them in
between.
Candlelight Walk Tuesday
From there, they will go to the San
Francisco Civic Center. A crowd of
several hundred is expected for the
candlelight walk through the city
Tuesday evening.
A silent vigil will take place through
the night. There will be no public address
system, and an atmosphere of
non-violence and communication will be
encouraged.
Wednesday morning the vigil will
move to the Presidio. It is uncertain as yet
whether the trial will be in session there,
since the trial of the last "mutineer" took
place at a military installation in the
Mojave Desert.
Arrived in Palo Alto
The group, numbering about 35,
arrived at the Friends Meeting House in
Palo Alto last night. They were greeted
with a warm dinner, provided by the
Quakers and the Resistance, complete
with cupcakes decorated with the
Resistance symbol (omega).
One of their leaders, Paul Wesley, a
soft spoken Resistance worker from
Ireland, described the walk. "The first
day (Monday, Feb. 24) there were 14 of
us, including the dog. It was raining. We
walked 15 miles over the mountains. It
was really hard, but it brought us
together as a group. There was a very
beautiful feeling of togetherness."
As they walk, they try to stop and talk
to people about the mutiny, about

They have found many
sympathizers.
High School Students
One of the walkers, Dorothy
Obluda, told about a march of
200-300 sympathetic high school
students in San Francisco on
Saturday.
This is one example of the large
response generated by the walkers'
almost spontaneous demonstration
of concern. The War Resisters
League (WRL) in San Francisco,
the Resistance, and the Committee
for New Democratic Politics
(CNDP) at Stanford have all been

working this past week for
community awareness and
support.
"This is an ideal issue," said
Dave Jones, chairman of the
CNDP, "It is one in which the
whole community can become
involved because the issues are so
clearcut. "I hope this can be used
to demonstrate how the army has
become a self-perpetuating
institution, encroaching on areas
where there should be civilian
decision making."
He described the mutineers as
being "caught up in something so
dehumanizing that they couldn't
handle it."

Church in San Mateo. At 9:30 a.m., they
will leave from the San Mateo Peace
Center, on Second Ave., and they will be
stopping from 4-6 that afternoon at the
Church of Our Lady of Perpetual Help,
on Wellington St. in Daly City.

Supporters can meet them at either place.
They will be moving at about 2-3 miles an
hour, for those who want to join them in
between.
Candlelight Walk Tuesday
From there, they will go to the San
Francisco Civic Center. A crowd of
several hundred is expected for the
candlelight walk through the city
Tuesday evening.
A silent vigil will take place through
the night. There will be no public address
system, and an atmosphere of
non-violence and communication will be
encouraged.
Wednesday morning the vigil will
move to the Presidio. It is uncertain as yet
whether the trial will be in session there,
since the trial of the last "mutineer" took
place at a military installation in the
Mojave Desert.
Arrived in Palo Alto
The group, numbering about 35,
arrived at the Friends Meeting House in
Palo Alto last night. They were greeted
with a warm dinner, provided by the
Quakers and the Resistance, complete
with cupcakes decorated with the
Resistance symbol (omega).
One of their leaders, Paul Wesley, a
soft spoken Resistance worker from
Ireland, described the walk. "The first
day (Monday, Feb. 24) there were 14 of
us, including the dog. It was raining. We
walked 15 miles over the mountains. It
was really hard, but it brought us
together as a group. There was a very
beautiful feeling of togetherness."

non-violence and the military.
They have found many
sympathizers.
High School Students
One of the walkers, Dorothy
Obluda, told about a march of
200-300 sympathetic high school
students in San Francisco on
Saturday.
This is one example of the large
response generated by the walkers'
almost spontaneous demonstration
of concern. The War Resisters
League (WRL) in San Francisco,
the Resistance, and the Committee
for New Democratic Politics
(CNDP) at Stanford have all been

working this past week for
community awareness and
support.
"This is an ideal issue," said
Dave Jones, chairman of the
CNDP, "It is one in which the
whole community can become
involved because the issues are so
clearcut. "I hope this can be used
to demonstrate how the army has
become a self-perpetuating
institution, encroaching on areas
where there should be civilian
decision making."
He described the mutineers as
being "caught up in something so
dehumanizing that they couldn't
handle it."
Last Tuesday about 300 soldiers were
standing around on a training group at
Fort Ord. A small group of marchers
stopped by the road, holding up "V"
signs and a banner saying "Walk with the
Presidio 27."
The soldiers started to cheer. The
marchers began to sing "We Shall
Overcome" and with the verse "We shall
live in peace" the soldiers joined in. As
the marchers moved on, the soldiers
regrouped and gave them three cheers.
The marchers prefer to be called
"walkers." "We are not the military,"
one of them said. They emphasize the

nonviolent quality of their actions. They
are celebrating the spirit of the 27
soldiers charged with mutiny, who on
Oct. 11 sat down in the Presidio stockade
to protest the shooting of one of their
comrades.
Three days before their protest,
mentally disturbed Richard Bunch had
been shot while running from a work
detail after asking the guard to aim for his
head.
Sentences Inspired Walk
The sentencing of three of the
"mutineers" to 14-16 years
imprisonment inspired the walk from the
Institute of Non-Violence in Carmel to
the Presidio in San Francisco, which the
marchers call "the institute of violence."
Some representatives of the "walkers"
will be speaking at a noon rally today in
White Plaza. Dave Harris, former student
body president and organizer of the
Resistance, will also speak, as will the
organizers of the rally, Paul Rupert, of
the United Christian Ministry and the
Resistance, and Dave Jones, chairman of
the Committee for New Democratic
Politics. B. David Napier will talk at the
rally if he can return in time from a trip to
Tennessee.
Stanford students will be encouraged
to join the "walk" after the rally, and

of 27 Gls. A rally will be held in White Plaza today at noon, and the trek will conclude with a candlelight procession through San Francisco
tomorrow night.
non-violence and the military.
They have found many
sympathizers.
High School Students
One of the walkers, Dorothy
Obluda, told about a march of
200-300 sympathetic high school
students in San Francisco on
Saturday.
This is one example of the large
response generated by the walkers'
almost spontaneous demonstration
of concern. The War Resisters
League (WRL) in San Francisco,
the Resistance, and the Committee
for New Democratic Politics
(CNDP) at Stanford have all been

working this past week for
community awareness and
support.
"This is an ideal issue," said
Dave Jones, chairman of the
CNDP, "It is one in which the
whole community can become
involved because the issues are so
clearcut. "I hope this can be used
to demonstrate how the army has
become a self-perpetuating
institution, encroaching on areas
where there should be civilian
decision making."
He described the mutineers as
being "caught up in something so
dehumanizing that they couldn't
handle it."
Last Tuesday about 300 soldiers were
standing around on a training group at
Fort Ord. A small group of marchers
stopped by the road, holding up "V"
signs and a banner saying "Walk with the
Presidio 27."
The soldiers started to cheer. The
marchers began to sing "We Shall
Overcome" and with the verse "We shall
live in peace" the soldiers joined in. As
the marchers moved on, the soldiers
regrouped and gave them three cheers.
The marchers prefer to be called
"walkers." "We are not the military,"
one of them said. They emphasize the

nonviolent quality of their actions. They
are celebrating the spirit of the 27
soldiers charged with mutiny, who on
Oct. 11 sat down in the Presidio stockade
to protest the shooting of one of their
comrades.
Three days before their protest,
mentally disturbed Richard Bunch had
been shot while running from a work
detail after asking the guard to aim for his
head.
Sentences Inspired Walk
The sentencing of three of the
"mutineers" to 14-16 years
imprisonment inspired the walk from the
Institute of Non-Violence in Carmel to
the Presidio in San Francisco, which the
marchers call "the institute of violence."
Some representatives of the "walkers"
will be speaking at a noon rally today in
White Plaza. Dave Harris, former student
body president and organizer of the
Resistance, will also speak, as will the
organizers of the rally, Paul Rupert, of
the United Christian Ministry and the
Resistance, and Dave Jones, chairman of
the Committee for New Democratic
Politics. B. David Napier will talk at the
rally if he can return in time from a trip to
Tennessee.
Stanford students will be encouraged
to join the "walk" after the rally, and
rides are to be arranged from there. They
will spent Monday night at the Unitarian
Church in San Mateo. At 9:30 a.m., they
will leave from the San Mateo Peace
Center, on Second Ave., and they will be
stopping from 4-6 that afternoon at the
Church of Our Lady of Perpetual Help,
on Wellington St. in Daly City.

Supporters can meet them at either place.
They will be moving at about 2-3 miles an
hour, for those who want to join them in
between.
Candlelight Walk Tuesday
From there, they will go to the San
Francisco Civic Center. A crowd of
several hundred is expected for the
candlelight walk through the city
Tuesday evening.
A silent vigil will take place through
the night. There will be no public address
system, and an atmosphere of
non-violence and communication will be
encouraged.
Wednesday morning the vigil will
move to the Presidio. It is uncertain as yet
whether the trial will be in session there,
since the trial of the last "mutineer" took
place at a military installation in the
Mojave Desert.
Arrived in Palo Alto
The group, numbering about 35,
arrived at the Friends Meeting House in
Palo Alto last night. They were greeted
with a warm dinner, provided by the
Quakers and the Resistance, complete
with cupcakes decorated with the
Resistance symbol (omega).
One of their leaders, Paul Wesley, a
soft spoken Resistance worker from
Ireland, described the walk. "The first
day (Monday, Feb. 24) there were 14 of
us, including the dog. It was raining. We
walked 15 miles over the mountains. It
was really hard, but it brought us
together as a group. There was a very
beautiful feeling of togetherness."
As they walk, they try to stop and talk
to people about the mutiny, about
