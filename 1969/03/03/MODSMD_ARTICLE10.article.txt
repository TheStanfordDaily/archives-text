# SDS Strikes Out?
## 
### 
SDS is up against the wall.
Members of Students for a Democratic
Society are caught in a web of tight disciplin
ary sanctions, lack of student support, and
ineffective tactics.
Despite the often raucous judicial hear
ings, the Stanford Judicial Council (SJC) has
recommended substantially fair punishment
for 29 students who disrupted the January
trustee meeting. Suspended suspensions lie
between probation and outright suspension
or expulsion. As such, the sentence is the
strongest possible warning that any future
disruption will result in suspension. We sup
port this SJC ruling and the quick accept
ance and implementation by President Pit
zer.
Another part of the SJC recommendation
imposes fines on the students, ranging from
$300 for Steve Smith to $50 for 26 of the
demonstrators. Though time schedule for
payment of the fines is flexible, the basic
move of levying fines is questionable. Mone
tary punishment seems far out of context in
this case since little if any damage was done
to people or buildings.
The suspended suspensions leave little
room for future SDS activities. The Uni
versity undoubtedly will move swiftly to
suspend any of the 29 students should they
again violate a University policy. Since the
SJC recommended indefinite suspended sus
pension, the students involved are walking
on nails for their remaining stay at Stanford.
None of which would matter if SDS could
mount a successful campaign to challenge
the legitimacy of the judicial system. It will
be no small miracle if they succeed. The
judicial system has received the overwhelm
ing support of students in two elections and

equal support from the faculty. Last spring
an attack on the judicial system made sense.
This year it is a dead end street.
The options facing SDS are thus not very
wide or pleasant from a radical outlook. All
would not be lost, however, if SDS had any
support or respect among the broad base of
Stanford students. Judicial hang-ups and
judicial legitimacy would only be a tempo
rary roadblock to SDS if they had effectively
built a movement at Stanford.
They have not built a movement, largely
because their tactics have been insensitive to
most student and faculty opinion. SDS be
lieves in revolution. Somewhere along the
line, they forgot to muster support.
