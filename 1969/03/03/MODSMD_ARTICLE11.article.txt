Two weeks ago a small announcement
appeared in The Daily noting that appli
cations were being accepted for co-chairmen
of next fall's freshman and transfer Pre-
Registration program.
Two people applied.
Each September, about 1200 enthusias
tic, somewhat tense freshmen arrive on cam
pus for an "orientation" program. The style
and content of that program are largely es
tablished by the Pre-Reg co-chairmen.
First days, even hours at Stanford are
crucial for adjustment to a University en
vironment, appreciation of that community,
and the development of a critical, question
ing attitude about education and self.
Why do so few here seem to care about
those first moments? Applications are still
available in the ASSU office. Deadline for
completion is this Friday.
