## Can't Talk Without Civ? 
### Jack Kaplan 
At last Thursday's joint Aca
demic Senate-Student Education
Council meeting, I heard Robert
Walker utter the following words:
"One of the two main reasons
for requiring Western Civilization is
that it gives freshmen something to
talk about."
I was immediately struck by the
monumental Truth behind his
statement. The Truth and its impli
cations.
For the first time, I understood
the generation gap. The reason I
can't communicate with my
parents is-THEY HAVEN'T
TAKEN CIV. Of course! That ex
plains every thing!
They've never taken Civ!

Mom! Dad! How can you ex
pect to hold an intelligent conver
sation with me if you've never
taken Civ? What could we possibly
talk about? You don't even know
the difference between the Greeks'
and Roman's world views.
Why, you don't even know what
a world view is.
It's astonishing that we can say
anything at all to each other.
When I speak, what do you
hear? Take a relatively simple,
comparatively elementary sen
tence like "Good morning". Do
you understand me? I am wishing
you a pleasant 9 to 12 A.M. Can
you grasp that?
But what do I mean by "good"?
What do I mean by "pleasant"?

What do I mean by "morning"?
Am I using those terms in the
Platonic sense, as unique, un
changing Forms.
Did you say yes, mother? Dad,
did you agree? NO! NO!
I knew it. I just knew it. You
don't have the vaguest idea what I
mean, when I say "good morning".
Look. Only an Idealist believes
in Forms, right? And I'm not an
Idealist. At least in the Socratic
sense of the word.
I'm what Kant would refer to as
a Neo-Thomist. Augustine would
call me an Aristotelian Realist.
Don't you know that much about
your own son? God! What kind of
parents are you?
Wait! All is not lost! Perhaps
you can be saved through a
Socratic Dialogue . . .
You have to know my parents in
order to understand why the
Socratic Dialogue failed. They live
in this cave, see, chained so they
can see only what is in front of
them. It's hopeless.
MORAL: Western Civ should be
required of everybody, not just
Stanford students.
P.S. I recently wrote a letter to
the Director of Overseas Campuses,
withdrawing from France XVIII. I
explained in the letter that there
seemed little reason to go to
Europe. After all, what could I talk
to Frenchmen about? Do they
know anything about Homer?
Aquinas? Descartes? Virgil?
Seneca?
We would have nothing to talk
about.

Council meeting, I heard Robert
Walker utter the following words:
"One of the two main reasons
for requiring Western Civilization is
that it gives freshmen something to
talk about."
I was immediately struck by the
monumental Truth behind his
statement. The Truth and its impli
cations.
For the first time, I understood
the generation gap. The reason I
can't communicate with my
parents is-THEY HAVEN'T
TAKEN CIV. Of course! That ex
plains every thing!
They've never taken Civ!

Mom! Dad! How can you ex
pect to hold an intelligent conver
sation with me if you've never
taken Civ? What could we possibly
talk about? You don't even know
the difference between the Greeks'
and Roman's world views.
Why, you don't even know what
a world view is.
It's astonishing that we can say
anything at all to each other.
When I speak, what do you
hear? Take a relatively simple,
comparatively elementary sen
tence like "Good morning". Do
you understand me? I am wishing
you a pleasant 9 to 12 A.M. Can
you grasp that?
But what do I mean by "good"?
What do I mean by "pleasant"?

What do I mean by "morning"?
Am I using those terms in the
Platonic sense, as unique, un
changing Forms.
Did you say yes, mother? Dad,
did you agree? NO! NO!
I knew it. I just knew it. You
don't have the vaguest idea what I
mean, when I say "good morning".
Look. Only an Idealist believes
in Forms, right? And I'm not an
Idealist. At least in the Socratic
sense of the word.
I'm what Kant would refer to as
a Neo-Thomist. Augustine would
call me an Aristotelian Realist.
Don't you know that much about
your own son? God! What kind of
parents are you?
Wait! All is not lost! Perhaps
you can be saved through a
Socratic Dialogue . . .
You have to know my parents in
order to understand why the
Socratic Dialogue failed. They live
in this cave, see, chained so they
can see only what is in front of
them. It's hopeless.
MORAL: Western Civ should be
required of everybody, not just
Stanford students.
P.S. I recently wrote a letter to
the Director of Overseas Campuses,
withdrawing from France XVIII. I
explained in the letter that there
seemed little reason to go to
Europe. After all, what could I talk
to Frenchmen about? Do they
know anything about Homer?
Aquinas? Descartes? Virgil?
Seneca?
We would have nothing to talk
about.
