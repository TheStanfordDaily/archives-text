## Views Of Liberty 
### Vishist K. Vaid-Raizada 
The traditional role assigned to
the university transmission and
advancement of heritage-social,
cultural, scientific and
technological, has basically
remained unchanged, although its
interpretation has widened.
The twentieth century goals of
education as described by
Universal Declaration of Human
Rights are the "full development"
and strengthening of respect for
"human rights and fundamental
freedoms". The advancement of
human rights is also stressed by the
Charter of the International
Student Conference. It states that
the ultimate aim is the creation of
"Free University in a Free
Society". The emphasis on civil
liberties is a new dimension.
Student support for civil
liberties, although abundent,
differs considerably in different
parts of the world. A comparative
study made by Fulbright Scholars,
Messrs. Range and Mallappa, shows
that 80 percent of the students in
California prefer "the values of
individual liberty when it came
into conflict with other values," as
compared to 52 percent in Georgia
and 25 percent in India.
The belief that there is more
tolerance to non-conformists in
higher or prestigious professions
(teachers, lawyers, businessmen,

engineers, etc.) Mi disproved by this
study both in *?Fherica and India.
Most of the student supporters
of civil liberties, in both the
countries, come from blue-collar
worker families. In United States
more student supporters come
from social sciences and
humanities than from natural
sciences and business.
It is just the opposite in India,
most of the supporters are
majoring in natural sciences.
Perhaps, it is because of the high
grade Indian students preference
for sciences. The support for civil
liberties among the Indian students
declines with the increase in level
of education. It is contrary to the
American pattern; the more
educated a student, the more likely
he is to support the civil liberties.
It is not difficult to find
explanation for lack of support for
civil liberties among the Indian
students. The human rights
movement originated in the West.
It is only some decades ago, that it
started influencing the Indian and
Asian thinking. Moreover, in a
underdeveloped country with a
subsistence economy, preference
for other values rather than
individual liberty is
understandable.
