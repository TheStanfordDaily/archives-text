## Racism And 'Rights' Of BSU 
### 
Dr. Pitzer and THE DAILY:
I was shocked as were many
students by the immature and
irresponsible acts of the BSU on
campus February 20. I was even
more surprised when it was printed
in The Daily that no disciplinary
measures were planned by the
administration concerning these
acts of vandalism.
From my vantage point—quite
removed from the firing line which
you face almost every day on this
issue—it seems incredible that a
militant minority (and I don't
mean just the BSU) can so
intimidate our schools and our
society with just one weapon: fear.
Generally this is not so much fear
of personal danger but fear of being
branded "racist".
It is now about as unpopular to
be a "racist" as it was in the
McCarthy Era to be a
"Communist". The technique is
simple; if anyone opposes you, just
call them a " " (fill in the
blank according to the times). Thus
if we don't all fall in line to the BSU
tune we are obviously "racists".
Yes, there has indeed been a
sickness of racism directed mainly
against the Negro. No one is
arguing that point. But there is now
forming a mirror image of this
sickness. This sickness says that the
present white generation must
atone for the sins of the past white
generations by granting to our
black brothers rights which we
would not grant to any other
group: the "right" to break those
laws which displease them, the
"right" to enroll in a school even i f
unqualified, the "right" to pass a
course actually failed, the "right"
to a position not earned . . .
Granting these special "rights"
will contradict the very principle
the Civil Rights movement is
founded on: that one should be
judged on his own merits and not
on his color or his religion. If the

principle is important for our
"ends" it must be applied to our
"means".
The concept of the University is
one based on reason and fairness.
How is it then that the technique of
"demanding" became legitimized
in this environment? A "Demand"
by its nature is not a plea to reason
or fairness. It is, however, a perfect
vehicle for the aspiring demagogue,
who sees himself on the evening
news tweaking the nose of the
Establishment.
I am not a child psychologist
(but that would be good training
for dealing with elements of the
student protest movement).
However, when my child throws a
tantrum and rips books from the
shelf and overturns furniture (so
far he has done neither, but then he
is not yet a college student) I do
not stand idly by nor do I indulge
him by saying, "Now, now, I'm
sure we can sit down and discuss
this thing" nor do I expect him to
say that if I don't grant him some
more-or-less outrageous demand

that he will, at his pleasure, again
throw another tantrum.
Yet this seems to be what has
happened between your
administration and the BSU. You
have not only granted them the
"right" to Demand but you have
allowed a precedent by which they
may throw a "tantrum" if you
displease them. Can the rest of us
view this as a campus of order and
reason?
I believe that you have the best
intentions. The road to the present
situation at San Francisco State is
paved with good intentions. It's a
short road, by now well traveled,
and it leads to anarchy and the
antithesis on what a university
should stand for. Be stronger and
less embarrassed to deal with
naughty children. Otherwise the
children will undoubtably get
naughtier. (Perhaps I should make,
that in the form of a demand.)
There is a phrase that sticks in
my mind. It is the ritualistic chant,

"Racist pigs off campus!"
Currently I can think of no group
on campus more avowedly racist
than the BSU. Further, their
behavior last Thursday was most
piglike—rooting and looting
through the cafeteria and then
tearing through the bookstore.

Editor, THE DAILY:
I await with interest a Uni
versity statement regarding the
source of funds which will pay for
the damage to the bookstore
caused by members of the BSU.
In the meantime, may I suggest
the money come from the fund
established in the name of Martin
Luther King. King, who saw the
futility and retrogressive effects of
violence, would I am sure approve.

Dr. Pitzer and THE DAILY:
I was shocked as were many
students by the immature and
irresponsible acts of the BSU on
campus February 20. I was even
more surprised when it was printed
in The Daily that no disciplinary
measures were planned by the
administration concerning these
acts of vandalism.
From my vantage point—quite
removed from the firing line which
you face almost every day on this
issue—it seems incredible that a
militant minority (and I don't
mean just the BSU) can so
intimidate our schools and our
society with just one weapon: fear.
Generally this is not so much fear
of personal danger but fear of being
branded "racist".
It is now about as unpopular to
be a "racist" as it was in the
McCarthy Era to be a
"Communist". The technique is
simple; if anyone opposes you, just
call them a " " (fill in the
blank according to the times). Thus
if we don't all fall in line to the BSU
tune we are obviously "racists".
Yes, there has indeed been a
sickness of racism directed mainly
against the Negro. No one is
arguing that point. But there is now
forming a mirror image of this
sickness. This sickness says that the
present white generation must
atone for the sins of the past white
generations by granting to our
black brothers rights which we
would not grant to any other
group: the "right" to break those
laws which displease them, the
"right" to enroll in a school even i f
unqualified, the "right" to pass a
course actually failed, the "right"
to a position not earned . . .
Granting these special "rights"
will contradict the very principle
the Civil Rights movement is
founded on: that one should be
judged on his own merits and not
on his color or his religion. If the

principle is important for our
"ends" it must be applied to our
"means".
The concept of the University is
one based on reason and fairness.
How is it then that the technique of
"demanding" became legitimized
in this environment? A "Demand"
by its nature is not a plea to reason
or fairness. It is, however, a perfect
vehicle for the aspiring demagogue,
who sees himself on the evening
news tweaking the nose of the
Establishment.
I am not a child psychologist
(but that would be good training
for dealing with elements of the
student protest movement).
However, when my child throws a
tantrum and rips books from the
shelf and overturns furniture (so
far he has done neither, but then he
is not yet a college student) I do
not stand idly by nor do I indulge
him by saying, "Now, now, I'm
sure we can sit down and discuss
this thing" nor do I expect him to
say that if I don't grant him some
more-or-less outrageous demand

that he will, at his pleasure, again
throw another tantrum.
Yet this seems to be what has
happened between your
administration and the BSU. You
have not only granted them the
"right" to Demand but you have
allowed a precedent by which they
may throw a "tantrum" if you
displease them. Can the rest of us
view this as a campus of order and
reason?
I believe that you have the best
intentions. The road to the present
situation at San Francisco State is
paved with good intentions. It's a
short road, by now well traveled,
and it leads to anarchy and the
antithesis on what a university
should stand for. Be stronger and
less embarrassed to deal with
naughty children. Otherwise the
children will undoubtably get
naughtier. (Perhaps I should make,
that in the form of a demand.)
There is a phrase that sticks in
my mind. It is the ritualistic chant,

"Racist pigs off campus!"
Currently I can think of no group
on campus more avowedly racist
than the BSU. Further, their
behavior last Thursday was most
piglike—rooting and looting
through the cafeteria and then
tearing through the bookstore.

• Who Should Pay?
Editor, THE DAILY:
I await with interest a Uni
versity statement regarding the
source of funds which will pay for
the damage to the bookstore
caused by members of the BSU.
In the meantime, may I suggest
the money come from the fund
established in the name of Martin
Luther King. King, who saw the
futility and retrogressive effects of
violence, would I am sure approve.
