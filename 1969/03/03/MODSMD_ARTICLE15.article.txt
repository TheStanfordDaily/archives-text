# Hayes On Presidio
## 
### 
Editor,THE DAILY:
The Thursday Daily contained a
letter signed by 63 Soto residents
which protested the Presidio mur
der of Richard Bunch and the sub
sequent mutiny trials. The letter
also suggests that LASSU send
Kenneth Pitzer, Leonard Schiff,
and me to Washington to present a
personal protest to Nixon.
Because I think the concern evi
denced at Soto is wide-spread on
campus, I would like to state pub
licly just what my response to that
situation has been to date.
On Feb. 16 I organized a tele
gram, cosigned by the President of
the Berkeley student body, the edi
tor of the Daily Calitornian, and
the editor of the Stanford Daily,
which we sent to David Packard.
Copies were sent to Richard Nixon
and Melvin Laird.
The text of the telegram was as
follows:
"The recent conviction of three
men for "mutiny" at the Presidio
constitutes in itself a far greater
crime than any committed by the
defendants. Similar convictions
seem certain to follow.
"This gross miscarriage of jus
tice can arrouse only contempt and
anger among Americans of all po
litical persuasions.
"We urge you to begin an im
partial review of the military trial
immediately."
On February 22 I sent David
Packard a follow-up letter, contain
ing editorial and cartoon comment
on the case from Bay Area papers.
I will be in Washington this
week on some other matters, and I
will make every attempt to gain the
ears of some of the powerful in the
hopes of persuading them to undo
this travesty.
I do want all students to know
that I share their concern and will
do everything I can to represent
th is concern to the government.
In closing I would like to urge all
students to join the march to the
Presidio and the vigil, which are
scheduled on March 3, 4, and 5.
The people with the authority to
make final decisions about this case
are more likely to be concerned
about the magnitude of public con
cern over the injustice than with
the injustice itself.
A demonstration which does
not demonstrate enormous sup
port will be worse than no demon
stration at all.
