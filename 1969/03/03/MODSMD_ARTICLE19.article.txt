# Grading 'Inhumanity'
## Frosh Reflect Aspirations 
### 
Nearly all freshmen entering
Stanford plan to continue their
education beyond the
baccalaureate degree.
In so doing, many will be
following in their parents'
footsteps.
Practically all freshman believe
that "developing a philosophy of
life" is an essential or very

important part of their college
years.
One in four are undecided about
their career choice when they come
to Stanford—a sharp increase over
two years ago. Law, medicine,
engineering, research science, and
art are the five most popular
objectives. But almost half of those
who enroll say they may change

their career goals and their
academic majors while at Stanford.
These findings emerge from a
questionnaire administered to all
freshmen as part of a national
study by the American Council on
Education last fall.
Summarizing the highlights of
the survey findings for Stanford,
Director John Black of the
Counseling and Testing Center
says:
"Stanford undergraduates
constitute the largest aggregation
of intellectual talent, as measured
by high school achievement,
among all American institutions of
learning. They are also extremely
versatile young people who are
exceptionally motivated to pursue
graduate studies.
"Relative to other private
universities, Stanford has improved
its representation of racial and
religious minorities and of students
from families of lower economic
and educational levels, but these
groups continue to constitute
minute proportions of the
freshman class.
"Traditional Goals" Out
"There is a striking trend (since
1966) for increasing numbers of
Stanford freshmen to be unwilling
or unable to identify with
traditional career goals and for
them to view college primarily as
an opportunity for self-definition,
for autonomous exploration, for
discovering meaningful ways of
relating to others and serving
humanity,"
"Probably not more than half a
dozen universities have comparable
distributions of high school grade
point average," Black notes. "The
only serious competition is
Harvard, although a few smaller
institutions, such as Rice and
Caltech, are even more selective in
admissions."
The caliber of the entering class
"reinforces the need for revision in
traditional grading practices at
Stanford," Black suggests. "To
select over 90 percent of your
study body from the upper third of
the normal (grade) curve among all
freshmen and then attempt to
spread them out over the full range
of a normal A-to-F curve borders
on inhumanity to man.
"Such a practice also interferes
with education by promoting a
grade-conscious student body, by
creating anxieties which impair
effective learning, by stimulating
competition and discouraging
cooperative learning efforts.
Shortcomings
"These shortcomings are not
alleviated by allowing a few
pass-fail courses in a student's
program, particularly when his
sights are set on graduate and
professional school admission.
"Other prestige schools have
liberalized their grading practices
and the kinds of subjective
adjustments made by graduate
schools in evaluating grades from
the more selective institutions are
just not large enough to be fair to
our students."
Black strongly endorses changes
recently recommended by the
Study of Education at Stanford,
which would provide for straight
"A-B-C" letter grades and give
students the option of taking
unlimited courses on a simple
"pass" grade basis, with the
consent of the instructor and
department concerned.
Courses not successfully
completed would simply not count
as credit toward graduation.
Students would have the option of
repeating courses to obtain a higher
grade.
Given the caliber of students
who come to Stanford, Black
concludes, "perhaps the major
implication for all of us is the
enormous challenge and
responsibility which confronts us.
"To be entrusted with
contributing to the intellectual and

personal growth of such a
disproportionate share of
America's most lifted students is as
sobering as it is exciting."
More than half those who enter
Stanford plan to be in a university
for seven to nine years. Among
men, 93 percent plan to seek
postgraduate degrees. For women,
this proportion is 73 percent, Black
notes.
About two-thirds of the men
plan something higher than a
master's degree. Only seven
percent do not plan graduate
study.
Sources Of Motivation
"If the undergraduate years do
not have a direct and intimate
relationship to the student's
ultimate career plans, then he must
obviously rely on other sources of
motivation to elicit his best effort.
It may be this factor that kindles
the demands for 'relevance' and the
impatience with much of the
curriculum."
Nearly nine out of 10 Stanford
freshmen agree with the statement
that "students should have a major
role in specifying the college
curriculum" and seven out of 10
felt "faculty promotions should be
based in part on student
evaluations." Both those views
were in line with those expressed
by 29,000 entering students at 30
private universities in the ACE
study.
"It may be that some of the
(Stanford) students yearning for
closer relationships with the
faculty and for a greater sense of
equality in a mutual search for
knowledge arises from the fact that
one in three students sees himself
as a future Ph.D.," Black notes.
"The freshman's identification
with the faculty is frustrated by the
limitations of faculty time
available for him."
When asked to indicate which of
18 different educational objectives
they considered essential or very
important for their college years,
over 90 percent of the freshmen
picked "developing a philosophy
of life."
Two-thirds chose "helping
others who are in difficulty" and
"keeping up to date with political
affairs," while more than half said
their goals included "becoming an
authority in my subject field."
One in three mentioned "being
well off financially" and
"obtaining recognition from
colleagues in my field."
"Own Business"
About one in four cited "being
successful in my own business,"
"joining the Peace Corps or
VISTA," "Becoming a community
leader" and "writing original
works."
Compared with two years ago,
Black says,"the current freshmen
value somewhat less the traditional
goals of our society, particularly
those that could be described as
materialistic or oriented toward
business.
"There is also less importance
attached to some objectives that
might imply a high degree of
specialization." Thus, contributing
to scientific theory and having
administrative responsibility
dropped substantially among the
goals chosen by current freshmen.
Asked their views on
controversial issues, Black reports,
"Students strongly reject in loco
parentis and favor student
autonomy and student influence
on faculty and curriculum.
"If they feel this way during
orientation week, one can
anticipate that the strength of
these sentiments will probably
grow during the ensuing years.
During the past year, eight
percent reported they had
protested against the Vietnam war,
11 percent said they had protested
against racial discrimination, and
20 percent protested against their
high schools.
Only one in three agreed that
"realistically, an individual can do
little to bring about changes in our
society." More than half (59
percent) felt only volunteers
should serve in the armed forces,
and about half (47 percent) said
marijuana should be legalized.

education beyond the

"pass" grade basis, with the
consent of the instructor and
department concerned.
Courses not successfully
completed would simply not count
as credit toward graduation.
Students would have the option of
repeating courses to obtain a higher
grade.
Given the caliber of students
who come to Stanford, Black
concludes, "perhaps the major
implication for all of us is the
enormous challenge and
responsibility which confronts us.
"To be entrusted with
contributing to the intellectual and

personal growth of such a
disproportionate share of
America's most lifted students is as
sobering as it is exciting."
More than half those who enter
Stanford plan to be in a university
for seven to nine years. Among
men, 93 percent plan to seek
postgraduate degrees. For women,
this proportion is 73 percent, Black
notes.
About two-thirds of the men
plan something higher than a
master's degree. Only seven
percent do not plan graduate
study.
Sources Of Motivation
"If the undergraduate years do
not have a direct and intimate
relationship to the student's
ultimate career plans, then he must
obviously rely on other sources of
motivation to elicit his best effort.
It may be this factor that kindles
the demands for 'relevance' and the
impatience with much of the
curriculum."
Nearly nine out of 10 Stanford
freshmen agree with the statement
that "students should have a major
role in specifying the college
curriculum" and seven out of 10
felt "faculty promotions should be
based in part on student
evaluations." Both those views
were in line with those expressed
by 29,000 entering students at 30
private universities in the ACE
study.
"It may be that some of the
(Stanford) students yearning for
closer relationships with the
faculty and for a greater sense of
equality in a mutual search for
knowledge arises from the fact that
one in three students sees himself
as a future Ph.D.," Black notes.
"The freshman's identification
with the faculty is frustrated by the
limitations of faculty time
available for him."
When asked to indicate which of
18 different educational objectives
they considered essential or very
important for their college years,
over 90 percent of the freshmen
picked "developing a philosophy
of life."
Two-thirds chose "helping
others who are in difficulty" and
"keeping up to date with political
affairs," while more than half said
their goals included "becoming an
authority in my subject field."
One in three mentioned "being
well off financially" and
"obtaining recognition from
colleagues in my field."
"Own Business"
About one in four cited "being
successful in my own business,"
"joining the Peace Corps or
VISTA," "Becoming a community
leader" and "writing original
works."
Compared with two years ago,
Black says,"the current freshmen
value somewhat less the traditional
goals of our society, particularly
those that could be described as
materialistic or oriented toward
business.
"There is also less importance
attached to some objectives that
might imply a high degree of
specialization." Thus, contributing
to scientific theory and having
administrative responsibility
dropped substantially among the
goals chosen by current freshmen.
Asked their views on
controversial issues, Black reports,
"Students strongly reject in loco
parentis and favor student
autonomy and student influence
on faculty and curriculum.
"If they feel this way during
orientation week, one can
anticipate that the strength of
these sentiments will probably
grow during the ensuing years.
During the past year, eight
percent reported they had
protested against the Vietnam war,
11 percent said they had protested
against racial discrimination, and
20 percent protested against their
high schools.
Only one in three agreed that
"realistically, an individual can do
little to bring about changes in our
society." More than half (59
percent) felt only volunteers
should serve in the armed forces,
and about half (47 percent) said
marijuana should be legalized.
Nearly all freshmen entering
Stanford plan to continue their
education beyond the
baccalaureate degree.
In so doing, many will be
following in their parents'
footsteps.
Practically all freshman believe
that "developing a philosophy of
life" is an essential or very

important part of their college
years.
One in four are undecided about
their career choice when they come
to Stanford—a sharp increase over
two years ago. Law, medicine,
engineering, research science, and
art are the five most popular
objectives. But almost half of those
who enroll say they may change

their career goals and their
academic majors while at Stanford.
These findings emerge from a
questionnaire administered to all
freshmen as part of a national
study by the American Council on
Education last fall.
Summarizing the highlights of
the survey findings for Stanford,
Director John Black of the
Counseling and Testing Center
says:
"Stanford undergraduates
constitute the largest aggregation
of intellectual talent, as measured
by high school achievement,
among all American institutions of
learning. They are also extremely
versatile young people who are
exceptionally motivated to pursue
graduate studies.
"Relative to other private
universities, Stanford has improved
its representation of racial and
religious minorities and of students
from families of lower economic
and educational levels, but these
groups continue to constitute
minute proportions of the
freshman class.
"Traditional Goals" Out
"There is a striking trend (since
1966) for increasing numbers of
Stanford freshmen to be unwilling
or unable to identify with
traditional career goals and for
them to view college primarily as
an opportunity for self-definition,
for autonomous exploration, for
discovering meaningful ways of
relating to others and serving
humanity,"
"Probably not more than half a
dozen universities have comparable
distributions of high school grade
point average," Black notes. "The
only serious competition is
Harvard, although a few smaller
institutions, such as Rice and
Caltech, are even more selective in
admissions."
The caliber of the entering class
"reinforces the need for revision in
traditional grading practices at
Stanford," Black suggests. "To
select over 90 percent of your
study body from the upper third of
the normal (grade) curve among all
freshmen and then attempt to
spread them out over the full range
of a normal A-to-F curve borders
on inhumanity to man.
"Such a practice also interferes
with education by promoting a
grade-conscious student body, by
creating anxieties which impair
effective learning, by stimulating
competition and discouraging
cooperative learning efforts.
Shortcomings
"These shortcomings are not
alleviated by allowing a few
pass-fail courses in a student's
program, particularly when his
sights are set on graduate and
professional school admission.
"Other prestige schools have
liberalized their grading practices
and the kinds of subjective
adjustments made by graduate
schools in evaluating grades from
the more selective institutions are
just not large enough to be fair to
our students."
Black strongly endorses changes
recently recommended by the
Study of Education at Stanford,
which would provide for straight
"A-B-C" letter grades and give
students the option of taking
unlimited courses on a simple
"pass" grade basis, with the
consent of the instructor and
department concerned.
Courses not successfully
completed would simply not count
as credit toward graduation.

controversial issues, Black reports,
"Students strongly reject in loco
parentis and favor student
autonomy and student influence
on faculty and curriculum.
"If they feel this way during
orientation week, one can
anticipate that the strength of
these sentiments will probably
grow during the ensuing years.
During the past year, eight
percent reported they had
protested against the Vietnam war,
11 percent said they had protested
against racial discrimination, and
20 percent protested against their
high schools.
Only one in three agreed that
"realistically, an individual can do
little to bring about changes in our
society." More than half (59
percent) felt only volunteers
should serve in the armed forces,
and about half (47 percent) said
marijuana should be legalized.
Nearly all freshmen entering
Stanford plan to continue their
education beyond the
baccalaureate degree.
In so doing, many will be
following in their parents'
footsteps.
Practically all freshman believe
that "developing a philosophy of
life" is an essential or very

important part of their college
years.
One in four are undecided about
their career choice when they come
to Stanford—a sharp increase over
two years ago. Law, medicine,
engineering, research science, and
art are the five most popular
objectives. But almost half of those
who enroll say they may change

their career goals and their
academic majors while at Stanford.
These findings emerge from a
questionnaire administered to all
freshmen as part of a national
study by the American Council on
Education last fall.
Summarizing the highlights of
the survey findings for Stanford,
Director John Black of the
Counseling and Testing Center
says:
"Stanford undergraduates
constitute the largest aggregation
of intellectual talent, as measured
by high school achievement,
among all American institutions of
learning. They are also extremely
versatile young people who are
exceptionally motivated to pursue
graduate studies.
"Relative to other private
universities, Stanford has improved
its representation of racial and
religious minorities and of students
from families of lower economic
and educational levels, but these
groups continue to constitute
minute proportions of the
freshman class.
"Traditional Goals" Out
"There is a striking trend (since
1966) for increasing numbers of
Stanford freshmen to be unwilling
or unable to identify with
traditional career goals and for
them to view college primarily as
an opportunity for self-definition,
for autonomous exploration, for
discovering meaningful ways of
relating to others and serving
humanity,"
"Probably not more than half a
dozen universities have comparable
distributions of high school grade
point average," Black notes. "The
only serious competition is
Harvard, although a few smaller
institutions, such as Rice and
Caltech, are even more selective in
admissions."
The caliber of the entering class
"reinforces the need for revision in
traditional grading practices at
Stanford," Black suggests. "To
select over 90 percent of your
study body from the upper third of
the normal (grade) curve among all
freshmen and then attempt to
spread them out over the full range
of a normal A-to-F curve borders
on inhumanity to man.
"Such a practice also interferes
with education by promoting a
grade-conscious student body, by
creating anxieties which impair
effective learning, by stimulating
competition and discouraging
cooperative learning efforts.
Shortcomings
"These shortcomings are not
alleviated by allowing a few
pass-fail courses in a student's
program, particularly when his
sights are set on graduate and
professional school admission.
"Other prestige schools have
liberalized their grading practices
and the kinds of subjective
adjustments made by graduate
schools in evaluating grades from
the more selective institutions are
just not large enough to be fair to
our students."
Black strongly endorses changes
recently recommended by the
Study of Education at Stanford,
which would provide for straight
"A-B-C" letter grades and give
students the option of taking
unlimited courses on a simple
"pass" grade basis, with the
consent of the instructor and
department concerned.
Courses not successfully
completed would simply not count
as credit toward graduation.
Students would have the option of
repeating courses to obtain a higher
grade.
Given the caliber of students
who come to Stanford, Black
concludes, "perhaps the major
implication for all of us is the
enormous challenge and
responsibility which confronts us.
"To be entrusted with
contributing to the intellectual and

personal growth of such a
disproportionate share of
America's most lifted students is as
sobering as it is exciting."
More than half those who enter
Stanford plan to be in a university
for seven to nine years. Among
men, 93 percent plan to seek
postgraduate degrees. For women,
this proportion is 73 percent, Black
notes.
About two-thirds of the men
plan something higher than a
master's degree. Only seven
percent do not plan graduate
study.
Sources Of Motivation
"If the undergraduate years do
not have a direct and intimate
relationship to the student's
ultimate career plans, then he must
obviously rely on other sources of
motivation to elicit his best effort.
It may be this factor that kindles
the demands for 'relevance' and the
impatience with much of the
curriculum."
Nearly nine out of 10 Stanford
freshmen agree with the statement
that "students should have a major
role in specifying the college
curriculum" and seven out of 10
felt "faculty promotions should be
based in part on student
evaluations." Both those views
were in line with those expressed
by 29,000 entering students at 30
private universities in the ACE
study.
"It may be that some of the
(Stanford) students yearning for
closer relationships with the
faculty and for a greater sense of
equality in a mutual search for
knowledge arises from the fact that
one in three students sees himself
as a future Ph.D.," Black notes.
"The freshman's identification
with the faculty is frustrated by the
limitations of faculty time
available for him."
When asked to indicate which of
18 different educational objectives
they considered essential or very
important for their college years,
over 90 percent of the freshmen
picked "developing a philosophy
of life."
Two-thirds chose "helping
others who are in difficulty" and
"keeping up to date with political
affairs," while more than half said
their goals included "becoming an
authority in my subject field."
One in three mentioned "being
well off financially" and
"obtaining recognition from
colleagues in my field."
"Own Business"
About one in four cited "being
successful in my own business,"
"joining the Peace Corps or
VISTA," "Becoming a community
leader" and "writing original
works."
Compared with two years ago,
Black says,"the current freshmen
value somewhat less the traditional
goals of our society, particularly
those that could be described as
materialistic or oriented toward
business.
"There is also less importance
attached to some objectives that
might imply a high degree of
specialization." Thus, contributing
to scientific theory and having
administrative responsibility
dropped substantially among the
goals chosen by current freshmen.

creating anxieties which impair
effective learning, by stimulating
competition and discouraging
cooperative learning efforts.
Shortcomings
"These shortcomings are not
alleviated by allowing a few
pass-fail courses in a student's
program, particularly when his
sights are set on graduate and
professional school admission.
"Other prestige schools have
liberalized their grading practices
and the kinds of subjective
adjustments made by graduate
schools in evaluating grades from
the more selective institutions are
just not large enough to be fair to
our students."
Black strongly endorses changes
recently recommended by the
Study of Education at Stanford,
which would provide for straight
"A-B-C" letter grades and give
students the option of taking
unlimited courses on a simple
"pass" grade basis, with the
consent of the instructor and
department concerned.
Courses not successfully
completed would simply not count
as credit toward graduation.
Students would have the option of
repeating courses to obtain a higher
grade.
Given the caliber of students
who come to Stanford, Black
concludes, "perhaps the major
implication for all of us is the
enormous challenge and
responsibility which confronts us.
"To be entrusted with
contributing to the intellectual and

personal growth of such a
disproportionate share of
America's most lifted students is as
sobering as it is exciting."
More than half those who enter
Stanford plan to be in a university
for seven to nine years. Among
men, 93 percent plan to seek
postgraduate degrees. For women,
this proportion is 73 percent, Black
notes.
About two-thirds of the men
plan something higher than a
master's degree. Only seven
percent do not plan graduate
study.
Sources Of Motivation
"If the undergraduate years do
not have a direct and intimate
relationship to the student's
ultimate career plans, then he must
obviously rely on other sources of
motivation to elicit his best effort.
It may be this factor that kindles
the demands for 'relevance' and the
impatience with much of the
curriculum."
Nearly nine out of 10 Stanford
freshmen agree with the statement
that "students should have a major
role in specifying the college
curriculum" and seven out of 10
felt "faculty promotions should be
based in part on student
evaluations." Both those views
were in line with those expressed
by 29,000 entering students at 30
private universities in the ACE
study.
"It may be that some of the
(Stanford) students yearning for
closer relationships with the
faculty and for a greater sense of
equality in a mutual search for
knowledge arises from the fact that
one in three students sees himself
as a future Ph.D.," Black notes.
"The freshman's identification
with the faculty is frustrated by the
limitations of faculty time
available for him."
When asked to indicate which of
18 different educational objectives
they considered essential or very
important for their college years,
over 90 percent of the freshmen
picked "developing a philosophy
of life."
Two-thirds chose "helping
others who are in difficulty" and
"keeping up to date with political
affairs," while more than half said
their goals included "becoming an
authority in my subject field."
One in three mentioned "being
well off financially" and
"obtaining recognition from
colleagues in my field."
"Own Business"
About one in four cited "being
successful in my own business,"
"joining the Peace Corps or
VISTA," "Becoming a community
leader" and "writing original
works."
Compared with two years ago,
Black says,"the current freshmen
value somewhat less the traditional
goals of our society, particularly
those that could be described as
materialistic or oriented toward
business.
"There is also less importance
attached to some objectives that
might imply a high degree of
specialization." Thus, contributing
to scientific theory and having
administrative responsibility
dropped substantially among the
goals chosen by current freshmen.
Asked their views on
controversial issues, Black reports,
"Students strongly reject in loco
parentis and favor student
autonomy and student influence
on faculty and curriculum.
"If they feel this way during
orientation week, one can
anticipate that the strength of
these sentiments will probably
grow during the ensuing years.
During the past year, eight
percent reported they had
protested against the Vietnam war,
11 percent said they had protested
against racial discrimination, and
20 percent protested against their
high schools.
Only one in three agreed that
"realistically, an individual can do
little to bring about changes in our
society." More than half (59
percent) felt only volunteers
should serve in the armed forces,
and about half (47 percent) said
marijuana should be legalized.
