# Frat Rush Tonight
## 
### FRANK MILLER 
Tonight at all fraternities begins
formal rush procedures for freshmen and
transfer students.
Fraternities will be open from 7:15 to
9:30 p.m. in order to give students an
opportunity to meet the members of the
fraternity and to look at the living
conditions.
The open house tonight will be
followed by similar open houses on
Wednesday and Thursday nights when
half the houses will be open each night. A
new event in rush this year is the
informal, Saturday afternoon open
houses at all fraternities scheduled next
Saturday from 1:00 to 6:00 p.m.
Volleyball, football, and talk will
characterize this open afternoon.
According to rush chairman Jay Voss,
a senior in economics, "anyone is invited
to visit the fraternities and to try to find a
few that he feels comfortable in. Even
those not very interested are encouraged
to visit fraternities so that they will not
eliminate the alternative of fraternity
living without looking at it."
Rush Events
Although rush is designed primarily
for freshmen and transfer students, any
male student may participate in rush
events.
A fraternity book listing the members,
their activities, years, majors, living costs
in each fraternity, average grade point
average for the house, etc., will be
distributed to all freshmen today or
tomorrow. This will furnish
freshmen an opportunity to
compare the fraternities in some
way without visiting each one.
Rush follows a two week meal
orientation program just
concluded designed to expose
freshmen to fraternity life. Besides
the open houses this week, there
will be two open houses and an
open afternoon in the first week of
spring quarter. Bids inviting
students to join a fraternity may be
issued on April 11.
Starting today, fraternities are
allowed to invite a maximum of
seven freshmen to any of their
functions. Voss indicated that this
informal contact is the central
point of rush. "The formal open
houses are so that no one is shut
out of fraternities. It is primarily a
show of interest and a chance
where the rushes can ask any
questions and get to know a few
people.
"If a fraternity is interested in a
guy, they will invite him up for
some activity—a party, dinner, a
volleyball game, a pizza run. The

only way fraternities know if
someone is interested in a
fraternity is if he comes to the open
house. A lot of guys will be invited
up for meals."
Voss continued that interested
students are encouraged to visit a
number of houses they thought
they might be interested in this
week and hopefully narrow it
down to two or three by talking
with friends. Spring quarter they
could then concentrate on meeting
members of just a few fraternities.
All fraternity members will be
at the open houses and rusheeswill
have an opportunity to meet the
members, tour the house, and ask
any questions they want to.
Refreshments will be served and all
students who come to a fraternity
will be asked to sign an attendance
book which is the only formal
record of who visits any fraternity.
In breaking with tradition this
year, freshmen and visitors will not
be required to wear a coat and tie.
Any dress that is comfortable is
encouraged.
Rush is more concentrated this
year than in the past. It has started
as early as the middle of February.

However, the parties which end
rush have been moved back a week
to April 11 and 12 in order to allow
for an extra week of intensive rush
during the early part, of spring
quarter.
The meal orientation program
which was designed to expose
freshmen to fraternity living in
several different houses, received
both support and criticism from
freshmen but most thought that
the idea was a good one.
Comments varied from"it was
extremely beneficial" to "some of
the fraternities didn't seem very
interested in the freshmen—it was
poorly organized."
Voss indicated that fraternities
had run into organizational
problems. About 40 per cent of the
freshmen participated in the
program and they all had to be
contacted by phone. Voss said that
the fraternities sometimes had
difficulty getting in touch with the
freshmen. Also, a ccrtain
inequality in the program in that
some freshmen had an opportunity
to *at at as many as eight different
fraternities while others could only
visit two or three.

allowed to invite a maximum of
seven freshmen to any of their
functions. Voss indicated that this
informal contact is the central
point of rush. "The formal open
houses are so that no one is shut
out of fraternities. It is primarily a
show of interest and a chance
where the rushes can ask any
questions and get to know a few
people.
"If a fraternity is interested in a
guy, they will invite him up for
some activity—a party, dinner, a
volleyball game, a pizza run. The

only way fraternities know if
someone is interested in a
fraternity is if he comes to the open
house. A lot of guys will be invited
up for meals."
Voss continued that interested
students are encouraged to visit a
number of houses they thought
they might be interested in this
week and hopefully narrow it
down to two or three by talking
with friends. Spring quarter they
could then concentrate on meeting
members of just a few fraternities.
All fraternity members will be
at the open houses and rusheeswill
have an opportunity to meet the
members, tour the house, and ask
any questions they want to.
Refreshments will be served and all
students who come to a fraternity
will be asked to sign an attendance
book which is the only formal
record of who visits any fraternity.
In breaking with tradition this
year, freshmen and visitors will not
be required to wear a coat and tie.
Any dress that is comfortable is
encouraged.
Rush is more concentrated this
year than in the past. It has started
as early as the middle of February.

However, the parties which end
rush have been moved back a week
to April 11 and 12 in order to allow
for an extra week of intensive rush
during the early part, of spring
quarter.
The meal orientation program
which was designed to expose
freshmen to fraternity living in
several different houses, received
both support and criticism from
freshmen but most thought that
the idea was a good one.
Comments varied from"it was
extremely beneficial" to "some of
the fraternities didn't seem very
interested in the freshmen—it was
poorly organized."
Voss indicated that fraternities
had run into organizational
problems. About 40 per cent of the
freshmen participated in the
program and they all had to be
contacted by phone. Voss said that
the fraternities sometimes had
difficulty getting in touch with the
freshmen. Also, a ccrtain
inequality in the program in that
some freshmen had an opportunity
to *at at as many as eight different
fraternities while others could only
visit two or three.
Tonight at all fraternities begins
formal rush procedures for freshmen and
transfer students.
Fraternities will be open from 7:15 to
9:30 p.m. in order to give students an
opportunity to meet the members of the
fraternity and to look at the living
conditions.
The open house tonight will be
followed by similar open houses on
Wednesday and Thursday nights when
half the houses will be open each night. A
new event in rush this year is the
informal, Saturday afternoon open
houses at all fraternities scheduled next
Saturday from 1:00 to 6:00 p.m.
Volleyball, football, and talk will
characterize this open afternoon.
According to rush chairman Jay Voss,
a senior in economics, "anyone is invited
to visit the fraternities and to try to find a
few that he feels comfortable in. Even
those not very interested are encouraged
to visit fraternities so that they will not
eliminate the alternative of fraternity
living without looking at it."
Rush Events
Although rush is designed primarily
for freshmen and transfer students, any
male student may participate in rush
events.
A fraternity book listing the members,
their activities, years, majors, living costs
in each fraternity, average grade point
average for the house, etc., will be
distributed to all freshmen today or
tomorrow. This will furnish
freshmen an opportunity to
compare the fraternities in some
way without visiting each one.
Rush follows a two week meal
orientation program just
concluded designed to expose
freshmen to fraternity life. Besides
the open houses this week, there
will be two open houses and an
open afternoon in the first week of
spring quarter. Bids inviting
students to join a fraternity may be
issued on April 11.
Starting today, fraternities are
allowed to invite a maximum of
seven freshmen to any of their
functions. Voss indicated that this
informal contact is the central
point of rush. "The formal open
