# Frat Rush Tonight
## 
### FRANK MILLER 
Tonight at all fraternities begins
formal rush procedures for freshmen and
transfer students.
Fraternities will be open from 7:15 to
9:30 p.m. in order to give students an
opportunity to meet the members of the
fraternity and to look at the living
conditions.
The open house tonight will be
followed by similar open houses on
Wednesday and Thursday nights when
half the houses will be open each night. A
new event in rush this year is the
informal, Saturday afternoon open
houses at all fraternities scheduled next
Saturday from 1:00 to 6:00 p.m.
Volleyball, football, and talk will
characterize this open afternoon.
According to rush chairman Jay Voss,
a senior in economics, "anyone is invited
to visit the fraternities and to try to find a
few that he feels comfortable in. Even
those not very interested are encouraged
to visit fraternities so that they will not
eliminate the alternative of fraternity
living without looking at it."
Rush Events
Although rush is designed primarily
for freshmen and transfer students, any
male student may participate in rush
events.
A fraternity book listing the members,
their activities, years, majors, living costs
in each fraternity, average grade point
average for the house, etc., will be
distributed to all freshmen today or
