# Happening Becomes Theater
## 
### 
Four nights a week every week
since January, a creative
"happening" has been developing
in Toyon Lounge. It has now
emerged into an entertaining
dramatic experince.
Don Currie's original play She
Got Out begins with the
appearance of five women draped
in saran wrap, visually niscent of
film stars in the 1940'5. The
women slowly strip themselves
physically, ver bally, and
emotionally until they at last break
loose. The play climaxes in a wild
orgiastic dance with a live rock
band in which the audience is
encouraged to join the act ion.
The second performance on the
evening's program is Beckett's
"Play". It presents the idea of
non-action.
"She Got Out" and "Play" will
be presented in Toyon Lounge at
8:00 p.m. on March 4, 5, 6, 7.
Tickets for the program are $1.50,
or, for blocks of 20 or more, $ 1.00.
Call X 4336 for block ticket
information.

"SHE GOT OUT"â€”Actors in "She Col Out" (1. to r.) Lyn Dusenberry, Polly
Adams, katliy Williams and Gail Anderson play would-be starlets who revolt against
the artificialities of the commercial world and create their own, more fulfilling
images. Don Currie's original play will be presented with Samual Ileckett's "Play" in
Toyon Lounge beginning Mar. 4 and the evening will be, according to Currie, "a
theatrical trip".
