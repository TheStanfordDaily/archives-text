# Judicial Council Decision On Faculty Club Incident
## 
### 
STATEMENT OF THE PROCEEDINGS
On January 15, 1969, the Stanford Judicial
Council was notified by the office of the Dean of
Students that on the previous day a group of
persons, believed primarily to be Stanford
students, had allegedly disrupted a meeting of the
University Board of Trustees which had been held
at the Stanford Faculty Club. The Council was
asked to investigate.
Pursuant to the Legislative and Judicial Charter
of 1968, the Council sent out five judicial aides to
investigate and interview witnesses. The judicial
aides made a comprehensive report to the Council
which included photographs, lists of witnesses and
participants, transcripts of tape-recorded
interviews of many persons, and additional
statements, including those of a number of
potential defendants.
At the Council's behest, the Chairman
examined the report and, on the basis of the
information therein, determined to call before
him, and one other member of the Council sitting
with him, some thirty-nine persons for the purpose
of charging them with violations of the Campus
Policy on Disruptions of October 7, 1968, and of
the Fundamental Standard, and to show each the
evidence the Council had obtained through its
judicial aides regarding his activities.
The letter summoning these persons was sent
by mail; in addition a copy of the letter was
personally served on each of them. The letter
contained the following:
(1) A statement that the person was charged
with violations of the Disruption Policy and
of the Fundamental Standard.
(2) An outline of proceedings to be followed
during trial of the case.
(3) A copy of the Council's rules containing
the rights of defendants as set out in the
Legislative and Judicial Charter of 1968.
(4) A date and time to appear before the
Chairman of the Council for a conference.
Each person summoned duly appeared with the
sole exception of Jack Gerson, who has at no time
appeared or taken part in these proceedings.
The Council Chairman, sitting with at least one
other member of the Council, showed each
defendant the evidence regarding his activities and
explained to each defendant the procedure to be
followed for trial. That procedure required a
bifurcated hearing. The first hearing would be
designed solely to determine what acts each
student had, or had not committed; the second
hearing would be devoted solely to matters of
motivation.
With but one exception, Fred Cohen, who was
also charged with acts of intimidation, each
student, for purposes of the present hearings, was
charged only with having disrupted the Board of
Trustees meeting; no specific acts of violence,
threats, etc. were alleged. [Defendant James
Johnson was also charged with having set a false
fire alarm but all hearings on this charge were
suspended pending decision on such a charge in the
county civil courts. ]
Every defendant was given an opportunity to
admit to the charge against him. He was told that
to do so would eliminate the need for the first
hearing in his case, but that he would still be
permitted to do three things;
(1) Take part in the motivational hearing.
(2) Argue the invalidity of the Campus Policy
on Disruptions.
(3) Argue that the Fundamental Standard does
not cover disruption without a showing of
specific acts such as violence, threats,
blocking access of other persons, etc.
Each student was further informed that any
specific facts regarding his individual conduct
which were brought out during a fact hearing
would be considered by the Council in deciding his
case.
Although defendants were told they had a right
to remain silent, many wished to discuss the nature
of their participation. On the basis of their
statements and the Council's continuing
investigation of the case, charges were withdrawn
against nine persons. Of the remaining twenty-nine
defendants, the following twelve initially decided
to admit to the charges against them:
Allen Christelow
Richard Greenspan
HallamC. Hamilton
Carolyn M. Iverson
Barbara E. Lee
Michael M. Morton
Christine M. Mrak
Jeffrey J. Preefer
Guy D. Smyth
Don P. Stuart
D. Jeffrey Weil
Helen K. Williams
Thereafter, two additional students, Irwin
Busse and Marc Weiss, also decided to admit the
charges against them. Thus, when the case
proceeded to the first hearing, only the following
fifteen students were involved:
John W. Avery
Anne C. Bauer
Richard F. Bogart
Fred H. Cohen
Marc D. Heller
James E. Johnson
Virginia A. Linsley
David F. Pugh
George C. Reinhardt
James E. Shoch
Leonard M. Siegel
Stephen S. Smith
Michael D. Vawter
Joan Williams (Mrs. Rodney W.)
Rodney W. Williams
This factual hearing was open to the public and
took place on February 11, 12 and 13.
Considerable evidence was received, including the
testimony of some 24 witnesses.
The motivational hearing, also open to the
public, was held on February 21. All twenty-nine
defendants subscribed to an organized
presentation of their views. Thereafter each
defendant was given an opportunity to add further
information on his own behalf.
STATEMENT OF THE GENERAL FACTS
On the basis of the evidence presented during
the hearings, the Council finds the following facts:
At the October 1968 meeting of the Stanford
University Board of Trustees, a student, Yale
Braunstein, Speaker of the Student Legislature,
was permitted to address the board members,
urging them to hold open meetings with students.
The Board Chairman, shortly thereafter, wrote a
letter to Mr. Braunstein, thanking him for his
remarks but not specifically mentioning the issue
of open meetings. Mr. Braunstein replied with a
letter to the Board Chairman emphasizing the
importance of the open-meeting request.
Although at both the November 1968 and January
14, 1969 meetings of the Board, student leaders
were invited to and did sit with a number of Board
committees, the Board made no statement, either
to Mr. Braunstein or the Stanford student body at
large, concerning meetings of the Board itself,
which would be open to members of the Stanford
community.
On the morning of January 14,1969, a group of
students circulated throughout the campus a
document requesting that all interested persons

arrive at Bowman Alumni House at 12:30 p.m. for
the purpose of holding an open meeting with the
trustees. The document contained nine specific
demands regarding the operations of the
University and the Stanford Research Institute.
At approximately 12:30 p.m., when a group of
students had collected at Bowman, they learned
that the trustees were at the Stanford Faculty
Club. The students then held a meeting to
determine what action to take. At about this time
Associate Dean of Students, Willard Wyman,
entered Bowman where one of the students
demanded that Wyman carry a message to the
trustees asking for an open meeting. Although he
made it clear that he was not a "messenger boy"
for the students, Dean Wyman nevertheless did in
fact go to the Faculty Club to tell members of the
University administration, including President
Pitzer, that a group of students at Bowman wished
to have an open meeting with the trustees and
would not leave Bowman until such a meeting was
arranged.
Shortly thereafter Yale Braunstein, who had
observed the meeting at Bowman, and apparently
was concerned that Dean Wyman would not
deliver the message, decided to attempt to
communicate with the Board himself. He went to
the Faculty Club where he met Dean Wyman who
arranged for Braunstein to enter the rooms where
the trustees were located. Mr. Braunstein spoke to
the trustees, stating that the students at Bowman
not only demanded an open meeting but would
consider whatever meeting the trustees did hold to
be an open one. This message was given twice, once
in a room where the bulk of the trustees were
sitting and in an adjacent room where the
Investment Committee was in session.
After delivering this message, Braunstein
immediately withdrew and proceeded to Bowman
where he found the students leaving, en route to
the Faculty Club.
As soon as Braunstein left the trustees, they had
a short discussion and unanimously passed a
motion not to alter their policy which permits
non-trustees to attend Board meetings only upon
express invitation. No effort was made to
communicate this decision to the students.
Shortly thereafter, apparently just prior to
1:00 p.m., the students entered the inner patio of
the Faculty Club. They did so by proceeding up
the outer stairway facing Tresidder Union and
down the inner stairway to the courtyard.
The students gathered in the inner court where
some of them rapped on the sliding glass doors of
the rooms in which the trustees were sitting. The
students shouted and made use of a "bullhorn" to
attract the attention of and communicate with the
trustees inside. Individual students unsuccessfully
attempted to open the sliding doors.
The trustees continued with their business,
attempting as best they could to ignore the
students. A number of the students then entered
the Faculty Club from the patio and congregated
in the hallway outside the rooms where the
trustees were meeting.
From the time that the students entered the
patio, just before 1:00 p.m. until a few minutes
past 2:00 p.m., the students' attempts to attract
the attention of the trustees were intensified by
means of shouting, beating and kicking on the
doors, reading demands through a "bullhorn," etc.
From time to time students attempted to open the
doors from the trustees rooms into the hallway,
but they had been locked from the inside. On
occasion, administrative personnel and waiters
passed through these doors but did so carefully in
order to keep the students out. At one such time a
student in the hallway attempted to force his way
in but personnel inside the room managed to
reclose and lock the door.
Shortly before 2:00 p.m. the Faculty Advisory
Committee on Disruptions sent one of its
members, Professor Clebsch, to speak with
President Pitzer and Chairman of the Board Fuller.
Professor Chebsch reported that the noise inside
the room was so intense that it seriously disturbed
the conduct of the board meeting and made it
virtually impossible for the meeting to continue.
Testimony from persons who were inside the room
at the time supported this statement.
At about 2:00 p.m. the Advisory Committee
informed Dean Wyman that the students were in
violation of the Campus Policy on Disruptions and
requested that he warn them of this and take their
names. Dean Wyman then announced in the
hallway that the Disruption Policy had been
violated and that any students who did not leave
would have their names taken. He did not,
however, identify himself as an official of the
University acting as such. Substantial testimony
indicated that some students in the hallway may
not have heard his statement or known who he
was.
Dean Wyman then proceeded to take the names
of students who remained in the hallway and in the
patio. A number of students did leave and their
names were not recorded; some others who did
remain refused to reveal their identity or gave false
names. As Dean Wyman moved through the
hallway taking names he was subjected to taunts
and occasional threats of violence.
By 2:15 p.m. most of the students who
remained after the warning congregated in the
hallway where they held an informal meeting to
determine their course of action; some students
argued that they should not remain at the Faculty
Club.
While this meeting continued the noise level
subsided substantially.
At about 2:25 p.m. one of the students gained
entrance to the trustees' rooms through one of the
sliding doors from the patio. He moved directly
across the room and opened one of the doors to
the hallway. University personnel within the room
as well as some who were in the hallway attempted
to shut the door but the students in the hallway
moved forward to keep the door open.
At the door the students at first hung back,
shouting that they wanted an open meeting with
the trustees. Their demands were read through a
bullhorn. Meanwhile a line of administrative
officers within the room formed at the open door
to prevent students from gaining entry into the
room.
There ensued a period of confusion with
pushing and shoving taking place both on the part
of the students in the hallway and the personnel
from inside the room. During this time one
University official lost his balance and fell into the
hallway. Some students were shouting and at least
one was so agitated that he uttered a threat to one
of the administrative personnel at the door.
Shortly thereafter the students succeeded in
entering the room. One of the students was highly
agitated and he insulted and threatened the
trustees. At least two students grabbed copies of
the agenda of the trustees meeting and a struggle
ensued between one of these students and
university officials who sought to retrieve the
agenda he had taken.
Some of the students attempted to engage the
trustees in discussion; the trustees cut off their
meeting and left. The students remained in the
room for a short time thereafter and gradually
dispersed of their own volition.

DECISION ON LEGAL ISSUES
At the factual hearing on February 11-13,
1969, the defendants raised several legal
arguments regarding the Policy on Campus
Disruption as follows:
I. That the Policy was no longer in effect on
January 14, 1969, when the alleged acts of
disruption occurred.
11. That paragraph two of the Policy did not
apply because the facts show beyond any doubt
that University officials did not comply with
requirements set out therein, and
111. That paragraph one of the Policy was
inapplicable because it is dependent upon
University official's compliance with the
requirements of paragraph two.
I. Was the Policy in Effect
Validity of the Policy on Disruptions:
A. Nature of the Argument
1. The Policy on Campus Disruption was
issued on October 7, 1968 by Acting President
Robert Glaser.
2. On October 7, 1968, the Legislative and
Judicial Charter of 1968 was not yet in effect.
That charter was submitted to a vote of the
student body which approved its adoption until
March 1, 1969. The vote was completed on
October 15, 1968, and the results were
announced on October 16, 1968.
3. The invalidity of the Policy is based upon
Article I, Sections D(2)(b), D(2)(d), and
D(2)(e), which read as follows:
Section D(2)(b): When in his opinion an
emergency exists that requires the
promulgation of a regulation, including change
or repeal of an existing regulation, in less time
than is required under the procedure set forth
in section D.l, the President of the University
may promulgate an interim regulation to
become effective immediately upon
publication, provided the President shall first
consult with as many members of the SCLC as
practicable and, if time permits, shall first
afford the SCLC an opportunity to act under
section D.2a.
Section D(2)(d): An interim regulation
promulgated by the President under section
D.2b shall remain in effect for 90 days or until
it is repealed or amended by the SCLC,
whichever occurs first.
The SCLC may amend or repeal interim
regulations by the procedure provided in
section D.l or, with the written concurrence of
the President, SCLC may proceed under section
D.2a.
Section D(2)(e): If in the case of an interim
regulation promulgated under section D.2b, 90
days expire with no action by the SCLC, the
President may repromulgate the interim
regulation every 30 days until SCLC acts on it.
He shall inform the SCLC of each
promulgation.
The argument is that the Policy on Campus
Disruption is subject to these provisions of the
Charter and hence expired on January 7, 1968,
some 7 days prior to the time of the alleged
offenses in this case. The policy was never formally
renewed.
B. Analysis
1. The Disruption Policy was clearly
promulgated prior to ratification of the
Charter.
2. The terms of the Charter can in no way be
considered binding on such a policy, since the
Charter distinguishes clearly between those
policies promulgated prior to the Charter and
those promulgated thereafter.
Section I.E of the Charter clearly provides this
as follows:
E. Relation to Present University Policy.
Until such time as the Student Conduct
Legislative Council changes any present
University policy, that policy will remain in
effect. It is recommended that the first order
of business of the SCLC be the consideration
of areas in which there are currently conflicts
of law.
Section lI.D of the Charter obligates this
Council to enforce "present policy" until
altered in the following terms:
D. Relation to University Policy. Each
member of the Stanford Judicial Council is
obligated to enforce the regulations of the
Student Conduct Legislative Council or the
legislative product of the President acting
after consultation with the SCLC as provided
in Article I, section D.2b. Until such time as
the SCLC changes present policy, the SJC will
be obligated in the case of conflicts of law to
enforce the University policy.
3. The policy was terned an "interim" one by
Dr. Glaser at the time of its announcement, as
he clearly hoped for student approval of the
Charter and a subsequent consideration of the
policy by the Student Conduct Legislative
Council. Dr. Glaser's statement was as follows:
The consensus was that the policy should be
issued on an interim basis. Its interim
character is emphasized because we anticipate
further action by appropriate governing
bodies of the faculty and students, and in
particular by the proposed Student Conduct
Legislative Council. Subsequent actions of
these bodies may confirm, amend or
supercede the temporary policy, which will be
in effect until such actions are taken.
Obviously this statement in no way impugns,
but rather affirms the fact that the policy was
promulgated without time limit and was to be
considered in force until such time as the SCLC,
if established, altered that policy.
4. As of January 14, 1969, the SCLC had not
altered the Policy on Disruptions.
C. Holding
The University Policy on Campus Disruption
Issued October 7, 1968, was in full force and effect
on January 14,1969.
11. Does Paragraph 2of
the Policy Apply
A. Nature of the Argument
1. Paragraph 2 of the Policy on Campus
Disruption reads as follows:
Members of the faculty, staff, and student body
have an obligation to leave a university building
or facility when asked to do so in the
furtherance of the above regulations by a
member of the university community acting in
an official role, and identifying himself as such;
members of the faculty, staff, or student body
also have an obligation to identify themselves,
when requested to do so by such a member of
the university community who has reasonable
grounds to believe that the person(s) has
violated section (1) or (2) of this policy and
who has so informed the person(s).
2. Although a general announcement was
made by Dean Wyman that the students in the
Faculty Club had violated the Policy, the
evidence is legally insufficient to show that this
message was heard by any or all of the
defendants.
3. The evidence clearly shows that Dean
Wyman failed to announce that he was "a
member of the university community acting in
an official role," and, furthermore, reveals
conclusively that at least some defendants did
not know him.

4. It is thus argued that the Council can find no
violation of paragraph two of the Policy.
B. Analysis
1. Paragraph two of the Policy is quite clear in
its requirements. Individuals should not be
forced to leave a university building or reveal
their identify until they know that the
individual who requires them to do so is
properly authorized. Otherwise paragraph two
could be an instrument of widespread abuse.
2. It is easy enough for university officials,
once informed of this decision, to comply
strictly with the paragraph two requirements.
The Council finds such strict compliance
necessary even when it might appear that
persons making the request are doing so in their
official capacity.
3. The evidence is clear and uncontradicted
that the requirements of paragraph two of the
Policy were not met.
C. Holding
No defendant shall be held guilty of a violation
of paragraph two of the Policy on Campus
Disruption of October 7,1968.
111. Is Paragraph One of the
Policy Separate from Paragraph Two
A. Nature of the Argument
1. Paragraph one of the Policy states as
follows:
It is a violation of university policy for a
member of the faculty, staff, or student body
to (1) prevent or disrupt the effective carrying
out of a university function or approved
activity, such as lectures, meetings, interviews,
ceremonies, the conduct of university business
in a university office, and public events; (2)
obstruct the legitimate movement of any
person about the campus or in any university
building or facility.
2. Paragraph two of the Policy is in
"furtherance" of paragraph one. Hence, it is
argued that paragraph one is to be enforced
only through paragraph two. Since the
requirements of paragraph two have not been
met, there can be no guilt under the policy.
B. Analysis
1. Paragraph one of the Policy on Campus
Disruption clearly states that certain disruptive
conduct is improper. There is no logical way by
which paragraph one can be considered
dependent upon paragraph two. Otherwise an
individual who engaged in such disruption
could, merely by leaving before being told to do
so, immunize himself from liability under the
Policy. This would be an open invitation for
members of the University community to
engage in "hit-and-run" raids.
2. Paragraph two has an entirely different
focus than does paragrpah one. It is often
necessary to clear a building to prevent
disruption or to end disruption in progress.
Thus persons can be required to leave and their
failure to do so is a violation in and of itself,
apart from any disruption which does in fact
occur.
The required notification of paragraph two is
meaningless with regard to an individual who
has already broken up a lecture or a meeting.
The present case clearly illustrates this point.
Dean Wyman's failure to properly identify
himself eliminates any guilt for mere failure to
leave the building; surely, however, it does not
justify acts of disruption done both before and
after his statements.
As to such acts of disruption if the defendants
did not know Dean Wyman or know that he was
acting in his official capacity, as they
successfully argued regarding II above, what he
said or didn't say was of no relevance.
C. Holding
Paragraph one of the Policy on Campus
Disruption is wholly independent from paragraph
two and failure to comply with the terms of the
latter does not prohibit a charge under the former.
SPECIFIC FINDINGS AS TO GUILT
The Council finds as follows:
1. That in addition to those fourteen students
who admitted disruption, the remaining fifteen
defendants, who received a hearing on the facts,
were guilty of acts that disrupted "the effective
carrying out of a university function," under
the Policy on Campus Disruption of October 7,
1968.
(a) From the time the students first entered
the inner patio at the Faculty Club until
shortly after 2:00 p.m., they attempted to
force the trustees to discontinue their regular
meeting by shouting, pounding on doors and
windows, and making statements through a
bullhorn.
(b) That these acts disrupted the trustees'
meeting is unmistakably clear. Although the
trustees attempted to continue with their
regular business, the noise from outside made
it extremely difficult for them to do so.
(c) That these acts by defendants were
intended to disrupt the trustees' meeting is
also clear. The refusal of the trustees to
acknowledge the presence of the students, the
fact that the trustees shut and locked the
doors, and the fact that entry of the students
into the meeting room was resisted at all times
is substantial evidence that the trustees did
not want or intend to meet with the students
at that time and that the students knew this.
(d) Quite apart from the noisy attempts to
disrupt the trustees' meeting, the actual entry
of the students into the meeting room at
approximately 2:25 to 2:30 p.m., through a
line of university officials who clearly were
attempting to keep them out, itself
constituted a flagrant act of disruption. At
that point, the trustees who were attempting
to deal with items on their regular agenda, had
no choice but to stop what they were doing.
(e) It is clear from the evidence, including the
pictures taken at the scene, that all but one of
the fifteen defendants who requested a
hearing, entered or pushed forward in
attempting to enter the open door of the room
where the trustees were meeting. The
exception is James Johnson and the testimony
regarding Mr. Johnson unmistakably shows
him to have engaged in acts of disruption by
banging and kicking on the locked doors to
the meeting room.
2. That Mr. Richard F. Bogart has no defense
on the ground that he was present as a reporter
for KZSU Radio Station.
(a) An individual who engages in illegal acts is
not immunized merely because he belongs, or
in the present case, has reason to believe he
belongs, to a news organization. By his own
statements Mr. Bogart showed that he was
present as a participant in the demonstration.
(b) The Council finds no credible evidence
sufficient for a finding that Mr. Bogart should
be exonerated as a KZSU reporter. Obviously,
participation by a person in illegal activities
cannot be excused even if that person
ultimately reports upon those activities in the
news media.
(c) Furthermore, the evidence regarding Mr.
Bogart is clearly distinguishable from that
available to the Council regarding other
reporters who were not charged or against

whom charges were brought and then
dismissed. These other persons were in
attendance as assigned reporters or
photographers. They took photographs and
notes for news stories which were published
shortly thereafter, and in doing so they clearly
distinguished themselves from the defendants
who were engaged in the disruption. This is
simply not the case with Mr. Bogart.
FINDINGS REGARDING CULPABILITY
The Council finds as follows:
1. That like the fourteen defendants who
admitted to the charge against them, the
following twelve defendant who received a
hearing on the facts engaged in no acts of
aggravation beyond general disruption:
John W. Avery
Anne C. Bauer
Richard F. Bogart
Marc D. Heller
Virginia A. Linsley
David F. Pugh
George C. Reinhardt
James E. Shoch
Leonard M. Siegel
Michael D. Vawter
Joan Williams (Mrs. Rodney W.)
Rodney W. Williams
2. That in addition to general disruption the
following students engaged in specific
aggravating acts as indicated:
(a) Fred H.Cohen
(1) Threatened a University official who
blocked his entry into the trustees meeting
room by stating words such as "get your
hands off me baby or I'll bust your head,"
upon gaining entry into the room further
threatened the trustees not to meet on the
campus again, and in general was so violent
in his manner that several of hiscodefendants
restrained him, and
(2) Took from inside the room a folder
containing the agenda of the trustees
meeting and placed it under his coat.
(b) James E. Johnson
Violently kicked and beat on the doors and
windows to the trustees' room, with his
heavy boots and with a stick.
(c) Stephen S. Smith
(1) At approximaetely 2:25 p.m. managed
to open one of the sliding glass doors from
the patio into the turstees' room, walked
across that room, and, after a struggle with
several university officials, opened the
doorway to the hall and invited the students
congregated there to come into the room.
[At this point the Council would note the
fact that it was unable to locate any witness
who could testify as to how Mr. Smith
succeeded in opening the door from the
patio into the trustees' room. Mr. Smith was
not called in deference to his privilege
against self-incrimination and he chose not
to testify. The Council does find, however,
the circumstantial evidence is overwhelming
that Mr. Smith entered the room knowing
that it was disruptive for him to do so. This is
clearly shown by his subsequent actions in
immediately attempting to open the door to
the hallway against the will of those
present. ]
(2) Took a folder containing an agenda of
the trustees meeting and refused to return it
at the request of a number of University
personnel who finally were forced to engage
in a struggle with Mr. Smith to retrieve it.
3. That the University administration and the
Board of Trustees failed to make clear to the
defendants what proper channels, if any,
existed for communication between students
on the one hand and the administration and the
Board on the other.
4. That the defendants were strongly
motivated by sincerely held beliefs and felt
frustrated by their apparent inability to state
those beliefs to the Board.
5. That the failure of the University
administration and the Board of Trustees to
develop and maintain methods for the orderly
exchange of views with the student body
regarding issues relevant to the University was a
contributing factor of the disruption.
6. That the defendants in the present case were
less interested in the orderly exchange of views
than they were in the imposition of their views
on the rest of the community.

University; the sum of $ 150 to be paid prior to
registration for Spring Quarter of the
1968-1969 academic year and the remaining
balance to be paid prior to registration for
Autumn Quarter of the 1969-70 academic
year.

5. That with respect to orders to pay money
under 1(b), 2(b), 3(b) and 4(b) above
(a) The Dean of Students, in his discretion
may upon application by a defendant,
postpone payment of any sum when it appears
necessary to avoid undue financial hardship.
(b) Provided, however, that in no event shall a
university degree be awarded to any
defendant until he has paid the full amount
due.
Analysis of the Recommendations on Penalty
1. The Council's recommendations as to
penalty are based on a total view of the
defendants' conduct in light of the Council's
desire, as set forth in its Rules, to utilize
penalties to strengthen the Stanford
community.
2. The penalties would have been more severe
had the defendants been aware of the existence
of a reasonably means by which to make their
views known to the Board of Trustees.
3. At the same time, however, the Council
considered the offense to be a very serious one
that must not be repeated. If every member of
the Stanford community who feels strongly
about an issue is permitted to disrupt the
campus to impose his views on others, the result
would be chaos. Indeed such actions are
counterproductive in that they tend to
eliminate opportunity for legitimate discussion
and resolution of vital issues.
4. The Council's imposition of periods of
probation takes into consideration the threat
by defendants, made at the motivational
hearing, to engage in further serious acts of
disruption. The Council takes the position that
if during the period of probation any defendant
carries out such a threat, and is duly convicted
thereof, the University community has the
right to insist upon his suspension.
5. The Council views as most serious those acts
which, directly or by implication, threaten
violence to any person. Fortunately, in the
present case no one was injured and there was

no serious damage to property. Nevertheless, a
real danger of personal injury exists when
persons ostensibly engaged in a demonstration
to present their views, lose their tempers or
engage in physical altercations. The penalties to
three individuals reflect the Council's position,
based on clear evidence, that in varying degrees,
these individuals materially increased the
danger of physical violence and personal injury.
6. In order that the University community not
be misled, the Council wishes to make clear that
its decision in this case was not based on the
military draft policy of the United States or on
the draft status of any of the defendants.
Findingson Collateral Matters
The Council finds as follows:
1. That in light of the fact that every defendant
was clearly in violation of the Policy on Campus
Disruption of October 7, 1968, which policy
was valid and in force, the Council feels it
unnecessary to determine whether or not the
defendants were also in violation of the
Fundamental Standard. The answer to this
question would in no way affect the penalties
imposed.
2. That student witnesses have the obligation
to testify when called before the Council.
(a) In the present case a student was called to
testify as to events he observed at the Faculty
Club at the time of the disruption. He claimed
that he had been present as a reporter for the
Stanford Daily and therefore he was privileged
not to testify.
(b) The Council subpoenaed this witness
because he was known to have been present
and it was felt that defendants might have
wished to elicit information from him. The
defendants declined to ask him questions and
he was excused.
(c) The Council at that time, however, and
now, holds that the claimed privilege does not
exist, that it has not been recognized by the
courts of the land, that there is no justification
for such a privilege, and that the refusal to

testify on such grounds cannot and will not be
tolerated. [This in no way, however, governs
the Council's attitude toward the privilege of a
reporter not to reveal the name of a
confidential informant, which privilege has
both been recognized and rejected in various
courts. 1
3. That persons who attend a hearing of the
Stanford Judicial Council, including the
defendants and their counsel, have an
obligation not to impede, disrupt, or in any
manner interfere with the conduct of the
proceedings.
(a) A number of persons who attended the
factual hearing, particularly on the first night,
in obvious support of the defendants,
deliberately attempted to disrupt the
proceedings and did, in fact, cause
considerably noise and confusion.
(b) The Council is not a court of law; it has no
bailiff or sheriff's department to maintain
order. Thus any handful of persons, who are
so inclined can seriously impede the
proceedings.
(c) The defendants themselves, and their
counsel, must share the blame for the
disorder, particularly during the first night.
They continually directed their comments to
their supporters in the audience rather than to
the members of the Council and they
attempted in numerous ways, including the
muttering of threats, to ridicule the Council
and to make its job impossible. All this was
done in spite of the Council's solemn promise,
duly kept, that they would be given an
opportunity at the hearings on motivatioto
say what they so desired about the basic issues
underlying their actions.
The Council does note that the defendants did
intercede during the most serious disruptions
to assist the Council, primarily to prevent the
Council from closing the hearings, and that
after the first night of the hearings, the
defendants were more restrained. Moreover,

the Council recognizes and appreciates the
efforts of Mr. Doron Weinberg, who, as sole
counsel after the first and second evenings,
assisted in maintaining order and preserving
the decorum of the proceedings.
(d) On the basis of its experience in this case,
regarding meetings that are open to the
general public, the Council will seriously
consider in future cases limiting the number of
persons in attendance. Furthermore, the
Council serves warning on those who would
disrupt future proceedings that the Council is
disposed to find in contempt persons who
engage in disruption of its proceedings and to
recommend immediate imposition of severe
sanctions.
4. That defendant Jack Gerson, who
apparently withdrew from the University
subsequent to January 14, 1969, but prior to
the hearings in this case, has failed to respond to
summonses from the Council duly served upon
him.
The Council recommends that, in accordance
with the Legislative and Judicial Charter of
1968, the University immediately withdraw
Mr. Gerson's registration privileges until such
time as he appears before the Council for the
trial of his case.
THIS DECISION AND ALL ITS PARTS ARE
UNANIMOUSLY ADOPTED BY THE
MEMBERS OF THE COUNCIL.
Dated: February 27, 1969
Editor's Note: The Judicial Council's reference
to "the faculty advisory Committee on
Disruptions" is, in fact, the President's advisory
group on campus disruptions. After hearing from
members of this group. President Pitzer informed
Dean Wyman that the students were believed to be
in violation of the campus policy on disruptions.
The faculty members did not instruct Wyman
directly.
Incremental costs for publication of this report
have been paid for the the Stanford Newsservice.
STATEMENT OF THE PROCEEDINGS
On January 15, 1969, the Stanford Judicial
Council was notified by the office of the Dean of
Students that on the previous day a group of
persons, believed primarily to be Stanford
students, had allegedly disrupted a meeting of the
University Board of Trustees which had been held
at the Stanford Faculty Club. The Council was
asked to investigate.
Pursuant to the Legislative and Judicial Charter
of 1968, the Council sent out five judicial aides to
investigate and interview witnesses. The judicial
aides made a comprehensive report to the Council
which included photographs, lists of witnesses and
participants, transcripts of tape-recorded
interviews of many persons, and additional
statements, including those of a number of
potential defendants.
At the Council's behest, the Chairman
examined the report and, on the basis of the
information therein, determined to call before
him, and one other member of the Council sitting
with him, some thirty-nine persons for the purpose
of charging them with violations of the Campus
Policy on Disruptions of October 7, 1968, and of
the Fundamental Standard, and to show each the
evidence the Council had obtained through its
judicial aides regarding his activities.
The letter summoning these persons was sent
by mail; in addition a copy of the letter was
personally served on each of them. The letter
contained the following:
(1) A statement that the person was charged
with violations of the Disruption Policy and
of the Fundamental Standard.
(2) An outline of proceedings to be followed
during trial of the case.
(3) A copy of the Council's rules containing
the rights of defendants as set out in the
Legislative and Judicial Charter of 1968.
(4) A date and time to appear before the
Chairman of the Council for a conference.
Each person summoned duly appeared with the
sole exception of Jack Gerson, who has at no time
appeared or taken part in these proceedings.
The Council Chairman, sitting with at least one
other member of the Council, showed each
defendant the evidence regarding his activities and
explained to each defendant the procedure to be
followed for trial. That procedure required a
bifurcated hearing. The first hearing would be
designed solely to determine what acts each
student had, or had not committed; the second
hearing would be devoted solely to matters of
motivation.
With but one exception, Fred Cohen, who was
also charged with acts of intimidation, each
student, for purposes of the present hearings, was
charged only with having disrupted the Board of
Trustees meeting; no specific acts of violence,
threats, etc. were alleged. [Defendant James
Johnson was also charged with having set a false
fire alarm but all hearings on this charge were
suspended pending decision on such a charge in the
county civil courts. ]
Every defendant was given an opportunity to
admit to the charge against him. He was told that
to do so would eliminate the need for the first
hearing in his case, but that he would still be
permitted to do three things;
(1) Take part in the motivational hearing.
(2) Argue the invalidity of the Campus Policy
on Disruptions.
(3) Argue that the Fundamental Standard does
not cover disruption without a showing of
specific acts such as violence, threats,
blocking access of other persons, etc.
Each student was further informed that any
specific facts regarding his individual conduct
which were brought out during a fact hearing
would be considered by the Council in deciding his
case.
Although defendants were told they had a right
to remain silent, many wished to discuss the nature
of their participation. On the basis of their
statements and the Council's continuing
investigation of the case, charges were withdrawn
against nine persons. Of the remaining twenty-nine
defendants, the following twelve initially decided
to admit to the charges against them:
Allen Christelow
Richard Greenspan
HallamC. Hamilton
Carolyn M. Iverson
Barbara E. Lee
Michael M. Morton
Christine M. Mrak
Jeffrey J. Preefer
Guy D. Smyth
Don P. Stuart
D. Jeffrey Weil
Helen K. Williams
Thereafter, two additional students, Irwin
Busse and Marc Weiss, also decided to admit the
charges against them. Thus, when the case
proceeded to the first hearing, only the following
fifteen students were involved:
John W. Avery
Anne C. Bauer
Richard F. Bogart
Fred H. Cohen
Marc D. Heller
James E. Johnson
Virginia A. Linsley
David F. Pugh
George C. Reinhardt
James E. Shoch
Leonard M. Siegel
Stephen S. Smith
Michael D. Vawter
Joan Williams (Mrs. Rodney W.)
Rodney W. Williams
This factual hearing was open to the public and
took place on February 11, 12 and 13.
Considerable evidence was received, including the
testimony of some 24 witnesses.
The motivational hearing, also open to the
public, was held on February 21. All twenty-nine
defendants subscribed to an organized
presentation of their views. Thereafter each
defendant was given an opportunity to add further
information on his own behalf.
STATEMENT OF THE GENERAL FACTS
On the basis of the evidence presented during
the hearings, the Council finds the following facts:
At the October 1968 meeting of the Stanford
University Board of Trustees, a student, Yale
Braunstein, Speaker of the Student Legislature,
was permitted to address the board members,
urging them to hold open meetings with students.
The Board Chairman, shortly thereafter, wrote a
letter to Mr. Braunstein, thanking him for his
remarks but not specifically mentioning the issue
of open meetings. Mr. Braunstein replied with a
letter to the Board Chairman emphasizing the
importance of the open-meeting request.
Although at both the November 1968 and January
14, 1969 meetings of the Board, student leaders
were invited to and did sit with a number of Board
committees, the Board made no statement, either
to Mr. Braunstein or the Stanford student body at
large, concerning meetings of the Board itself,
which would be open to members of the Stanford
community.
On the morning of January 14,1969, a group of
students circulated throughout the campus a
document requesting that all interested persons

arrive at Bowman Alumni House at 12:30 p.m. for
the purpose of holding an open meeting with the
trustees. The document contained nine specific
demands regarding the operations of the
University and the Stanford Research Institute.
At approximately 12:30 p.m., when a group of
students had collected at Bowman, they learned
that the trustees were at the Stanford Faculty
Club. The students then held a meeting to
determine what action to take. At about this time
Associate Dean of Students, Willard Wyman,
entered Bowman where one of the students
demanded that Wyman carry a message to the
trustees asking for an open meeting. Although he
made it clear that he was not a "messenger boy"
for the students, Dean Wyman nevertheless did in
fact go to the Faculty Club to tell members of the
University administration, including President
Pitzer, that a group of students at Bowman wished
to have an open meeting with the trustees and
would not leave Bowman until such a meeting was
arranged.
Shortly thereafter Yale Braunstein, who had
observed the meeting at Bowman, and apparently
was concerned that Dean Wyman would not
deliver the message, decided to attempt to
communicate with the Board himself. He went to
the Faculty Club where he met Dean Wyman who
arranged for Braunstein to enter the rooms where
the trustees were located. Mr. Braunstein spoke to
the trustees, stating that the students at Bowman
not only demanded an open meeting but would
consider whatever meeting the trustees did hold to
be an open one. This message was given twice, once
in a room where the bulk of the trustees were
sitting and in an adjacent room where the
Investment Committee was in session.
After delivering this message, Braunstein
immediately withdrew and proceeded to Bowman
where he found the students leaving, en route to
the Faculty Club.
As soon as Braunstein left the trustees, they had
a short discussion and unanimously passed a
motion not to alter their policy which permits
non-trustees to attend Board meetings only upon
express invitation. No effort was made to
communicate this decision to the students.
Shortly thereafter, apparently just prior to
1:00 p.m., the students entered the inner patio of
the Faculty Club. They did so by proceeding up
the outer stairway facing Tresidder Union and
down the inner stairway to the courtyard.
The students gathered in the inner court where
some of them rapped on the sliding glass doors of
the rooms in which the trustees were sitting. The
students shouted and made use of a "bullhorn" to
attract the attention of and communicate with the
trustees inside. Individual students unsuccessfully
attempted to open the sliding doors.
The trustees continued with their business,
attempting as best they could to ignore the
students. A number of the students then entered
the Faculty Club from the patio and congregated
in the hallway outside the rooms where the
trustees were meeting.
From the time that the students entered the
patio, just before 1:00 p.m. until a few minutes
past 2:00 p.m., the students' attempts to attract
the attention of the trustees were intensified by
means of shouting, beating and kicking on the
doors, reading demands through a "bullhorn," etc.
From time to time students attempted to open the
doors from the trustees rooms into the hallway,
but they had been locked from the inside. On
occasion, administrative personnel and waiters
passed through these doors but did so carefully in
order to keep the students out. At one such time a
student in the hallway attempted to force his way
in but personnel inside the room managed to
reclose and lock the door.
Shortly before 2:00 p.m. the Faculty Advisory
Committee on Disruptions sent one of its
members, Professor Clebsch, to speak with
President Pitzer and Chairman of the Board Fuller.
Professor Chebsch reported that the noise inside
the room was so intense that it seriously disturbed
the conduct of the board meeting and made it
virtually impossible for the meeting to continue.
Testimony from persons who were inside the room
at the time supported this statement.
At about 2:00 p.m. the Advisory Committee
informed Dean Wyman that the students were in
violation of the Campus Policy on Disruptions and
requested that he warn them of this and take their
names. Dean Wyman then announced in the
hallway that the Disruption Policy had been
violated and that any students who did not leave
would have their names taken. He did not,
however, identify himself as an official of the
University acting as such. Substantial testimony
indicated that some students in the hallway may
not have heard his statement or known who he
was.
Dean Wyman then proceeded to take the names
of students who remained in the hallway and in the
patio. A number of students did leave and their
names were not recorded; some others who did
remain refused to reveal their identity or gave false
names. As Dean Wyman moved through the
hallway taking names he was subjected to taunts
and occasional threats of violence.
By 2:15 p.m. most of the students who
remained after the warning congregated in the
hallway where they held an informal meeting to
determine their course of action; some students
argued that they should not remain at the Faculty
Club.
While this meeting continued the noise level
subsided substantially.
At about 2:25 p.m. one of the students gained
entrance to the trustees' rooms through one of the
sliding doors from the patio. He moved directly
across the room and opened one of the doors to
the hallway. University personnel within the room
as well as some who were in the hallway attempted
to shut the door but the students in the hallway
moved forward to keep the door open.
At the door the students at first hung back,
shouting that they wanted an open meeting with
the trustees. Their demands were read through a
bullhorn. Meanwhile a line of administrative
officers within the room formed at the open door
to prevent students from gaining entry into the
room.
There ensued a period of confusion with
pushing and shoving taking place both on the part
of the students in the hallway and the personnel
from inside the room. During this time one
University official lost his balance and fell into the
hallway. Some students were shouting and at least
one was so agitated that he uttered a threat to one
of the administrative personnel at the door.
Shortly thereafter the students succeeded in
entering the room. One of the students was highly
agitated and he insulted and threatened the
trustees. At least two students grabbed copies of
the agenda of the trustees meeting and a struggle
ensued between one of these students and
university officials who sought to retrieve the
agenda he had taken.
Some of the students attempted to engage the
trustees in discussion; the trustees cut off their
meeting and left. The students remained in the
room for a short time thereafter and gradually
dispersed of their own volition.

DECISION ON LEGAL ISSUES
At the factual hearing on February 11-13,
1969, the defendants raised several legal
arguments regarding the Policy on Campus
Disruption as follows:
I. That the Policy was no longer in effect on
January 14, 1969, when the alleged acts of
disruption occurred.
11. That paragraph two of the Policy did not
apply because the facts show beyond any doubt
that University officials did not comply with
requirements set out therein, and
111. That paragraph one of the Policy was
inapplicable because it is dependent upon
University official's compliance with the
requirements of paragraph two.
I. Was the Policy in Effect
Validity of the Policy on Disruptions:
A. Nature of the Argument
1. The Policy on Campus Disruption was
issued on October 7, 1968 by Acting President
Robert Glaser.
2. On October 7, 1968, the Legislative and
Judicial Charter of 1968 was not yet in effect.
That charter was submitted to a vote of the
student body which approved its adoption until
March 1, 1969. The vote was completed on
October 15, 1968, and the results were
announced on October 16, 1968.
3. The invalidity of the Policy is based upon
Article I, Sections D(2)(b), D(2)(d), and
D(2)(e), which read as follows:
Section D(2)(b): When in his opinion an
emergency exists that requires the
promulgation of a regulation, including change
or repeal of an existing regulation, in less time
than is required under the procedure set forth
in section D.l, the President of the University
may promulgate an interim regulation to
become effective immediately upon
publication, provided the President shall first
consult with as many members of the SCLC as
practicable and, if time permits, shall first
afford the SCLC an opportunity to act under
section D.2a.
Section D(2)(d): An interim regulation
promulgated by the President under section
D.2b shall remain in effect for 90 days or until
it is repealed or amended by the SCLC,
whichever occurs first.
The SCLC may amend or repeal interim
regulations by the procedure provided in
section D.l or, with the written concurrence of
the President, SCLC may proceed under section
D.2a.
Section D(2)(e): If in the case of an interim
regulation promulgated under section D.2b, 90
days expire with no action by the SCLC, the
President may repromulgate the interim
regulation every 30 days until SCLC acts on it.
He shall inform the SCLC of each
promulgation.
The argument is that the Policy on Campus
Disruption is subject to these provisions of the
Charter and hence expired on January 7, 1968,
some 7 days prior to the time of the alleged
offenses in this case. The policy was never formally
renewed.
B. Analysis
1. The Disruption Policy was clearly
promulgated prior to ratification of the
Charter.
2. The terms of the Charter can in no way be
considered binding on such a policy, since the
Charter distinguishes clearly between those
policies promulgated prior to the Charter and
those promulgated thereafter.
Section I.E of the Charter clearly provides this
as follows:
E. Relation to Present University Policy.
Until such time as the Student Conduct
Legislative Council changes any present
University policy, that policy will remain in
effect. It is recommended that the first order
of business of the SCLC be the consideration
of areas in which there are currently conflicts
of law.
Section lI.D of the Charter obligates this
Council to enforce "present policy" until
altered in the following terms:
D. Relation to University Policy. Each
member of the Stanford Judicial Council is
obligated to enforce the regulations of the
Student Conduct Legislative Council or the
legislative product of the President acting
after consultation with the SCLC as provided
in Article I, section D.2b. Until such time as
the SCLC changes present policy, the SJC will
be obligated in the case of conflicts of law to
enforce the University policy.
3. The policy was terned an "interim" one by
Dr. Glaser at the time of its announcement, as
he clearly hoped for student approval of the
Charter and a subsequent consideration of the
policy by the Student Conduct Legislative
Council. Dr. Glaser's statement was as follows:
The consensus was that the policy should be
issued on an interim basis. Its interim
character is emphasized because we anticipate
further action by appropriate governing
bodies of the faculty and students, and in
particular by the proposed Student Conduct
Legislative Council. Subsequent actions of
these bodies may confirm, amend or
supercede the temporary policy, which will be
in effect until such actions are taken.
Obviously this statement in no way impugns,
but rather affirms the fact that the policy was
promulgated without time limit and was to be
considered in force until such time as the SCLC,
if established, altered that policy.
4. As of January 14, 1969, the SCLC had not
altered the Policy on Disruptions.
C. Holding
The University Policy on Campus Disruption
Issued October 7, 1968, was in full force and effect
on January 14,1969.
11. Does Paragraph 2of
the Policy Apply
A. Nature of the Argument
1. Paragraph 2 of the Policy on Campus
Disruption reads as follows:
Members of the faculty, staff, and student body
have an obligation to leave a university building
or facility when asked to do so in the
furtherance of the above regulations by a
member of the university community acting in
an official role, and identifying himself as such;
members of the faculty, staff, or student body
also have an obligation to identify themselves,
when requested to do so by such a member of
the university community who has reasonable
grounds to believe that the person(s) has
violated section (1) or (2) of this policy and
who has so informed the person(s).
2. Although a general announcement was
made by Dean Wyman that the students in the
Faculty Club had violated the Policy, the
evidence is legally insufficient to show that this
message was heard by any or all of the
defendants.
3. The evidence clearly shows that Dean
Wyman failed to announce that he was "a
member of the university community acting in
an official role," and, furthermore, reveals
conclusively that at least some defendants did
not know him.

4. It is thus argued that the Council can find no
violation of paragraph two of the Policy.
B. Analysis
1. Paragraph two of the Policy is quite clear in
its requirements. Individuals should not be
forced to leave a university building or reveal
their identify until they know that the
individual who requires them to do so is
properly authorized. Otherwise paragraph two
could be an instrument of widespread abuse.
2. It is easy enough for university officials,
once informed of this decision, to comply
strictly with the paragraph two requirements.
The Council finds such strict compliance
necessary even when it might appear that
persons making the request are doing so in their
official capacity.
3. The evidence is clear and uncontradicted
that the requirements of paragraph two of the
Policy were not met.
C. Holding
No defendant shall be held guilty of a violation
of paragraph two of the Policy on Campus
Disruption of October 7,1968.
111. Is Paragraph One of the
Policy Separate from Paragraph Two
A. Nature of the Argument
1. Paragraph one of the Policy states as
follows:
It is a violation of university policy for a
member of the faculty, staff, or student body
to (1) prevent or disrupt the effective carrying
out of a university function or approved
activity, such as lectures, meetings, interviews,
ceremonies, the conduct of university business
in a university office, and public events; (2)
obstruct the legitimate movement of any
person about the campus or in any university
building or facility.
2. Paragraph two of the Policy is in
"furtherance" of paragraph one. Hence, it is
argued that paragraph one is to be enforced
only through paragraph two. Since the
requirements of paragraph two have not been
met, there can be no guilt under the policy.
B. Analysis
1. Paragraph one of the Policy on Campus
Disruption clearly states that certain disruptive
conduct is improper. There is no logical way by
which paragraph one can be considered
dependent upon paragraph two. Otherwise an
individual who engaged in such disruption
could, merely by leaving before being told to do
so, immunize himself from liability under the
Policy. This would be an open invitation for
members of the University community to
engage in "hit-and-run" raids.
2. Paragraph two has an entirely different
focus than does paragrpah one. It is often
necessary to clear a building to prevent
disruption or to end disruption in progress.
Thus persons can be required to leave and their
failure to do so is a violation in and of itself,
apart from any disruption which does in fact
occur.
The required notification of paragraph two is
meaningless with regard to an individual who
has already broken up a lecture or a meeting.
The present case clearly illustrates this point.
Dean Wyman's failure to properly identify
himself eliminates any guilt for mere failure to
leave the building; surely, however, it does not
justify acts of disruption done both before and
after his statements.
As to such acts of disruption if the defendants
did not know Dean Wyman or know that he was
acting in his official capacity, as they
successfully argued regarding II above, what he
said or didn't say was of no relevance.
C. Holding
Paragraph one of the Policy on Campus
Disruption is wholly independent from paragraph
two and failure to comply with the terms of the
latter does not prohibit a charge under the former.
SPECIFIC FINDINGS AS TO GUILT
The Council finds as follows:
1. That in addition to those fourteen students
who admitted disruption, the remaining fifteen
defendants, who received a hearing on the facts,
were guilty of acts that disrupted "the effective
carrying out of a university function," under
the Policy on Campus Disruption of October 7,
1968.
(a) From the time the students first entered
the inner patio at the Faculty Club until
shortly after 2:00 p.m., they attempted to
force the trustees to discontinue their regular
meeting by shouting, pounding on doors and
windows, and making statements through a
bullhorn.
(b) That these acts disrupted the trustees'
meeting is unmistakably clear. Although the
trustees attempted to continue with their
regular business, the noise from outside made
it extremely difficult for them to do so.
(c) That these acts by defendants were
intended to disrupt the trustees' meeting is
also clear. The refusal of the trustees to
acknowledge the presence of the students, the
fact that the trustees shut and locked the
doors, and the fact that entry of the students
into the meeting room was resisted at all times
is substantial evidence that the trustees did
not want or intend to meet with the students
at that time and that the students knew this.
(d) Quite apart from the noisy attempts to
disrupt the trustees' meeting, the actual entry
of the students into the meeting room at
approximately 2:25 to 2:30 p.m., through a
line of university officials who clearly were
attempting to keep them out, itself
constituted a flagrant act of disruption. At
that point, the trustees who were attempting
to deal with items on their regular agenda, had
no choice but to stop what they were doing.
(e) It is clear from the evidence, including the
pictures taken at the scene, that all but one of
the fifteen defendants who requested a
hearing, entered or pushed forward in
attempting to enter the open door of the room
where the trustees were meeting. The
exception is James Johnson and the testimony
regarding Mr. Johnson unmistakably shows
him to have engaged in acts of disruption by
banging and kicking on the locked doors to
the meeting room.
2. That Mr. Richard F. Bogart has no defense
on the ground that he was present as a reporter
for KZSU Radio Station.
(a) An individual who engages in illegal acts is
not immunized merely because he belongs, or
in the present case, has reason to believe he
belongs, to a news organization. By his own
statements Mr. Bogart showed that he was
present as a participant in the demonstration.
(b) The Council finds no credible evidence
sufficient for a finding that Mr. Bogart should
be exonerated as a KZSU reporter. Obviously,
participation by a person in illegal activities
cannot be excused even if that person
ultimately reports upon those activities in the
news media.
(c) Furthermore, the evidence regarding Mr.
Bogart is clearly distinguishable from that
available to the Council regarding other
reporters who were not charged or against

whom charges were brought and then
dismissed. These other persons were in
attendance as assigned reporters or
photographers. They took photographs and
notes for news stories which were published
shortly thereafter, and in doing so they clearly
distinguished themselves from the defendants
who were engaged in the disruption. This is
simply not the case with Mr. Bogart.
FINDINGS REGARDING CULPABILITY
The Council finds as follows:
1. That like the fourteen defendants who
admitted to the charge against them, the
following twelve defendant who received a
hearing on the facts engaged in no acts of
aggravation beyond general disruption:
John W. Avery
Anne C. Bauer
Richard F. Bogart
Marc D. Heller
Virginia A. Linsley
David F. Pugh
George C. Reinhardt
James E. Shoch
Leonard M. Siegel
Michael D. Vawter
Joan Williams (Mrs. Rodney W.)
Rodney W. Williams
2. That in addition to general disruption the
following students engaged in specific
aggravating acts as indicated:
(a) Fred H.Cohen
(1) Threatened a University official who
blocked his entry into the trustees meeting
room by stating words such as "get your
hands off me baby or I'll bust your head,"
upon gaining entry into the room further
threatened the trustees not to meet on the
campus again, and in general was so violent
in his manner that several of hiscodefendants
restrained him, and
(2) Took from inside the room a folder
containing the agenda of the trustees
meeting and placed it under his coat.
(b) James E. Johnson
Violently kicked and beat on the doors and
windows to the trustees' room, with his
heavy boots and with a stick.
(c) Stephen S. Smith
(1) At approximaetely 2:25 p.m. managed
to open one of the sliding glass doors from
the patio into the turstees' room, walked
across that room, and, after a struggle with
several university officials, opened the
doorway to the hall and invited the students
congregated there to come into the room.
[At this point the Council would note the
fact that it was unable to locate any witness
who could testify as to how Mr. Smith
succeeded in opening the door from the
patio into the trustees' room. Mr. Smith was
not called in deference to his privilege
against self-incrimination and he chose not
to testify. The Council does find, however,
the circumstantial evidence is overwhelming
that Mr. Smith entered the room knowing
that it was disruptive for him to do so. This is
clearly shown by his subsequent actions in
immediately attempting to open the door to
the hallway against the will of those
present. ]
(2) Took a folder containing an agenda of
the trustees meeting and refused to return it
at the request of a number of University
personnel who finally were forced to engage
in a struggle with Mr. Smith to retrieve it.
3. That the University administration and the
Board of Trustees failed to make clear to the
defendants what proper channels, if any,
existed for communication between students
on the one hand and the administration and the
Board on the other.
4. That the defendants were strongly
motivated by sincerely held beliefs and felt
frustrated by their apparent inability to state
those beliefs to the Board.
5. That the failure of the University
administration and the Board of Trustees to
develop and maintain methods for the orderly
exchange of views with the student body
regarding issues relevant to the University was a
contributing factor of the disruption.
6. That the defendants in the present case were
less interested in the orderly exchange of views
than they were in the imposition of their views
on the rest of the community.

balance to be paid prior to registration for
Autumn Quarter of the 1969-70 academic

Autumn Quarter of the 1969-70 academic
year.

5. That with respect to orders to pay money
under 1(b), 2(b), 3(b) and 4(b) above
(a) The Dean of Students, in his discretion
may upon application by a defendant,
postpone payment of any sum when it appears
necessary to avoid undue financial hardship.
(b) Provided, however, that in no event shall a
university degree be awarded to any
defendant until he has paid the full amount
due.
Analysis of the Recommendations on Penalty
1. The Council's recommendations as to
penalty are based on a total view of the
defendants' conduct in light of the Council's
desire, as set forth in its Rules, to utilize
penalties to strengthen the Stanford
community.
2. The penalties would have been more severe
had the defendants been aware of the existence
of a reasonably means by which to make their
views known to the Board of Trustees.
3. At the same time, however, the Council
considered the offense to be a very serious one
that must not be repeated. If every member of
the Stanford community who feels strongly
about an issue is permitted to disrupt the
campus to impose his views on others, the result
would be chaos. Indeed such actions are
counterproductive in that they tend to
eliminate opportunity for legitimate discussion
and resolution of vital issues.
4. The Council's imposition of periods of
probation takes into consideration the threat
by defendants, made at the motivational
hearing, to engage in further serious acts of
disruption. The Council takes the position that
if during the period of probation any defendant
carries out such a threat, and is duly convicted
thereof, the University community has the
right to insist upon his suspension.
5. The Council views as most serious those acts
which, directly or by implication, threaten
violence to any person. Fortunately, in the
present case no one was injured and there was

no serious damage to property. Nevertheless, a
real danger of personal injury exists when
persons ostensibly engaged in a demonstration
to present their views, lose their tempers or
engage in physical altercations. The penalties to
three individuals reflect the Council's position,
based on clear evidence, that in varying degrees,
these individuals materially increased the
danger of physical violence and personal injury.
6. In order that the University community not
be misled, the Council wishes to make clear that
its decision in this case was not based on the
military draft policy of the United States or on
the draft status of any of the defendants.
Findingson Collateral Matters
The Council finds as follows:
1. That in light of the fact that every defendant
was clearly in violation of the Policy on Campus
Disruption of October 7, 1968, which policy
was valid and in force, the Council feels it
unnecessary to determine whether or not the
defendants were also in violation of the
Fundamental Standard. The answer to this
question would in no way affect the penalties
imposed.
2. That student witnesses have the obligation
to testify when called before the Council.
(a) In the present case a student was called to
testify as to events he observed at the Faculty
Club at the time of the disruption. He claimed
that he had been present as a reporter for the
Stanford Daily and therefore he was privileged
not to testify.
(b) The Council subpoenaed this witness
because he was known to have been present
and it was felt that defendants might have
wished to elicit information from him. The
defendants declined to ask him questions and
he was excused.
(c) The Council at that time, however, and
now, holds that the claimed privilege does not
exist, that it has not been recognized by the
courts of the land, that there is no justification
for such a privilege, and that the refusal to

testify on such grounds cannot and will not be
tolerated. [This in no way, however, governs
the Council's attitude toward the privilege of a
reporter not to reveal the name of a
confidential informant, which privilege has
both been recognized and rejected in various
courts. 1
3. That persons who attend a hearing of the
Stanford Judicial Council, including the
defendants and their counsel, have an
obligation not to impede, disrupt, or in any
manner interfere with the conduct of the
proceedings.
(a) A number of persons who attended the
factual hearing, particularly on the first night,
in obvious support of the defendants,
deliberately attempted to disrupt the
proceedings and did, in fact, cause
considerably noise and confusion.
(b) The Council is not a court of law; it has no
bailiff or sheriff's department to maintain
order. Thus any handful of persons, who are
so inclined can seriously impede the
proceedings.
(c) The defendants themselves, and their
counsel, must share the blame for the
disorder, particularly during the first night.
They continually directed their comments to
their supporters in the audience rather than to
the members of the Council and they
attempted in numerous ways, including the
muttering of threats, to ridicule the Council
and to make its job impossible. All this was
done in spite of the Council's solemn promise,
duly kept, that they would be given an
opportunity at the hearings on motivatioto
say what they so desired about the basic issues
underlying their actions.
The Council does note that the defendants did
intercede during the most serious disruptions
to assist the Council, primarily to prevent the
Council from closing the hearings, and that
after the first night of the hearings, the
defendants were more restrained. Moreover,

the Council recognizes and appreciates the
efforts of Mr. Doron Weinberg, who, as sole
counsel after the first and second evenings,
assisted in maintaining order and preserving
the decorum of the proceedings.
(d) On the basis of its experience in this case,
regarding meetings that are open to the
general public, the Council will seriously
consider in future cases limiting the number of
persons in attendance. Furthermore, the
Council serves warning on those who would
disrupt future proceedings that the Council is
disposed to find in contempt persons who
engage in disruption of its proceedings and to
recommend immediate imposition of severe
sanctions.
4. That defendant Jack Gerson, who
apparently withdrew from the University
subsequent to January 14, 1969, but prior to
the hearings in this case, has failed to respond to
summonses from the Council duly served upon
him.
The Council recommends that, in accordance
with the Legislative and Judicial Charter of
1968, the University immediately withdraw
Mr. Gerson's registration privileges until such
time as he appears before the Council for the
trial of his case.
THIS DECISION AND ALL ITS PARTS ARE
UNANIMOUSLY ADOPTED BY THE
MEMBERS OF THE COUNCIL.
Dated: February 27, 1969
Editor's Note: The Judicial Council's reference
to "the faculty advisory Committee on
Disruptions" is, in fact, the President's advisory
group on campus disruptions. After hearing from
members of this group. President Pitzer informed
Dean Wyman that the students were believed to be
in violation of the campus policy on disruptions.
The faculty members did not instruct Wyman
directly.
Incremental costs for publication of this report
have been paid for the the Stanford Newsservice.
STATEMENT OF THE PROCEEDINGS
On January 15, 1969, the Stanford Judicial
Council was notified by the office of the Dean of
Students that on the previous day a group of
persons, believed primarily to be Stanford
students, had allegedly disrupted a meeting of the
University Board of Trustees which had been held
at the Stanford Faculty Club. The Council was
asked to investigate.
Pursuant to the Legislative and Judicial Charter
of 1968, the Council sent out five judicial aides to
investigate and interview witnesses. The judicial
aides made a comprehensive report to the Council
which included photographs, lists of witnesses and
participants, transcripts of tape-recorded
interviews of many persons, and additional
statements, including those of a number of
potential defendants.
At the Council's behest, the Chairman
examined the report and, on the basis of the
information therein, determined to call before
him, and one other member of the Council sitting
with him, some thirty-nine persons for the purpose
of charging them with violations of the Campus
Policy on Disruptions of October 7, 1968, and of
the Fundamental Standard, and to show each the
evidence the Council had obtained through its
judicial aides regarding his activities.
The letter summoning these persons was sent
by mail; in addition a copy of the letter was
personally served on each of them. The letter
contained the following:
(1) A statement that the person was charged
with violations of the Disruption Policy and
of the Fundamental Standard.
(2) An outline of proceedings to be followed
during trial of the case.
(3) A copy of the Council's rules containing
the rights of defendants as set out in the
Legislative and Judicial Charter of 1968.
(4) A date and time to appear before the
Chairman of the Council for a conference.
Each person summoned duly appeared with the
sole exception of Jack Gerson, who has at no time
appeared or taken part in these proceedings.
The Council Chairman, sitting with at least one
other member of the Council, showed each
defendant the evidence regarding his activities and
explained to each defendant the procedure to be
followed for trial. That procedure required a
bifurcated hearing. The first hearing would be
designed solely to determine what acts each
student had, or had not committed; the second
hearing would be devoted solely to matters of
motivation.
With but one exception, Fred Cohen, who was
also charged with acts of intimidation, each
student, for purposes of the present hearings, was
charged only with having disrupted the Board of
Trustees meeting; no specific acts of violence,
threats, etc. were alleged. [Defendant James
Johnson was also charged with having set a false
fire alarm but all hearings on this charge were
suspended pending decision on such a charge in the
county civil courts. ]
Every defendant was given an opportunity to
admit to the charge against him. He was told that
to do so would eliminate the need for the first
hearing in his case, but that he would still be
permitted to do three things;
(1) Take part in the motivational hearing.
(2) Argue the invalidity of the Campus Policy
on Disruptions.
(3) Argue that the Fundamental Standard does
not cover disruption without a showing of
specific acts such as violence, threats,
blocking access of other persons, etc.
Each student was further informed that any
specific facts regarding his individual conduct
which were brought out during a fact hearing
would be considered by the Council in deciding his
case.
Although defendants were told they had a right
to remain silent, many wished to discuss the nature
of their participation. On the basis of their
statements and the Council's continuing
investigation of the case, charges were withdrawn
against nine persons. Of the remaining twenty-nine
defendants, the following twelve initially decided
to admit to the charges against them:
Allen Christelow
Richard Greenspan
HallamC. Hamilton
Carolyn M. Iverson
Barbara E. Lee
Michael M. Morton
Christine M. Mrak
Jeffrey J. Preefer
Guy D. Smyth
Don P. Stuart
D. Jeffrey Weil
Helen K. Williams
Thereafter, two additional students, Irwin
Busse and Marc Weiss, also decided to admit the
charges against them. Thus, when the case
proceeded to the first hearing, only the following
fifteen students were involved:
John W. Avery
Anne C. Bauer
Richard F. Bogart
Fred H. Cohen
Marc D. Heller
James E. Johnson
Virginia A. Linsley
David F. Pugh
George C. Reinhardt
James E. Shoch
Leonard M. Siegel
Stephen S. Smith
Michael D. Vawter
Joan Williams (Mrs. Rodney W.)
Rodney W. Williams
This factual hearing was open to the public and
took place on February 11, 12 and 13.
Considerable evidence was received, including the
testimony of some 24 witnesses.
The motivational hearing, also open to the
public, was held on February 21. All twenty-nine
defendants subscribed to an organized
presentation of their views. Thereafter each
defendant was given an opportunity to add further
information on his own behalf.
STATEMENT OF THE GENERAL FACTS
On the basis of the evidence presented during
the hearings, the Council finds the following facts:
At the October 1968 meeting of the Stanford
University Board of Trustees, a student, Yale
Braunstein, Speaker of the Student Legislature,
was permitted to address the board members,
urging them to hold open meetings with students.
The Board Chairman, shortly thereafter, wrote a
letter to Mr. Braunstein, thanking him for his
remarks but not specifically mentioning the issue
of open meetings. Mr. Braunstein replied with a
letter to the Board Chairman emphasizing the
importance of the open-meeting request.
Although at both the November 1968 and January
14, 1969 meetings of the Board, student leaders
were invited to and did sit with a number of Board
committees, the Board made no statement, either
to Mr. Braunstein or the Stanford student body at
large, concerning meetings of the Board itself,
which would be open to members of the Stanford
community.
On the morning of January 14,1969, a group of
students circulated throughout the campus a
document requesting that all interested persons

arrive at Bowman Alumni House at 12:30 p.m. for
the purpose of holding an open meeting with the
trustees. The document contained nine specific
demands regarding the operations of the
University and the Stanford Research Institute.
At approximately 12:30 p.m., when a group of
students had collected at Bowman, they learned
that the trustees were at the Stanford Faculty
Club. The students then held a meeting to
determine what action to take. At about this time
Associate Dean of Students, Willard Wyman,
entered Bowman where one of the students
demanded that Wyman carry a message to the
trustees asking for an open meeting. Although he
made it clear that he was not a "messenger boy"
for the students, Dean Wyman nevertheless did in
fact go to the Faculty Club to tell members of the
University administration, including President
Pitzer, that a group of students at Bowman wished
to have an open meeting with the trustees and
would not leave Bowman until such a meeting was
arranged.
Shortly thereafter Yale Braunstein, who had
observed the meeting at Bowman, and apparently
was concerned that Dean Wyman would not
deliver the message, decided to attempt to
communicate with the Board himself. He went to
the Faculty Club where he met Dean Wyman who
arranged for Braunstein to enter the rooms where
the trustees were located. Mr. Braunstein spoke to
the trustees, stating that the students at Bowman
not only demanded an open meeting but would
consider whatever meeting the trustees did hold to
be an open one. This message was given twice, once
in a room where the bulk of the trustees were
sitting and in an adjacent room where the
Investment Committee was in session.
After delivering this message, Braunstein
immediately withdrew and proceeded to Bowman
where he found the students leaving, en route to
the Faculty Club.
As soon as Braunstein left the trustees, they had
a short discussion and unanimously passed a
motion not to alter their policy which permits
non-trustees to attend Board meetings only upon
express invitation. No effort was made to
communicate this decision to the students.
Shortly thereafter, apparently just prior to
1:00 p.m., the students entered the inner patio of
the Faculty Club. They did so by proceeding up
the outer stairway facing Tresidder Union and
down the inner stairway to the courtyard.
The students gathered in the inner court where
some of them rapped on the sliding glass doors of
the rooms in which the trustees were sitting. The
students shouted and made use of a "bullhorn" to
attract the attention of and communicate with the
trustees inside. Individual students unsuccessfully
attempted to open the sliding doors.
The trustees continued with their business,
attempting as best they could to ignore the
students. A number of the students then entered
the Faculty Club from the patio and congregated
in the hallway outside the rooms where the
trustees were meeting.
From the time that the students entered the
patio, just before 1:00 p.m. until a few minutes
past 2:00 p.m., the students' attempts to attract
the attention of the trustees were intensified by
means of shouting, beating and kicking on the
doors, reading demands through a "bullhorn," etc.
From time to time students attempted to open the
doors from the trustees rooms into the hallway,
but they had been locked from the inside. On
occasion, administrative personnel and waiters
passed through these doors but did so carefully in
order to keep the students out. At one such time a
student in the hallway attempted to force his way
in but personnel inside the room managed to
reclose and lock the door.
Shortly before 2:00 p.m. the Faculty Advisory
Committee on Disruptions sent one of its
members, Professor Clebsch, to speak with
President Pitzer and Chairman of the Board Fuller.
Professor Chebsch reported that the noise inside
the room was so intense that it seriously disturbed
the conduct of the board meeting and made it
virtually impossible for the meeting to continue.
Testimony from persons who were inside the room
at the time supported this statement.
At about 2:00 p.m. the Advisory Committee
informed Dean Wyman that the students were in
violation of the Campus Policy on Disruptions and
requested that he warn them of this and take their
names. Dean Wyman then announced in the
hallway that the Disruption Policy had been
violated and that any students who did not leave
would have their names taken. He did not,
however, identify himself as an official of the
University acting as such. Substantial testimony
indicated that some students in the hallway may
not have heard his statement or known who he
was.
Dean Wyman then proceeded to take the names
of students who remained in the hallway and in the
patio. A number of students did leave and their
names were not recorded; some others who did
remain refused to reveal their identity or gave false
names. As Dean Wyman moved through the
hallway taking names he was subjected to taunts
and occasional threats of violence.
By 2:15 p.m. most of the students who
remained after the warning congregated in the
hallway where they held an informal meeting to
determine their course of action; some students
argued that they should not remain at the Faculty
Club.
While this meeting continued the noise level
subsided substantially.
At about 2:25 p.m. one of the students gained
entrance to the trustees' rooms through one of the
sliding doors from the patio. He moved directly
across the room and opened one of the doors to
the hallway. University personnel within the room
as well as some who were in the hallway attempted
to shut the door but the students in the hallway
moved forward to keep the door open.
At the door the students at first hung back,
shouting that they wanted an open meeting with
the trustees. Their demands were read through a
bullhorn. Meanwhile a line of administrative
officers within the room formed at the open door
to prevent students from gaining entry into the
room.
There ensued a period of confusion with
pushing and shoving taking place both on the part
of the students in the hallway and the personnel
from inside the room. During this time one
University official lost his balance and fell into the
hallway. Some students were shouting and at least
one was so agitated that he uttered a threat to one
of the administrative personnel at the door.
Shortly thereafter the students succeeded in
entering the room. One of the students was highly
agitated and he insulted and threatened the
trustees. At least two students grabbed copies of
the agenda of the trustees meeting and a struggle
ensued between one of these students and
university officials who sought to retrieve the
agenda he had taken.
Some of the students attempted to engage the
trustees in discussion; the trustees cut off their
meeting and left. The students remained in the
room for a short time thereafter and gradually
dispersed of their own volition.

DECISION ON LEGAL ISSUES
At the factual hearing on February 11-13,
1969, the defendants raised several legal
arguments regarding the Policy on Campus
Disruption as follows:
I. That the Policy was no longer in effect on
January 14, 1969, when the alleged acts of
disruption occurred.
11. That paragraph two of the Policy did not
apply because the facts show beyond any doubt
that University officials did not comply with
requirements set out therein, and
111. That paragraph one of the Policy was
inapplicable because it is dependent upon
University official's compliance with the
requirements of paragraph two.
I. Was the Policy in Effect
Validity of the Policy on Disruptions:
A. Nature of the Argument
1. The Policy on Campus Disruption was
issued on October 7, 1968 by Acting President
Robert Glaser.
2. On October 7, 1968, the Legislative and
Judicial Charter of 1968 was not yet in effect.
That charter was submitted to a vote of the
student body which approved its adoption until
March 1, 1969. The vote was completed on
October 15, 1968, and the results were
announced on October 16, 1968.
3. The invalidity of the Policy is based upon
Article I, Sections D(2)(b), D(2)(d), and
D(2)(e), which read as follows:
Section D(2)(b): When in his opinion an
emergency exists that requires the
promulgation of a regulation, including change
or repeal of an existing regulation, in less time
than is required under the procedure set forth
in section D.l, the President of the University
may promulgate an interim regulation to
become effective immediately upon
publication, provided the President shall first
consult with as many members of the SCLC as
practicable and, if time permits, shall first
afford the SCLC an opportunity to act under
section D.2a.
Section D(2)(d): An interim regulation
promulgated by the President under section
D.2b shall remain in effect for 90 days or until
it is repealed or amended by the SCLC,
whichever occurs first.
The SCLC may amend or repeal interim
regulations by the procedure provided in
section D.l or, with the written concurrence of
the President, SCLC may proceed under section
D.2a.
Section D(2)(e): If in the case of an interim
regulation promulgated under section D.2b, 90
days expire with no action by the SCLC, the
President may repromulgate the interim
regulation every 30 days until SCLC acts on it.
He shall inform the SCLC of each
promulgation.
The argument is that the Policy on Campus
Disruption is subject to these provisions of the
Charter and hence expired on January 7, 1968,
some 7 days prior to the time of the alleged
offenses in this case. The policy was never formally
renewed.
B. Analysis
1. The Disruption Policy was clearly
promulgated prior to ratification of the
Charter.
2. The terms of the Charter can in no way be
considered binding on such a policy, since the
Charter distinguishes clearly between those
policies promulgated prior to the Charter and
those promulgated thereafter.
Section I.E of the Charter clearly provides this
as follows:
E. Relation to Present University Policy.
Until such time as the Student Conduct
Legislative Council changes any present
University policy, that policy will remain in
effect. It is recommended that the first order
of business of the SCLC be the consideration
of areas in which there are currently conflicts
of law.
Section lI.D of the Charter obligates this
Council to enforce "present policy" until
altered in the following terms:
D. Relation to University Policy. Each
member of the Stanford Judicial Council is
obligated to enforce the regulations of the
Student Conduct Legislative Council or the
legislative product of the President acting
after consultation with the SCLC as provided
in Article I, section D.2b. Until such time as
the SCLC changes present policy, the SJC will
be obligated in the case of conflicts of law to
enforce the University policy.
3. The policy was terned an "interim" one by
Dr. Glaser at the time of its announcement, as
he clearly hoped for student approval of the
Charter and a subsequent consideration of the
policy by the Student Conduct Legislative
Council. Dr. Glaser's statement was as follows:
The consensus was that the policy should be
issued on an interim basis. Its interim
character is emphasized because we anticipate
further action by appropriate governing
bodies of the faculty and students, and in
particular by the proposed Student Conduct
Legislative Council. Subsequent actions of
these bodies may confirm, amend or
supercede the temporary policy, which will be
in effect until such actions are taken.
Obviously this statement in no way impugns,
but rather affirms the fact that the policy was
promulgated without time limit and was to be
considered in force until such time as the SCLC,
if established, altered that policy.
4. As of January 14, 1969, the SCLC had not
altered the Policy on Disruptions.
C. Holding
The University Policy on Campus Disruption
Issued October 7, 1968, was in full force and effect
on January 14,1969.
11. Does Paragraph 2of
the Policy Apply
A. Nature of the Argument
1. Paragraph 2 of the Policy on Campus
Disruption reads as follows:
Members of the faculty, staff, and student body
have an obligation to leave a university building
or facility when asked to do so in the
furtherance of the above regulations by a
member of the university community acting in
an official role, and identifying himself as such;
members of the faculty, staff, or student body
also have an obligation to identify themselves,
when requested to do so by such a member of
the university community who has reasonable
grounds to believe that the person(s) has
violated section (1) or (2) of this policy and
who has so informed the person(s).
2. Although a general announcement was
made by Dean Wyman that the students in the
Faculty Club had violated the Policy, the
evidence is legally insufficient to show that this
message was heard by any or all of the
defendants.
3. The evidence clearly shows that Dean
Wyman failed to announce that he was "a
member of the university community acting in
an official role," and, furthermore, reveals
conclusively that at least some defendants did
not know him.

4. It is thus argued that the Council can find no
violation of paragraph two of the Policy.
B. Analysis
1. Paragraph two of the Policy is quite clear in
its requirements. Individuals should not be
forced to leave a university building or reveal
their identify until they know that the
individual who requires them to do so is
properly authorized. Otherwise paragraph two
could be an instrument of widespread abuse.
2. It is easy enough for university officials,
once informed of this decision, to comply
strictly with the paragraph two requirements.
The Council finds such strict compliance
necessary even when it might appear that
persons making the request are doing so in their
official capacity.
3. The evidence is clear and uncontradicted
that the requirements of paragraph two of the
Policy were not met.
C. Holding
No defendant shall be held guilty of a violation
of paragraph two of the Policy on Campus
Disruption of October 7,1968.
111. Is Paragraph One of the
Policy Separate from Paragraph Two
A. Nature of the Argument
1. Paragraph one of the Policy states as
follows:
It is a violation of university policy for a
member of the faculty, staff, or student body
to (1) prevent or disrupt the effective carrying
out of a university function or approved
activity, such as lectures, meetings, interviews,
ceremonies, the conduct of university business
in a university office, and public events; (2)
obstruct the legitimate movement of any
person about the campus or in any university
building or facility.
2. Paragraph two of the Policy is in
"furtherance" of paragraph one. Hence, it is
argued that paragraph one is to be enforced
only through paragraph two. Since the
requirements of paragraph two have not been
met, there can be no guilt under the policy.
B. Analysis
1. Paragraph one of the Policy on Campus
Disruption clearly states that certain disruptive
conduct is improper. There is no logical way by
which paragraph one can be considered
dependent upon paragraph two. Otherwise an
individual who engaged in such disruption
could, merely by leaving before being told to do
so, immunize himself from liability under the
Policy. This would be an open invitation for
members of the University community to
engage in "hit-and-run" raids.
2. Paragraph two has an entirely different
focus than does paragrpah one. It is often
necessary to clear a building to prevent
disruption or to end disruption in progress.
Thus persons can be required to leave and their
failure to do so is a violation in and of itself,
apart from any disruption which does in fact
occur.
The required notification of paragraph two is
meaningless with regard to an individual who
has already broken up a lecture or a meeting.
The present case clearly illustrates this point.
Dean Wyman's failure to properly identify
himself eliminates any guilt for mere failure to
leave the building; surely, however, it does not
justify acts of disruption done both before and
after his statements.
As to such acts of disruption if the defendants
did not know Dean Wyman or know that he was
acting in his official capacity, as they
successfully argued regarding II above, what he
said or didn't say was of no relevance.
C. Holding
Paragraph one of the Policy on Campus
Disruption is wholly independent from paragraph
two and failure to comply with the terms of the
latter does not prohibit a charge under the former.
SPECIFIC FINDINGS AS TO GUILT
The Council finds as follows:
1. That in addition to those fourteen students
who admitted disruption, the remaining fifteen
defendants, who received a hearing on the facts,
were guilty of acts that disrupted "the effective
carrying out of a university function," under
the Policy on Campus Disruption of October 7,
1968.
(a) From the time the students first entered
the inner patio at the Faculty Club until
shortly after 2:00 p.m., they attempted to
force the trustees to discontinue their regular
meeting by shouting, pounding on doors and
windows, and making statements through a
bullhorn.
(b) That these acts disrupted the trustees'
meeting is unmistakably clear. Although the
trustees attempted to continue with their
regular business, the noise from outside made
it extremely difficult for them to do so.
(c) That these acts by defendants were
intended to disrupt the trustees' meeting is
also clear. The refusal of the trustees to
acknowledge the presence of the students, the
fact that the trustees shut and locked the
doors, and the fact that entry of the students
into the meeting room was resisted at all times
is substantial evidence that the trustees did
not want or intend to meet with the students
at that time and that the students knew this.
(d) Quite apart from the noisy attempts to
disrupt the trustees' meeting, the actual entry
of the students into the meeting room at
approximately 2:25 to 2:30 p.m., through a
line of university officials who clearly were
attempting to keep them out, itself
constituted a flagrant act of disruption. At
that point, the trustees who were attempting
to deal with items on their regular agenda, had
no choice but to stop what they were doing.
(e) It is clear from the evidence, including the
pictures taken at the scene, that all but one of
the fifteen defendants who requested a
hearing, entered or pushed forward in
attempting to enter the open door of the room
where the trustees were meeting. The
exception is James Johnson and the testimony
regarding Mr. Johnson unmistakably shows
him to have engaged in acts of disruption by
banging and kicking on the locked doors to
the meeting room.
2. That Mr. Richard F. Bogart has no defense
on the ground that he was present as a reporter
for KZSU Radio Station.
(a) An individual who engages in illegal acts is
not immunized merely because he belongs, or
in the present case, has reason to believe he
belongs, to a news organization. By his own
statements Mr. Bogart showed that he was
present as a participant in the demonstration.
(b) The Council finds no credible evidence
sufficient for a finding that Mr. Bogart should
be exonerated as a KZSU reporter. Obviously,
participation by a person in illegal activities
cannot be excused even if that person
ultimately reports upon those activities in the
news media.
(c) Furthermore, the evidence regarding Mr.
Bogart is clearly distinguishable from that
available to the Council regarding other
reporters who were not charged or against

whom charges were brought and then
dismissed. These other persons were in
attendance as assigned reporters or
photographers. They took photographs and
notes for news stories which were published
shortly thereafter, and in doing so they clearly
distinguished themselves from the defendants
who were engaged in the disruption. This is
simply not the case with Mr. Bogart.
FINDINGS REGARDING CULPABILITY
The Council finds as follows:
1. That like the fourteen defendants who
admitted to the charge against them, the
following twelve defendant who received a
hearing on the facts engaged in no acts of
aggravation beyond general disruption:
John W. Avery
Anne C. Bauer
Richard F. Bogart
Marc D. Heller
Virginia A. Linsley
David F. Pugh
George C. Reinhardt
James E. Shoch
Leonard M. Siegel
Michael D. Vawter
Joan Williams (Mrs. Rodney W.)
Rodney W. Williams
2. That in addition to general disruption the
following students engaged in specific
aggravating acts as indicated:
(a) Fred H.Cohen
(1) Threatened a University official who
blocked his entry into the trustees meeting
room by stating words such as "get your
hands off me baby or I'll bust your head,"
upon gaining entry into the room further
threatened the trustees not to meet on the
campus again, and in general was so violent
in his manner that several of hiscodefendants
restrained him, and
(2) Took from inside the room a folder
containing the agenda of the trustees
meeting and placed it under his coat.
(b) James E. Johnson
Violently kicked and beat on the doors and
windows to the trustees' room, with his
heavy boots and with a stick.
(c) Stephen S. Smith
(1) At approximaetely 2:25 p.m. managed
to open one of the sliding glass doors from
the patio into the turstees' room, walked
across that room, and, after a struggle with
several university officials, opened the
doorway to the hall and invited the students
congregated there to come into the room.
[At this point the Council would note the
fact that it was unable to locate any witness
who could testify as to how Mr. Smith
succeeded in opening the door from the
patio into the trustees' room. Mr. Smith was
not called in deference to his privilege
against self-incrimination and he chose not
to testify. The Council does find, however,
the circumstantial evidence is overwhelming
that Mr. Smith entered the room knowing
that it was disruptive for him to do so. This is
clearly shown by his subsequent actions in
immediately attempting to open the door to
the hallway against the will of those
present. ]
(2) Took a folder containing an agenda of
the trustees meeting and refused to return it
at the request of a number of University
personnel who finally were forced to engage
in a struggle with Mr. Smith to retrieve it.
3. That the University administration and the
Board of Trustees failed to make clear to the
defendants what proper channels, if any,
existed for communication between students
on the one hand and the administration and the
Board on the other.
4. That the defendants were strongly
motivated by sincerely held beliefs and felt
frustrated by their apparent inability to state
those beliefs to the Board.
5. That the failure of the University
administration and the Board of Trustees to
develop and maintain methods for the orderly
exchange of views with the student body
regarding issues relevant to the University was a
contributing factor of the disruption.
6. That the defendants in the present case were
less interested in the orderly exchange of views
than they were in the imposition of their views
on the rest of the community.

Autumn Quarter of the 1969-70 academic
year.

5. That with respect to orders to pay money
under 1(b), 2(b), 3(b) and 4(b) above
(a) The Dean of Students, in his discretion
may upon application by a defendant,
postpone payment of any sum when it appears
necessary to avoid undue financial hardship.
(b) Provided, however, that in no event shall a
university degree be awarded to any
defendant until he has paid the full amount
due.
Analysis of the Recommendations on Penalty
1. The Council's recommendations as to
penalty are based on a total view of the
defendants' conduct in light of the Council's
desire, as set forth in its Rules, to utilize
penalties to strengthen the Stanford
community.
2. The penalties would have been more severe
had the defendants been aware of the existence
of a reasonably means by which to make their
views known to the Board of Trustees.
3. At the same time, however, the Council
considered the offense to be a very serious one
that must not be repeated. If every member of
the Stanford community who feels strongly
about an issue is permitted to disrupt the
campus to impose his views on others, the result
would be chaos. Indeed such actions are
counterproductive in that they tend to
eliminate opportunity for legitimate discussion
and resolution of vital issues.
4. The Council's imposition of periods of
probation takes into consideration the threat
by defendants, made at the motivational
hearing, to engage in further serious acts of
disruption. The Council takes the position that
if during the period of probation any defendant
carries out such a threat, and is duly convicted
thereof, the University community has the
right to insist upon his suspension.
5. The Council views as most serious those acts
which, directly or by implication, threaten
violence to any person. Fortunately, in the
present case no one was injured and there was

no serious damage to property. Nevertheless, a
real danger of personal injury exists when
persons ostensibly engaged in a demonstration
to present their views, lose their tempers or
engage in physical altercations. The penalties to
three individuals reflect the Council's position,
based on clear evidence, that in varying degrees,
these individuals materially increased the
danger of physical violence and personal injury.
6. In order that the University community not
be misled, the Council wishes to make clear that
its decision in this case was not based on the
military draft policy of the United States or on
the draft status of any of the defendants.
Findingson Collateral Matters
The Council finds as follows:
1. That in light of the fact that every defendant
was clearly in violation of the Policy on Campus
Disruption of October 7, 1968, which policy
was valid and in force, the Council feels it
unnecessary to determine whether or not the
defendants were also in violation of the
Fundamental Standard. The answer to this
question would in no way affect the penalties
imposed.
2. That student witnesses have the obligation
to testify when called before the Council.
(a) In the present case a student was called to
testify as to events he observed at the Faculty
Club at the time of the disruption. He claimed
that he had been present as a reporter for the
Stanford Daily and therefore he was privileged
not to testify.
(b) The Council subpoenaed this witness
because he was known to have been present
and it was felt that defendants might have
wished to elicit information from him. The
defendants declined to ask him questions and
he was excused.
(c) The Council at that time, however, and
now, holds that the claimed privilege does not
exist, that it has not been recognized by the
courts of the land, that there is no justification
for such a privilege, and that the refusal to

testify on such grounds cannot and will not be
tolerated. [This in no way, however, governs
the Council's attitude toward the privilege of a
reporter not to reveal the name of a
confidential informant, which privilege has
both been recognized and rejected in various
courts. 1
3. That persons who attend a hearing of the
Stanford Judicial Council, including the
defendants and their counsel, have an
obligation not to impede, disrupt, or in any
manner interfere with the conduct of the
proceedings.
(a) A number of persons who attended the
factual hearing, particularly on the first night,
in obvious support of the defendants,
deliberately attempted to disrupt the
proceedings and did, in fact, cause
considerably noise and confusion.
(b) The Council is not a court of law; it has no
bailiff or sheriff's department to maintain
order. Thus any handful of persons, who are
so inclined can seriously impede the
proceedings.
(c) The defendants themselves, and their
counsel, must share the blame for the
disorder, particularly during the first night.
They continually directed their comments to
their supporters in the audience rather than to
the members of the Council and they
attempted in numerous ways, including the
muttering of threats, to ridicule the Council
and to make its job impossible. All this was
done in spite of the Council's solemn promise,
duly kept, that they would be given an
opportunity at the hearings on motivatioto
say what they so desired about the basic issues
underlying their actions.
The Council does note that the defendants did
intercede during the most serious disruptions
to assist the Council, primarily to prevent the
Council from closing the hearings, and that
after the first night of the hearings, the
defendants were more restrained. Moreover,

the Council recognizes and appreciates the
efforts of Mr. Doron Weinberg, who, as sole
counsel after the first and second evenings,
assisted in maintaining order and preserving
the decorum of the proceedings.
(d) On the basis of its experience in this case,
regarding meetings that are open to the
general public, the Council will seriously
consider in future cases limiting the number of
persons in attendance. Furthermore, the
Council serves warning on those who would
disrupt future proceedings that the Council is
disposed to find in contempt persons who
engage in disruption of its proceedings and to
recommend immediate imposition of severe
sanctions.
4. That defendant Jack Gerson, who
apparently withdrew from the University
subsequent to January 14, 1969, but prior to
the hearings in this case, has failed to respond to
summonses from the Council duly served upon
him.
The Council recommends that, in accordance
with the Legislative and Judicial Charter of
1968, the University immediately withdraw
Mr. Gerson's registration privileges until such
time as he appears before the Council for the
trial of his case.
THIS DECISION AND ALL ITS PARTS ARE
UNANIMOUSLY ADOPTED BY THE
MEMBERS OF THE COUNCIL.
Dated: February 27, 1969
Editor's Note: The Judicial Council's reference
to "the faculty advisory Committee on
Disruptions" is, in fact, the President's advisory
group on campus disruptions. After hearing from
members of this group. President Pitzer informed
Dean Wyman that the students were believed to be
in violation of the campus policy on disruptions.
The faculty members did not instruct Wyman
directly.
Incremental costs for publication of this report
have been paid for the the Stanford Newsservice.
STATEMENT OF THE PROCEEDINGS
On January 15, 1969, the Stanford Judicial
Council was notified by the office of the Dean of
Students that on the previous day a group of
persons, believed primarily to be Stanford
students, had allegedly disrupted a meeting of the
University Board of Trustees which had been held
at the Stanford Faculty Club. The Council was
asked to investigate.
Pursuant to the Legislative and Judicial Charter
of 1968, the Council sent out five judicial aides to
investigate and interview witnesses. The judicial
aides made a comprehensive report to the Council
which included photographs, lists of witnesses and
participants, transcripts of tape-recorded
interviews of many persons, and additional
statements, including those of a number of
potential defendants.
At the Council's behest, the Chairman
examined the report and, on the basis of the
information therein, determined to call before
him, and one other member of the Council sitting
with him, some thirty-nine persons for the purpose
of charging them with violations of the Campus
Policy on Disruptions of October 7, 1968, and of
the Fundamental Standard, and to show each the
evidence the Council had obtained through its
judicial aides regarding his activities.
The letter summoning these persons was sent
by mail; in addition a copy of the letter was
personally served on each of them. The letter
contained the following:
(1) A statement that the person was charged
with violations of the Disruption Policy and
of the Fundamental Standard.
(2) An outline of proceedings to be followed
during trial of the case.
(3) A copy of the Council's rules containing
the rights of defendants as set out in the
Legislative and Judicial Charter of 1968.
(4) A date and time to appear before the
Chairman of the Council for a conference.
Each person summoned duly appeared with the
sole exception of Jack Gerson, who has at no time
appeared or taken part in these proceedings.
The Council Chairman, sitting with at least one
other member of the Council, showed each
defendant the evidence regarding his activities and
explained to each defendant the procedure to be
followed for trial. That procedure required a
bifurcated hearing. The first hearing would be
designed solely to determine what acts each
student had, or had not committed; the second
hearing would be devoted solely to matters of
motivation.
With but one exception, Fred Cohen, who was
also charged with acts of intimidation, each
student, for purposes of the present hearings, was
charged only with having disrupted the Board of
Trustees meeting; no specific acts of violence,
threats, etc. were alleged. [Defendant James
Johnson was also charged with having set a false
fire alarm but all hearings on this charge were
suspended pending decision on such a charge in the
county civil courts. ]
Every defendant was given an opportunity to
admit to the charge against him. He was told that
to do so would eliminate the need for the first
hearing in his case, but that he would still be
permitted to do three things;
(1) Take part in the motivational hearing.
(2) Argue the invalidity of the Campus Policy
on Disruptions.
(3) Argue that the Fundamental Standard does
not cover disruption without a showing of
specific acts such as violence, threats,
blocking access of other persons, etc.
Each student was further informed that any
specific facts regarding his individual conduct
which were brought out during a fact hearing
would be considered by the Council in deciding his
case.
Although defendants were told they had a right
to remain silent, many wished to discuss the nature
of their participation. On the basis of their
statements and the Council's continuing
investigation of the case, charges were withdrawn
against nine persons. Of the remaining twenty-nine
defendants, the following twelve initially decided
to admit to the charges against them:
Allen Christelow
Richard Greenspan
HallamC. Hamilton
Carolyn M. Iverson
Barbara E. Lee
Michael M. Morton
Christine M. Mrak
Jeffrey J. Preefer
Guy D. Smyth
Don P. Stuart
D. Jeffrey Weil
Helen K. Williams
Thereafter, two additional students, Irwin
Busse and Marc Weiss, also decided to admit the
charges against them. Thus, when the case
proceeded to the first hearing, only the following
fifteen students were involved:
John W. Avery
Anne C. Bauer
Richard F. Bogart
Fred H. Cohen
Marc D. Heller
James E. Johnson
Virginia A. Linsley
David F. Pugh
George C. Reinhardt
James E. Shoch
Leonard M. Siegel
Stephen S. Smith
Michael D. Vawter
Joan Williams (Mrs. Rodney W.)
Rodney W. Williams
This factual hearing was open to the public and
took place on February 11, 12 and 13.
Considerable evidence was received, including the
testimony of some 24 witnesses.
The motivational hearing, also open to the
public, was held on February 21. All twenty-nine
defendants subscribed to an organized
presentation of their views. Thereafter each
defendant was given an opportunity to add further
information on his own behalf.
STATEMENT OF THE GENERAL FACTS
On the basis of the evidence presented during
the hearings, the Council finds the following facts:
At the October 1968 meeting of the Stanford
University Board of Trustees, a student, Yale
Braunstein, Speaker of the Student Legislature,
was permitted to address the board members,
urging them to hold open meetings with students.
The Board Chairman, shortly thereafter, wrote a
letter to Mr. Braunstein, thanking him for his
remarks but not specifically mentioning the issue
of open meetings. Mr. Braunstein replied with a
letter to the Board Chairman emphasizing the
importance of the open-meeting request.
Although at both the November 1968 and January
14, 1969 meetings of the Board, student leaders
were invited to and did sit with a number of Board
committees, the Board made no statement, either
to Mr. Braunstein or the Stanford student body at
large, concerning meetings of the Board itself,
which would be open to members of the Stanford
community.
On the morning of January 14,1969, a group of
students circulated throughout the campus a
document requesting that all interested persons

arrive at Bowman Alumni House at 12:30 p.m. for
the purpose of holding an open meeting with the
trustees. The document contained nine specific
demands regarding the operations of the
University and the Stanford Research Institute.
At approximately 12:30 p.m., when a group of
students had collected at Bowman, they learned
that the trustees were at the Stanford Faculty
Club. The students then held a meeting to
determine what action to take. At about this time
Associate Dean of Students, Willard Wyman,
entered Bowman where one of the students
demanded that Wyman carry a message to the
trustees asking for an open meeting. Although he
made it clear that he was not a "messenger boy"
for the students, Dean Wyman nevertheless did in
fact go to the Faculty Club to tell members of the
University administration, including President
Pitzer, that a group of students at Bowman wished
to have an open meeting with the trustees and
would not leave Bowman until such a meeting was
arranged.
Shortly thereafter Yale Braunstein, who had
observed the meeting at Bowman, and apparently
was concerned that Dean Wyman would not
deliver the message, decided to attempt to
communicate with the Board himself. He went to
the Faculty Club where he met Dean Wyman who
arranged for Braunstein to enter the rooms where
the trustees were located. Mr. Braunstein spoke to
the trustees, stating that the students at Bowman
not only demanded an open meeting but would
consider whatever meeting the trustees did hold to
be an open one. This message was given twice, once
in a room where the bulk of the trustees were
sitting and in an adjacent room where the
Investment Committee was in session.
After delivering this message, Braunstein
immediately withdrew and proceeded to Bowman
where he found the students leaving, en route to
the Faculty Club.
As soon as Braunstein left the trustees, they had
a short discussion and unanimously passed a
motion not to alter their policy which permits
non-trustees to attend Board meetings only upon
express invitation. No effort was made to
communicate this decision to the students.
Shortly thereafter, apparently just prior to
1:00 p.m., the students entered the inner patio of
the Faculty Club. They did so by proceeding up
the outer stairway facing Tresidder Union and
down the inner stairway to the courtyard.
The students gathered in the inner court where
some of them rapped on the sliding glass doors of
the rooms in which the trustees were sitting. The
students shouted and made use of a "bullhorn" to
attract the attention of and communicate with the
trustees inside. Individual students unsuccessfully
attempted to open the sliding doors.
The trustees continued with their business,
attempting as best they could to ignore the
students. A number of the students then entered
the Faculty Club from the patio and congregated
in the hallway outside the rooms where the
trustees were meeting.
From the time that the students entered the
patio, just before 1:00 p.m. until a few minutes
past 2:00 p.m., the students' attempts to attract
the attention of the trustees were intensified by
means of shouting, beating and kicking on the
doors, reading demands through a "bullhorn," etc.
From time to time students attempted to open the
doors from the trustees rooms into the hallway,
but they had been locked from the inside. On
occasion, administrative personnel and waiters
passed through these doors but did so carefully in
order to keep the students out. At one such time a
student in the hallway attempted to force his way
in but personnel inside the room managed to
reclose and lock the door.
Shortly before 2:00 p.m. the Faculty Advisory
Committee on Disruptions sent one of its
members, Professor Clebsch, to speak with
President Pitzer and Chairman of the Board Fuller.
Professor Chebsch reported that the noise inside
the room was so intense that it seriously disturbed
the conduct of the board meeting and made it
virtually impossible for the meeting to continue.
Testimony from persons who were inside the room
at the time supported this statement.
At about 2:00 p.m. the Advisory Committee
informed Dean Wyman that the students were in
violation of the Campus Policy on Disruptions and
requested that he warn them of this and take their
names. Dean Wyman then announced in the
hallway that the Disruption Policy had been
violated and that any students who did not leave
would have their names taken. He did not,
however, identify himself as an official of the
University acting as such. Substantial testimony
indicated that some students in the hallway may
not have heard his statement or known who he
was.
Dean Wyman then proceeded to take the names
of students who remained in the hallway and in the
patio. A number of students did leave and their
names were not recorded; some others who did
remain refused to reveal their identity or gave false
names. As Dean Wyman moved through the
hallway taking names he was subjected to taunts
and occasional threats of violence.
By 2:15 p.m. most of the students who
remained after the warning congregated in the
hallway where they held an informal meeting to
determine their course of action; some students
argued that they should not remain at the Faculty
Club.
While this meeting continued the noise level
subsided substantially.
At about 2:25 p.m. one of the students gained
entrance to the trustees' rooms through one of the
sliding doors from the patio. He moved directly
across the room and opened one of the doors to
the hallway. University personnel within the room
as well as some who were in the hallway attempted
to shut the door but the students in the hallway
moved forward to keep the door open.
At the door the students at first hung back,
shouting that they wanted an open meeting with
the trustees. Their demands were read through a
bullhorn. Meanwhile a line of administrative
officers within the room formed at the open door
to prevent students from gaining entry into the
room.
There ensued a period of confusion with
pushing and shoving taking place both on the part
of the students in the hallway and the personnel
from inside the room. During this time one
University official lost his balance and fell into the
hallway. Some students were shouting and at least
one was so agitated that he uttered a threat to one
of the administrative personnel at the door.
Shortly thereafter the students succeeded in
entering the room. One of the students was highly
agitated and he insulted and threatened the
trustees. At least two students grabbed copies of
the agenda of the trustees meeting and a struggle
ensued between one of these students and
university officials who sought to retrieve the
agenda he had taken.
Some of the students attempted to engage the
trustees in discussion; the trustees cut off their
meeting and left. The students remained in the
room for a short time thereafter and gradually
dispersed of their own volition.

DECISION ON LEGAL ISSUES
At the factual hearing on February 11-13,
1969, the defendants raised several legal
arguments regarding the Policy on Campus
Disruption as follows:
I. That the Policy was no longer in effect on
January 14, 1969, when the alleged acts of
disruption occurred.
11. That paragraph two of the Policy did not
apply because the facts show beyond any doubt
that University officials did not comply with
requirements set out therein, and
111. That paragraph one of the Policy was
inapplicable because it is dependent upon
University official's compliance with the
requirements of paragraph two.
I. Was the Policy in Effect
Validity of the Policy on Disruptions:
A. Nature of the Argument
1. The Policy on Campus Disruption was
issued on October 7, 1968 by Acting President
Robert Glaser.
2. On October 7, 1968, the Legislative and
Judicial Charter of 1968 was not yet in effect.
That charter was submitted to a vote of the
student body which approved its adoption until
March 1, 1969. The vote was completed on
October 15, 1968, and the results were
announced on October 16, 1968.
3. The invalidity of the Policy is based upon
Article I, Sections D(2)(b), D(2)(d), and
D(2)(e), which read as follows:
Section D(2)(b): When in his opinion an
emergency exists that requires the
promulgation of a regulation, including change
or repeal of an existing regulation, in less time
than is required under the procedure set forth
in section D.l, the President of the University
may promulgate an interim regulation to
become effective immediately upon
publication, provided the President shall first
consult with as many members of the SCLC as
practicable and, if time permits, shall first
afford the SCLC an opportunity to act under
section D.2a.
Section D(2)(d): An interim regulation
promulgated by the President under section
D.2b shall remain in effect for 90 days or until
it is repealed or amended by the SCLC,
whichever occurs first.
The SCLC may amend or repeal interim
regulations by the procedure provided in
section D.l or, with the written concurrence of
the President, SCLC may proceed under section
D.2a.
Section D(2)(e): If in the case of an interim
regulation promulgated under section D.2b, 90
days expire with no action by the SCLC, the
President may repromulgate the interim
regulation every 30 days until SCLC acts on it.
He shall inform the SCLC of each
promulgation.
The argument is that the Policy on Campus
Disruption is subject to these provisions of the
Charter and hence expired on January 7, 1968,
some 7 days prior to the time of the alleged
offenses in this case. The policy was never formally
renewed.
B. Analysis
1. The Disruption Policy was clearly
promulgated prior to ratification of the
Charter.
2. The terms of the Charter can in no way be
considered binding on such a policy, since the
Charter distinguishes clearly between those
policies promulgated prior to the Charter and
those promulgated thereafter.
Section I.E of the Charter clearly provides this
as follows:
E. Relation to Present University Policy.
Until such time as the Student Conduct
Legislative Council changes any present
University policy, that policy will remain in
effect. It is recommended that the first order
of business of the SCLC be the consideration
of areas in which there are currently conflicts
of law.
Section lI.D of the Charter obligates this
Council to enforce "present policy" until
altered in the following terms:
D. Relation to University Policy. Each
member of the Stanford Judicial Council is
obligated to enforce the regulations of the
Student Conduct Legislative Council or the
legislative product of the President acting
after consultation with the SCLC as provided
in Article I, section D.2b. Until such time as
the SCLC changes present policy, the SJC will
be obligated in the case of conflicts of law to
enforce the University policy.
3. The policy was terned an "interim" one by
Dr. Glaser at the time of its announcement, as
he clearly hoped for student approval of the
Charter and a subsequent consideration of the
policy by the Student Conduct Legislative
Council. Dr. Glaser's statement was as follows:
The consensus was that the policy should be
issued on an interim basis. Its interim
character is emphasized because we anticipate
further action by appropriate governing
bodies of the faculty and students, and in
particular by the proposed Student Conduct
Legislative Council. Subsequent actions of
these bodies may confirm, amend or
supercede the temporary policy, which will be
in effect until such actions are taken.
Obviously this statement in no way impugns,
but rather affirms the fact that the policy was
promulgated without time limit and was to be
considered in force until such time as the SCLC,
if established, altered that policy.
4. As of January 14, 1969, the SCLC had not
altered the Policy on Disruptions.
C. Holding
The University Policy on Campus Disruption
Issued October 7, 1968, was in full force and effect
on January 14,1969.
11. Does Paragraph 2of
the Policy Apply
A. Nature of the Argument
1. Paragraph 2 of the Policy on Campus
Disruption reads as follows:
Members of the faculty, staff, and student body
have an obligation to leave a university building
or facility when asked to do so in the
furtherance of the above regulations by a
member of the university community acting in
an official role, and identifying himself as such;
members of the faculty, staff, or student body
also have an obligation to identify themselves,
when requested to do so by such a member of
the university community who has reasonable
grounds to believe that the person(s) has
violated section (1) or (2) of this policy and
who has so informed the person(s).
2. Although a general announcement was
made by Dean Wyman that the students in the
Faculty Club had violated the Policy, the
evidence is legally insufficient to show that this
message was heard by any or all of the
defendants.
3. The evidence clearly shows that Dean
Wyman failed to announce that he was "a
member of the university community acting in
an official role," and, furthermore, reveals
conclusively that at least some defendants did
not know him.

4. It is thus argued that the Council can find no
violation of paragraph two of the Policy.
B. Analysis
1. Paragraph two of the Policy is quite clear in
its requirements. Individuals should not be
forced to leave a university building or reveal
their identify until they know that the
individual who requires them to do so is
properly authorized. Otherwise paragraph two
could be an instrument of widespread abuse.
2. It is easy enough for university officials,
once informed of this decision, to comply
strictly with the paragraph two requirements.
The Council finds such strict compliance
necessary even when it might appear that
persons making the request are doing so in their
official capacity.
3. The evidence is clear and uncontradicted
that the requirements of paragraph two of the
Policy were not met.
C. Holding
No defendant shall be held guilty of a violation
of paragraph two of the Policy on Campus
Disruption of October 7,1968.
111. Is Paragraph One of the
Policy Separate from Paragraph Two
A. Nature of the Argument
1. Paragraph one of the Policy states as
follows:
It is a violation of university policy for a
member of the faculty, staff, or student body
to (1) prevent or disrupt the effective carrying
out of a university function or approved
activity, such as lectures, meetings, interviews,
ceremonies, the conduct of university business
in a university office, and public events; (2)
obstruct the legitimate movement of any
person about the campus or in any university
building or facility.
2. Paragraph two of the Policy is in
"furtherance" of paragraph one. Hence, it is
argued that paragraph one is to be enforced
only through paragraph two. Since the
requirements of paragraph two have not been
met, there can be no guilt under the policy.
B. Analysis
1. Paragraph one of the Policy on Campus
Disruption clearly states that certain disruptive
conduct is improper. There is no logical way by
which paragraph one can be considered
dependent upon paragraph two. Otherwise an
individual who engaged in such disruption
could, merely by leaving before being told to do
so, immunize himself from liability under the
Policy. This would be an open invitation for
members of the University community to
engage in "hit-and-run" raids.
2. Paragraph two has an entirely different
focus than does paragrpah one. It is often
necessary to clear a building to prevent
disruption or to end disruption in progress.
Thus persons can be required to leave and their
failure to do so is a violation in and of itself,
apart from any disruption which does in fact
occur.
The required notification of paragraph two is
meaningless with regard to an individual who
has already broken up a lecture or a meeting.
The present case clearly illustrates this point.
Dean Wyman's failure to properly identify
himself eliminates any guilt for mere failure to
leave the building; surely, however, it does not
justify acts of disruption done both before and
after his statements.
As to such acts of disruption if the defendants
did not know Dean Wyman or know that he was
acting in his official capacity, as they
successfully argued regarding II above, what he
said or didn't say was of no relevance.
C. Holding
Paragraph one of the Policy on Campus
Disruption is wholly independent from paragraph
two and failure to comply with the terms of the
latter does not prohibit a charge under the former.
SPECIFIC FINDINGS AS TO GUILT
The Council finds as follows:
1. That in addition to those fourteen students
who admitted disruption, the remaining fifteen
defendants, who received a hearing on the facts,
were guilty of acts that disrupted "the effective
carrying out of a university function," under
the Policy on Campus Disruption of October 7,
1968.
(a) From the time the students first entered
the inner patio at the Faculty Club until
shortly after 2:00 p.m., they attempted to
force the trustees to discontinue their regular
meeting by shouting, pounding on doors and
windows, and making statements through a
bullhorn.
(b) That these acts disrupted the trustees'
meeting is unmistakably clear. Although the
trustees attempted to continue with their
regular business, the noise from outside made
it extremely difficult for them to do so.
(c) That these acts by defendants were
intended to disrupt the trustees' meeting is
also clear. The refusal of the trustees to
acknowledge the presence of the students, the
fact that the trustees shut and locked the
doors, and the fact that entry of the students
into the meeting room was resisted at all times
is substantial evidence that the trustees did
not want or intend to meet with the students
at that time and that the students knew this.
(d) Quite apart from the noisy attempts to
disrupt the trustees' meeting, the actual entry
of the students into the meeting room at
approximately 2:25 to 2:30 p.m., through a
line of university officials who clearly were
attempting to keep them out, itself
constituted a flagrant act of disruption. At
that point, the trustees who were attempting
to deal with items on their regular agenda, had
no choice but to stop what they were doing.
(e) It is clear from the evidence, including the
pictures taken at the scene, that all but one of
the fifteen defendants who requested a
hearing, entered or pushed forward in
attempting to enter the open door of the room
where the trustees were meeting. The
exception is James Johnson and the testimony
regarding Mr. Johnson unmistakably shows
him to have engaged in acts of disruption by
banging and kicking on the locked doors to
the meeting room.
2. That Mr. Richard F. Bogart has no defense
on the ground that he was present as a reporter
for KZSU Radio Station.
(a) An individual who engages in illegal acts is
not immunized merely because he belongs, or
in the present case, has reason to believe he
belongs, to a news organization. By his own
statements Mr. Bogart showed that he was
present as a participant in the demonstration.
(b) The Council finds no credible evidence
sufficient for a finding that Mr. Bogart should
be exonerated as a KZSU reporter. Obviously,
participation by a person in illegal activities
cannot be excused even if that person
ultimately reports upon those activities in the
news media.
(c) Furthermore, the evidence regarding Mr.
Bogart is clearly distinguishable from that
available to the Council regarding other
reporters who were not charged or against

whom charges were brought and then
dismissed. These other persons were in
attendance as assigned reporters or
photographers. They took photographs and
notes for news stories which were published
shortly thereafter, and in doing so they clearly
distinguished themselves from the defendants
who were engaged in the disruption. This is
simply not the case with Mr. Bogart.
FINDINGS REGARDING CULPABILITY
The Council finds as follows:
1. That like the fourteen defendants who
admitted to the charge against them, the
following twelve defendant who received a
hearing on the facts engaged in no acts of
aggravation beyond general disruption:
John W. Avery
Anne C. Bauer
Richard F. Bogart
Marc D. Heller
Virginia A. Linsley
David F. Pugh
George C. Reinhardt
James E. Shoch
Leonard M. Siegel
Michael D. Vawter
Joan Williams (Mrs. Rodney W.)
Rodney W. Williams
2. That in addition to general disruption the
following students engaged in specific
aggravating acts as indicated:
(a) Fred H.Cohen
(1) Threatened a University official who
blocked his entry into the trustees meeting
room by stating words such as "get your
hands off me baby or I'll bust your head,"
upon gaining entry into the room further
threatened the trustees not to meet on the
campus again, and in general was so violent
in his manner that several of hiscodefendants
restrained him, and
(2) Took from inside the room a folder
containing the agenda of the trustees
meeting and placed it under his coat.
(b) James E. Johnson
Violently kicked and beat on the doors and
windows to the trustees' room, with his
heavy boots and with a stick.
(c) Stephen S. Smith
(1) At approximaetely 2:25 p.m. managed
to open one of the sliding glass doors from
the patio into the turstees' room, walked
across that room, and, after a struggle with
several university officials, opened the
doorway to the hall and invited the students
congregated there to come into the room.
[At this point the Council would note the
fact that it was unable to locate any witness
who could testify as to how Mr. Smith
succeeded in opening the door from the
patio into the trustees' room. Mr. Smith was
not called in deference to his privilege
against self-incrimination and he chose not
to testify. The Council does find, however,
the circumstantial evidence is overwhelming
that Mr. Smith entered the room knowing
that it was disruptive for him to do so. This is
clearly shown by his subsequent actions in
immediately attempting to open the door to
the hallway against the will of those
present. ]
(2) Took a folder containing an agenda of
the trustees meeting and refused to return it
at the request of a number of University
personnel who finally were forced to engage
in a struggle with Mr. Smith to retrieve it.
3. That the University administration and the
Board of Trustees failed to make clear to the
defendants what proper channels, if any,
existed for communication between students
on the one hand and the administration and the
Board on the other.
4. That the defendants were strongly
motivated by sincerely held beliefs and felt
frustrated by their apparent inability to state
those beliefs to the Board.
5. That the failure of the University
administration and the Board of Trustees to
develop and maintain methods for the orderly
exchange of views with the student body
regarding issues relevant to the University was a
contributing factor of the disruption.
6. That the defendants in the present case were
less interested in the orderly exchange of views
than they were in the imposition of their views
on the rest of the community.

5. That with respect to orders to pay money
under 1(b), 2(b), 3(b) and 4(b) above
(a) The Dean of Students, in his discretion
may upon application by a defendant,
postpone payment of any sum when it appears
necessary to avoid undue financial hardship.
(b) Provided, however, that in no event shall a
university degree be awarded to any
defendant until he has paid the full amount
due.
Analysis of the Recommendations on Penalty
1. The Council's recommendations as to
penalty are based on a total view of the
defendants' conduct in light of the Council's
desire, as set forth in its Rules, to utilize
penalties to strengthen the Stanford
community.
2. The penalties would have been more severe
had the defendants been aware of the existence
of a reasonably means by which to make their
views known to the Board of Trustees.
3. At the same time, however, the Council
considered the offense to be a very serious one
that must not be repeated. If every member of
the Stanford community who feels strongly
about an issue is permitted to disrupt the
campus to impose his views on others, the result
would be chaos. Indeed such actions are
counterproductive in that they tend to
eliminate opportunity for legitimate discussion
and resolution of vital issues.
4. The Council's imposition of periods of
probation takes into consideration the threat
by defendants, made at the motivational
hearing, to engage in further serious acts of
disruption. The Council takes the position that
if during the period of probation any defendant
carries out such a threat, and is duly convicted
thereof, the University community has the
right to insist upon his suspension.
5. The Council views as most serious those acts
which, directly or by implication, threaten
violence to any person. Fortunately, in the
present case no one was injured and there was

no serious damage to property. Nevertheless, a
real danger of personal injury exists when
persons ostensibly engaged in a demonstration
to present their views, lose their tempers or
engage in physical altercations. The penalties to
three individuals reflect the Council's position,
based on clear evidence, that in varying degrees,
these individuals materially increased the
danger of physical violence and personal injury.
6. In order that the University community not
be misled, the Council wishes to make clear that
its decision in this case was not based on the
military draft policy of the United States or on
the draft status of any of the defendants.
Findingson Collateral Matters
The Council finds as follows:
1. That in light of the fact that every defendant
was clearly in violation of the Policy on Campus
Disruption of October 7, 1968, which policy
was valid and in force, the Council feels it
unnecessary to determine whether or not the
defendants were also in violation of the
Fundamental Standard. The answer to this
question would in no way affect the penalties
imposed.
2. That student witnesses have the obligation
to testify when called before the Council.
(a) In the present case a student was called to
testify as to events he observed at the Faculty
Club at the time of the disruption. He claimed
that he had been present as a reporter for the
Stanford Daily and therefore he was privileged
not to testify.
(b) The Council subpoenaed this witness
because he was known to have been present
and it was felt that defendants might have
wished to elicit information from him. The
defendants declined to ask him questions and
he was excused.
(c) The Council at that time, however, and
now, holds that the claimed privilege does not
exist, that it has not been recognized by the
courts of the land, that there is no justification
for such a privilege, and that the refusal to

testify on such grounds cannot and will not be
tolerated. [This in no way, however, governs
the Council's attitude toward the privilege of a
reporter not to reveal the name of a
confidential informant, which privilege has
both been recognized and rejected in various
courts. 1
3. That persons who attend a hearing of the
Stanford Judicial Council, including the
defendants and their counsel, have an
obligation not to impede, disrupt, or in any
manner interfere with the conduct of the
proceedings.
(a) A number of persons who attended the
factual hearing, particularly on the first night,
in obvious support of the defendants,
deliberately attempted to disrupt the
proceedings and did, in fact, cause
considerably noise and confusion.
(b) The Council is not a court of law; it has no
bailiff or sheriff's department to maintain
order. Thus any handful of persons, who are
so inclined can seriously impede the
proceedings.
(c) The defendants themselves, and their
counsel, must share the blame for the
disorder, particularly during the first night.
They continually directed their comments to
their supporters in the audience rather than to
the members of the Council and they
attempted in numerous ways, including the
muttering of threats, to ridicule the Council
and to make its job impossible. All this was
done in spite of the Council's solemn promise,
duly kept, that they would be given an
opportunity at the hearings on motivatioto
say what they so desired about the basic issues
underlying their actions.
The Council does note that the defendants did
intercede during the most serious disruptions
to assist the Council, primarily to prevent the
Council from closing the hearings, and that
after the first night of the hearings, the
defendants were more restrained. Moreover,

the Council recognizes and appreciates the
efforts of Mr. Doron Weinberg, who, as sole
counsel after the first and second evenings,
assisted in maintaining order and preserving
the decorum of the proceedings.
(d) On the basis of its experience in this case,
regarding meetings that are open to the
general public, the Council will seriously
consider in future cases limiting the number of
persons in attendance. Furthermore, the
Council serves warning on those who would
disrupt future proceedings that the Council is
disposed to find in contempt persons who
engage in disruption of its proceedings and to
recommend immediate imposition of severe
sanctions.
4. That defendant Jack Gerson, who
apparently withdrew from the University
subsequent to January 14, 1969, but prior to
the hearings in this case, has failed to respond to
summonses from the Council duly served upon
him.
The Council recommends that, in accordance
with the Legislative and Judicial Charter of
1968, the University immediately withdraw
Mr. Gerson's registration privileges until such
time as he appears before the Council for the
trial of his case.
THIS DECISION AND ALL ITS PARTS ARE
UNANIMOUSLY ADOPTED BY THE
MEMBERS OF THE COUNCIL.
Dated: February 27, 1969
Editor's Note: The Judicial Council's reference
to "the faculty advisory Committee on
Disruptions" is, in fact, the President's advisory
group on campus disruptions. After hearing from
members of this group. President Pitzer informed
Dean Wyman that the students were believed to be
in violation of the campus policy on disruptions.
The faculty members did not instruct Wyman
directly.
Incremental costs for publication of this report
have been paid for the the Stanford Newsservice.
STATEMENT OF THE PROCEEDINGS
On January 15, 1969, the Stanford Judicial
Council was notified by the office of the Dean of
Students that on the previous day a group of
persons, believed primarily to be Stanford
students, had allegedly disrupted a meeting of the
University Board of Trustees which had been held
at the Stanford Faculty Club. The Council was
asked to investigate.
Pursuant to the Legislative and Judicial Charter
of 1968, the Council sent out five judicial aides to
investigate and interview witnesses. The judicial
aides made a comprehensive report to the Council
which included photographs, lists of witnesses and
participants, transcripts of tape-recorded
interviews of many persons, and additional
statements, including those of a number of
potential defendants.
At the Council's behest, the Chairman
examined the report and, on the basis of the
information therein, determined to call before
him, and one other member of the Council sitting
with him, some thirty-nine persons for the purpose
of charging them with violations of the Campus
Policy on Disruptions of October 7, 1968, and of
the Fundamental Standard, and to show each the
evidence the Council had obtained through its
judicial aides regarding his activities.
The letter summoning these persons was sent
by mail; in addition a copy of the letter was
personally served on each of them. The letter
contained the following:
(1) A statement that the person was charged
with violations of the Disruption Policy and
of the Fundamental Standard.
(2) An outline of proceedings to be followed
during trial of the case.
(3) A copy of the Council's rules containing
the rights of defendants as set out in the
Legislative and Judicial Charter of 1968.
(4) A date and time to appear before the
Chairman of the Council for a conference.
Each person summoned duly appeared with the
sole exception of Jack Gerson, who has at no time
appeared or taken part in these proceedings.
The Council Chairman, sitting with at least one
other member of the Council, showed each
defendant the evidence regarding his activities and
explained to each defendant the procedure to be
followed for trial. That procedure required a
bifurcated hearing. The first hearing would be
designed solely to determine what acts each
student had, or had not committed; the second
hearing would be devoted solely to matters of
motivation.
With but one exception, Fred Cohen, who was
also charged with acts of intimidation, each
student, for purposes of the present hearings, was
charged only with having disrupted the Board of
Trustees meeting; no specific acts of violence,
threats, etc. were alleged. [Defendant James
Johnson was also charged with having set a false
fire alarm but all hearings on this charge were
suspended pending decision on such a charge in the
county civil courts. ]
Every defendant was given an opportunity to
admit to the charge against him. He was told that
to do so would eliminate the need for the first
hearing in his case, but that he would still be
permitted to do three things;
(1) Take part in the motivational hearing.
(2) Argue the invalidity of the Campus Policy
on Disruptions.
(3) Argue that the Fundamental Standard does
not cover disruption without a showing of
specific acts such as violence, threats,
blocking access of other persons, etc.
Each student was further informed that any
specific facts regarding his individual conduct
which were brought out during a fact hearing
would be considered by the Council in deciding his
case.
Although defendants were told they had a right
to remain silent, many wished to discuss the nature
of their participation. On the basis of their
statements and the Council's continuing
investigation of the case, charges were withdrawn
against nine persons. Of the remaining twenty-nine
defendants, the following twelve initially decided
to admit to the charges against them:
Allen Christelow
Richard Greenspan
HallamC. Hamilton
Carolyn M. Iverson
Barbara E. Lee
Michael M. Morton
Christine M. Mrak
Jeffrey J. Preefer
Guy D. Smyth
Don P. Stuart
D. Jeffrey Weil
Helen K. Williams
Thereafter, two additional students, Irwin
Busse and Marc Weiss, also decided to admit the
charges against them. Thus, when the case
proceeded to the first hearing, only the following
fifteen students were involved:
John W. Avery
Anne C. Bauer
Richard F. Bogart
Fred H. Cohen
Marc D. Heller
James E. Johnson
Virginia A. Linsley
David F. Pugh
George C. Reinhardt
James E. Shoch
Leonard M. Siegel
Stephen S. Smith
Michael D. Vawter
Joan Williams (Mrs. Rodney W.)
Rodney W. Williams
This factual hearing was open to the public and
took place on February 11, 12 and 13.
Considerable evidence was received, including the
testimony of some 24 witnesses.
The motivational hearing, also open to the
public, was held on February 21. All twenty-nine
defendants subscribed to an organized
presentation of their views. Thereafter each
defendant was given an opportunity to add further
information on his own behalf.
STATEMENT OF THE GENERAL FACTS
On the basis of the evidence presented during
the hearings, the Council finds the following facts:
At the October 1968 meeting of the Stanford
University Board of Trustees, a student, Yale
Braunstein, Speaker of the Student Legislature,
was permitted to address the board members,
urging them to hold open meetings with students.
The Board Chairman, shortly thereafter, wrote a
letter to Mr. Braunstein, thanking him for his
remarks but not specifically mentioning the issue
of open meetings. Mr. Braunstein replied with a
letter to the Board Chairman emphasizing the
importance of the open-meeting request.
Although at both the November 1968 and January
14, 1969 meetings of the Board, student leaders
were invited to and did sit with a number of Board
committees, the Board made no statement, either
to Mr. Braunstein or the Stanford student body at
large, concerning meetings of the Board itself,
which would be open to members of the Stanford
community.
On the morning of January 14,1969, a group of
students circulated throughout the campus a
document requesting that all interested persons

arrive at Bowman Alumni House at 12:30 p.m. for
the purpose of holding an open meeting with the
trustees. The document contained nine specific
demands regarding the operations of the
University and the Stanford Research Institute.
At approximately 12:30 p.m., when a group of
students had collected at Bowman, they learned
that the trustees were at the Stanford Faculty
Club. The students then held a meeting to
determine what action to take. At about this time
Associate Dean of Students, Willard Wyman,
entered Bowman where one of the students
demanded that Wyman carry a message to the
trustees asking for an open meeting. Although he
made it clear that he was not a "messenger boy"
for the students, Dean Wyman nevertheless did in
fact go to the Faculty Club to tell members of the
University administration, including President
Pitzer, that a group of students at Bowman wished
to have an open meeting with the trustees and
would not leave Bowman until such a meeting was
arranged.
Shortly thereafter Yale Braunstein, who had
observed the meeting at Bowman, and apparently
was concerned that Dean Wyman would not
deliver the message, decided to attempt to
communicate with the Board himself. He went to
the Faculty Club where he met Dean Wyman who
arranged for Braunstein to enter the rooms where
the trustees were located. Mr. Braunstein spoke to
the trustees, stating that the students at Bowman
not only demanded an open meeting but would
consider whatever meeting the trustees did hold to
be an open one. This message was given twice, once
in a room where the bulk of the trustees were
sitting and in an adjacent room where the
Investment Committee was in session.
After delivering this message, Braunstein
immediately withdrew and proceeded to Bowman
where he found the students leaving, en route to
the Faculty Club.
As soon as Braunstein left the trustees, they had
a short discussion and unanimously passed a
motion not to alter their policy which permits
non-trustees to attend Board meetings only upon
express invitation. No effort was made to
communicate this decision to the students.
Shortly thereafter, apparently just prior to
1:00 p.m., the students entered the inner patio of
the Faculty Club. They did so by proceeding up
the outer stairway facing Tresidder Union and
down the inner stairway to the courtyard.
The students gathered in the inner court where
some of them rapped on the sliding glass doors of
the rooms in which the trustees were sitting. The
students shouted and made use of a "bullhorn" to
attract the attention of and communicate with the
trustees inside. Individual students unsuccessfully
attempted to open the sliding doors.
The trustees continued with their business,
attempting as best they could to ignore the
students. A number of the students then entered
the Faculty Club from the patio and congregated
in the hallway outside the rooms where the
trustees were meeting.
From the time that the students entered the
patio, just before 1:00 p.m. until a few minutes
past 2:00 p.m., the students' attempts to attract
the attention of the trustees were intensified by
means of shouting, beating and kicking on the
doors, reading demands through a "bullhorn," etc.
From time to time students attempted to open the
doors from the trustees rooms into the hallway,
but they had been locked from the inside. On
occasion, administrative personnel and waiters
passed through these doors but did so carefully in
order to keep the students out. At one such time a
student in the hallway attempted to force his way
in but personnel inside the room managed to
reclose and lock the door.
Shortly before 2:00 p.m. the Faculty Advisory
Committee on Disruptions sent one of its
members, Professor Clebsch, to speak with
President Pitzer and Chairman of the Board Fuller.
Professor Chebsch reported that the noise inside
the room was so intense that it seriously disturbed
the conduct of the board meeting and made it
virtually impossible for the meeting to continue.
Testimony from persons who were inside the room
at the time supported this statement.
At about 2:00 p.m. the Advisory Committee
informed Dean Wyman that the students were in
violation of the Campus Policy on Disruptions and
requested that he warn them of this and take their
names. Dean Wyman then announced in the
hallway that the Disruption Policy had been
violated and that any students who did not leave
would have their names taken. He did not,
however, identify himself as an official of the
University acting as such. Substantial testimony
indicated that some students in the hallway may
not have heard his statement or known who he
was.
Dean Wyman then proceeded to take the names
of students who remained in the hallway and in the
patio. A number of students did leave and their
names were not recorded; some others who did
remain refused to reveal their identity or gave false
names. As Dean Wyman moved through the
hallway taking names he was subjected to taunts
and occasional threats of violence.
By 2:15 p.m. most of the students who
remained after the warning congregated in the
hallway where they held an informal meeting to
determine their course of action; some students
argued that they should not remain at the Faculty
Club.
While this meeting continued the noise level
subsided substantially.
At about 2:25 p.m. one of the students gained
entrance to the trustees' rooms through one of the
sliding doors from the patio. He moved directly
across the room and opened one of the doors to
the hallway. University personnel within the room
as well as some who were in the hallway attempted
to shut the door but the students in the hallway
moved forward to keep the door open.
At the door the students at first hung back,
shouting that they wanted an open meeting with
the trustees. Their demands were read through a
bullhorn. Meanwhile a line of administrative
officers within the room formed at the open door
to prevent students from gaining entry into the
room.
There ensued a period of confusion with
pushing and shoving taking place both on the part
of the students in the hallway and the personnel
from inside the room. During this time one
University official lost his balance and fell into the
hallway. Some students were shouting and at least
one was so agitated that he uttered a threat to one
of the administrative personnel at the door.
Shortly thereafter the students succeeded in
entering the room. One of the students was highly
agitated and he insulted and threatened the
trustees. At least two students grabbed copies of
the agenda of the trustees meeting and a struggle
ensued between one of these students and
university officials who sought to retrieve the
agenda he had taken.
Some of the students attempted to engage the
trustees in discussion; the trustees cut off their
meeting and left. The students remained in the
room for a short time thereafter and gradually
dispersed of their own volition.

DECISION ON LEGAL ISSUES
At the factual hearing on February 11-13,
1969, the defendants raised several legal
arguments regarding the Policy on Campus
Disruption as follows:
I. That the Policy was no longer in effect on
January 14, 1969, when the alleged acts of
disruption occurred.
11. That paragraph two of the Policy did not
apply because the facts show beyond any doubt
that University officials did not comply with
requirements set out therein, and
111. That paragraph one of the Policy was
inapplicable because it is dependent upon
University official's compliance with the
requirements of paragraph two.
I. Was the Policy in Effect
Validity of the Policy on Disruptions:
A. Nature of the Argument
1. The Policy on Campus Disruption was
issued on October 7, 1968 by Acting President
Robert Glaser.
2. On October 7, 1968, the Legislative and
Judicial Charter of 1968 was not yet in effect.
That charter was submitted to a vote of the
student body which approved its adoption until
March 1, 1969. The vote was completed on
October 15, 1968, and the results were
announced on October 16, 1968.
3. The invalidity of the Policy is based upon
Article I, Sections D(2)(b), D(2)(d), and
D(2)(e), which read as follows:
Section D(2)(b): When in his opinion an
emergency exists that requires the
promulgation of a regulation, including change
or repeal of an existing regulation, in less time
than is required under the procedure set forth
in section D.l, the President of the University
may promulgate an interim regulation to
become effective immediately upon
publication, provided the President shall first
consult with as many members of the SCLC as
practicable and, if time permits, shall first
afford the SCLC an opportunity to act under
section D.2a.
Section D(2)(d): An interim regulation
promulgated by the President under section
D.2b shall remain in effect for 90 days or until
it is repealed or amended by the SCLC,
whichever occurs first.
The SCLC may amend or repeal interim
regulations by the procedure provided in
section D.l or, with the written concurrence of
the President, SCLC may proceed under section
D.2a.
Section D(2)(e): If in the case of an interim
regulation promulgated under section D.2b, 90
days expire with no action by the SCLC, the
President may repromulgate the interim
regulation every 30 days until SCLC acts on it.
He shall inform the SCLC of each
promulgation.
The argument is that the Policy on Campus
Disruption is subject to these provisions of the
Charter and hence expired on January 7, 1968,
some 7 days prior to the time of the alleged
offenses in this case. The policy was never formally
renewed.
B. Analysis
1. The Disruption Policy was clearly
promulgated prior to ratification of the
Charter.
2. The terms of the Charter can in no way be
considered binding on such a policy, since the
Charter distinguishes clearly between those
policies promulgated prior to the Charter and
those promulgated thereafter.
Section I.E of the Charter clearly provides this
as follows:
E. Relation to Present University Policy.
Until such time as the Student Conduct
Legislative Council changes any present
University policy, that policy will remain in
effect. It is recommended that the first order
of business of the SCLC be the consideration
of areas in which there are currently conflicts
of law.
Section lI.D of the Charter obligates this
Council to enforce "present policy" until
altered in the following terms:
D. Relation to University Policy. Each
member of the Stanford Judicial Council is
obligated to enforce the regulations of the
Student Conduct Legislative Council or the
legislative product of the President acting
after consultation with the SCLC as provided
in Article I, section D.2b. Until such time as
the SCLC changes present policy, the SJC will
be obligated in the case of conflicts of law to
enforce the University policy.
3. The policy was terned an "interim" one by
Dr. Glaser at the time of its announcement, as
he clearly hoped for student approval of the
Charter and a subsequent consideration of the
policy by the Student Conduct Legislative
Council. Dr. Glaser's statement was as follows:
The consensus was that the policy should be
issued on an interim basis. Its interim
character is emphasized because we anticipate
further action by appropriate governing
bodies of the faculty and students, and in
particular by the proposed Student Conduct
Legislative Council. Subsequent actions of
these bodies may confirm, amend or
supercede the temporary policy, which will be
in effect until such actions are taken.
Obviously this statement in no way impugns,
but rather affirms the fact that the policy was
promulgated without time limit and was to be
considered in force until such time as the SCLC,
if established, altered that policy.
4. As of January 14, 1969, the SCLC had not
altered the Policy on Disruptions.
C. Holding
The University Policy on Campus Disruption
Issued October 7, 1968, was in full force and effect
on January 14,1969.
11. Does Paragraph 2of
the Policy Apply
A. Nature of the Argument
1. Paragraph 2 of the Policy on Campus
Disruption reads as follows:
Members of the faculty, staff, and student body
have an obligation to leave a university building
or facility when asked to do so in the
furtherance of the above regulations by a
member of the university community acting in
an official role, and identifying himself as such;
members of the faculty, staff, or student body
also have an obligation to identify themselves,
when requested to do so by such a member of
the university community who has reasonable
grounds to believe that the person(s) has
violated section (1) or (2) of this policy and
who has so informed the person(s).
2. Although a general announcement was
made by Dean Wyman that the students in the
Faculty Club had violated the Policy, the
evidence is legally insufficient to show that this
message was heard by any or all of the
defendants.
3. The evidence clearly shows that Dean
Wyman failed to announce that he was "a
member of the university community acting in
an official role," and, furthermore, reveals
conclusively that at least some defendants did
not know him.

4. It is thus argued that the Council can find no
violation of paragraph two of the Policy.
B. Analysis
1. Paragraph two of the Policy is quite clear in
its requirements. Individuals should not be
forced to leave a university building or reveal
their identify until they know that the
individual who requires them to do so is
properly authorized. Otherwise paragraph two
could be an instrument of widespread abuse.
2. It is easy enough for university officials,
once informed of this decision, to comply
strictly with the paragraph two requirements.
The Council finds such strict compliance
necessary even when it might appear that
persons making the request are doing so in their
official capacity.
3. The evidence is clear and uncontradicted
that the requirements of paragraph two of the
Policy were not met.
C. Holding
No defendant shall be held guilty of a violation
of paragraph two of the Policy on Campus
Disruption of October 7,1968.
111. Is Paragraph One of the
Policy Separate from Paragraph Two
A. Nature of the Argument
1. Paragraph one of the Policy states as
follows:
It is a violation of university policy for a
member of the faculty, staff, or student body
to (1) prevent or disrupt the effective carrying
out of a university function or approved
activity, such as lectures, meetings, interviews,
ceremonies, the conduct of university business
in a university office, and public events; (2)
obstruct the legitimate movement of any
person about the campus or in any university
building or facility.
2. Paragraph two of the Policy is in
"furtherance" of paragraph one. Hence, it is
argued that paragraph one is to be enforced
only through paragraph two. Since the
requirements of paragraph two have not been
met, there can be no guilt under the policy.
B. Analysis
1. Paragraph one of the Policy on Campus
Disruption clearly states that certain disruptive
conduct is improper. There is no logical way by
which paragraph one can be considered
dependent upon paragraph two. Otherwise an
individual who engaged in such disruption
could, merely by leaving before being told to do
so, immunize himself from liability under the
Policy. This would be an open invitation for
members of the University community to
engage in "hit-and-run" raids.
2. Paragraph two has an entirely different
focus than does paragrpah one. It is often
necessary to clear a building to prevent
disruption or to end disruption in progress.
Thus persons can be required to leave and their
failure to do so is a violation in and of itself,
apart from any disruption which does in fact
occur.
The required notification of paragraph two is
meaningless with regard to an individual who
has already broken up a lecture or a meeting.
The present case clearly illustrates this point.
Dean Wyman's failure to properly identify
himself eliminates any guilt for mere failure to
leave the building; surely, however, it does not
justify acts of disruption done both before and
after his statements.
As to such acts of disruption if the defendants
did not know Dean Wyman or know that he was
acting in his official capacity, as they
successfully argued regarding II above, what he
said or didn't say was of no relevance.
C. Holding
Paragraph one of the Policy on Campus
Disruption is wholly independent from paragraph
two and failure to comply with the terms of the
latter does not prohibit a charge under the former.
SPECIFIC FINDINGS AS TO GUILT
The Council finds as follows:
1. That in addition to those fourteen students
who admitted disruption, the remaining fifteen
defendants, who received a hearing on the facts,
were guilty of acts that disrupted "the effective
carrying out of a university function," under
the Policy on Campus Disruption of October 7,
1968.
(a) From the time the students first entered
the inner patio at the Faculty Club until
shortly after 2:00 p.m., they attempted to
force the trustees to discontinue their regular
meeting by shouting, pounding on doors and
windows, and making statements through a
bullhorn.
(b) That these acts disrupted the trustees'
meeting is unmistakably clear. Although the
trustees attempted to continue with their
regular business, the noise from outside made
it extremely difficult for them to do so.
(c) That these acts by defendants were
intended to disrupt the trustees' meeting is
also clear. The refusal of the trustees to
acknowledge the presence of the students, the
fact that the trustees shut and locked the
doors, and the fact that entry of the students
into the meeting room was resisted at all times
is substantial evidence that the trustees did
not want or intend to meet with the students
at that time and that the students knew this.
(d) Quite apart from the noisy attempts to
disrupt the trustees' meeting, the actual entry
of the students into the meeting room at
approximately 2:25 to 2:30 p.m., through a
line of university officials who clearly were
attempting to keep them out, itself
constituted a flagrant act of disruption. At
that point, the trustees who were attempting
to deal with items on their regular agenda, had
no choice but to stop what they were doing.
(e) It is clear from the evidence, including the
pictures taken at the scene, that all but one of
the fifteen defendants who requested a
hearing, entered or pushed forward in
attempting to enter the open door of the room
where the trustees were meeting. The
exception is James Johnson and the testimony
regarding Mr. Johnson unmistakably shows
him to have engaged in acts of disruption by
banging and kicking on the locked doors to
the meeting room.
2. That Mr. Richard F. Bogart has no defense
on the ground that he was present as a reporter
for KZSU Radio Station.
(a) An individual who engages in illegal acts is
not immunized merely because he belongs, or
in the present case, has reason to believe he
belongs, to a news organization. By his own
statements Mr. Bogart showed that he was
present as a participant in the demonstration.
(b) The Council finds no credible evidence
sufficient for a finding that Mr. Bogart should
be exonerated as a KZSU reporter. Obviously,
participation by a person in illegal activities
cannot be excused even if that person
ultimately reports upon those activities in the
news media.
(c) Furthermore, the evidence regarding Mr.
Bogart is clearly distinguishable from that
available to the Council regarding other
reporters who were not charged or against

whom charges were brought and then
dismissed. These other persons were in
attendance as assigned reporters or
photographers. They took photographs and
notes for news stories which were published
shortly thereafter, and in doing so they clearly
distinguished themselves from the defendants
who were engaged in the disruption. This is
simply not the case with Mr. Bogart.
FINDINGS REGARDING CULPABILITY
The Council finds as follows:
1. That like the fourteen defendants who
admitted to the charge against them, the
following twelve defendant who received a
hearing on the facts engaged in no acts of
aggravation beyond general disruption:
John W. Avery
Anne C. Bauer
Richard F. Bogart
Marc D. Heller
Virginia A. Linsley
David F. Pugh
George C. Reinhardt
James E. Shoch
Leonard M. Siegel
Michael D. Vawter
Joan Williams (Mrs. Rodney W.)
Rodney W. Williams
2. That in addition to general disruption the
following students engaged in specific
aggravating acts as indicated:
(a) Fred H.Cohen
(1) Threatened a University official who
blocked his entry into the trustees meeting
room by stating words such as "get your
hands off me baby or I'll bust your head,"
upon gaining entry into the room further
threatened the trustees not to meet on the
campus again, and in general was so violent
in his manner that several of hiscodefendants
restrained him, and
(2) Took from inside the room a folder
containing the agenda of the trustees
meeting and placed it under his coat.
(b) James E. Johnson
Violently kicked and beat on the doors and
windows to the trustees' room, with his
heavy boots and with a stick.
(c) Stephen S. Smith
(1) At approximaetely 2:25 p.m. managed
to open one of the sliding glass doors from
the patio into the turstees' room, walked
across that room, and, after a struggle with
several university officials, opened the
doorway to the hall and invited the students
congregated there to come into the room.
[At this point the Council would note the
fact that it was unable to locate any witness
who could testify as to how Mr. Smith
succeeded in opening the door from the
patio into the trustees' room. Mr. Smith was
not called in deference to his privilege
against self-incrimination and he chose not
to testify. The Council does find, however,
the circumstantial evidence is overwhelming
that Mr. Smith entered the room knowing
that it was disruptive for him to do so. This is
clearly shown by his subsequent actions in
immediately attempting to open the door to
the hallway against the will of those
present. ]
(2) Took a folder containing an agenda of
the trustees meeting and refused to return it
at the request of a number of University
personnel who finally were forced to engage
in a struggle with Mr. Smith to retrieve it.
3. That the University administration and the
Board of Trustees failed to make clear to the
defendants what proper channels, if any,
existed for communication between students
on the one hand and the administration and the
Board on the other.
4. That the defendants were strongly
motivated by sincerely held beliefs and felt
frustrated by their apparent inability to state
those beliefs to the Board.
5. That the failure of the University
administration and the Board of Trustees to
develop and maintain methods for the orderly
exchange of views with the student body
regarding issues relevant to the University was a
contributing factor of the disruption.
6. That the defendants in the present case were
less interested in the orderly exchange of views
than they were in the imposition of their views
on the rest of the community.

necessary to avoid undue financial hardship.
(b) Provided, however, that in no event shall a
university degree be awarded to any

due.
Analysis of the Recommendations on Penalty
1. The Council's recommendations as to
penalty are based on a total view of the
defendants' conduct in light of the Council's
desire, as set forth in its Rules, to utilize
penalties to strengthen the Stanford
community.
2. The penalties would have been more severe
had the defendants been aware of the existence
of a reasonably means by which to make their
views known to the Board of Trustees.
3. At the same time, however, the Council
considered the offense to be a very serious one
that must not be repeated. If every member of
the Stanford community who feels strongly
about an issue is permitted to disrupt the
campus to impose his views on others, the result
would be chaos. Indeed such actions are
counterproductive in that they tend to
eliminate opportunity for legitimate discussion
and resolution of vital issues.
4. The Council's imposition of periods of
probation takes into consideration the threat
by defendants, made at the motivational
hearing, to engage in further serious acts of
disruption. The Council takes the position that
if during the period of probation any defendant
carries out such a threat, and is duly convicted
thereof, the University community has the
right to insist upon his suspension.
5. The Council views as most serious those acts
which, directly or by implication, threaten
violence to any person. Fortunately, in the
present case no one was injured and there was

no serious damage to property. Nevertheless, a
real danger of personal injury exists when
persons ostensibly engaged in a demonstration
to present their views, lose their tempers or
engage in physical altercations. The penalties to
three individuals reflect the Council's position,
based on clear evidence, that in varying degrees,
these individuals materially increased the
danger of physical violence and personal injury.
6. In order that the University community not
be misled, the Council wishes to make clear that
its decision in this case was not based on the
military draft policy of the United States or on
the draft status of any of the defendants.
Findingson Collateral Matters
The Council finds as follows:
1. That in light of the fact that every defendant
was clearly in violation of the Policy on Campus
Disruption of October 7, 1968, which policy
was valid and in force, the Council feels it
unnecessary to determine whether or not the
defendants were also in violation of the
Fundamental Standard. The answer to this
question would in no way affect the penalties
imposed.
2. That student witnesses have the obligation
to testify when called before the Council.
(a) In the present case a student was called to
testify as to events he observed at the Faculty
Club at the time of the disruption. He claimed
that he had been present as a reporter for the
Stanford Daily and therefore he was privileged
not to testify.
(b) The Council subpoenaed this witness
because he was known to have been present
and it was felt that defendants might have
wished to elicit information from him. The
defendants declined to ask him questions and
he was excused.
(c) The Council at that time, however, and
now, holds that the claimed privilege does not
exist, that it has not been recognized by the
courts of the land, that there is no justification
for such a privilege, and that the refusal to

testify on such grounds cannot and will not be
tolerated. [This in no way, however, governs
the Council's attitude toward the privilege of a
reporter not to reveal the name of a
confidential informant, which privilege has
both been recognized and rejected in various
courts. 1
3. That persons who attend a hearing of the
Stanford Judicial Council, including the
defendants and their counsel, have an
obligation not to impede, disrupt, or in any
manner interfere with the conduct of the
proceedings.
(a) A number of persons who attended the
factual hearing, particularly on the first night,
in obvious support of the defendants,
deliberately attempted to disrupt the
proceedings and did, in fact, cause
considerably noise and confusion.
(b) The Council is not a court of law; it has no
bailiff or sheriff's department to maintain
order. Thus any handful of persons, who are
so inclined can seriously impede the
proceedings.
(c) The defendants themselves, and their
counsel, must share the blame for the
disorder, particularly during the first night.
They continually directed their comments to
their supporters in the audience rather than to
the members of the Council and they
attempted in numerous ways, including the
muttering of threats, to ridicule the Council
and to make its job impossible. All this was
done in spite of the Council's solemn promise,
duly kept, that they would be given an
opportunity at the hearings on motivatioto
say what they so desired about the basic issues
underlying their actions.
The Council does note that the defendants did
intercede during the most serious disruptions
to assist the Council, primarily to prevent the
Council from closing the hearings, and that
after the first night of the hearings, the
defendants were more restrained. Moreover,

the Council recognizes and appreciates the
efforts of Mr. Doron Weinberg, who, as sole
counsel after the first and second evenings,
assisted in maintaining order and preserving
the decorum of the proceedings.
(d) On the basis of its experience in this case,
regarding meetings that are open to the
general public, the Council will seriously
consider in future cases limiting the number of
persons in attendance. Furthermore, the
Council serves warning on those who would
disrupt future proceedings that the Council is
disposed to find in contempt persons who
engage in disruption of its proceedings and to
recommend immediate imposition of severe
sanctions.
4. That defendant Jack Gerson, who
apparently withdrew from the University
subsequent to January 14, 1969, but prior to
the hearings in this case, has failed to respond to
summonses from the Council duly served upon
him.
The Council recommends that, in accordance
with the Legislative and Judicial Charter of
1968, the University immediately withdraw
Mr. Gerson's registration privileges until such
time as he appears before the Council for the
trial of his case.
THIS DECISION AND ALL ITS PARTS ARE
UNANIMOUSLY ADOPTED BY THE
MEMBERS OF THE COUNCIL.
Dated: February 27, 1969
Editor's Note: The Judicial Council's reference
to "the faculty advisory Committee on
Disruptions" is, in fact, the President's advisory
group on campus disruptions. After hearing from
members of this group. President Pitzer informed
Dean Wyman that the students were believed to be
in violation of the campus policy on disruptions.
The faculty members did not instruct Wyman
directly.
Incremental costs for publication of this report
have been paid for the the Stanford Newsservice.
STATEMENT OF THE PROCEEDINGS
On January 15, 1969, the Stanford Judicial
Council was notified by the office of the Dean of
Students that on the previous day a group of
persons, believed primarily to be Stanford
students, had allegedly disrupted a meeting of the
University Board of Trustees which had been held
at the Stanford Faculty Club. The Council was
asked to investigate.
Pursuant to the Legislative and Judicial Charter
of 1968, the Council sent out five judicial aides to
investigate and interview witnesses. The judicial
aides made a comprehensive report to the Council
which included photographs, lists of witnesses and
participants, transcripts of tape-recorded
interviews of many persons, and additional
statements, including those of a number of
potential defendants.
At the Council's behest, the Chairman
examined the report and, on the basis of the
information therein, determined to call before
him, and one other member of the Council sitting
with him, some thirty-nine persons for the purpose
of charging them with violations of the Campus
Policy on Disruptions of October 7, 1968, and of
the Fundamental Standard, and to show each the
evidence the Council had obtained through its
judicial aides regarding his activities.
The letter summoning these persons was sent
by mail; in addition a copy of the letter was
personally served on each of them. The letter
contained the following:
(1) A statement that the person was charged
with violations of the Disruption Policy and
of the Fundamental Standard.
(2) An outline of proceedings to be followed
during trial of the case.
(3) A copy of the Council's rules containing
the rights of defendants as set out in the
Legislative and Judicial Charter of 1968.
(4) A date and time to appear before the
Chairman of the Council for a conference.
Each person summoned duly appeared with the
sole exception of Jack Gerson, who has at no time
appeared or taken part in these proceedings.
The Council Chairman, sitting with at least one
other member of the Council, showed each
defendant the evidence regarding his activities and
explained to each defendant the procedure to be
followed for trial. That procedure required a
bifurcated hearing. The first hearing would be
designed solely to determine what acts each
student had, or had not committed; the second
hearing would be devoted solely to matters of
motivation.
With but one exception, Fred Cohen, who was
also charged with acts of intimidation, each
student, for purposes of the present hearings, was
charged only with having disrupted the Board of
Trustees meeting; no specific acts of violence,
threats, etc. were alleged. [Defendant James
Johnson was also charged with having set a false
fire alarm but all hearings on this charge were
suspended pending decision on such a charge in the
county civil courts. ]
Every defendant was given an opportunity to
admit to the charge against him. He was told that
to do so would eliminate the need for the first
hearing in his case, but that he would still be
permitted to do three things;
(1) Take part in the motivational hearing.
(2) Argue the invalidity of the Campus Policy
on Disruptions.
(3) Argue that the Fundamental Standard does
not cover disruption without a showing of
specific acts such as violence, threats,
blocking access of other persons, etc.
Each student was further informed that any
specific facts regarding his individual conduct
which were brought out during a fact hearing
would be considered by the Council in deciding his
case.
Although defendants were told they had a right
to remain silent, many wished to discuss the nature
of their participation. On the basis of their
statements and the Council's continuing
investigation of the case, charges were withdrawn
against nine persons. Of the remaining twenty-nine
defendants, the following twelve initially decided
to admit to the charges against them:
Allen Christelow
Richard Greenspan
HallamC. Hamilton
Carolyn M. Iverson
Barbara E. Lee
Michael M. Morton
Christine M. Mrak
Jeffrey J. Preefer
Guy D. Smyth
Don P. Stuart
D. Jeffrey Weil
Helen K. Williams
Thereafter, two additional students, Irwin
Busse and Marc Weiss, also decided to admit the
charges against them. Thus, when the case
proceeded to the first hearing, only the following
fifteen students were involved:
John W. Avery
Anne C. Bauer
Richard F. Bogart
Fred H. Cohen
Marc D. Heller
James E. Johnson
Virginia A. Linsley
David F. Pugh
George C. Reinhardt
James E. Shoch
Leonard M. Siegel
Stephen S. Smith
Michael D. Vawter
Joan Williams (Mrs. Rodney W.)
Rodney W. Williams
This factual hearing was open to the public and
took place on February 11, 12 and 13.
Considerable evidence was received, including the
testimony of some 24 witnesses.
The motivational hearing, also open to the
public, was held on February 21. All twenty-nine
defendants subscribed to an organized
presentation of their views. Thereafter each
defendant was given an opportunity to add further
information on his own behalf.
STATEMENT OF THE GENERAL FACTS
On the basis of the evidence presented during
the hearings, the Council finds the following facts:
At the October 1968 meeting of the Stanford
University Board of Trustees, a student, Yale
Braunstein, Speaker of the Student Legislature,
was permitted to address the board members,
urging them to hold open meetings with students.
The Board Chairman, shortly thereafter, wrote a
letter to Mr. Braunstein, thanking him for his
remarks but not specifically mentioning the issue
of open meetings. Mr. Braunstein replied with a
letter to the Board Chairman emphasizing the
importance of the open-meeting request.
Although at both the November 1968 and January
14, 1969 meetings of the Board, student leaders
were invited to and did sit with a number of Board
committees, the Board made no statement, either
to Mr. Braunstein or the Stanford student body at
large, concerning meetings of the Board itself,
which would be open to members of the Stanford
community.
On the morning of January 14,1969, a group of
students circulated throughout the campus a
document requesting that all interested persons

arrive at Bowman Alumni House at 12:30 p.m. for
the purpose of holding an open meeting with the
trustees. The document contained nine specific
demands regarding the operations of the
University and the Stanford Research Institute.
At approximately 12:30 p.m., when a group of
students had collected at Bowman, they learned
that the trustees were at the Stanford Faculty
Club. The students then held a meeting to
determine what action to take. At about this time
Associate Dean of Students, Willard Wyman,
entered Bowman where one of the students
demanded that Wyman carry a message to the
trustees asking for an open meeting. Although he
made it clear that he was not a "messenger boy"
for the students, Dean Wyman nevertheless did in
fact go to the Faculty Club to tell members of the
University administration, including President
Pitzer, that a group of students at Bowman wished
to have an open meeting with the trustees and
would not leave Bowman until such a meeting was
arranged.
Shortly thereafter Yale Braunstein, who had
observed the meeting at Bowman, and apparently
was concerned that Dean Wyman would not
deliver the message, decided to attempt to
communicate with the Board himself. He went to
the Faculty Club where he met Dean Wyman who
arranged for Braunstein to enter the rooms where
the trustees were located. Mr. Braunstein spoke to
the trustees, stating that the students at Bowman
not only demanded an open meeting but would
consider whatever meeting the trustees did hold to
be an open one. This message was given twice, once
in a room where the bulk of the trustees were
sitting and in an adjacent room where the
Investment Committee was in session.
After delivering this message, Braunstein
immediately withdrew and proceeded to Bowman
where he found the students leaving, en route to
the Faculty Club.
As soon as Braunstein left the trustees, they had
a short discussion and unanimously passed a
motion not to alter their policy which permits
non-trustees to attend Board meetings only upon
express invitation. No effort was made to
communicate this decision to the students.
Shortly thereafter, apparently just prior to
1:00 p.m., the students entered the inner patio of
the Faculty Club. They did so by proceeding up
the outer stairway facing Tresidder Union and
down the inner stairway to the courtyard.
The students gathered in the inner court where
some of them rapped on the sliding glass doors of
the rooms in which the trustees were sitting. The
students shouted and made use of a "bullhorn" to
attract the attention of and communicate with the
trustees inside. Individual students unsuccessfully
attempted to open the sliding doors.
The trustees continued with their business,
attempting as best they could to ignore the
students. A number of the students then entered
the Faculty Club from the patio and congregated
in the hallway outside the rooms where the
trustees were meeting.
From the time that the students entered the
patio, just before 1:00 p.m. until a few minutes
past 2:00 p.m., the students' attempts to attract
the attention of the trustees were intensified by
means of shouting, beating and kicking on the
doors, reading demands through a "bullhorn," etc.
From time to time students attempted to open the
doors from the trustees rooms into the hallway,
but they had been locked from the inside. On
occasion, administrative personnel and waiters
passed through these doors but did so carefully in
order to keep the students out. At one such time a
student in the hallway attempted to force his way
in but personnel inside the room managed to
reclose and lock the door.
Shortly before 2:00 p.m. the Faculty Advisory
Committee on Disruptions sent one of its
members, Professor Clebsch, to speak with
President Pitzer and Chairman of the Board Fuller.
Professor Chebsch reported that the noise inside
the room was so intense that it seriously disturbed
the conduct of the board meeting and made it
virtually impossible for the meeting to continue.
Testimony from persons who were inside the room
at the time supported this statement.
At about 2:00 p.m. the Advisory Committee
informed Dean Wyman that the students were in
violation of the Campus Policy on Disruptions and
requested that he warn them of this and take their
names. Dean Wyman then announced in the
hallway that the Disruption Policy had been
violated and that any students who did not leave
would have their names taken. He did not,
however, identify himself as an official of the
University acting as such. Substantial testimony
indicated that some students in the hallway may
not have heard his statement or known who he
was.
Dean Wyman then proceeded to take the names
of students who remained in the hallway and in the
patio. A number of students did leave and their
names were not recorded; some others who did
remain refused to reveal their identity or gave false
names. As Dean Wyman moved through the
hallway taking names he was subjected to taunts
and occasional threats of violence.
By 2:15 p.m. most of the students who
remained after the warning congregated in the
hallway where they held an informal meeting to
determine their course of action; some students
argued that they should not remain at the Faculty
Club.
While this meeting continued the noise level
subsided substantially.
At about 2:25 p.m. one of the students gained
entrance to the trustees' rooms through one of the
sliding doors from the patio. He moved directly
across the room and opened one of the doors to
the hallway. University personnel within the room
as well as some who were in the hallway attempted
to shut the door but the students in the hallway
moved forward to keep the door open.
At the door the students at first hung back,
shouting that they wanted an open meeting with
the trustees. Their demands were read through a
bullhorn. Meanwhile a line of administrative
officers within the room formed at the open door
to prevent students from gaining entry into the
room.
There ensued a period of confusion with
pushing and shoving taking place both on the part
of the students in the hallway and the personnel
from inside the room. During this time one
University official lost his balance and fell into the
hallway. Some students were shouting and at least
one was so agitated that he uttered a threat to one
of the administrative personnel at the door.
Shortly thereafter the students succeeded in
entering the room. One of the students was highly
agitated and he insulted and threatened the
trustees. At least two students grabbed copies of
the agenda of the trustees meeting and a struggle
ensued between one of these students and
university officials who sought to retrieve the
agenda he had taken.
Some of the students attempted to engage the
trustees in discussion; the trustees cut off their
meeting and left. The students remained in the
room for a short time thereafter and gradually
dispersed of their own volition.

DECISION ON LEGAL ISSUES
At the factual hearing on February 11-13,
1969, the defendants raised several legal
arguments regarding the Policy on Campus
Disruption as follows:
I. That the Policy was no longer in effect on
January 14, 1969, when the alleged acts of
disruption occurred.
11. That paragraph two of the Policy did not
apply because the facts show beyond any doubt
that University officials did not comply with
requirements set out therein, and
111. That paragraph one of the Policy was
inapplicable because it is dependent upon
University official's compliance with the
requirements of paragraph two.
I. Was the Policy in Effect
Validity of the Policy on Disruptions:
A. Nature of the Argument
1. The Policy on Campus Disruption was
issued on October 7, 1968 by Acting President
Robert Glaser.
2. On October 7, 1968, the Legislative and
Judicial Charter of 1968 was not yet in effect.
That charter was submitted to a vote of the
student body which approved its adoption until
March 1, 1969. The vote was completed on
October 15, 1968, and the results were
announced on October 16, 1968.
3. The invalidity of the Policy is based upon
Article I, Sections D(2)(b), D(2)(d), and
D(2)(e), which read as follows:
Section D(2)(b): When in his opinion an
emergency exists that requires the
promulgation of a regulation, including change
or repeal of an existing regulation, in less time
than is required under the procedure set forth
in section D.l, the President of the University
may promulgate an interim regulation to
become effective immediately upon
publication, provided the President shall first
consult with as many members of the SCLC as
practicable and, if time permits, shall first
afford the SCLC an opportunity to act under
section D.2a.
Section D(2)(d): An interim regulation
promulgated by the President under section
D.2b shall remain in effect for 90 days or until
it is repealed or amended by the SCLC,
whichever occurs first.
The SCLC may amend or repeal interim
regulations by the procedure provided in
section D.l or, with the written concurrence of
the President, SCLC may proceed under section
D.2a.
Section D(2)(e): If in the case of an interim
regulation promulgated under section D.2b, 90
days expire with no action by the SCLC, the
President may repromulgate the interim
regulation every 30 days until SCLC acts on it.
He shall inform the SCLC of each
promulgation.
The argument is that the Policy on Campus
Disruption is subject to these provisions of the
Charter and hence expired on January 7, 1968,
some 7 days prior to the time of the alleged
offenses in this case. The policy was never formally
renewed.
B. Analysis
1. The Disruption Policy was clearly
promulgated prior to ratification of the
Charter.
2. The terms of the Charter can in no way be
considered binding on such a policy, since the
Charter distinguishes clearly between those
policies promulgated prior to the Charter and
those promulgated thereafter.
Section I.E of the Charter clearly provides this
as follows:
E. Relation to Present University Policy.
Until such time as the Student Conduct
Legislative Council changes any present
University policy, that policy will remain in
effect. It is recommended that the first order
of business of the SCLC be the consideration
of areas in which there are currently conflicts
of law.
Section lI.D of the Charter obligates this
Council to enforce "present policy" until
altered in the following terms:
D. Relation to University Policy. Each
member of the Stanford Judicial Council is
obligated to enforce the regulations of the
Student Conduct Legislative Council or the
legislative product of the President acting
after consultation with the SCLC as provided
in Article I, section D.2b. Until such time as
the SCLC changes present policy, the SJC will
be obligated in the case of conflicts of law to
enforce the University policy.
3. The policy was terned an "interim" one by
Dr. Glaser at the time of its announcement, as
he clearly hoped for student approval of the
Charter and a subsequent consideration of the
policy by the Student Conduct Legislative
Council. Dr. Glaser's statement was as follows:
The consensus was that the policy should be
issued on an interim basis. Its interim
character is emphasized because we anticipate
further action by appropriate governing
bodies of the faculty and students, and in
particular by the proposed Student Conduct
Legislative Council. Subsequent actions of
these bodies may confirm, amend or
supercede the temporary policy, which will be
in effect until such actions are taken.
Obviously this statement in no way impugns,
but rather affirms the fact that the policy was
promulgated without time limit and was to be
considered in force until such time as the SCLC,
if established, altered that policy.
4. As of January 14, 1969, the SCLC had not
altered the Policy on Disruptions.
C. Holding
The University Policy on Campus Disruption
Issued October 7, 1968, was in full force and effect
on January 14,1969.
11. Does Paragraph 2of
the Policy Apply
A. Nature of the Argument
1. Paragraph 2 of the Policy on Campus
Disruption reads as follows:
Members of the faculty, staff, and student body
have an obligation to leave a university building
or facility when asked to do so in the
furtherance of the above regulations by a
member of the university community acting in
an official role, and identifying himself as such;
members of the faculty, staff, or student body
also have an obligation to identify themselves,
when requested to do so by such a member of
the university community who has reasonable
grounds to believe that the person(s) has
violated section (1) or (2) of this policy and
who has so informed the person(s).
2. Although a general announcement was
made by Dean Wyman that the students in the
Faculty Club had violated the Policy, the
evidence is legally insufficient to show that this
message was heard by any or all of the
defendants.
3. The evidence clearly shows that Dean
Wyman failed to announce that he was "a
member of the university community acting in
an official role," and, furthermore, reveals
conclusively that at least some defendants did
not know him.

4. It is thus argued that the Council can find no
violation of paragraph two of the Policy.
B. Analysis
1. Paragraph two of the Policy is quite clear in
its requirements. Individuals should not be
forced to leave a university building or reveal
their identify until they know that the
individual who requires them to do so is
properly authorized. Otherwise paragraph two
could be an instrument of widespread abuse.
2. It is easy enough for university officials,
once informed of this decision, to comply
strictly with the paragraph two requirements.
The Council finds such strict compliance
necessary even when it might appear that
persons making the request are doing so in their
official capacity.
3. The evidence is clear and uncontradicted
that the requirements of paragraph two of the
Policy were not met.
C. Holding
No defendant shall be held guilty of a violation
of paragraph two of the Policy on Campus
Disruption of October 7,1968.
111. Is Paragraph One of the
Policy Separate from Paragraph Two
A. Nature of the Argument
1. Paragraph one of the Policy states as
follows:
It is a violation of university policy for a
member of the faculty, staff, or student body
to (1) prevent or disrupt the effective carrying
out of a university function or approved
activity, such as lectures, meetings, interviews,
ceremonies, the conduct of university business
in a university office, and public events; (2)
obstruct the legitimate movement of any
person about the campus or in any university
building or facility.
2. Paragraph two of the Policy is in
"furtherance" of paragraph one. Hence, it is
argued that paragraph one is to be enforced
only through paragraph two. Since the
requirements of paragraph two have not been
met, there can be no guilt under the policy.
B. Analysis
1. Paragraph one of the Policy on Campus
Disruption clearly states that certain disruptive
conduct is improper. There is no logical way by
which paragraph one can be considered
dependent upon paragraph two. Otherwise an
individual who engaged in such disruption
could, merely by leaving before being told to do
so, immunize himself from liability under the
Policy. This would be an open invitation for
members of the University community to
engage in "hit-and-run" raids.
2. Paragraph two has an entirely different
focus than does paragrpah one. It is often
necessary to clear a building to prevent
disruption or to end disruption in progress.
Thus persons can be required to leave and their
failure to do so is a violation in and of itself,
apart from any disruption which does in fact
occur.
The required notification of paragraph two is
meaningless with regard to an individual who
has already broken up a lecture or a meeting.
The present case clearly illustrates this point.
Dean Wyman's failure to properly identify
himself eliminates any guilt for mere failure to
leave the building; surely, however, it does not
justify acts of disruption done both before and
after his statements.
As to such acts of disruption if the defendants
did not know Dean Wyman or know that he was
acting in his official capacity, as they
successfully argued regarding II above, what he
said or didn't say was of no relevance.
C. Holding
Paragraph one of the Policy on Campus
Disruption is wholly independent from paragraph
two and failure to comply with the terms of the
latter does not prohibit a charge under the former.
SPECIFIC FINDINGS AS TO GUILT
The Council finds as follows:
1. That in addition to those fourteen students
who admitted disruption, the remaining fifteen
defendants, who received a hearing on the facts,
were guilty of acts that disrupted "the effective
carrying out of a university function," under
the Policy on Campus Disruption of October 7,
1968.
(a) From the time the students first entered
the inner patio at the Faculty Club until
shortly after 2:00 p.m., they attempted to
force the trustees to discontinue their regular
meeting by shouting, pounding on doors and
windows, and making statements through a
bullhorn.
(b) That these acts disrupted the trustees'
meeting is unmistakably clear. Although the
trustees attempted to continue with their
regular business, the noise from outside made
it extremely difficult for them to do so.
(c) That these acts by defendants were
intended to disrupt the trustees' meeting is
also clear. The refusal of the trustees to
acknowledge the presence of the students, the
fact that the trustees shut and locked the
doors, and the fact that entry of the students
into the meeting room was resisted at all times
is substantial evidence that the trustees did
not want or intend to meet with the students
at that time and that the students knew this.
(d) Quite apart from the noisy attempts to
disrupt the trustees' meeting, the actual entry
of the students into the meeting room at
approximately 2:25 to 2:30 p.m., through a
line of university officials who clearly were
attempting to keep them out, itself
constituted a flagrant act of disruption. At
that point, the trustees who were attempting
to deal with items on their regular agenda, had
no choice but to stop what they were doing.
(e) It is clear from the evidence, including the
pictures taken at the scene, that all but one of
the fifteen defendants who requested a
hearing, entered or pushed forward in
attempting to enter the open door of the room
where the trustees were meeting. The
exception is James Johnson and the testimony
regarding Mr. Johnson unmistakably shows
him to have engaged in acts of disruption by
banging and kicking on the locked doors to
the meeting room.
2. That Mr. Richard F. Bogart has no defense
on the ground that he was present as a reporter
for KZSU Radio Station.
(a) An individual who engages in illegal acts is
not immunized merely because he belongs, or
in the present case, has reason to believe he
belongs, to a news organization. By his own
statements Mr. Bogart showed that he was
present as a participant in the demonstration.
(b) The Council finds no credible evidence
sufficient for a finding that Mr. Bogart should
be exonerated as a KZSU reporter. Obviously,
participation by a person in illegal activities
cannot be excused even if that person
ultimately reports upon those activities in the
news media.
(c) Furthermore, the evidence regarding Mr.
Bogart is clearly distinguishable from that
available to the Council regarding other
reporters who were not charged or against

whom charges were brought and then
dismissed. These other persons were in
attendance as assigned reporters or
photographers. They took photographs and
notes for news stories which were published
shortly thereafter, and in doing so they clearly
distinguished themselves from the defendants
who were engaged in the disruption. This is
simply not the case with Mr. Bogart.
FINDINGS REGARDING CULPABILITY
The Council finds as follows:
1. That like the fourteen defendants who
admitted to the charge against them, the
following twelve defendant who received a
hearing on the facts engaged in no acts of
aggravation beyond general disruption:
John W. Avery
Anne C. Bauer
Richard F. Bogart
Marc D. Heller
Virginia A. Linsley
David F. Pugh
George C. Reinhardt
James E. Shoch
Leonard M. Siegel
Michael D. Vawter
Joan Williams (Mrs. Rodney W.)
Rodney W. Williams
2. That in addition to general disruption the
following students engaged in specific
aggravating acts as indicated:
(a) Fred H.Cohen
(1) Threatened a University official who
blocked his entry into the trustees meeting
room by stating words such as "get your
hands off me baby or I'll bust your head,"
upon gaining entry into the room further
threatened the trustees not to meet on the
campus again, and in general was so violent
in his manner that several of hiscodefendants
restrained him, and
(2) Took from inside the room a folder
containing the agenda of the trustees
meeting and placed it under his coat.
(b) James E. Johnson
Violently kicked and beat on the doors and
windows to the trustees' room, with his
heavy boots and with a stick.
(c) Stephen S. Smith
(1) At approximaetely 2:25 p.m. managed
to open one of the sliding glass doors from
the patio into the turstees' room, walked
across that room, and, after a struggle with
several university officials, opened the
doorway to the hall and invited the students
congregated there to come into the room.
[At this point the Council would note the
fact that it was unable to locate any witness
who could testify as to how Mr. Smith
succeeded in opening the door from the
patio into the trustees' room. Mr. Smith was
not called in deference to his privilege
against self-incrimination and he chose not
to testify. The Council does find, however,
the circumstantial evidence is overwhelming
that Mr. Smith entered the room knowing
that it was disruptive for him to do so. This is
clearly shown by his subsequent actions in
immediately attempting to open the door to
the hallway against the will of those
present. ]
(2) Took a folder containing an agenda of
the trustees meeting and refused to return it
at the request of a number of University
personnel who finally were forced to engage
in a struggle with Mr. Smith to retrieve it.
3. That the University administration and the
Board of Trustees failed to make clear to the
defendants what proper channels, if any,
existed for communication between students
on the one hand and the administration and the
Board on the other.
4. That the defendants were strongly
motivated by sincerely held beliefs and felt
frustrated by their apparent inability to state
those beliefs to the Board.
5. That the failure of the University
administration and the Board of Trustees to
develop and maintain methods for the orderly
exchange of views with the student body
regarding issues relevant to the University was a
contributing factor of the disruption.
6. That the defendants in the present case were
less interested in the orderly exchange of views
than they were in the imposition of their views
on the rest of the community.

necessary to avoid undue financial hardship.
(b) Provided, however, that in no event shall a
university degree be awarded to any

due.
Analysis of the Recommendations on Penalty
1. The Council's recommendations as to
penalty are based on a total view of the
defendants' conduct in light of the Council's
desire, as set forth in its Rules, to utilize
penalties to strengthen the Stanford
community.
2. The penalties would have been more severe
had the defendants been aware of the existence
of a reasonably means by which to make their
views known to the Board of Trustees.
3. At the same time, however, the Council
considered the offense to be a very serious one
that must not be repeated. If every member of
the Stanford community who feels strongly
about an issue is permitted to disrupt the
campus to impose his views on others, the result
would be chaos. Indeed such actions are
counterproductive in that they tend to
eliminate opportunity for legitimate discussion
and resolution of vital issues.
4. The Council's imposition of periods of
probation takes into consideration the threat
by defendants, made at the motivational
hearing, to engage in further serious acts of
disruption. The Council takes the position that
if during the period of probation any defendant
carries out such a threat, and is duly convicted
thereof, the University community has the
right to insist upon his suspension.
5. The Council views as most serious those acts
which, directly or by implication, threaten
violence to any person. Fortunately, in the
present case no one was injured and there was

no serious damage to property. Nevertheless, a
real danger of personal injury exists when
persons ostensibly engaged in a demonstration
to present their views, lose their tempers or
engage in physical altercations. The penalties to
three individuals reflect the Council's position,
based on clear evidence, that in varying degrees,
these individuals materially increased the
danger of physical violence and personal injury.
6. In order that the University community not
be misled, the Council wishes to make clear that
its decision in this case was not based on the
military draft policy of the United States or on
the draft status of any of the defendants.
Findingson Collateral Matters
The Council finds as follows:
1. That in light of the fact that every defendant
was clearly in violation of the Policy on Campus
Disruption of October 7, 1968, which policy
was valid and in force, the Council feels it
unnecessary to determine whether or not the
defendants were also in violation of the
Fundamental Standard. The answer to this
question would in no way affect the penalties
imposed.
2. That student witnesses have the obligation
to testify when called before the Council.
(a) In the present case a student was called to
testify as to events he observed at the Faculty
Club at the time of the disruption. He claimed
that he had been present as a reporter for the
Stanford Daily and therefore he was privileged
not to testify.
(b) The Council subpoenaed this witness
because he was known to have been present
and it was felt that defendants might have
wished to elicit information from him. The
defendants declined to ask him questions and
he was excused.
(c) The Council at that time, however, and
now, holds that the claimed privilege does not
exist, that it has not been recognized by the
courts of the land, that there is no justification
for such a privilege, and that the refusal to

testify on such grounds cannot and will not be
tolerated. [This in no way, however, governs
the Council's attitude toward the privilege of a
reporter not to reveal the name of a
confidential informant, which privilege has
both been recognized and rejected in various
courts. 1
3. That persons who attend a hearing of the
Stanford Judicial Council, including the
defendants and their counsel, have an
obligation not to impede, disrupt, or in any
manner interfere with the conduct of the
proceedings.
(a) A number of persons who attended the
factual hearing, particularly on the first night,
in obvious support of the defendants,
deliberately attempted to disrupt the
proceedings and did, in fact, cause
considerably noise and confusion.
(b) The Council is not a court of law; it has no
bailiff or sheriff's department to maintain
order. Thus any handful of persons, who are
so inclined can seriously impede the
proceedings.
(c) The defendants themselves, and their
counsel, must share the blame for the
disorder, particularly during the first night.
They continually directed their comments to
their supporters in the audience rather than to
the members of the Council and they
attempted in numerous ways, including the
muttering of threats, to ridicule the Council
and to make its job impossible. All this was
done in spite of the Council's solemn promise,
duly kept, that they would be given an
opportunity at the hearings on motivatioto
say what they so desired about the basic issues
underlying their actions.
The Council does note that the defendants did
intercede during the most serious disruptions
to assist the Council, primarily to prevent the
Council from closing the hearings, and that
after the first night of the hearings, the
defendants were more restrained. Moreover,

the Council recognizes and appreciates the
efforts of Mr. Doron Weinberg, who, as sole
counsel after the first and second evenings,
assisted in maintaining order and preserving
the decorum of the proceedings.
(d) On the basis of its experience in this case,
regarding meetings that are open to the
general public, the Council will seriously
consider in future cases limiting the number of
persons in attendance. Furthermore, the
Council serves warning on those who would
disrupt future proceedings that the Council is
disposed to find in contempt persons who
engage in disruption of its proceedings and to
recommend immediate imposition of severe
sanctions.
4. That defendant Jack Gerson, who
apparently withdrew from the University
subsequent to January 14, 1969, but prior to
the hearings in this case, has failed to respond to
summonses from the Council duly served upon
him.
The Council recommends that, in accordance
with the Legislative and Judicial Charter of
1968, the University immediately withdraw
Mr. Gerson's registration privileges until such
time as he appears before the Council for the
trial of his case.
THIS DECISION AND ALL ITS PARTS ARE
UNANIMOUSLY ADOPTED BY THE
MEMBERS OF THE COUNCIL.
Dated: February 27, 1969
Editor's Note: The Judicial Council's reference
to "the faculty advisory Committee on
Disruptions" is, in fact, the President's advisory
group on campus disruptions. After hearing from
members of this group. President Pitzer informed
Dean Wyman that the students were believed to be
in violation of the campus policy on disruptions.
The faculty members did not instruct Wyman
directly.
Incremental costs for publication of this report
have been paid for the the Stanford Newsservice.
STATEMENT OF THE PROCEEDINGS
On January 15, 1969, the Stanford Judicial
Council was notified by the office of the Dean of
Students that on the previous day a group of
persons, believed primarily to be Stanford
students, had allegedly disrupted a meeting of the
University Board of Trustees which had been held
at the Stanford Faculty Club. The Council was
asked to investigate.
Pursuant to the Legislative and Judicial Charter
of 1968, the Council sent out five judicial aides to
investigate and interview witnesses. The judicial
aides made a comprehensive report to the Council
which included photographs, lists of witnesses and
participants, transcripts of tape-recorded
interviews of many persons, and additional
statements, including those of a number of
potential defendants.
At the Council's behest, the Chairman
examined the report and, on the basis of the
information therein, determined to call before
him, and one other member of the Council sitting
with him, some thirty-nine persons for the purpose
of charging them with violations of the Campus
Policy on Disruptions of October 7, 1968, and of
the Fundamental Standard, and to show each the
evidence the Council had obtained through its
judicial aides regarding his activities.
The letter summoning these persons was sent
by mail; in addition a copy of the letter was
personally served on each of them. The letter
contained the following:
(1) A statement that the person was charged
with violations of the Disruption Policy and
of the Fundamental Standard.
(2) An outline of proceedings to be followed
during trial of the case.
(3) A copy of the Council's rules containing
the rights of defendants as set out in the
Legislative and Judicial Charter of 1968.
(4) A date and time to appear before the
Chairman of the Council for a conference.
Each person summoned duly appeared with the
sole exception of Jack Gerson, who has at no time
appeared or taken part in these proceedings.
The Council Chairman, sitting with at least one
other member of the Council, showed each
defendant the evidence regarding his activities and
explained to each defendant the procedure to be
followed for trial. That procedure required a
bifurcated hearing. The first hearing would be
designed solely to determine what acts each
student had, or had not committed; the second
hearing would be devoted solely to matters of
motivation.
With but one exception, Fred Cohen, who was
also charged with acts of intimidation, each
student, for purposes of the present hearings, was
charged only with having disrupted the Board of
Trustees meeting; no specific acts of violence,
threats, etc. were alleged. [Defendant James
Johnson was also charged with having set a false
fire alarm but all hearings on this charge were
suspended pending decision on such a charge in the
county civil courts. ]
Every defendant was given an opportunity to
admit to the charge against him. He was told that
to do so would eliminate the need for the first
hearing in his case, but that he would still be
permitted to do three things;
(1) Take part in the motivational hearing.
(2) Argue the invalidity of the Campus Policy
on Disruptions.
(3) Argue that the Fundamental Standard does
not cover disruption without a showing of
specific acts such as violence, threats,
blocking access of other persons, etc.
Each student was further informed that any
specific facts regarding his individual conduct
which were brought out during a fact hearing
would be considered by the Council in deciding his
case.
Although defendants were told they had a right
to remain silent, many wished to discuss the nature
of their participation. On the basis of their
statements and the Council's continuing
investigation of the case, charges were withdrawn
against nine persons. Of the remaining twenty-nine
defendants, the following twelve initially decided
to admit to the charges against them:
Allen Christelow
Richard Greenspan
HallamC. Hamilton
Carolyn M. Iverson
Barbara E. Lee
Michael M. Morton
Christine M. Mrak
Jeffrey J. Preefer
Guy D. Smyth
Don P. Stuart
D. Jeffrey Weil
Helen K. Williams
Thereafter, two additional students, Irwin
Busse and Marc Weiss, also decided to admit the
charges against them. Thus, when the case
proceeded to the first hearing, only the following
fifteen students were involved:
John W. Avery
Anne C. Bauer
Richard F. Bogart
Fred H. Cohen
Marc D. Heller
James E. Johnson
Virginia A. Linsley
David F. Pugh
George C. Reinhardt
James E. Shoch
Leonard M. Siegel
Stephen S. Smith
Michael D. Vawter
Joan Williams (Mrs. Rodney W.)
Rodney W. Williams
This factual hearing was open to the public and
took place on February 11, 12 and 13.
Considerable evidence was received, including the
testimony of some 24 witnesses.
The motivational hearing, also open to the
public, was held on February 21. All twenty-nine
defendants subscribed to an organized
presentation of their views. Thereafter each
defendant was given an opportunity to add further
information on his own behalf.
STATEMENT OF THE GENERAL FACTS
On the basis of the evidence presented during
the hearings, the Council finds the following facts:
At the October 1968 meeting of the Stanford
University Board of Trustees, a student, Yale
Braunstein, Speaker of the Student Legislature,
was permitted to address the board members,
urging them to hold open meetings with students.
The Board Chairman, shortly thereafter, wrote a
letter to Mr. Braunstein, thanking him for his
remarks but not specifically mentioning the issue
of open meetings. Mr. Braunstein replied with a
letter to the Board Chairman emphasizing the
importance of the open-meeting request.
Although at both the November 1968 and January
14, 1969 meetings of the Board, student leaders
were invited to and did sit with a number of Board
committees, the Board made no statement, either
to Mr. Braunstein or the Stanford student body at
large, concerning meetings of the Board itself,
which would be open to members of the Stanford
community.
On the morning of January 14,1969, a group of
students circulated throughout the campus a
document requesting that all interested persons

arrive at Bowman Alumni House at 12:30 p.m. for
the purpose of holding an open meeting with the
trustees. The document contained nine specific
demands regarding the operations of the
University and the Stanford Research Institute.
At approximately 12:30 p.m., when a group of
students had collected at Bowman, they learned
that the trustees were at the Stanford Faculty
Club. The students then held a meeting to
determine what action to take. At about this time
Associate Dean of Students, Willard Wyman,
entered Bowman where one of the students
demanded that Wyman carry a message to the
trustees asking for an open meeting. Although he
made it clear that he was not a "messenger boy"
for the students, Dean Wyman nevertheless did in
fact go to the Faculty Club to tell members of the
University administration, including President
Pitzer, that a group of students at Bowman wished
to have an open meeting with the trustees and
would not leave Bowman until such a meeting was
arranged.
Shortly thereafter Yale Braunstein, who had
observed the meeting at Bowman, and apparently
was concerned that Dean Wyman would not
deliver the message, decided to attempt to
communicate with the Board himself. He went to
the Faculty Club where he met Dean Wyman who
arranged for Braunstein to enter the rooms where
the trustees were located. Mr. Braunstein spoke to
the trustees, stating that the students at Bowman
not only demanded an open meeting but would
consider whatever meeting the trustees did hold to
be an open one. This message was given twice, once
in a room where the bulk of the trustees were
sitting and in an adjacent room where the
Investment Committee was in session.
After delivering this message, Braunstein
immediately withdrew and proceeded to Bowman
where he found the students leaving, en route to
the Faculty Club.
As soon as Braunstein left the trustees, they had
a short discussion and unanimously passed a
motion not to alter their policy which permits
non-trustees to attend Board meetings only upon
express invitation. No effort was made to
communicate this decision to the students.
Shortly thereafter, apparently just prior to
1:00 p.m., the students entered the inner patio of
the Faculty Club. They did so by proceeding up
the outer stairway facing Tresidder Union and
down the inner stairway to the courtyard.
The students gathered in the inner court where
some of them rapped on the sliding glass doors of
the rooms in which the trustees were sitting. The
students shouted and made use of a "bullhorn" to
attract the attention of and communicate with the
trustees inside. Individual students unsuccessfully
attempted to open the sliding doors.
The trustees continued with their business,
attempting as best they could to ignore the
students. A number of the students then entered
the Faculty Club from the patio and congregated
in the hallway outside the rooms where the
trustees were meeting.
From the time that the students entered the
patio, just before 1:00 p.m. until a few minutes
past 2:00 p.m., the students' attempts to attract
the attention of the trustees were intensified by
means of shouting, beating and kicking on the
doors, reading demands through a "bullhorn," etc.
From time to time students attempted to open the
doors from the trustees rooms into the hallway,
but they had been locked from the inside. On
occasion, administrative personnel and waiters
passed through these doors but did so carefully in
order to keep the students out. At one such time a
student in the hallway attempted to force his way
in but personnel inside the room managed to
reclose and lock the door.
Shortly before 2:00 p.m. the Faculty Advisory
Committee on Disruptions sent one of its
members, Professor Clebsch, to speak with
President Pitzer and Chairman of the Board Fuller.
Professor Chebsch reported that the noise inside
the room was so intense that it seriously disturbed
the conduct of the board meeting and made it
virtually impossible for the meeting to continue.
Testimony from persons who were inside the room
at the time supported this statement.
At about 2:00 p.m. the Advisory Committee
informed Dean Wyman that the students were in
violation of the Campus Policy on Disruptions and
requested that he warn them of this and take their
names. Dean Wyman then announced in the
hallway that the Disruption Policy had been
violated and that any students who did not leave
would have their names taken. He did not,
however, identify himself as an official of the
University acting as such. Substantial testimony
indicated that some students in the hallway may
not have heard his statement or known who he
was.
Dean Wyman then proceeded to take the names
of students who remained in the hallway and in the
patio. A number of students did leave and their
names were not recorded; some others who did
remain refused to reveal their identity or gave false
names. As Dean Wyman moved through the
hallway taking names he was subjected to taunts
and occasional threats of violence.
By 2:15 p.m. most of the students who
remained after the warning congregated in the
hallway where they held an informal meeting to
determine their course of action; some students
argued that they should not remain at the Faculty
Club.
While this meeting continued the noise level
subsided substantially.
At about 2:25 p.m. one of the students gained
entrance to the trustees' rooms through one of the
sliding doors from the patio. He moved directly
across the room and opened one of the doors to
the hallway. University personnel within the room
as well as some who were in the hallway attempted
to shut the door but the students in the hallway
moved forward to keep the door open.
At the door the students at first hung back,
shouting that they wanted an open meeting with
the trustees. Their demands were read through a
bullhorn. Meanwhile a line of administrative
officers within the room formed at the open door
to prevent students from gaining entry into the
room.
There ensued a period of confusion with
pushing and shoving taking place both on the part
of the students in the hallway and the personnel
from inside the room. During this time one
University official lost his balance and fell into the
hallway. Some students were shouting and at least
one was so agitated that he uttered a threat to one
of the administrative personnel at the door.
Shortly thereafter the students succeeded in
entering the room. One of the students was highly
agitated and he insulted and threatened the
trustees. At least two students grabbed copies of
the agenda of the trustees meeting and a struggle
ensued between one of these students and
university officials who sought to retrieve the
agenda he had taken.
Some of the students attempted to engage the
trustees in discussion; the trustees cut off their
meeting and left. The students remained in the
room for a short time thereafter and gradually
dispersed of their own volition.

DECISION ON LEGAL ISSUES
At the factual hearing on February 11-13,
1969, the defendants raised several legal
arguments regarding the Policy on Campus
Disruption as follows:
I. That the Policy was no longer in effect on
January 14, 1969, when the alleged acts of
disruption occurred.
11. That paragraph two of the Policy did not
apply because the facts show beyond any doubt
that University officials did not comply with
requirements set out therein, and
111. That paragraph one of the Policy was
inapplicable because it is dependent upon
University official's compliance with the
requirements of paragraph two.
I. Was the Policy in Effect
Validity of the Policy on Disruptions:
A. Nature of the Argument
1. The Policy on Campus Disruption was
issued on October 7, 1968 by Acting President
Robert Glaser.
2. On October 7, 1968, the Legislative and
Judicial Charter of 1968 was not yet in effect.
That charter was submitted to a vote of the
student body which approved its adoption until
March 1, 1969. The vote was completed on
October 15, 1968, and the results were
announced on October 16, 1968.
3. The invalidity of the Policy is based upon
Article I, Sections D(2)(b), D(2)(d), and
D(2)(e), which read as follows:
Section D(2)(b): When in his opinion an
emergency exists that requires the
promulgation of a regulation, including change
or repeal of an existing regulation, in less time
than is required under the procedure set forth
in section D.l, the President of the University
may promulgate an interim regulation to
become effective immediately upon
publication, provided the President shall first
consult with as many members of the SCLC as
practicable and, if time permits, shall first
afford the SCLC an opportunity to act under
section D.2a.
Section D(2)(d): An interim regulation
promulgated by the President under section
D.2b shall remain in effect for 90 days or until
it is repealed or amended by the SCLC,
whichever occurs first.
The SCLC may amend or repeal interim
regulations by the procedure provided in
section D.l or, with the written concurrence of
the President, SCLC may proceed under section
D.2a.
Section D(2)(e): If in the case of an interim
regulation promulgated under section D.2b, 90
days expire with no action by the SCLC, the
President may repromulgate the interim
regulation every 30 days until SCLC acts on it.
He shall inform the SCLC of each
promulgation.
The argument is that the Policy on Campus
Disruption is subject to these provisions of the
Charter and hence expired on January 7, 1968,
some 7 days prior to the time of the alleged
offenses in this case. The policy was never formally
renewed.
B. Analysis
1. The Disruption Policy was clearly
promulgated prior to ratification of the
Charter.
2. The terms of the Charter can in no way be
considered binding on such a policy, since the
Charter distinguishes clearly between those
policies promulgated prior to the Charter and
those promulgated thereafter.
Section I.E of the Charter clearly provides this
as follows:
E. Relation to Present University Policy.
Until such time as the Student Conduct
Legislative Council changes any present
University policy, that policy will remain in
effect. It is recommended that the first order
of business of the SCLC be the consideration
of areas in which there are currently conflicts
of law.
Section lI.D of the Charter obligates this
Council to enforce "present policy" until
altered in the following terms:
D. Relation to University Policy. Each
member of the Stanford Judicial Council is
obligated to enforce the regulations of the
Student Conduct Legislative Council or the
legislative product of the President acting
after consultation with the SCLC as provided
in Article I, section D.2b. Until such time as
the SCLC changes present policy, the SJC will
be obligated in the case of conflicts of law to
enforce the University policy.
3. The policy was terned an "interim" one by
Dr. Glaser at the time of its announcement, as
he clearly hoped for student approval of the
Charter and a subsequent consideration of the
policy by the Student Conduct Legislative
Council. Dr. Glaser's statement was as follows:
The consensus was that the policy should be
issued on an interim basis. Its interim
character is emphasized because we anticipate
further action by appropriate governing
bodies of the faculty and students, and in
particular by the proposed Student Conduct
Legislative Council. Subsequent actions of
these bodies may confirm, amend or
supercede the temporary policy, which will be
in effect until such actions are taken.
Obviously this statement in no way impugns,
but rather affirms the fact that the policy was
promulgated without time limit and was to be
considered in force until such time as the SCLC,
if established, altered that policy.
4. As of January 14, 1969, the SCLC had not
altered the Policy on Disruptions.
C. Holding
The University Policy on Campus Disruption
Issued October 7, 1968, was in full force and effect
on January 14,1969.
11. Does Paragraph 2of
the Policy Apply
A. Nature of the Argument
1. Paragraph 2 of the Policy on Campus
Disruption reads as follows:
Members of the faculty, staff, and student body
have an obligation to leave a university building
or facility when asked to do so in the
furtherance of the above regulations by a
member of the university community acting in
an official role, and identifying himself as such;
members of the faculty, staff, or student body
also have an obligation to identify themselves,
when requested to do so by such a member of
the university community who has reasonable
grounds to believe that the person(s) has
violated section (1) or (2) of this policy and
who has so informed the person(s).
2. Although a general announcement was
made by Dean Wyman that the students in the
Faculty Club had violated the Policy, the
evidence is legally insufficient to show that this
message was heard by any or all of the
defendants.
3. The evidence clearly shows that Dean
Wyman failed to announce that he was "a
member of the university community acting in
an official role," and, furthermore, reveals
conclusively that at least some defendants did
not know him.

4. It is thus argued that the Council can find no
violation of paragraph two of the Policy.
B. Analysis
1. Paragraph two of the Policy is quite clear in
its requirements. Individuals should not be
forced to leave a university building or reveal
their identify until they know that the
individual who requires them to do so is
properly authorized. Otherwise paragraph two
could be an instrument of widespread abuse.
2. It is easy enough for university officials,
once informed of this decision, to comply
strictly with the paragraph two requirements.
The Council finds such strict compliance
necessary even when it might appear that
persons making the request are doing so in their
official capacity.
3. The evidence is clear and uncontradicted
that the requirements of paragraph two of the
Policy were not met.
C. Holding
No defendant shall be held guilty of a violation
of paragraph two of the Policy on Campus
Disruption of October 7,1968.
111. Is Paragraph One of the
Policy Separate from Paragraph Two
A. Nature of the Argument
1. Paragraph one of the Policy states as
follows:
It is a violation of university policy for a
member of the faculty, staff, or student body
to (1) prevent or disrupt the effective carrying
out of a university function or approved
activity, such as lectures, meetings, interviews,
ceremonies, the conduct of university business
in a university office, and public events; (2)
obstruct the legitimate movement of any
person about the campus or in any university
building or facility.
2. Paragraph two of the Policy is in
"furtherance" of paragraph one. Hence, it is
argued that paragraph one is to be enforced
only through paragraph two. Since the
requirements of paragraph two have not been
met, there can be no guilt under the policy.
B. Analysis
1. Paragraph one of the Policy on Campus
Disruption clearly states that certain disruptive
conduct is improper. There is no logical way by
which paragraph one can be considered
dependent upon paragraph two. Otherwise an
individual who engaged in such disruption
could, merely by leaving before being told to do
so, immunize himself from liability under the
Policy. This would be an open invitation for
members of the University community to
engage in "hit-and-run" raids.
2. Paragraph two has an entirely different
focus than does paragrpah one. It is often
necessary to clear a building to prevent
disruption or to end disruption in progress.
Thus persons can be required to leave and their
failure to do so is a violation in and of itself,
apart from any disruption which does in fact
occur.
The required notification of paragraph two is
meaningless with regard to an individual who
has already broken up a lecture or a meeting.
The present case clearly illustrates this point.
Dean Wyman's failure to properly identify
himself eliminates any guilt for mere failure to
leave the building; surely, however, it does not
justify acts of disruption done both before and
after his statements.
As to such acts of disruption if the defendants
did not know Dean Wyman or know that he was
acting in his official capacity, as they
successfully argued regarding II above, what he
said or didn't say was of no relevance.
C. Holding
Paragraph one of the Policy on Campus
Disruption is wholly independent from paragraph
two and failure to comply with the terms of the
latter does not prohibit a charge under the former.
SPECIFIC FINDINGS AS TO GUILT
The Council finds as follows:
1. That in addition to those fourteen students
who admitted disruption, the remaining fifteen
defendants, who received a hearing on the facts,
were guilty of acts that disrupted "the effective
carrying out of a university function," under
the Policy on Campus Disruption of October 7,
1968.
(a) From the time the students first entered
the inner patio at the Faculty Club until
shortly after 2:00 p.m., they attempted to
force the trustees to discontinue their regular
meeting by shouting, pounding on doors and
windows, and making statements through a
bullhorn.
(b) That these acts disrupted the trustees'
meeting is unmistakably clear. Although the
trustees attempted to continue with their
regular business, the noise from outside made
it extremely difficult for them to do so.
(c) That these acts by defendants were
intended to disrupt the trustees' meeting is
also clear. The refusal of the trustees to
acknowledge the presence of the students, the
fact that the trustees shut and locked the
doors, and the fact that entry of the students
into the meeting room was resisted at all times
is substantial evidence that the trustees did
not want or intend to meet with the students
at that time and that the students knew this.
(d) Quite apart from the noisy attempts to
disrupt the trustees' meeting, the actual entry
of the students into the meeting room at
approximately 2:25 to 2:30 p.m., through a
line of university officials who clearly were
attempting to keep them out, itself
constituted a flagrant act of disruption. At
that point, the trustees who were attempting
to deal with items on their regular agenda, had
no choice but to stop what they were doing.
(e) It is clear from the evidence, including the
pictures taken at the scene, that all but one of
the fifteen defendants who requested a
hearing, entered or pushed forward in
attempting to enter the open door of the room
where the trustees were meeting. The
exception is James Johnson and the testimony
regarding Mr. Johnson unmistakably shows
him to have engaged in acts of disruption by
banging and kicking on the locked doors to
the meeting room.
2. That Mr. Richard F. Bogart has no defense
on the ground that he was present as a reporter
for KZSU Radio Station.
(a) An individual who engages in illegal acts is
not immunized merely because he belongs, or
in the present case, has reason to believe he
belongs, to a news organization. By his own
statements Mr. Bogart showed that he was
present as a participant in the demonstration.
(b) The Council finds no credible evidence
sufficient for a finding that Mr. Bogart should
be exonerated as a KZSU reporter. Obviously,
participation by a person in illegal activities
cannot be excused even if that person
ultimately reports upon those activities in the
news media.
(c) Furthermore, the evidence regarding Mr.
Bogart is clearly distinguishable from that
available to the Council regarding other
reporters who were not charged or against

whom charges were brought and then
dismissed. These other persons were in
attendance as assigned reporters or
photographers. They took photographs and
notes for news stories which were published
shortly thereafter, and in doing so they clearly
distinguished themselves from the defendants
who were engaged in the disruption. This is
simply not the case with Mr. Bogart.
FINDINGS REGARDING CULPABILITY
The Council finds as follows:
1. That like the fourteen defendants who
admitted to the charge against them, the
following twelve defendant who received a
hearing on the facts engaged in no acts of
aggravation beyond general disruption:
John W. Avery
Anne C. Bauer
Richard F. Bogart
Marc D. Heller
Virginia A. Linsley
David F. Pugh
George C. Reinhardt
James E. Shoch
Leonard M. Siegel
Michael D. Vawter
Joan Williams (Mrs. Rodney W.)
Rodney W. Williams
2. That in addition to general disruption the
following students engaged in specific
aggravating acts as indicated:
(a) Fred H.Cohen
(1) Threatened a University official who
blocked his entry into the trustees meeting
room by stating words such as "get your
hands off me baby or I'll bust your head,"
upon gaining entry into the room further
threatened the trustees not to meet on the
campus again, and in general was so violent
in his manner that several of hiscodefendants
restrained him, and
(2) Took from inside the room a folder
containing the agenda of the trustees
meeting and placed it under his coat.
(b) James E. Johnson
Violently kicked and beat on the doors and
windows to the trustees' room, with his
heavy boots and with a stick.
(c) Stephen S. Smith
(1) At approximaetely 2:25 p.m. managed
to open one of the sliding glass doors from
the patio into the turstees' room, walked
across that room, and, after a struggle with
several university officials, opened the
doorway to the hall and invited the students
congregated there to come into the room.
[At this point the Council would note the
fact that it was unable to locate any witness
who could testify as to how Mr. Smith
succeeded in opening the door from the
patio into the trustees' room. Mr. Smith was
not called in deference to his privilege
against self-incrimination and he chose not
to testify. The Council does find, however,
the circumstantial evidence is overwhelming
that Mr. Smith entered the room knowing
that it was disruptive for him to do so. This is
clearly shown by his subsequent actions in
immediately attempting to open the door to
the hallway against the will of those
present. ]
(2) Took a folder containing an agenda of
the trustees meeting and refused to return it
at the request of a number of University
personnel who finally were forced to engage
in a struggle with Mr. Smith to retrieve it.
3. That the University administration and the
Board of Trustees failed to make clear to the
defendants what proper channels, if any,
existed for communication between students
on the one hand and the administration and the
Board on the other.
4. That the defendants were strongly
motivated by sincerely held beliefs and felt
frustrated by their apparent inability to state
those beliefs to the Board.
5. That the failure of the University
administration and the Board of Trustees to
develop and maintain methods for the orderly
exchange of views with the student body
regarding issues relevant to the University was a
contributing factor of the disruption.
6. That the defendants in the present case were
less interested in the orderly exchange of views
than they were in the imposition of their views
on the rest of the community.

Autumn Quarter of the 1969-70 academic
year.

5. That with respect to orders to pay money
under 1(b), 2(b), 3(b) and 4(b) above
(a) The Dean of Students, in his discretion
may upon application by a defendant,
postpone payment of any sum when it appears
necessary to avoid undue financial hardship.
(b) Provided, however, that in no event shall a
university degree be awarded to any
defendant until he has paid the full amount
due.
Analysis of the Recommendations on Penalty
1. The Council's recommendations as to
penalty are based on a total view of the
defendants' conduct in light of the Council's
desire, as set forth in its Rules, to utilize
penalties to strengthen the Stanford
community.
2. The penalties would have been more severe
had the defendants been aware of the existence
of a reasonably means by which to make their
views known to the Board of Trustees.
3. At the same time, however, the Council
considered the offense to be a very serious one
that must not be repeated. If every member of
the Stanford community who feels strongly
about an issue is permitted to disrupt the
campus to impose his views on others, the result
would be chaos. Indeed such actions are
counterproductive in that they tend to
eliminate opportunity for legitimate discussion
and resolution of vital issues.
4. The Council's imposition of periods of
probation takes into consideration the threat
by defendants, made at the motivational
hearing, to engage in further serious acts of
disruption. The Council takes the position that
if during the period of probation any defendant
carries out such a threat, and is duly convicted
thereof, the University community has the
right to insist upon his suspension.
5. The Council views as most serious those acts
which, directly or by implication, threaten
violence to any person. Fortunately, in the
present case no one was injured and there was

no serious damage to property. Nevertheless, a
real danger of personal injury exists when
persons ostensibly engaged in a demonstration
to present their views, lose their tempers or
engage in physical altercations. The penalties to
three individuals reflect the Council's position,
based on clear evidence, that in varying degrees,
these individuals materially increased the
danger of physical violence and personal injury.
6. In order that the University community not
be misled, the Council wishes to make clear that
its decision in this case was not based on the
military draft policy of the United States or on
the draft status of any of the defendants.
Findingson Collateral Matters
The Council finds as follows:
1. That in light of the fact that every defendant
was clearly in violation of the Policy on Campus
Disruption of October 7, 1968, which policy
was valid and in force, the Council feels it
unnecessary to determine whether or not the
defendants were also in violation of the
Fundamental Standard. The answer to this
question would in no way affect the penalties
imposed.
2. That student witnesses have the obligation
to testify when called before the Council.
(a) In the present case a student was called to
testify as to events he observed at the Faculty
Club at the time of the disruption. He claimed
that he had been present as a reporter for the
Stanford Daily and therefore he was privileged
not to testify.
(b) The Council subpoenaed this witness
because he was known to have been present
and it was felt that defendants might have
wished to elicit information from him. The
defendants declined to ask him questions and
he was excused.
(c) The Council at that time, however, and
now, holds that the claimed privilege does not
exist, that it has not been recognized by the
courts of the land, that there is no justification
for such a privilege, and that the refusal to

testify on such grounds cannot and will not be
tolerated. [This in no way, however, governs
the Council's attitude toward the privilege of a
reporter not to reveal the name of a
confidential informant, which privilege has
both been recognized and rejected in various
courts. 1
3. That persons who attend a hearing of the
Stanford Judicial Council, including the
defendants and their counsel, have an
obligation not to impede, disrupt, or in any
manner interfere with the conduct of the
proceedings.
(a) A number of persons who attended the
factual hearing, particularly on the first night,
in obvious support of the defendants,
deliberately attempted to disrupt the
proceedings and did, in fact, cause
considerably noise and confusion.
(b) The Council is not a court of law; it has no
bailiff or sheriff's department to maintain
order. Thus any handful of persons, who are
so inclined can seriously impede the
proceedings.
(c) The defendants themselves, and their
counsel, must share the blame for the
disorder, particularly during the first night.
They continually directed their comments to
their supporters in the audience rather than to
the members of the Council and they
attempted in numerous ways, including the
muttering of threats, to ridicule the Council
and to make its job impossible. All this was
done in spite of the Council's solemn promise,
duly kept, that they would be given an
opportunity at the hearings on motivatioto
say what they so desired about the basic issues
underlying their actions.
The Council does note that the defendants did
intercede during the most serious disruptions
to assist the Council, primarily to prevent the
Council from closing the hearings, and that
after the first night of the hearings, the
defendants were more restrained. Moreover,

the Council recognizes and appreciates the
efforts of Mr. Doron Weinberg, who, as sole
counsel after the first and second evenings,
assisted in maintaining order and preserving
the decorum of the proceedings.
(d) On the basis of its experience in this case,
regarding meetings that are open to the
general public, the Council will seriously
consider in future cases limiting the number of
persons in attendance. Furthermore, the
Council serves warning on those who would
disrupt future proceedings that the Council is
disposed to find in contempt persons who
engage in disruption of its proceedings and to
recommend immediate imposition of severe
sanctions.
4. That defendant Jack Gerson, who
apparently withdrew from the University
subsequent to January 14, 1969, but prior to
the hearings in this case, has failed to respond to
summonses from the Council duly served upon
him.
The Council recommends that, in accordance
with the Legislative and Judicial Charter of
1968, the University immediately withdraw
Mr. Gerson's registration privileges until such
time as he appears before the Council for the
trial of his case.
THIS DECISION AND ALL ITS PARTS ARE
UNANIMOUSLY ADOPTED BY THE
MEMBERS OF THE COUNCIL.
Dated: February 27, 1969
Editor's Note: The Judicial Council's reference
to "the faculty advisory Committee on
Disruptions" is, in fact, the President's advisory
group on campus disruptions. After hearing from
members of this group. President Pitzer informed
Dean Wyman that the students were believed to be
in violation of the campus policy on disruptions.
The faculty members did not instruct Wyman
directly.
Incremental costs for publication of this report
have been paid for the the Stanford Newsservice.
STATEMENT OF THE PROCEEDINGS
On January 15, 1969, the Stanford Judicial
Council was notified by the office of the Dean of
Students that on the previous day a group of
persons, believed primarily to be Stanford
students, had allegedly disrupted a meeting of the
University Board of Trustees which had been held
at the Stanford Faculty Club. The Council was
asked to investigate.
Pursuant to the Legislative and Judicial Charter
of 1968, the Council sent out five judicial aides to
investigate and interview witnesses. The judicial
aides made a comprehensive report to the Council
which included photographs, lists of witnesses and
participants, transcripts of tape-recorded
interviews of many persons, and additional
statements, including those of a number of
potential defendants.
At the Council's behest, the Chairman
examined the report and, on the basis of the
information therein, determined to call before
him, and one other member of the Council sitting
with him, some thirty-nine persons for the purpose
of charging them with violations of the Campus
Policy on Disruptions of October 7, 1968, and of
the Fundamental Standard, and to show each the
evidence the Council had obtained through its
judicial aides regarding his activities.
The letter summoning these persons was sent
by mail; in addition a copy of the letter was
personally served on each of them. The letter
contained the following:
(1) A statement that the person was charged
with violations of the Disruption Policy and
of the Fundamental Standard.
(2) An outline of proceedings to be followed
during trial of the case.
(3) A copy of the Council's rules containing
the rights of defendants as set out in the
Legislative and Judicial Charter of 1968.
(4) A date and time to appear before the
Chairman of the Council for a conference.
Each person summoned duly appeared with the
sole exception of Jack Gerson, who has at no time
appeared or taken part in these proceedings.
The Council Chairman, sitting with at least one
other member of the Council, showed each
defendant the evidence regarding his activities and
explained to each defendant the procedure to be
followed for trial. That procedure required a
bifurcated hearing. The first hearing would be
designed solely to determine what acts each
student had, or had not committed; the second
hearing would be devoted solely to matters of
motivation.
With but one exception, Fred Cohen, who was
also charged with acts of intimidation, each
student, for purposes of the present hearings, was
charged only with having disrupted the Board of
Trustees meeting; no specific acts of violence,
threats, etc. were alleged. [Defendant James
Johnson was also charged with having set a false
fire alarm but all hearings on this charge were
suspended pending decision on such a charge in the
county civil courts. ]
Every defendant was given an opportunity to
admit to the charge against him. He was told that
to do so would eliminate the need for the first
hearing in his case, but that he would still be
permitted to do three things;
(1) Take part in the motivational hearing.
(2) Argue the invalidity of the Campus Policy
on Disruptions.
(3) Argue that the Fundamental Standard does
not cover disruption without a showing of
specific acts such as violence, threats,
blocking access of other persons, etc.
Each student was further informed that any
specific facts regarding his individual conduct
which were brought out during a fact hearing
would be considered by the Council in deciding his
case.
Although defendants were told they had a right
to remain silent, many wished to discuss the nature
of their participation. On the basis of their
statements and the Council's continuing
investigation of the case, charges were withdrawn
against nine persons. Of the remaining twenty-nine
defendants, the following twelve initially decided
to admit to the charges against them:
Allen Christelow
Richard Greenspan
HallamC. Hamilton
Carolyn M. Iverson
Barbara E. Lee
Michael M. Morton
Christine M. Mrak
Jeffrey J. Preefer
Guy D. Smyth
Don P. Stuart
D. Jeffrey Weil
Helen K. Williams
Thereafter, two additional students, Irwin
Busse and Marc Weiss, also decided to admit the
charges against them. Thus, when the case
proceeded to the first hearing, only the following
fifteen students were involved:
John W. Avery
Anne C. Bauer
Richard F. Bogart
Fred H. Cohen
Marc D. Heller
James E. Johnson
Virginia A. Linsley
David F. Pugh
George C. Reinhardt
James E. Shoch
Leonard M. Siegel
Stephen S. Smith
Michael D. Vawter
Joan Williams (Mrs. Rodney W.)
Rodney W. Williams
This factual hearing was open to the public and
took place on February 11, 12 and 13.
Considerable evidence was received, including the
testimony of some 24 witnesses.
The motivational hearing, also open to the
public, was held on February 21. All twenty-nine
defendants subscribed to an organized
presentation of their views. Thereafter each
defendant was given an opportunity to add further
information on his own behalf.
STATEMENT OF THE GENERAL FACTS
On the basis of the evidence presented during
the hearings, the Council finds the following facts:
At the October 1968 meeting of the Stanford
University Board of Trustees, a student, Yale
Braunstein, Speaker of the Student Legislature,
was permitted to address the board members,
urging them to hold open meetings with students.
The Board Chairman, shortly thereafter, wrote a
letter to Mr. Braunstein, thanking him for his
remarks but not specifically mentioning the issue
of open meetings. Mr. Braunstein replied with a
letter to the Board Chairman emphasizing the
importance of the open-meeting request.
Although at both the November 1968 and January
14, 1969 meetings of the Board, student leaders
were invited to and did sit with a number of Board
committees, the Board made no statement, either
to Mr. Braunstein or the Stanford student body at
large, concerning meetings of the Board itself,
which would be open to members of the Stanford
community.
On the morning of January 14,1969, a group of
students circulated throughout the campus a
document requesting that all interested persons

arrive at Bowman Alumni House at 12:30 p.m. for
the purpose of holding an open meeting with the
trustees. The document contained nine specific
demands regarding the operations of the
University and the Stanford Research Institute.
At approximately 12:30 p.m., when a group of
students had collected at Bowman, they learned
that the trustees were at the Stanford Faculty
Club. The students then held a meeting to
determine what action to take. At about this time
Associate Dean of Students, Willard Wyman,
entered Bowman where one of the students
demanded that Wyman carry a message to the
trustees asking for an open meeting. Although he
made it clear that he was not a "messenger boy"
for the students, Dean Wyman nevertheless did in
fact go to the Faculty Club to tell members of the
University administration, including President
Pitzer, that a group of students at Bowman wished
to have an open meeting with the trustees and
would not leave Bowman until such a meeting was
arranged.
Shortly thereafter Yale Braunstein, who had
observed the meeting at Bowman, and apparently
was concerned that Dean Wyman would not
deliver the message, decided to attempt to
communicate with the Board himself. He went to
the Faculty Club where he met Dean Wyman who
arranged for Braunstein to enter the rooms where
the trustees were located. Mr. Braunstein spoke to
the trustees, stating that the students at Bowman
not only demanded an open meeting but would
consider whatever meeting the trustees did hold to
be an open one. This message was given twice, once
in a room where the bulk of the trustees were
sitting and in an adjacent room where the
Investment Committee was in session.
After delivering this message, Braunstein
immediately withdrew and proceeded to Bowman
where he found the students leaving, en route to
the Faculty Club.
As soon as Braunstein left the trustees, they had
a short discussion and unanimously passed a
motion not to alter their policy which permits
non-trustees to attend Board meetings only upon
express invitation. No effort was made to
communicate this decision to the students.
Shortly thereafter, apparently just prior to
1:00 p.m., the students entered the inner patio of
the Faculty Club. They did so by proceeding up
the outer stairway facing Tresidder Union and
down the inner stairway to the courtyard.
The students gathered in the inner court where
some of them rapped on the sliding glass doors of
the rooms in which the trustees were sitting. The
students shouted and made use of a "bullhorn" to
attract the attention of and communicate with the
trustees inside. Individual students unsuccessfully
attempted to open the sliding doors.
The trustees continued with their business,
attempting as best they could to ignore the
students. A number of the students then entered
the Faculty Club from the patio and congregated
in the hallway outside the rooms where the
trustees were meeting.
From the time that the students entered the
patio, just before 1:00 p.m. until a few minutes
past 2:00 p.m., the students' attempts to attract
the attention of the trustees were intensified by
means of shouting, beating and kicking on the
doors, reading demands through a "bullhorn," etc.
From time to time students attempted to open the
doors from the trustees rooms into the hallway,
but they had been locked from the inside. On
occasion, administrative personnel and waiters
passed through these doors but did so carefully in
order to keep the students out. At one such time a
student in the hallway attempted to force his way
in but personnel inside the room managed to
reclose and lock the door.
Shortly before 2:00 p.m. the Faculty Advisory
Committee on Disruptions sent one of its
members, Professor Clebsch, to speak with
President Pitzer and Chairman of the Board Fuller.
Professor Chebsch reported that the noise inside
the room was so intense that it seriously disturbed
the conduct of the board meeting and made it
virtually impossible for the meeting to continue.
Testimony from persons who were inside the room
at the time supported this statement.
At about 2:00 p.m. the Advisory Committee
informed Dean Wyman that the students were in
violation of the Campus Policy on Disruptions and
requested that he warn them of this and take their
names. Dean Wyman then announced in the
hallway that the Disruption Policy had been
violated and that any students who did not leave
would have their names taken. He did not,
however, identify himself as an official of the
University acting as such. Substantial testimony
indicated that some students in the hallway may
not have heard his statement or known who he
was.
Dean Wyman then proceeded to take the names
of students who remained in the hallway and in the
patio. A number of students did leave and their
names were not recorded; some others who did
remain refused to reveal their identity or gave false
names. As Dean Wyman moved through the
hallway taking names he was subjected to taunts
and occasional threats of violence.
By 2:15 p.m. most of the students who
remained after the warning congregated in the
hallway where they held an informal meeting to
determine their course of action; some students
argued that they should not remain at the Faculty
Club.
While this meeting continued the noise level
subsided substantially.
At about 2:25 p.m. one of the students gained
entrance to the trustees' rooms through one of the
sliding doors from the patio. He moved directly
across the room and opened one of the doors to
the hallway. University personnel within the room
as well as some who were in the hallway attempted
to shut the door but the students in the hallway
moved forward to keep the door open.
At the door the students at first hung back,
shouting that they wanted an open meeting with
the trustees. Their demands were read through a
bullhorn. Meanwhile a line of administrative
officers within the room formed at the open door
to prevent students from gaining entry into the
room.
There ensued a period of confusion with
pushing and shoving taking place both on the part
of the students in the hallway and the personnel
from inside the room. During this time one
University official lost his balance and fell into the
hallway. Some students were shouting and at least
one was so agitated that he uttered a threat to one
of the administrative personnel at the door.
Shortly thereafter the students succeeded in
entering the room. One of the students was highly
agitated and he insulted and threatened the
trustees. At least two students grabbed copies of
the agenda of the trustees meeting and a struggle
ensued between one of these students and
university officials who sought to retrieve the
agenda he had taken.
Some of the students attempted to engage the
trustees in discussion; the trustees cut off their
meeting and left. The students remained in the
room for a short time thereafter and gradually
dispersed of their own volition.

DECISION ON LEGAL ISSUES
At the factual hearing on February 11-13,
1969, the defendants raised several legal
arguments regarding the Policy on Campus
Disruption as follows:
I. That the Policy was no longer in effect on
January 14, 1969, when the alleged acts of
disruption occurred.
11. That paragraph two of the Policy did not
apply because the facts show beyond any doubt
that University officials did not comply with
requirements set out therein, and
111. That paragraph one of the Policy was
inapplicable because it is dependent upon
University official's compliance with the
requirements of paragraph two.
I. Was the Policy in Effect
Validity of the Policy on Disruptions:
A. Nature of the Argument
1. The Policy on Campus Disruption was
issued on October 7, 1968 by Acting President
Robert Glaser.
2. On October 7, 1968, the Legislative and
Judicial Charter of 1968 was not yet in effect.
That charter was submitted to a vote of the
student body which approved its adoption until
March 1, 1969. The vote was completed on
October 15, 1968, and the results were
announced on October 16, 1968.
3. The invalidity of the Policy is based upon
Article I, Sections D(2)(b), D(2)(d), and
D(2)(e), which read as follows:
Section D(2)(b): When in his opinion an
emergency exists that requires the
promulgation of a regulation, including change
or repeal of an existing regulation, in less time
than is required under the procedure set forth
in section D.l, the President of the University
may promulgate an interim regulation to
become effective immediately upon
publication, provided the President shall first
consult with as many members of the SCLC as
practicable and, if time permits, shall first
afford the SCLC an opportunity to act under
section D.2a.
Section D(2)(d): An interim regulation
promulgated by the President under section
D.2b shall remain in effect for 90 days or until
it is repealed or amended by the SCLC,
whichever occurs first.
The SCLC may amend or repeal interim
regulations by the procedure provided in
section D.l or, with the written concurrence of
the President, SCLC may proceed under section
D.2a.
Section D(2)(e): If in the case of an interim
regulation promulgated under section D.2b, 90
days expire with no action by the SCLC, the
President may repromulgate the interim
regulation every 30 days until SCLC acts on it.
He shall inform the SCLC of each
promulgation.
The argument is that the Policy on Campus
Disruption is subject to these provisions of the
Charter and hence expired on January 7, 1968,
some 7 days prior to the time of the alleged
offenses in this case. The policy was never formally
renewed.
B. Analysis
1. The Disruption Policy was clearly
promulgated prior to ratification of the
Charter.
2. The terms of the Charter can in no way be
considered binding on such a policy, since the
Charter distinguishes clearly between those
policies promulgated prior to the Charter and
those promulgated thereafter.
Section I.E of the Charter clearly provides this
as follows:
E. Relation to Present University Policy.
Until such time as the Student Conduct
Legislative Council changes any present
University policy, that policy will remain in
effect. It is recommended that the first order
of business of the SCLC be the consideration
of areas in which there are currently conflicts
of law.
Section lI.D of the Charter obligates this
Council to enforce "present policy" until
altered in the following terms:
D. Relation to University Policy. Each
member of the Stanford Judicial Council is
obligated to enforce the regulations of the
Student Conduct Legislative Council or the
legislative product of the President acting
after consultation with the SCLC as provided
in Article I, section D.2b. Until such time as
the SCLC changes present policy, the SJC will
be obligated in the case of conflicts of law to
enforce the University policy.
3. The policy was terned an "interim" one by
Dr. Glaser at the time of its announcement, as
he clearly hoped for student approval of the
Charter and a subsequent consideration of the
policy by the Student Conduct Legislative
Council. Dr. Glaser's statement was as follows:
The consensus was that the policy should be
issued on an interim basis. Its interim
character is emphasized because we anticipate
further action by appropriate governing
bodies of the faculty and students, and in
particular by the proposed Student Conduct
Legislative Council. Subsequent actions of
these bodies may confirm, amend or
supercede the temporary policy, which will be
in effect until such actions are taken.
Obviously this statement in no way impugns,
but rather affirms the fact that the policy was
promulgated without time limit and was to be
considered in force until such time as the SCLC,
if established, altered that policy.
4. As of January 14, 1969, the SCLC had not
altered the Policy on Disruptions.
C. Holding
The University Policy on Campus Disruption
Issued October 7, 1968, was in full force and effect
on January 14,1969.
11. Does Paragraph 2of
the Policy Apply
A. Nature of the Argument
1. Paragraph 2 of the Policy on Campus
Disruption reads as follows:
Members of the faculty, staff, and student body
have an obligation to leave a university building
or facility when asked to do so in the
furtherance of the above regulations by a
member of the university community acting in
an official role, and identifying himself as such;
members of the faculty, staff, or student body
also have an obligation to identify themselves,
when requested to do so by such a member of
the university community who has reasonable
grounds to believe that the person(s) has
violated section (1) or (2) of this policy and
who has so informed the person(s).
2. Although a general announcement was
made by Dean Wyman that the students in the
Faculty Club had violated the Policy, the
evidence is legally insufficient to show that this
message was heard by any or all of the
defendants.
3. The evidence clearly shows that Dean
Wyman failed to announce that he was "a
member of the university community acting in
an official role," and, furthermore, reveals
conclusively that at least some defendants did
not know him.

4. It is thus argued that the Council can find no
violation of paragraph two of the Policy.
B. Analysis
1. Paragraph two of the Policy is quite clear in
its requirements. Individuals should not be
forced to leave a university building or reveal
their identify until they know that the
individual who requires them to do so is
properly authorized. Otherwise paragraph two
could be an instrument of widespread abuse.
2. It is easy enough for university officials,
once informed of this decision, to comply
strictly with the paragraph two requirements.
The Council finds such strict compliance
necessary even when it might appear that
persons making the request are doing so in their
official capacity.
3. The evidence is clear and uncontradicted
that the requirements of paragraph two of the
Policy were not met.
C. Holding
No defendant shall be held guilty of a violation
of paragraph two of the Policy on Campus
Disruption of October 7,1968.
111. Is Paragraph One of the
Policy Separate from Paragraph Two
A. Nature of the Argument
1. Paragraph one of the Policy states as
follows:
It is a violation of university policy for a
member of the faculty, staff, or student body
to (1) prevent or disrupt the effective carrying
out of a university function or approved
activity, such as lectures, meetings, interviews,
ceremonies, the conduct of university business
in a university office, and public events; (2)
obstruct the legitimate movement of any
person about the campus or in any university
building or facility.
2. Paragraph two of the Policy is in
"furtherance" of paragraph one. Hence, it is
argued that paragraph one is to be enforced
only through paragraph two. Since the
requirements of paragraph two have not been
met, there can be no guilt under the policy.
B. Analysis
1. Paragraph one of the Policy on Campus
Disruption clearly states that certain disruptive
conduct is improper. There is no logical way by
which paragraph one can be considered
dependent upon paragraph two. Otherwise an
individual who engaged in such disruption
could, merely by leaving before being told to do
so, immunize himself from liability under the
Policy. This would be an open invitation for
members of the University community to
engage in "hit-and-run" raids.
2. Paragraph two has an entirely different
focus than does paragrpah one. It is often
necessary to clear a building to prevent
disruption or to end disruption in progress.
Thus persons can be required to leave and their
failure to do so is a violation in and of itself,
apart from any disruption which does in fact
occur.
The required notification of paragraph two is
meaningless with regard to an individual who
has already broken up a lecture or a meeting.
The present case clearly illustrates this point.
Dean Wyman's failure to properly identify
himself eliminates any guilt for mere failure to
leave the building; surely, however, it does not
justify acts of disruption done both before and
after his statements.
As to such acts of disruption if the defendants
did not know Dean Wyman or know that he was
acting in his official capacity, as they
successfully argued regarding II above, what he
said or didn't say was of no relevance.
C. Holding
Paragraph one of the Policy on Campus
Disruption is wholly independent from paragraph
two and failure to comply with the terms of the
latter does not prohibit a charge under the former.
SPECIFIC FINDINGS AS TO GUILT
The Council finds as follows:
1. That in addition to those fourteen students
who admitted disruption, the remaining fifteen
defendants, who received a hearing on the facts,
were guilty of acts that disrupted "the effective
carrying out of a university function," under
the Policy on Campus Disruption of October 7,
1968.
(a) From the time the students first entered
the inner patio at the Faculty Club until
shortly after 2:00 p.m., they attempted to
force the trustees to discontinue their regular
meeting by shouting, pounding on doors and
windows, and making statements through a
bullhorn.
(b) That these acts disrupted the trustees'
meeting is unmistakably clear. Although the
trustees attempted to continue with their
regular business, the noise from outside made
it extremely difficult for them to do so.
(c) That these acts by defendants were
intended to disrupt the trustees' meeting is
also clear. The refusal of the trustees to
acknowledge the presence of the students, the
fact that the trustees shut and locked the
doors, and the fact that entry of the students
into the meeting room was resisted at all times
is substantial evidence that the trustees did
not want or intend to meet with the students
at that time and that the students knew this.
(d) Quite apart from the noisy attempts to
disrupt the trustees' meeting, the actual entry
of the students into the meeting room at
approximately 2:25 to 2:30 p.m., through a
line of university officials who clearly were
attempting to keep them out, itself
constituted a flagrant act of disruption. At
that point, the trustees who were attempting
to deal with items on their regular agenda, had
no choice but to stop what they were doing.
(e) It is clear from the evidence, including the
pictures taken at the scene, that all but one of
the fifteen defendants who requested a
hearing, entered or pushed forward in
attempting to enter the open door of the room
where the trustees were meeting. The
exception is James Johnson and the testimony
regarding Mr. Johnson unmistakably shows
him to have engaged in acts of disruption by
banging and kicking on the locked doors to
the meeting room.
2. That Mr. Richard F. Bogart has no defense
on the ground that he was present as a reporter
for KZSU Radio Station.
(a) An individual who engages in illegal acts is
not immunized merely because he belongs, or
in the present case, has reason to believe he
belongs, to a news organization. By his own
statements Mr. Bogart showed that he was
present as a participant in the demonstration.
(b) The Council finds no credible evidence
sufficient for a finding that Mr. Bogart should
be exonerated as a KZSU reporter. Obviously,
participation by a person in illegal activities
cannot be excused even if that person
ultimately reports upon those activities in the
news media.
(c) Furthermore, the evidence regarding Mr.
Bogart is clearly distinguishable from that
available to the Council regarding other
reporters who were not charged or against

whom charges were brought and then
dismissed. These other persons were in
attendance as assigned reporters or
photographers. They took photographs and
notes for news stories which were published
shortly thereafter, and in doing so they clearly
distinguished themselves from the defendants
who were engaged in the disruption. This is
simply not the case with Mr. Bogart.
FINDINGS REGARDING CULPABILITY
The Council finds as follows:
1. That like the fourteen defendants who
admitted to the charge against them, the
following twelve defendant who received a
hearing on the facts engaged in no acts of
aggravation beyond general disruption:
John W. Avery
Anne C. Bauer
Richard F. Bogart
Marc D. Heller
Virginia A. Linsley
David F. Pugh
George C. Reinhardt
James E. Shoch
Leonard M. Siegel
Michael D. Vawter
Joan Williams (Mrs. Rodney W.)
Rodney W. Williams
2. That in addition to general disruption the
following students engaged in specific
aggravating acts as indicated:
(a) Fred H.Cohen
(1) Threatened a University official who
blocked his entry into the trustees meeting
room by stating words such as "get your
hands off me baby or I'll bust your head,"
upon gaining entry into the room further
threatened the trustees not to meet on the
campus again, and in general was so violent
in his manner that several of hiscodefendants
restrained him, and
(2) Took from inside the room a folder
containing the agenda of the trustees
meeting and placed it under his coat.
(b) James E. Johnson
Violently kicked and beat on the doors and
windows to the trustees' room, with his
heavy boots and with a stick.
(c) Stephen S. Smith
(1) At approximaetely 2:25 p.m. managed
to open one of the sliding glass doors from
the patio into the turstees' room, walked
across that room, and, after a struggle with
several university officials, opened the
doorway to the hall and invited the students
congregated there to come into the room.
[At this point the Council would note the
fact that it was unable to locate any witness
who could testify as to how Mr. Smith
succeeded in opening the door from the
patio into the trustees' room. Mr. Smith was
not called in deference to his privilege
against self-incrimination and he chose not
to testify. The Council does find, however,
the circumstantial evidence is overwhelming
that Mr. Smith entered the room knowing
that it was disruptive for him to do so. This is
clearly shown by his subsequent actions in
immediately attempting to open the door to
the hallway against the will of those
present. ]
(2) Took a folder containing an agenda of
the trustees meeting and refused to return it
at the request of a number of University
personnel who finally were forced to engage
in a struggle with Mr. Smith to retrieve it.
3. That the University administration and the
Board of Trustees failed to make clear to the
defendants what proper channels, if any,
existed for communication between students
on the one hand and the administration and the
Board on the other.
4. That the defendants were strongly
motivated by sincerely held beliefs and felt
frustrated by their apparent inability to state
those beliefs to the Board.
5. That the failure of the University
administration and the Board of Trustees to
develop and maintain methods for the orderly
exchange of views with the student body
regarding issues relevant to the University was a
contributing factor of the disruption.
6. That the defendants in the present case were
less interested in the orderly exchange of views
than they were in the imposition of their views
on the rest of the community.

5. That with respect to orders to pay money
under 1(b), 2(b), 3(b) and 4(b) above
(a) The Dean of Students, in his discretion
may upon application by a defendant,
postpone payment of any sum when it appears
necessary to avoid undue financial hardship.
(b) Provided, however, that in no event shall a
university degree be awarded to any
defendant until he has paid the full amount
due.
Analysis of the Recommendations on Penalty
1. The Council's recommendations as to
penalty are based on a total view of the
defendants' conduct in light of the Council's
desire, as set forth in its Rules, to utilize
penalties to strengthen the Stanford
community.
2. The penalties would have been more severe
had the defendants been aware of the existence
of a reasonably means by which to make their
views known to the Board of Trustees.
3. At the same time, however, the Council
considered the offense to be a very serious one
that must not be repeated. If every member of
the Stanford community who feels strongly
about an issue is permitted to disrupt the
campus to impose his views on others, the result
would be chaos. Indeed such actions are
counterproductive in that they tend to
eliminate opportunity for legitimate discussion
and resolution of vital issues.
4. The Council's imposition of periods of
probation takes into consideration the threat
by defendants, made at the motivational
hearing, to engage in further serious acts of
disruption. The Council takes the position that
if during the period of probation any defendant
carries out such a threat, and is duly convicted
thereof, the University community has the
right to insist upon his suspension.
5. The Council views as most serious those acts
which, directly or by implication, threaten
violence to any person. Fortunately, in the
present case no one was injured and there was

no serious damage to property. Nevertheless, a
real danger of personal injury exists when
persons ostensibly engaged in a demonstration
to present their views, lose their tempers or
engage in physical altercations. The penalties to
three individuals reflect the Council's position,
based on clear evidence, that in varying degrees,
these individuals materially increased the
danger of physical violence and personal injury.
6. In order that the University community not
be misled, the Council wishes to make clear that
its decision in this case was not based on the
military draft policy of the United States or on
the draft status of any of the defendants.
Findingson Collateral Matters
The Council finds as follows:
1. That in light of the fact that every defendant
was clearly in violation of the Policy on Campus
Disruption of October 7, 1968, which policy
was valid and in force, the Council feels it
unnecessary to determine whether or not the
defendants were also in violation of the
Fundamental Standard. The answer to this
question would in no way affect the penalties
imposed.
2. That student witnesses have the obligation
to testify when called before the Council.
(a) In the present case a student was called to
testify as to events he observed at the Faculty
Club at the time of the disruption. He claimed
that he had been present as a reporter for the
Stanford Daily and therefore he was privileged
not to testify.
(b) The Council subpoenaed this witness
because he was known to have been present
and it was felt that defendants might have
wished to elicit information from him. The
defendants declined to ask him questions and
he was excused.
(c) The Council at that time, however, and
now, holds that the claimed privilege does not
exist, that it has not been recognized by the
courts of the land, that there is no justification
for such a privilege, and that the refusal to

testify on such grounds cannot and will not be
tolerated. [This in no way, however, governs
the Council's attitude toward the privilege of a
reporter not to reveal the name of a
confidential informant, which privilege has
both been recognized and rejected in various
courts. 1
3. That persons who attend a hearing of the
Stanford Judicial Council, including the
defendants and their counsel, have an
obligation not to impede, disrupt, or in any
manner interfere with the conduct of the
proceedings.
(a) A number of persons who attended the
factual hearing, particularly on the first night,
in obvious support of the defendants,
deliberately attempted to disrupt the
proceedings and did, in fact, cause
considerably noise and confusion.
(b) The Council is not a court of law; it has no
bailiff or sheriff's department to maintain
order. Thus any handful of persons, who are
so inclined can seriously impede the
proceedings.
(c) The defendants themselves, and their
counsel, must share the blame for the
disorder, particularly during the first night.
They continually directed their comments to
their supporters in the audience rather than to
the members of the Council and they
attempted in numerous ways, including the
muttering of threats, to ridicule the Council
and to make its job impossible. All this was
done in spite of the Council's solemn promise,
duly kept, that they would be given an
opportunity at the hearings on motivatioto
say what they so desired about the basic issues
underlying their actions.
The Council does note that the defendants did
intercede during the most serious disruptions
to assist the Council, primarily to prevent the
Council from closing the hearings, and that
after the first night of the hearings, the
defendants were more restrained. Moreover,

the Council recognizes and appreciates the
efforts of Mr. Doron Weinberg, who, as sole
counsel after the first and second evenings,
assisted in maintaining order and preserving
the decorum of the proceedings.
(d) On the basis of its experience in this case,
regarding meetings that are open to the
general public, the Council will seriously
consider in future cases limiting the number of
persons in attendance. Furthermore, the
Council serves warning on those who would
disrupt future proceedings that the Council is
disposed to find in contempt persons who
engage in disruption of its proceedings and to
recommend immediate imposition of severe
sanctions.
4. That defendant Jack Gerson, who
apparently withdrew from the University
subsequent to January 14, 1969, but prior to
the hearings in this case, has failed to respond to
summonses from the Council duly served upon
him.
The Council recommends that, in accordance
with the Legislative and Judicial Charter of
1968, the University immediately withdraw
Mr. Gerson's registration privileges until such
time as he appears before the Council for the
trial of his case.
THIS DECISION AND ALL ITS PARTS ARE
UNANIMOUSLY ADOPTED BY THE
MEMBERS OF THE COUNCIL.
Dated: February 27, 1969
Editor's Note: The Judicial Council's reference
to "the faculty advisory Committee on
Disruptions" is, in fact, the President's advisory
group on campus disruptions. After hearing from
members of this group. President Pitzer informed
Dean Wyman that the students were believed to be
in violation of the campus policy on disruptions.
The faculty members did not instruct Wyman
directly.
Incremental costs for publication of this report
have been paid for the the Stanford Newsservice.
STATEMENT OF THE PROCEEDINGS
On January 15, 1969, the Stanford Judicial
Council was notified by the office of the Dean of
Students that on the previous day a group of
persons, believed primarily to be Stanford
students, had allegedly disrupted a meeting of the
University Board of Trustees which had been held
at the Stanford Faculty Club. The Council was
asked to investigate.
Pursuant to the Legislative and Judicial Charter
of 1968, the Council sent out five judicial aides to
investigate and interview witnesses. The judicial
aides made a comprehensive report to the Council
which included photographs, lists of witnesses and
participants, transcripts of tape-recorded
interviews of many persons, and additional
statements, including those of a number of
potential defendants.
At the Council's behest, the Chairman
examined the report and, on the basis of the
information therein, determined to call before
him, and one other member of the Council sitting
with him, some thirty-nine persons for the purpose
of charging them with violations of the Campus
Policy on Disruptions of October 7, 1968, and of
the Fundamental Standard, and to show each the
evidence the Council had obtained through its
judicial aides regarding his activities.
The letter summoning these persons was sent
by mail; in addition a copy of the letter was
personally served on each of them. The letter
contained the following:
(1) A statement that the person was charged
with violations of the Disruption Policy and
of the Fundamental Standard.
(2) An outline of proceedings to be followed
during trial of the case.
(3) A copy of the Council's rules containing
the rights of defendants as set out in the
Legislative and Judicial Charter of 1968.
(4) A date and time to appear before the
Chairman of the Council for a conference.
Each person summoned duly appeared with the
sole exception of Jack Gerson, who has at no time
appeared or taken part in these proceedings.
The Council Chairman, sitting with at least one
other member of the Council, showed each
defendant the evidence regarding his activities and
explained to each defendant the procedure to be
followed for trial. That procedure required a
bifurcated hearing. The first hearing would be
designed solely to determine what acts each
student had, or had not committed; the second
hearing would be devoted solely to matters of
motivation.
With but one exception, Fred Cohen, who was
also charged with acts of intimidation, each
student, for purposes of the present hearings, was
charged only with having disrupted the Board of
Trustees meeting; no specific acts of violence,
threats, etc. were alleged. [Defendant James
Johnson was also charged with having set a false
fire alarm but all hearings on this charge were
suspended pending decision on such a charge in the
county civil courts. ]
Every defendant was given an opportunity to
admit to the charge against him. He was told that
to do so would eliminate the need for the first
hearing in his case, but that he would still be
permitted to do three things;
(1) Take part in the motivational hearing.
(2) Argue the invalidity of the Campus Policy
on Disruptions.
(3) Argue that the Fundamental Standard does
not cover disruption without a showing of
specific acts such as violence, threats,
blocking access of other persons, etc.
Each student was further informed that any
specific facts regarding his individual conduct
which were brought out during a fact hearing
would be considered by the Council in deciding his
case.
Although defendants were told they had a right
to remain silent, many wished to discuss the nature
of their participation. On the basis of their
statements and the Council's continuing
investigation of the case, charges were withdrawn
against nine persons. Of the remaining twenty-nine
defendants, the following twelve initially decided
to admit to the charges against them:
Allen Christelow
Richard Greenspan
HallamC. Hamilton
Carolyn M. Iverson
Barbara E. Lee
Michael M. Morton
Christine M. Mrak
Jeffrey J. Preefer
Guy D. Smyth
Don P. Stuart
D. Jeffrey Weil
Helen K. Williams
Thereafter, two additional students, Irwin
Busse and Marc Weiss, also decided to admit the
charges against them. Thus, when the case
proceeded to the first hearing, only the following
fifteen students were involved:
John W. Avery
Anne C. Bauer
Richard F. Bogart
Fred H. Cohen
Marc D. Heller
James E. Johnson
Virginia A. Linsley
David F. Pugh
George C. Reinhardt
James E. Shoch
Leonard M. Siegel
Stephen S. Smith
Michael D. Vawter
Joan Williams (Mrs. Rodney W.)
Rodney W. Williams
This factual hearing was open to the public and
took place on February 11, 12 and 13.
Considerable evidence was received, including the
testimony of some 24 witnesses.
The motivational hearing, also open to the
public, was held on February 21. All twenty-nine
defendants subscribed to an organized
presentation of their views. Thereafter each
defendant was given an opportunity to add further
information on his own behalf.
STATEMENT OF THE GENERAL FACTS
On the basis of the evidence presented during
the hearings, the Council finds the following facts:
At the October 1968 meeting of the Stanford
University Board of Trustees, a student, Yale
Braunstein, Speaker of the Student Legislature,
was permitted to address the board members,
urging them to hold open meetings with students.
The Board Chairman, shortly thereafter, wrote a
letter to Mr. Braunstein, thanking him for his
remarks but not specifically mentioning the issue
of open meetings. Mr. Braunstein replied with a
letter to the Board Chairman emphasizing the
importance of the open-meeting request.
Although at both the November 1968 and January
14, 1969 meetings of the Board, student leaders
were invited to and did sit with a number of Board
committees, the Board made no statement, either
to Mr. Braunstein or the Stanford student body at
large, concerning meetings of the Board itself,
which would be open to members of the Stanford
community.
On the morning of January 14,1969, a group of
students circulated throughout the campus a
document requesting that all interested persons

arrive at Bowman Alumni House at 12:30 p.m. for
the purpose of holding an open meeting with the
trustees. The document contained nine specific
demands regarding the operations of the
University and the Stanford Research Institute.
At approximately 12:30 p.m., when a group of
students had collected at Bowman, they learned
that the trustees were at the Stanford Faculty
Club. The students then held a meeting to
determine what action to take. At about this time
Associate Dean of Students, Willard Wyman,
entered Bowman where one of the students
demanded that Wyman carry a message to the
trustees asking for an open meeting. Although he
made it clear that he was not a "messenger boy"
for the students, Dean Wyman nevertheless did in
fact go to the Faculty Club to tell members of the
University administration, including President
Pitzer, that a group of students at Bowman wished
to have an open meeting with the trustees and
would not leave Bowman until such a meeting was
arranged.
Shortly thereafter Yale Braunstein, who had
observed the meeting at Bowman, and apparently
was concerned that Dean Wyman would not
deliver the message, decided to attempt to
communicate with the Board himself. He went to
the Faculty Club where he met Dean Wyman who
arranged for Braunstein to enter the rooms where
the trustees were located. Mr. Braunstein spoke to
the trustees, stating that the students at Bowman
not only demanded an open meeting but would
consider whatever meeting the trustees did hold to
be an open one. This message was given twice, once
in a room where the bulk of the trustees were
sitting and in an adjacent room where the
Investment Committee was in session.
After delivering this message, Braunstein
immediately withdrew and proceeded to Bowman
where he found the students leaving, en route to
the Faculty Club.
As soon as Braunstein left the trustees, they had
a short discussion and unanimously passed a
motion not to alter their policy which permits
non-trustees to attend Board meetings only upon
express invitation. No effort was made to
communicate this decision to the students.
Shortly thereafter, apparently just prior to
1:00 p.m., the students entered the inner patio of
the Faculty Club. They did so by proceeding up
the outer stairway facing Tresidder Union and
down the inner stairway to the courtyard.
The students gathered in the inner court where
some of them rapped on the sliding glass doors of
the rooms in which the trustees were sitting. The
students shouted and made use of a "bullhorn" to
attract the attention of and communicate with the
trustees inside. Individual students unsuccessfully
attempted to open the sliding doors.
The trustees continued with their business,
attempting as best they could to ignore the
students. A number of the students then entered
the Faculty Club from the patio and congregated
in the hallway outside the rooms where the
trustees were meeting.
From the time that the students entered the
patio, just before 1:00 p.m. until a few minutes
past 2:00 p.m., the students' attempts to attract
the attention of the trustees were intensified by
means of shouting, beating and kicking on the
doors, reading demands through a "bullhorn," etc.
From time to time students attempted to open the
doors from the trustees rooms into the hallway,
but they had been locked from the inside. On
occasion, administrative personnel and waiters
passed through these doors but did so carefully in
order to keep the students out. At one such time a
student in the hallway attempted to force his way
in but personnel inside the room managed to
reclose and lock the door.
Shortly before 2:00 p.m. the Faculty Advisory
Committee on Disruptions sent one of its
members, Professor Clebsch, to speak with
President Pitzer and Chairman of the Board Fuller.
Professor Chebsch reported that the noise inside
the room was so intense that it seriously disturbed
the conduct of the board meeting and made it
virtually impossible for the meeting to continue.
Testimony from persons who were inside the room
at the time supported this statement.
At about 2:00 p.m. the Advisory Committee
informed Dean Wyman that the students were in
violation of the Campus Policy on Disruptions and
requested that he warn them of this and take their
names. Dean Wyman then announced in the
hallway that the Disruption Policy had been
violated and that any students who did not leave
would have their names taken. He did not,
however, identify himself as an official of the
University acting as such. Substantial testimony
indicated that some students in the hallway may
not have heard his statement or known who he
was.
Dean Wyman then proceeded to take the names
of students who remained in the hallway and in the
patio. A number of students did leave and their
names were not recorded; some others who did
remain refused to reveal their identity or gave false
names. As Dean Wyman moved through the
hallway taking names he was subjected to taunts
and occasional threats of violence.
By 2:15 p.m. most of the students who
remained after the warning congregated in the
hallway where they held an informal meeting to
determine their course of action; some students
argued that they should not remain at the Faculty
Club.
While this meeting continued the noise level
subsided substantially.
At about 2:25 p.m. one of the students gained
entrance to the trustees' rooms through one of the
sliding doors from the patio. He moved directly
across the room and opened one of the doors to
the hallway. University personnel within the room
as well as some who were in the hallway attempted
to shut the door but the students in the hallway
moved forward to keep the door open.
At the door the students at first hung back,
shouting that they wanted an open meeting with
the trustees. Their demands were read through a
bullhorn. Meanwhile a line of administrative
officers within the room formed at the open door
to prevent students from gaining entry into the
room.
There ensued a period of confusion with
pushing and shoving taking place both on the part
of the students in the hallway and the personnel
from inside the room. During this time one
University official lost his balance and fell into the
hallway. Some students were shouting and at least
one was so agitated that he uttered a threat to one
of the administrative personnel at the door.
Shortly thereafter the students succeeded in
entering the room. One of the students was highly
agitated and he insulted and threatened the
trustees. At least two students grabbed copies of
the agenda of the trustees meeting and a struggle
ensued between one of these students and
university officials who sought to retrieve the
agenda he had taken.
Some of the students attempted to engage the
trustees in discussion; the trustees cut off their
meeting and left. The students remained in the
room for a short time thereafter and gradually
dispersed of their own volition.

DECISION ON LEGAL ISSUES
At the factual hearing on February 11-13,
1969, the defendants raised several legal
arguments regarding the Policy on Campus
Disruption as follows:
I. That the Policy was no longer in effect on
January 14, 1969, when the alleged acts of
disruption occurred.
11. That paragraph two of the Policy did not
apply because the facts show beyond any doubt
that University officials did not comply with
requirements set out therein, and
111. That paragraph one of the Policy was
inapplicable because it is dependent upon
University official's compliance with the
requirements of paragraph two.
I. Was the Policy in Effect
Validity of the Policy on Disruptions:
A. Nature of the Argument
1. The Policy on Campus Disruption was
issued on October 7, 1968 by Acting President
Robert Glaser.
2. On October 7, 1968, the Legislative and
Judicial Charter of 1968 was not yet in effect.
That charter was submitted to a vote of the
student body which approved its adoption until
March 1, 1969. The vote was completed on
October 15, 1968, and the results were
announced on October 16, 1968.
3. The invalidity of the Policy is based upon
Article I, Sections D(2)(b), D(2)(d), and
D(2)(e), which read as follows:
Section D(2)(b): When in his opinion an
emergency exists that requires the
promulgation of a regulation, including change
or repeal of an existing regulation, in less time
than is required under the procedure set forth
in section D.l, the President of the University
may promulgate an interim regulation to
become effective immediately upon
publication, provided the President shall first
consult with as many members of the SCLC as
practicable and, if time permits, shall first
afford the SCLC an opportunity to act under
section D.2a.
Section D(2)(d): An interim regulation
promulgated by the President under section
D.2b shall remain in effect for 90 days or until
it is repealed or amended by the SCLC,
whichever occurs first.
The SCLC may amend or repeal interim
regulations by the procedure provided in
section D.l or, with the written concurrence of
the President, SCLC may proceed under section
D.2a.
Section D(2)(e): If in the case of an interim
regulation promulgated under section D.2b, 90
days expire with no action by the SCLC, the
President may repromulgate the interim
regulation every 30 days until SCLC acts on it.
He shall inform the SCLC of each
promulgation.
The argument is that the Policy on Campus
Disruption is subject to these provisions of the
Charter and hence expired on January 7, 1968,
some 7 days prior to the time of the alleged
offenses in this case. The policy was never formally
renewed.
B. Analysis
1. The Disruption Policy was clearly
promulgated prior to ratification of the
Charter.
2. The terms of the Charter can in no way be
considered binding on such a policy, since the
Charter distinguishes clearly between those
policies promulgated prior to the Charter and
those promulgated thereafter.
Section I.E of the Charter clearly provides this
as follows:
E. Relation to Present University Policy.
Until such time as the Student Conduct
Legislative Council changes any present
University policy, that policy will remain in
effect. It is recommended that the first order
of business of the SCLC be the consideration
of areas in which there are currently conflicts
of law.
Section lI.D of the Charter obligates this
Council to enforce "present policy" until
altered in the following terms:
D. Relation to University Policy. Each
member of the Stanford Judicial Council is
obligated to enforce the regulations of the
Student Conduct Legislative Council or the
legislative product of the President acting
after consultation with the SCLC as provided
in Article I, section D.2b. Until such time as
the SCLC changes present policy, the SJC will
be obligated in the case of conflicts of law to
enforce the University policy.
3. The policy was terned an "interim" one by
Dr. Glaser at the time of its announcement, as
he clearly hoped for student approval of the
Charter and a subsequent consideration of the
policy by the Student Conduct Legislative
Council. Dr. Glaser's statement was as follows:
The consensus was that the policy should be
issued on an interim basis. Its interim
character is emphasized because we anticipate
further action by appropriate governing
bodies of the faculty and students, and in
particular by the proposed Student Conduct
Legislative Council. Subsequent actions of
these bodies may confirm, amend or
supercede the temporary policy, which will be
in effect until such actions are taken.
Obviously this statement in no way impugns,
but rather affirms the fact that the policy was
promulgated without time limit and was to be
considered in force until such time as the SCLC,
if established, altered that policy.
4. As of January 14, 1969, the SCLC had not
altered the Policy on Disruptions.
C. Holding
The University Policy on Campus Disruption
Issued October 7, 1968, was in full force and effect
on January 14,1969.
11. Does Paragraph 2of
the Policy Apply
A. Nature of the Argument
1. Paragraph 2 of the Policy on Campus
Disruption reads as follows:
Members of the faculty, staff, and student body
have an obligation to leave a university building
or facility when asked to do so in the
furtherance of the above regulations by a
member of the university community acting in
an official role, and identifying himself as such;
members of the faculty, staff, or student body
also have an obligation to identify themselves,
when requested to do so by such a member of
the university community who has reasonable
grounds to believe that the person(s) has
violated section (1) or (2) of this policy and
who has so informed the person(s).
2. Although a general announcement was
made by Dean Wyman that the students in the
Faculty Club had violated the Policy, the
evidence is legally insufficient to show that this
message was heard by any or all of the
defendants.
3. The evidence clearly shows that Dean
Wyman failed to announce that he was "a
member of the university community acting in
an official role," and, furthermore, reveals
conclusively that at least some defendants did
not know him.

4. It is thus argued that the Council can find no
violation of paragraph two of the Policy.
B. Analysis
1. Paragraph two of the Policy is quite clear in
its requirements. Individuals should not be
forced to leave a university building or reveal
their identify until they know that the
individual who requires them to do so is
properly authorized. Otherwise paragraph two
could be an instrument of widespread abuse.
2. It is easy enough for university officials,
once informed of this decision, to comply
strictly with the paragraph two requirements.
The Council finds such strict compliance
necessary even when it might appear that
persons making the request are doing so in their
official capacity.
3. The evidence is clear and uncontradicted
that the requirements of paragraph two of the
Policy were not met.
C. Holding
No defendant shall be held guilty of a violation
of paragraph two of the Policy on Campus
Disruption of October 7,1968.
111. Is Paragraph One of the
Policy Separate from Paragraph Two
A. Nature of the Argument
1. Paragraph one of the Policy states as
follows:
It is a violation of university policy for a
member of the faculty, staff, or student body
to (1) prevent or disrupt the effective carrying
out of a university function or approved
activity, such as lectures, meetings, interviews,
ceremonies, the conduct of university business
in a university office, and public events; (2)
obstruct the legitimate movement of any
person about the campus or in any university
building or facility.
2. Paragraph two of the Policy is in
"furtherance" of paragraph one. Hence, it is
argued that paragraph one is to be enforced
only through paragraph two. Since the
requirements of paragraph two have not been
met, there can be no guilt under the policy.
B. Analysis
1. Paragraph one of the Policy on Campus
Disruption clearly states that certain disruptive
conduct is improper. There is no logical way by
which paragraph one can be considered
dependent upon paragraph two. Otherwise an
individual who engaged in such disruption
could, merely by leaving before being told to do
so, immunize himself from liability under the
Policy. This would be an open invitation for
members of the University community to
engage in "hit-and-run" raids.
2. Paragraph two has an entirely different
focus than does paragrpah one. It is often
necessary to clear a building to prevent
disruption or to end disruption in progress.
Thus persons can be required to leave and their
failure to do so is a violation in and of itself,
apart from any disruption which does in fact
occur.
The required notification of paragraph two is
meaningless with regard to an individual who
has already broken up a lecture or a meeting.
The present case clearly illustrates this point.
Dean Wyman's failure to properly identify
himself eliminates any guilt for mere failure to
leave the building; surely, however, it does not
justify acts of disruption done both before and
after his statements.
As to such acts of disruption if the defendants
did not know Dean Wyman or know that he was
acting in his official capacity, as they
successfully argued regarding II above, what he
said or didn't say was of no relevance.
C. Holding
Paragraph one of the Policy on Campus
Disruption is wholly independent from paragraph
two and failure to comply with the terms of the
latter does not prohibit a charge under the former.
SPECIFIC FINDINGS AS TO GUILT
The Council finds as follows:
1. That in addition to those fourteen students
who admitted disruption, the remaining fifteen
defendants, who received a hearing on the facts,
were guilty of acts that disrupted "the effective
carrying out of a university function," under
the Policy on Campus Disruption of October 7,
1968.
(a) From the time the students first entered
the inner patio at the Faculty Club until
shortly after 2:00 p.m., they attempted to
force the trustees to discontinue their regular
meeting by shouting, pounding on doors and
windows, and making statements through a
bullhorn.
(b) That these acts disrupted the trustees'
meeting is unmistakably clear. Although the
trustees attempted to continue with their
regular business, the noise from outside made
it extremely difficult for them to do so.
(c) That these acts by defendants were
intended to disrupt the trustees' meeting is
also clear. The refusal of the trustees to
acknowledge the presence of the students, the
fact that the trustees shut and locked the
doors, and the fact that entry of the students
into the meeting room was resisted at all times
is substantial evidence that the trustees did
not want or intend to meet with the students
at that time and that the students knew this.
(d) Quite apart from the noisy attempts to
disrupt the trustees' meeting, the actual entry
of the students into the meeting room at
approximately 2:25 to 2:30 p.m., through a
line of university officials who clearly were
attempting to keep them out, itself
constituted a flagrant act of disruption. At
that point, the trustees who were attempting
to deal with items on their regular agenda, had
no choice but to stop what they were doing.
(e) It is clear from the evidence, including the
pictures taken at the scene, that all but one of
the fifteen defendants who requested a
hearing, entered or pushed forward in
attempting to enter the open door of the room
where the trustees were meeting. The
exception is James Johnson and the testimony
regarding Mr. Johnson unmistakably shows
him to have engaged in acts of disruption by
banging and kicking on the locked doors to
the meeting room.
2. That Mr. Richard F. Bogart has no defense
on the ground that he was present as a reporter
for KZSU Radio Station.
(a) An individual who engages in illegal acts is
not immunized merely because he belongs, or
in the present case, has reason to believe he
belongs, to a news organization. By his own
statements Mr. Bogart showed that he was
present as a participant in the demonstration.
(b) The Council finds no credible evidence
sufficient for a finding that Mr. Bogart should
be exonerated as a KZSU reporter. Obviously,
participation by a person in illegal activities
cannot be excused even if that person
ultimately reports upon those activities in the
news media.
(c) Furthermore, the evidence regarding Mr.
Bogart is clearly distinguishable from that
available to the Council regarding other
reporters who were not charged or against

whom charges were brought and then
dismissed. These other persons were in
attendance as assigned reporters or
photographers. They took photographs and
notes for news stories which were published
shortly thereafter, and in doing so they clearly
distinguished themselves from the defendants
who were engaged in the disruption. This is
simply not the case with Mr. Bogart.
FINDINGS REGARDING CULPABILITY
The Council finds as follows:
1. That like the fourteen defendants who
admitted to the charge against them, the
following twelve defendant who received a
hearing on the facts engaged in no acts of
aggravation beyond general disruption:
John W. Avery
Anne C. Bauer
Richard F. Bogart
Marc D. Heller
Virginia A. Linsley
David F. Pugh
George C. Reinhardt
James E. Shoch
Leonard M. Siegel
Michael D. Vawter
Joan Williams (Mrs. Rodney W.)
Rodney W. Williams
2. That in addition to general disruption the
following students engaged in specific
aggravating acts as indicated:
(a) Fred H.Cohen
(1) Threatened a University official who
blocked his entry into the trustees meeting
room by stating words such as "get your
hands off me baby or I'll bust your head,"
upon gaining entry into the room further
threatened the trustees not to meet on the
campus again, and in general was so violent
in his manner that several of hiscodefendants
restrained him, and
(2) Took from inside the room a folder
containing the agenda of the trustees
meeting and placed it under his coat.
(b) James E. Johnson
Violently kicked and beat on the doors and
windows to the trustees' room, with his
heavy boots and with a stick.
(c) Stephen S. Smith
(1) At approximaetely 2:25 p.m. managed
to open one of the sliding glass doors from
the patio into the turstees' room, walked
across that room, and, after a struggle with
several university officials, opened the
doorway to the hall and invited the students
congregated there to come into the room.
[At this point the Council would note the
fact that it was unable to locate any witness
who could testify as to how Mr. Smith
succeeded in opening the door from the
patio into the trustees' room. Mr. Smith was
not called in deference to his privilege
against self-incrimination and he chose not
to testify. The Council does find, however,
the circumstantial evidence is overwhelming
that Mr. Smith entered the room knowing
that it was disruptive for him to do so. This is
clearly shown by his subsequent actions in
immediately attempting to open the door to
the hallway against the will of those
present. ]
(2) Took a folder containing an agenda of
the trustees meeting and refused to return it
at the request of a number of University
personnel who finally were forced to engage
in a struggle with Mr. Smith to retrieve it.
3. That the University administration and the
Board of Trustees failed to make clear to the
defendants what proper channels, if any,
existed for communication between students
on the one hand and the administration and the
Board on the other.
4. That the defendants were strongly
motivated by sincerely held beliefs and felt
frustrated by their apparent inability to state
those beliefs to the Board.
5. That the failure of the University
administration and the Board of Trustees to
develop and maintain methods for the orderly
exchange of views with the student body
regarding issues relevant to the University was a
contributing factor of the disruption.
6. That the defendants in the present case were
less interested in the orderly exchange of views
than they were in the imposition of their views
on the rest of the community.

necessary to avoid undue financial hardship.
(b) Provided, however, that in no event shall a
university degree be awarded to any

due.
Analysis of the Recommendations on Penalty
1. The Council's recommendations as to
penalty are based on a total view of the
defendants' conduct in light of the Council's
desire, as set forth in its Rules, to utilize
penalties to strengthen the Stanford
community.
2. The penalties would have been more severe
had the defendants been aware of the existence
of a reasonably means by which to make their
views known to the Board of Trustees.
3. At the same time, however, the Council
considered the offense to be a very serious one
that must not be repeated. If every member of
the Stanford community who feels strongly
about an issue is permitted to disrupt the
campus to impose his views on others, the result
would be chaos. Indeed such actions are
counterproductive in that they tend to
eliminate opportunity for legitimate discussion
and resolution of vital issues.
4. The Council's imposition of periods of
probation takes into consideration the threat
by defendants, made at the motivational
hearing, to engage in further serious acts of
disruption. The Council takes the position that
if during the period of probation any defendant
carries out such a threat, and is duly convicted
thereof, the University community has the
right to insist upon his suspension.
5. The Council views as most serious those acts
which, directly or by implication, threaten
violence to any person. Fortunately, in the
present case no one was injured and there was

no serious damage to property. Nevertheless, a
real danger of personal injury exists when
persons ostensibly engaged in a demonstration
to present their views, lose their tempers or
engage in physical altercations. The penalties to
three individuals reflect the Council's position,
based on clear evidence, that in varying degrees,
these individuals materially increased the
danger of physical violence and personal injury.
6. In order that the University community not
be misled, the Council wishes to make clear that
its decision in this case was not based on the
military draft policy of the United States or on
the draft status of any of the defendants.
Findingson Collateral Matters
The Council finds as follows:
1. That in light of the fact that every defendant
was clearly in violation of the Policy on Campus
Disruption of October 7, 1968, which policy
was valid and in force, the Council feels it
unnecessary to determine whether or not the
defendants were also in violation of the
Fundamental Standard. The answer to this
question would in no way affect the penalties
imposed.
2. That student witnesses have the obligation
to testify when called before the Council.
(a) In the present case a student was called to
testify as to events he observed at the Faculty
Club at the time of the disruption. He claimed
that he had been present as a reporter for the
Stanford Daily and therefore he was privileged
not to testify.
(b) The Council subpoenaed this witness
because he was known to have been present
and it was felt that defendants might have
wished to elicit information from him. The
defendants declined to ask him questions and
he was excused.
(c) The Council at that time, however, and
now, holds that the claimed privilege does not
exist, that it has not been recognized by the
courts of the land, that there is no justification
for such a privilege, and that the refusal to

testify on such grounds cannot and will not be
tolerated. [This in no way, however, governs
the Council's attitude toward the privilege of a
reporter not to reveal the name of a
confidential informant, which privilege has
both been recognized and rejected in various
courts. 1
3. That persons who attend a hearing of the
Stanford Judicial Council, including the
defendants and their counsel, have an
obligation not to impede, disrupt, or in any
manner interfere with the conduct of the
proceedings.
(a) A number of persons who attended the
factual hearing, particularly on the first night,
in obvious support of the defendants,
deliberately attempted to disrupt the
proceedings and did, in fact, cause
considerably noise and confusion.
(b) The Council is not a court of law; it has no
bailiff or sheriff's department to maintain
order. Thus any handful of persons, who are
so inclined can seriously impede the
proceedings.
(c) The defendants themselves, and their
counsel, must share the blame for the
disorder, particularly during the first night.
They continually directed their comments to
their supporters in the audience rather than to
the members of the Council and they
attempted in numerous ways, including the
muttering of threats, to ridicule the Council
and to make its job impossible. All this was
done in spite of the Council's solemn promise,
duly kept, that they would be given an
opportunity at the hearings on motivatioto
say what they so desired about the basic issues
underlying their actions.
The Council does note that the defendants did
intercede during the most serious disruptions
to assist the Council, primarily to prevent the
Council from closing the hearings, and that
after the first night of the hearings, the
defendants were more restrained. Moreover,

the Council recognizes and appreciates the
efforts of Mr. Doron Weinberg, who, as sole
counsel after the first and second evenings,
assisted in maintaining order and preserving
the decorum of the proceedings.
(d) On the basis of its experience in this case,
regarding meetings that are open to the
general public, the Council will seriously
consider in future cases limiting the number of
persons in attendance. Furthermore, the
Council serves warning on those who would
disrupt future proceedings that the Council is
disposed to find in contempt persons who
engage in disruption of its proceedings and to
recommend immediate imposition of severe
sanctions.
4. That defendant Jack Gerson, who
apparently withdrew from the University
subsequent to January 14, 1969, but prior to
the hearings in this case, has failed to respond to
summonses from the Council duly served upon
him.
The Council recommends that, in accordance
with the Legislative and Judicial Charter of
1968, the University immediately withdraw
Mr. Gerson's registration privileges until such
time as he appears before the Council for the
trial of his case.
THIS DECISION AND ALL ITS PARTS ARE
UNANIMOUSLY ADOPTED BY THE
MEMBERS OF THE COUNCIL.
Dated: February 27, 1969
Editor's Note: The Judicial Council's reference
to "the faculty advisory Committee on
Disruptions" is, in fact, the President's advisory
group on campus disruptions. After hearing from
members of this group. President Pitzer informed
Dean Wyman that the students were believed to be
in violation of the campus policy on disruptions.
The faculty members did not instruct Wyman
directly.
Incremental costs for publication of this report
have been paid for the the Stanford Newsservice.
STATEMENT OF THE PROCEEDINGS
On January 15, 1969, the Stanford Judicial
Council was notified by the office of the Dean of
Students that on the previous day a group of
persons, believed primarily to be Stanford
students, had allegedly disrupted a meeting of the
University Board of Trustees which had been held
at the Stanford Faculty Club. The Council was
asked to investigate.
Pursuant to the Legislative and Judicial Charter
of 1968, the Council sent out five judicial aides to
investigate and interview witnesses. The judicial
aides made a comprehensive report to the Council
which included photographs, lists of witnesses and
participants, transcripts of tape-recorded
interviews of many persons, and additional
statements, including those of a number of
potential defendants.
At the Council's behest, the Chairman
examined the report and, on the basis of the
information therein, determined to call before
him, and one other member of the Council sitting
with him, some thirty-nine persons for the purpose
of charging them with violations of the Campus
Policy on Disruptions of October 7, 1968, and of
the Fundamental Standard, and to show each the
evidence the Council had obtained through its
judicial aides regarding his activities.
The letter summoning these persons was sent
by mail; in addition a copy of the letter was
personally served on each of them. The letter
contained the following:
(1) A statement that the person was charged
with violations of the Disruption Policy and
of the Fundamental Standard.
(2) An outline of proceedings to be followed
during trial of the case.
(3) A copy of the Council's rules containing
the rights of defendants as set out in the
Legislative and Judicial Charter of 1968.
(4) A date and time to appear before the
Chairman of the Council for a conference.
Each person summoned duly appeared with the
sole exception of Jack Gerson, who has at no time
appeared or taken part in these proceedings.
The Council Chairman, sitting with at least one
other member of the Council, showed each
defendant the evidence regarding his activities and
explained to each defendant the procedure to be
followed for trial. That procedure required a
bifurcated hearing. The first hearing would be
designed solely to determine what acts each
student had, or had not committed; the second
hearing would be devoted solely to matters of
motivation.
With but one exception, Fred Cohen, who was
also charged with acts of intimidation, each
student, for purposes of the present hearings, was
charged only with having disrupted the Board of
Trustees meeting; no specific acts of violence,
threats, etc. were alleged. [Defendant James
Johnson was also charged with having set a false
fire alarm but all hearings on this charge were
suspended pending decision on such a charge in the
county civil courts. ]
Every defendant was given an opportunity to
admit to the charge against him. He was told that
to do so would eliminate the need for the first
hearing in his case, but that he would still be
permitted to do three things;
(1) Take part in the motivational hearing.
(2) Argue the invalidity of the Campus Policy
on Disruptions.
(3) Argue that the Fundamental Standard does
not cover disruption without a showing of
specific acts such as violence, threats,
blocking access of other persons, etc.
Each student was further informed that any
specific facts regarding his individual conduct
which were brought out during a fact hearing
would be considered by the Council in deciding his
case.
Although defendants were told they had a right
to remain silent, many wished to discuss the nature
of their participation. On the basis of their
statements and the Council's continuing
investigation of the case, charges were withdrawn
against nine persons. Of the remaining twenty-nine
defendants, the following twelve initially decided
to admit to the charges against them:
Allen Christelow
Richard Greenspan
HallamC. Hamilton
Carolyn M. Iverson
Barbara E. Lee
Michael M. Morton
Christine M. Mrak
Jeffrey J. Preefer
Guy D. Smyth
Don P. Stuart
D. Jeffrey Weil
Helen K. Williams
Thereafter, two additional students, Irwin
Busse and Marc Weiss, also decided to admit the
charges against them. Thus, when the case
proceeded to the first hearing, only the following
fifteen students were involved:
John W. Avery
Anne C. Bauer
Richard F. Bogart
Fred H. Cohen
Marc D. Heller
James E. Johnson
Virginia A. Linsley
David F. Pugh
George C. Reinhardt
James E. Shoch
Leonard M. Siegel
Stephen S. Smith
Michael D. Vawter
Joan Williams (Mrs. Rodney W.)
Rodney W. Williams
This factual hearing was open to the public and
took place on February 11, 12 and 13.
Considerable evidence was received, including the
testimony of some 24 witnesses.
The motivational hearing, also open to the
public, was held on February 21. All twenty-nine
defendants subscribed to an organized
presentation of their views. Thereafter each
defendant was given an opportunity to add further
information on his own behalf.
STATEMENT OF THE GENERAL FACTS
On the basis of the evidence presented during
the hearings, the Council finds the following facts:
At the October 1968 meeting of the Stanford
University Board of Trustees, a student, Yale
Braunstein, Speaker of the Student Legislature,
was permitted to address the board members,
urging them to hold open meetings with students.
The Board Chairman, shortly thereafter, wrote a
letter to Mr. Braunstein, thanking him for his
remarks but not specifically mentioning the issue
of open meetings. Mr. Braunstein replied with a
letter to the Board Chairman emphasizing the
importance of the open-meeting request.
Although at both the November 1968 and January
14, 1969 meetings of the Board, student leaders
were invited to and did sit with a number of Board
committees, the Board made no statement, either
to Mr. Braunstein or the Stanford student body at
large, concerning meetings of the Board itself,
which would be open to members of the Stanford
community.
On the morning of January 14,1969, a group of
students circulated throughout the campus a
document requesting that all interested persons

arrive at Bowman Alumni House at 12:30 p.m. for
the purpose of holding an open meeting with the
trustees. The document contained nine specific
demands regarding the operations of the
University and the Stanford Research Institute.
At approximately 12:30 p.m., when a group of
students had collected at Bowman, they learned
that the trustees were at the Stanford Faculty
Club. The students then held a meeting to
determine what action to take. At about this time
Associate Dean of Students, Willard Wyman,
entered Bowman where one of the students
demanded that Wyman carry a message to the
trustees asking for an open meeting. Although he
made it clear that he was not a "messenger boy"
for the students, Dean Wyman nevertheless did in
fact go to the Faculty Club to tell members of the
University administration, including President
Pitzer, that a group of students at Bowman wished
to have an open meeting with the trustees and
would not leave Bowman until such a meeting was
arranged.
Shortly thereafter Yale Braunstein, who had
observed the meeting at Bowman, and apparently
was concerned that Dean Wyman would not
deliver the message, decided to attempt to
communicate with the Board himself. He went to
the Faculty Club where he met Dean Wyman who
arranged for Braunstein to enter the rooms where
the trustees were located. Mr. Braunstein spoke to
the trustees, stating that the students at Bowman
not only demanded an open meeting but would
consider whatever meeting the trustees did hold to
be an open one. This message was given twice, once
in a room where the bulk of the trustees were
sitting and in an adjacent room where the
Investment Committee was in session.
After delivering this message, Braunstein
immediately withdrew and proceeded to Bowman
where he found the students leaving, en route to
the Faculty Club.
As soon as Braunstein left the trustees, they had
a short discussion and unanimously passed a
motion not to alter their policy which permits
non-trustees to attend Board meetings only upon
express invitation. No effort was made to
communicate this decision to the students.
Shortly thereafter, apparently just prior to
1:00 p.m., the students entered the inner patio of
the Faculty Club. They did so by proceeding up
the outer stairway facing Tresidder Union and
down the inner stairway to the courtyard.
The students gathered in the inner court where
some of them rapped on the sliding glass doors of
the rooms in which the trustees were sitting. The
students shouted and made use of a "bullhorn" to
attract the attention of and communicate with the
trustees inside. Individual students unsuccessfully
attempted to open the sliding doors.
The trustees continued with their business,
attempting as best they could to ignore the
students. A number of the students then entered
the Faculty Club from the patio and congregated
in the hallway outside the rooms where the
trustees were meeting.
From the time that the students entered the
patio, just before 1:00 p.m. until a few minutes
past 2:00 p.m., the students' attempts to attract
the attention of the trustees were intensified by
means of shouting, beating and kicking on the
doors, reading demands through a "bullhorn," etc.
From time to time students attempted to open the
doors from the trustees rooms into the hallway,
but they had been locked from the inside. On
occasion, administrative personnel and waiters
passed through these doors but did so carefully in
order to keep the students out. At one such time a
student in the hallway attempted to force his way
in but personnel inside the room managed to
reclose and lock the door.
Shortly before 2:00 p.m. the Faculty Advisory
Committee on Disruptions sent one of its
members, Professor Clebsch, to speak with
President Pitzer and Chairman of the Board Fuller.
Professor Chebsch reported that the noise inside
the room was so intense that it seriously disturbed
the conduct of the board meeting and made it
virtually impossible for the meeting to continue.
Testimony from persons who were inside the room
at the time supported this statement.
At about 2:00 p.m. the Advisory Committee
informed Dean Wyman that the students were in
violation of the Campus Policy on Disruptions and
requested that he warn them of this and take their
names. Dean Wyman then announced in the
hallway that the Disruption Policy had been
violated and that any students who did not leave
would have their names taken. He did not,
however, identify himself as an official of the
University acting as such. Substantial testimony
indicated that some students in the hallway may
not have heard his statement or known who he
was.
Dean Wyman then proceeded to take the names
of students who remained in the hallway and in the
patio. A number of students did leave and their
names were not recorded; some others who did
remain refused to reveal their identity or gave false
names. As Dean Wyman moved through the
hallway taking names he was subjected to taunts
and occasional threats of violence.
By 2:15 p.m. most of the students who
remained after the warning congregated in the
hallway where they held an informal meeting to
determine their course of action; some students
argued that they should not remain at the Faculty
Club.
While this meeting continued the noise level
subsided substantially.
At about 2:25 p.m. one of the students gained
entrance to the trustees' rooms through one of the
sliding doors from the patio. He moved directly
across the room and opened one of the doors to
the hallway. University personnel within the room
as well as some who were in the hallway attempted
to shut the door but the students in the hallway
moved forward to keep the door open.
At the door the students at first hung back,
shouting that they wanted an open meeting with
the trustees. Their demands were read through a
bullhorn. Meanwhile a line of administrative
officers within the room formed at the open door
to prevent students from gaining entry into the
room.
There ensued a period of confusion with
pushing and shoving taking place both on the part
of the students in the hallway and the personnel
from inside the room. During this time one
University official lost his balance and fell into the
hallway. Some students were shouting and at least
one was so agitated that he uttered a threat to one
of the administrative personnel at the door.
Shortly thereafter the students succeeded in
entering the room. One of the students was highly
agitated and he insulted and threatened the
trustees. At least two students grabbed copies of
the agenda of the trustees meeting and a struggle
ensued between one of these students and
university officials who sought to retrieve the
agenda he had taken.
Some of the students attempted to engage the
trustees in discussion; the trustees cut off their
meeting and left. The students remained in the
room for a short time thereafter and gradually
dispersed of their own volition.

DECISION ON LEGAL ISSUES
At the factual hearing on February 11-13,
1969, the defendants raised several legal
arguments regarding the Policy on Campus
Disruption as follows:
I. That the Policy was no longer in effect on
January 14, 1969, when the alleged acts of
disruption occurred.
11. That paragraph two of the Policy did not
apply because the facts show beyond any doubt
that University officials did not comply with
requirements set out therein, and
111. That paragraph one of the Policy was
inapplicable because it is dependent upon
University official's compliance with the
requirements of paragraph two.
I. Was the Policy in Effect
Validity of the Policy on Disruptions:
A. Nature of the Argument
1. The Policy on Campus Disruption was
issued on October 7, 1968 by Acting President
Robert Glaser.
2. On October 7, 1968, the Legislative and
Judicial Charter of 1968 was not yet in effect.
That charter was submitted to a vote of the
student body which approved its adoption until
March 1, 1969. The vote was completed on
October 15, 1968, and the results were
announced on October 16, 1968.
3. The invalidity of the Policy is based upon
Article I, Sections D(2)(b), D(2)(d), and
D(2)(e), which read as follows:
Section D(2)(b): When in his opinion an
emergency exists that requires the
promulgation of a regulation, including change
or repeal of an existing regulation, in less time
than is required under the procedure set forth
in section D.l, the President of the University
may promulgate an interim regulation to
become effective immediately upon
publication, provided the President shall first
consult with as many members of the SCLC as
practicable and, if time permits, shall first
afford the SCLC an opportunity to act under
section D.2a.
Section D(2)(d): An interim regulation
promulgated by the President under section
D.2b shall remain in effect for 90 days or until
it is repealed or amended by the SCLC,
whichever occurs first.
The SCLC may amend or repeal interim
regulations by the procedure provided in
section D.l or, with the written concurrence of
the President, SCLC may proceed under section
D.2a.
Section D(2)(e): If in the case of an interim
regulation promulgated under section D.2b, 90
days expire with no action by the SCLC, the
President may repromulgate the interim
regulation every 30 days until SCLC acts on it.
He shall inform the SCLC of each
promulgation.
The argument is that the Policy on Campus
Disruption is subject to these provisions of the
Charter and hence expired on January 7, 1968,
some 7 days prior to the time of the alleged
offenses in this case. The policy was never formally
renewed.
B. Analysis
1. The Disruption Policy was clearly
promulgated prior to ratification of the
Charter.
2. The terms of the Charter can in no way be
considered binding on such a policy, since the
Charter distinguishes clearly between those
policies promulgated prior to the Charter and
those promulgated thereafter.
Section I.E of the Charter clearly provides this
as follows:
E. Relation to Present University Policy.
Until such time as the Student Conduct
Legislative Council changes any present
University policy, that policy will remain in
effect. It is recommended that the first order
of business of the SCLC be the consideration
of areas in which there are currently conflicts
of law.
Section lI.D of the Charter obligates this
Council to enforce "present policy" until
altered in the following terms:
D. Relation to University Policy. Each
member of the Stanford Judicial Council is
obligated to enforce the regulations of the
Student Conduct Legislative Council or the
legislative product of the President acting
after consultation with the SCLC as provided
in Article I, section D.2b. Until such time as
the SCLC changes present policy, the SJC will
be obligated in the case of conflicts of law to
enforce the University policy.
3. The policy was terned an "interim" one by
Dr. Glaser at the time of its announcement, as
he clearly hoped for student approval of the
Charter and a subsequent consideration of the
policy by the Student Conduct Legislative
Council. Dr. Glaser's statement was as follows:
The consensus was that the policy should be
issued on an interim basis. Its interim
character is emphasized because we anticipate
further action by appropriate governing
bodies of the faculty and students, and in
particular by the proposed Student Conduct
Legislative Council. Subsequent actions of
these bodies may confirm, amend or
supercede the temporary policy, which will be
in effect until such actions are taken.
Obviously this statement in no way impugns,
but rather affirms the fact that the policy was
promulgated without time limit and was to be
considered in force until such time as the SCLC,
if established, altered that policy.
4. As of January 14, 1969, the SCLC had not
altered the Policy on Disruptions.
C. Holding
The University Policy on Campus Disruption
Issued October 7, 1968, was in full force and effect
on January 14,1969.
11. Does Paragraph 2of
the Policy Apply
A. Nature of the Argument
1. Paragraph 2 of the Policy on Campus
Disruption reads as follows:
Members of the faculty, staff, and student body
have an obligation to leave a university building
or facility when asked to do so in the
furtherance of the above regulations by a
member of the university community acting in
an official role, and identifying himself as such;
members of the faculty, staff, or student body
also have an obligation to identify themselves,
when requested to do so by such a member of
the university community who has reasonable
grounds to believe that the person(s) has
violated section (1) or (2) of this policy and
who has so informed the person(s).
2. Although a general announcement was
made by Dean Wyman that the students in the
Faculty Club had violated the Policy, the
evidence is legally insufficient to show that this
message was heard by any or all of the
defendants.
3. The evidence clearly shows that Dean
Wyman failed to announce that he was "a
member of the university community acting in
an official role," and, furthermore, reveals
conclusively that at least some defendants did
not know him.

4. It is thus argued that the Council can find no
violation of paragraph two of the Policy.
B. Analysis
1. Paragraph two of the Policy is quite clear in
its requirements. Individuals should not be
forced to leave a university building or reveal
their identify until they know that the
individual who requires them to do so is
properly authorized. Otherwise paragraph two
could be an instrument of widespread abuse.
2. It is easy enough for university officials,
once informed of this decision, to comply
strictly with the paragraph two requirements.
The Council finds such strict compliance
necessary even when it might appear that
persons making the request are doing so in their
official capacity.
3. The evidence is clear and uncontradicted
that the requirements of paragraph two of the
Policy were not met.
C. Holding
No defendant shall be held guilty of a violation
of paragraph two of the Policy on Campus
Disruption of October 7,1968.
111. Is Paragraph One of the
Policy Separate from Paragraph Two
A. Nature of the Argument
1. Paragraph one of the Policy states as
follows:
It is a violation of university policy for a
member of the faculty, staff, or student body
to (1) prevent or disrupt the effective carrying
out of a university function or approved
activity, such as lectures, meetings, interviews,
ceremonies, the conduct of university business
in a university office, and public events; (2)
obstruct the legitimate movement of any
person about the campus or in any university
building or facility.
2. Paragraph two of the Policy is in
"furtherance" of paragraph one. Hence, it is
argued that paragraph one is to be enforced
only through paragraph two. Since the
requirements of paragraph two have not been
met, there can be no guilt under the policy.
B. Analysis
1. Paragraph one of the Policy on Campus
Disruption clearly states that certain disruptive
conduct is improper. There is no logical way by
which paragraph one can be considered
dependent upon paragraph two. Otherwise an
individual who engaged in such disruption
could, merely by leaving before being told to do
so, immunize himself from liability under the
Policy. This would be an open invitation for
members of the University community to
engage in "hit-and-run" raids.
2. Paragraph two has an entirely different
focus than does paragrpah one. It is often
necessary to clear a building to prevent
disruption or to end disruption in progress.
Thus persons can be required to leave and their
failure to do so is a violation in and of itself,
apart from any disruption which does in fact
occur.
The required notification of paragraph two is
meaningless with regard to an individual who
has already broken up a lecture or a meeting.
The present case clearly illustrates this point.
Dean Wyman's failure to properly identify
himself eliminates any guilt for mere failure to
leave the building; surely, however, it does not
justify acts of disruption done both before and
after his statements.
As to such acts of disruption if the defendants
did not know Dean Wyman or know that he was
acting in his official capacity, as they
successfully argued regarding II above, what he
said or didn't say was of no relevance.
C. Holding
Paragraph one of the Policy on Campus
Disruption is wholly independent from paragraph
two and failure to comply with the terms of the
latter does not prohibit a charge under the former.
SPECIFIC FINDINGS AS TO GUILT
The Council finds as follows:
1. That in addition to those fourteen students
who admitted disruption, the remaining fifteen
defendants, who received a hearing on the facts,
were guilty of acts that disrupted "the effective
carrying out of a university function," under
the Policy on Campus Disruption of October 7,
1968.
(a) From the time the students first entered
the inner patio at the Faculty Club until
shortly after 2:00 p.m., they attempted to
force the trustees to discontinue their regular
meeting by shouting, pounding on doors and
windows, and making statements through a
bullhorn.
(b) That these acts disrupted the trustees'
meeting is unmistakably clear. Although the
trustees attempted to continue with their
regular business, the noise from outside made
it extremely difficult for them to do so.
(c) That these acts by defendants were
intended to disrupt the trustees' meeting is
also clear. The refusal of the trustees to
acknowledge the presence of the students, the
fact that the trustees shut and locked the
doors, and the fact that entry of the students
into the meeting room was resisted at all times
is substantial evidence that the trustees did
not want or intend to meet with the students
at that time and that the students knew this.
(d) Quite apart from the noisy attempts to
disrupt the trustees' meeting, the actual entry
of the students into the meeting room at
approximately 2:25 to 2:30 p.m., through a
line of university officials who clearly were
attempting to keep them out, itself
constituted a flagrant act of disruption. At
that point, the trustees who were attempting
to deal with items on their regular agenda, had
no choice but to stop what they were doing.
(e) It is clear from the evidence, including the
pictures taken at the scene, that all but one of
the fifteen defendants who requested a
hearing, entered or pushed forward in
attempting to enter the open door of the room
where the trustees were meeting. The
exception is James Johnson and the testimony
regarding Mr. Johnson unmistakably shows
him to have engaged in acts of disruption by
banging and kicking on the locked doors to
the meeting room.
2. That Mr. Richard F. Bogart has no defense
on the ground that he was present as a reporter
for KZSU Radio Station.
(a) An individual who engages in illegal acts is
not immunized merely because he belongs, or
in the present case, has reason to believe he
belongs, to a news organization. By his own
statements Mr. Bogart showed that he was
present as a participant in the demonstration.
(b) The Council finds no credible evidence
sufficient for a finding that Mr. Bogart should
be exonerated as a KZSU reporter. Obviously,
participation by a person in illegal activities
cannot be excused even if that person
ultimately reports upon those activities in the
news media.
(c) Furthermore, the evidence regarding Mr.
Bogart is clearly distinguishable from that
available to the Council regarding other
reporters who were not charged or against

whom charges were brought and then
dismissed. These other persons were in
attendance as assigned reporters or
photographers. They took photographs and
notes for news stories which were published
shortly thereafter, and in doing so they clearly
distinguished themselves from the defendants
who were engaged in the disruption. This is
simply not the case with Mr. Bogart.
FINDINGS REGARDING CULPABILITY
The Council finds as follows:
1. That like the fourteen defendants who
admitted to the charge against them, the
following twelve defendant who received a
hearing on the facts engaged in no acts of
aggravation beyond general disruption:
John W. Avery
Anne C. Bauer
Richard F. Bogart
Marc D. Heller
Virginia A. Linsley
David F. Pugh
George C. Reinhardt
James E. Shoch
Leonard M. Siegel
Michael D. Vawter
Joan Williams (Mrs. Rodney W.)
Rodney W. Williams
2. That in addition to general disruption the
following students engaged in specific
aggravating acts as indicated:
(a) Fred H.Cohen
(1) Threatened a University official who
blocked his entry into the trustees meeting
room by stating words such as "get your
hands off me baby or I'll bust your head,"
upon gaining entry into the room further
threatened the trustees not to meet on the
campus again, and in general was so violent
in his manner that several of hiscodefendants
restrained him, and
(2) Took from inside the room a folder
containing the agenda of the trustees
meeting and placed it under his coat.
(b) James E. Johnson
Violently kicked and beat on the doors and
windows to the trustees' room, with his
heavy boots and with a stick.
(c) Stephen S. Smith
(1) At approximaetely 2:25 p.m. managed
to open one of the sliding glass doors from
the patio into the turstees' room, walked
across that room, and, after a struggle with
several university officials, opened the
doorway to the hall and invited the students
congregated there to come into the room.
[At this point the Council would note the
fact that it was unable to locate any witness
who could testify as to how Mr. Smith
succeeded in opening the door from the
patio into the trustees' room. Mr. Smith was
not called in deference to his privilege
against self-incrimination and he chose not
to testify. The Council does find, however,
the circumstantial evidence is overwhelming
that Mr. Smith entered the room knowing
that it was disruptive for him to do so. This is
clearly shown by his subsequent actions in
immediately attempting to open the door to
the hallway against the will of those
present. ]
(2) Took a folder containing an agenda of
the trustees meeting and refused to return it
at the request of a number of University
personnel who finally were forced to engage
in a struggle with Mr. Smith to retrieve it.
3. That the University administration and the
Board of Trustees failed to make clear to the
defendants what proper channels, if any,
existed for communication between students
on the one hand and the administration and the
Board on the other.
4. That the defendants were strongly
motivated by sincerely held beliefs and felt
frustrated by their apparent inability to state
those beliefs to the Board.
5. That the failure of the University
administration and the Board of Trustees to
develop and maintain methods for the orderly
exchange of views with the student body
regarding issues relevant to the University was a
contributing factor of the disruption.
6. That the defendants in the present case were
less interested in the orderly exchange of views
than they were in the imposition of their views
on the rest of the community.

postpone payment of any sum when it appears
necessary to avoid undue financial hardship.
(b) Provided, however, that in no event shall a
university degree be awarded to any
defendant until he has paid the full amount
due.
Analysis of the Recommendations on Penalty
1. The Council's recommendations as to
penalty are based on a total view of the
defendants' conduct in light of the Council's
desire, as set forth in its Rules, to utilize
penalties to strengthen the Stanford
community.
2. The penalties would have been more severe
had the defendants been aware of the existence
of a reasonably means by which to make their
views known to the Board of Trustees.
3. At the same time, however, the Council
considered the offense to be a very serious one
that must not be repeated. If every member of
the Stanford community who feels strongly
about an issue is permitted to disrupt the
campus to impose his views on others, the result
would be chaos. Indeed such actions are
counterproductive in that they tend to
eliminate opportunity for legitimate discussion
and resolution of vital issues.
4. The Council's imposition of periods of
probation takes into consideration the threat
by defendants, made at the motivational
hearing, to engage in further serious acts of
disruption. The Council takes the position that
if during the period of probation any defendant
carries out such a threat, and is duly convicted
thereof, the University community has the
right to insist upon his suspension.
5. The Council views as most serious those acts
which, directly or by implication, threaten
violence to any person. Fortunately, in the
present case no one was injured and there was

no serious damage to property. Nevertheless, a
real danger of personal injury exists when
persons ostensibly engaged in a demonstration
to present their views, lose their tempers or
engage in physical altercations. The penalties to
three individuals reflect the Council's position,
based on clear evidence, that in varying degrees,
these individuals materially increased the
danger of physical violence and personal injury.
6. In order that the University community not
be misled, the Council wishes to make clear that
its decision in this case was not based on the
military draft policy of the United States or on
the draft status of any of the defendants.
Findingson Collateral Matters
The Council finds as follows:
1. That in light of the fact that every defendant
was clearly in violation of the Policy on Campus
Disruption of October 7, 1968, which policy
was valid and in force, the Council feels it
unnecessary to determine whether or not the
defendants were also in violation of the
Fundamental Standard. The answer to this
question would in no way affect the penalties
imposed.
2. That student witnesses have the obligation
to testify when called before the Council.
(a) In the present case a student was called to
testify as to events he observed at the Faculty
Club at the time of the disruption. He claimed
that he had been present as a reporter for the
Stanford Daily and therefore he was privileged
not to testify.
(b) The Council subpoenaed this witness
because he was known to have been present
and it was felt that defendants might have
wished to elicit information from him. The
defendants declined to ask him questions and
he was excused.
(c) The Council at that time, however, and
now, holds that the claimed privilege does not
exist, that it has not been recognized by the
courts of the land, that there is no justification
for such a privilege, and that the refusal to

testify on such grounds cannot and will not be
tolerated. [This in no way, however, governs
the Council's attitude toward the privilege of a
reporter not to reveal the name of a
confidential informant, which privilege has
both been recognized and rejected in various
courts. 1
3. That persons who attend a hearing of the
Stanford Judicial Council, including the
defendants and their counsel, have an
obligation not to impede, disrupt, or in any
manner interfere with the conduct of the
proceedings.
(a) A number of persons who attended the
factual hearing, particularly on the first night,
in obvious support of the defendants,
deliberately attempted to disrupt the
proceedings and did, in fact, cause
considerably noise and confusion.
(b) The Council is not a court of law; it has no
bailiff or sheriff's department to maintain
order. Thus any handful of persons, who are
so inclined can seriously impede the
proceedings.
(c) The defendants themselves, and their
counsel, must share the blame for the
disorder, particularly during the first night.
They continually directed their comments to
their supporters in the audience rather than to
the members of the Council and they
attempted in numerous ways, including the
muttering of threats, to ridicule the Council
and to make its job impossible. All this was
done in spite of the Council's solemn promise,
duly kept, that they would be given an
opportunity at the hearings on motivatioto
say what they so desired about the basic issues
underlying their actions.
The Council does note that the defendants did
intercede during the most serious disruptions
to assist the Council, primarily to prevent the
Council from closing the hearings, and that
after the first night of the hearings, the
defendants were more restrained. Moreover,

the Council recognizes and appreciates the
efforts of Mr. Doron Weinberg, who, as sole
counsel after the first and second evenings,
assisted in maintaining order and preserving
the decorum of the proceedings.
(d) On the basis of its experience in this case,
regarding meetings that are open to the
general public, the Council will seriously
consider in future cases limiting the number of
persons in attendance. Furthermore, the
Council serves warning on those who would
disrupt future proceedings that the Council is
disposed to find in contempt persons who
engage in disruption of its proceedings and to
recommend immediate imposition of severe
sanctions.
4. That defendant Jack Gerson, who
apparently withdrew from the University
subsequent to January 14, 1969, but prior to
the hearings in this case, has failed to respond to
summonses from the Council duly served upon
him.
The Council recommends that, in accordance
with the Legislative and Judicial Charter of
1968, the University immediately withdraw
Mr. Gerson's registration privileges until such
time as he appears before the Council for the
trial of his case.
THIS DECISION AND ALL ITS PARTS ARE
UNANIMOUSLY ADOPTED BY THE
MEMBERS OF THE COUNCIL.
Dated: February 27, 1969
Editor's Note: The Judicial Council's reference
to "the faculty advisory Committee on
Disruptions" is, in fact, the President's advisory
group on campus disruptions. After hearing from
members of this group. President Pitzer informed
Dean Wyman that the students were believed to be
in violation of the campus policy on disruptions.
The faculty members did not instruct Wyman
directly.
Incremental costs for publication of this report
have been paid for the the Stanford Newsservice.
STATEMENT OF THE PROCEEDINGS
On January 15, 1969, the Stanford Judicial
Council was notified by the office of the Dean of
Students that on the previous day a group of
persons, believed primarily to be Stanford
students, had allegedly disrupted a meeting of the
University Board of Trustees which had been held
at the Stanford Faculty Club. The Council was
asked to investigate.
Pursuant to the Legislative and Judicial Charter
of 1968, the Council sent out five judicial aides to
investigate and interview witnesses. The judicial
aides made a comprehensive report to the Council
which included photographs, lists of witnesses and
participants, transcripts of tape-recorded
interviews of many persons, and additional
statements, including those of a number of
potential defendants.
At the Council's behest, the Chairman
examined the report and, on the basis of the
information therein, determined to call before
him, and one other member of the Council sitting
with him, some thirty-nine persons for the purpose
of charging them with violations of the Campus
Policy on Disruptions of October 7, 1968, and of
the Fundamental Standard, and to show each the
evidence the Council had obtained through its
judicial aides regarding his activities.
The letter summoning these persons was sent
by mail; in addition a copy of the letter was
personally served on each of them. The letter
contained the following:
(1) A statement that the person was charged
with violations of the Disruption Policy and
of the Fundamental Standard.
(2) An outline of proceedings to be followed
during trial of the case.
(3) A copy of the Council's rules containing
the rights of defendants as set out in the
Legislative and Judicial Charter of 1968.
(4) A date and time to appear before the
Chairman of the Council for a conference.
Each person summoned duly appeared with the
sole exception of Jack Gerson, who has at no time
appeared or taken part in these proceedings.
The Council Chairman, sitting with at least one
other member of the Council, showed each
defendant the evidence regarding his activities and
explained to each defendant the procedure to be
followed for trial. That procedure required a
bifurcated hearing. The first hearing would be
designed solely to determine what acts each
student had, or had not committed; the second
hearing would be devoted solely to matters of
motivation.
With but one exception, Fred Cohen, who was
also charged with acts of intimidation, each
student, for purposes of the present hearings, was
charged only with having disrupted the Board of
Trustees meeting; no specific acts of violence,
threats, etc. were alleged. [Defendant James
Johnson was also charged with having set a false
fire alarm but all hearings on this charge were
suspended pending decision on such a charge in the
county civil courts. ]
Every defendant was given an opportunity to
admit to the charge against him. He was told that
to do so would eliminate the need for the first
hearing in his case, but that he would still be
permitted to do three things;
(1) Take part in the motivational hearing.
(2) Argue the invalidity of the Campus Policy
on Disruptions.
(3) Argue that the Fundamental Standard does
not cover disruption without a showing of
specific acts such as violence, threats,
blocking access of other persons, etc.
Each student was further informed that any
specific facts regarding his individual conduct
which were brought out during a fact hearing
would be considered by the Council in deciding his
case.
Although defendants were told they had a right
to remain silent, many wished to discuss the nature
of their participation. On the basis of their
statements and the Council's continuing
investigation of the case, charges were withdrawn
against nine persons. Of the remaining twenty-nine
defendants, the following twelve initially decided
to admit to the charges against them:
Allen Christelow
Richard Greenspan
HallamC. Hamilton
Carolyn M. Iverson
Barbara E. Lee
Michael M. Morton
Christine M. Mrak
Jeffrey J. Preefer
Guy D. Smyth
Don P. Stuart
D. Jeffrey Weil
Helen K. Williams
Thereafter, two additional students, Irwin
Busse and Marc Weiss, also decided to admit the
charges against them. Thus, when the case
proceeded to the first hearing, only the following
fifteen students were involved:
John W. Avery
Anne C. Bauer
Richard F. Bogart
Fred H. Cohen
Marc D. Heller
James E. Johnson
Virginia A. Linsley
David F. Pugh
George C. Reinhardt
James E. Shoch
Leonard M. Siegel
Stephen S. Smith
Michael D. Vawter
Joan Williams (Mrs. Rodney W.)
Rodney W. Williams
This factual hearing was open to the public and
took place on February 11, 12 and 13.
Considerable evidence was received, including the
testimony of some 24 witnesses.
The motivational hearing, also open to the
public, was held on February 21. All twenty-nine
defendants subscribed to an organized
presentation of their views. Thereafter each
defendant was given an opportunity to add further
information on his own behalf.
STATEMENT OF THE GENERAL FACTS
On the basis of the evidence presented during
the hearings, the Council finds the following facts:
At the October 1968 meeting of the Stanford
University Board of Trustees, a student, Yale
Braunstein, Speaker of the Student Legislature,
was permitted to address the board members,
urging them to hold open meetings with students.
The Board Chairman, shortly thereafter, wrote a
letter to Mr. Braunstein, thanking him for his
remarks but not specifically mentioning the issue
of open meetings. Mr. Braunstein replied with a
letter to the Board Chairman emphasizing the
importance of the open-meeting request.
Although at both the November 1968 and January
14, 1969 meetings of the Board, student leaders
were invited to and did sit with a number of Board
committees, the Board made no statement, either
to Mr. Braunstein or the Stanford student body at
large, concerning meetings of the Board itself,
which would be open to members of the Stanford
community.
On the morning of January 14,1969, a group of
students circulated throughout the campus a
document requesting that all interested persons

arrive at Bowman Alumni House at 12:30 p.m. for
the purpose of holding an open meeting with the
trustees. The document contained nine specific
demands regarding the operations of the
University and the Stanford Research Institute.
At approximately 12:30 p.m., when a group of
students had collected at Bowman, they learned
that the trustees were at the Stanford Faculty
Club. The students then held a meeting to
determine what action to take. At about this time
Associate Dean of Students, Willard Wyman,
entered Bowman where one of the students
demanded that Wyman carry a message to the
trustees asking for an open meeting. Although he
made it clear that he was not a "messenger boy"
for the students, Dean Wyman nevertheless did in
fact go to the Faculty Club to tell members of the
University administration, including President
Pitzer, that a group of students at Bowman wished
to have an open meeting with the trustees and
would not leave Bowman until such a meeting was
arranged.
Shortly thereafter Yale Braunstein, who had
observed the meeting at Bowman, and apparently
was concerned that Dean Wyman would not
deliver the message, decided to attempt to
communicate with the Board himself. He went to
the Faculty Club where he met Dean Wyman who
arranged for Braunstein to enter the rooms where
the trustees were located. Mr. Braunstein spoke to
the trustees, stating that the students at Bowman
not only demanded an open meeting but would
consider whatever meeting the trustees did hold to
be an open one. This message was given twice, once
in a room where the bulk of the trustees were
sitting and in an adjacent room where the
Investment Committee was in session.
After delivering this message, Braunstein
immediately withdrew and proceeded to Bowman
where he found the students leaving, en route to
the Faculty Club.
As soon as Braunstein left the trustees, they had
a short discussion and unanimously passed a
motion not to alter their policy which permits
non-trustees to attend Board meetings only upon
express invitation. No effort was made to
communicate this decision to the students.
Shortly thereafter, apparently just prior to
1:00 p.m., the students entered the inner patio of
the Faculty Club. They did so by proceeding up
the outer stairway facing Tresidder Union and
down the inner stairway to the courtyard.
The students gathered in the inner court where
some of them rapped on the sliding glass doors of
the rooms in which the trustees were sitting. The
students shouted and made use of a "bullhorn" to
attract the attention of and communicate with the
trustees inside. Individual students unsuccessfully
attempted to open the sliding doors.
The trustees continued with their business,
attempting as best they could to ignore the
students. A number of the students then entered
the Faculty Club from the patio and congregated
in the hallway outside the rooms where the
trustees were meeting.
From the time that the students entered the
patio, just before 1:00 p.m. until a few minutes
past 2:00 p.m., the students' attempts to attract
the attention of the trustees were intensified by
means of shouting, beating and kicking on the
doors, reading demands through a "bullhorn," etc.
From time to time students attempted to open the
doors from the trustees rooms into the hallway,
but they had been locked from the inside. On
occasion, administrative personnel and waiters
passed through these doors but did so carefully in
order to keep the students out. At one such time a
student in the hallway attempted to force his way
in but personnel inside the room managed to
reclose and lock the door.
Shortly before 2:00 p.m. the Faculty Advisory
Committee on Disruptions sent one of its
members, Professor Clebsch, to speak with
President Pitzer and Chairman of the Board Fuller.
Professor Chebsch reported that the noise inside
the room was so intense that it seriously disturbed
the conduct of the board meeting and made it
virtually impossible for the meeting to continue.
Testimony from persons who were inside the room
at the time supported this statement.
At about 2:00 p.m. the Advisory Committee
informed Dean Wyman that the students were in
violation of the Campus Policy on Disruptions and
requested that he warn them of this and take their
names. Dean Wyman then announced in the
hallway that the Disruption Policy had been
violated and that any students who did not leave
would have their names taken. He did not,
however, identify himself as an official of the
University acting as such. Substantial testimony
indicated that some students in the hallway may
not have heard his statement or known who he
was.
Dean Wyman then proceeded to take the names
of students who remained in the hallway and in the
patio. A number of students did leave and their
names were not recorded; some others who did
remain refused to reveal their identity or gave false
names. As Dean Wyman moved through the
hallway taking names he was subjected to taunts
and occasional threats of violence.
By 2:15 p.m. most of the students who
remained after the warning congregated in the
hallway where they held an informal meeting to
determine their course of action; some students
argued that they should not remain at the Faculty
Club.
While this meeting continued the noise level
subsided substantially.
At about 2:25 p.m. one of the students gained
entrance to the trustees' rooms through one of the
sliding doors from the patio. He moved directly
across the room and opened one of the doors to
the hallway. University personnel within the room
as well as some who were in the hallway attempted
to shut the door but the students in the hallway
moved forward to keep the door open.
At the door the students at first hung back,
shouting that they wanted an open meeting with
the trustees. Their demands were read through a
bullhorn. Meanwhile a line of administrative
officers within the room formed at the open door
to prevent students from gaining entry into the
room.
There ensued a period of confusion with
pushing and shoving taking place both on the part
of the students in the hallway and the personnel
from inside the room. During this time one
University official lost his balance and fell into the
hallway. Some students were shouting and at least
one was so agitated that he uttered a threat to one
of the administrative personnel at the door.
Shortly thereafter the students succeeded in
entering the room. One of the students was highly
agitated and he insulted and threatened the
trustees. At least two students grabbed copies of
the agenda of the trustees meeting and a struggle
ensued between one of these students and
university officials who sought to retrieve the
agenda he had taken.
Some of the students attempted to engage the
trustees in discussion; the trustees cut off their
meeting and left. The students remained in the
room for a short time thereafter and gradually
dispersed of their own volition.

DECISION ON LEGAL ISSUES
At the factual hearing on February 11-13,
1969, the defendants raised several legal
arguments regarding the Policy on Campus
Disruption as follows:
I. That the Policy was no longer in effect on
January 14, 1969, when the alleged acts of
disruption occurred.
11. That paragraph two of the Policy did not
apply because the facts show beyond any doubt
that University officials did not comply with
requirements set out therein, and
111. That paragraph one of the Policy was
inapplicable because it is dependent upon
University official's compliance with the
requirements of paragraph two.
I. Was the Policy in Effect
Validity of the Policy on Disruptions:
A. Nature of the Argument
1. The Policy on Campus Disruption was
issued on October 7, 1968 by Acting President
Robert Glaser.
2. On October 7, 1968, the Legislative and
Judicial Charter of 1968 was not yet in effect.
That charter was submitted to a vote of the
student body which approved its adoption until
March 1, 1969. The vote was completed on
October 15, 1968, and the results were
announced on October 16, 1968.
3. The invalidity of the Policy is based upon
Article I, Sections D(2)(b), D(2)(d), and
D(2)(e), which read as follows:
Section D(2)(b): When in his opinion an
emergency exists that requires the
promulgation of a regulation, including change
or repeal of an existing regulation, in less time
than is required under the procedure set forth
in section D.l, the President of the University
may promulgate an interim regulation to
become effective immediately upon
publication, provided the President shall first
consult with as many members of the SCLC as
practicable and, if time permits, shall first
afford the SCLC an opportunity to act under
section D.2a.
Section D(2)(d): An interim regulation
promulgated by the President under section
D.2b shall remain in effect for 90 days or until
it is repealed or amended by the SCLC,
whichever occurs first.
The SCLC may amend or repeal interim
regulations by the procedure provided in
section D.l or, with the written concurrence of
the President, SCLC may proceed under section
D.2a.
Section D(2)(e): If in the case of an interim
regulation promulgated under section D.2b, 90
days expire with no action by the SCLC, the
President may repromulgate the interim
regulation every 30 days until SCLC acts on it.
He shall inform the SCLC of each
promulgation.
The argument is that the Policy on Campus
Disruption is subject to these provisions of the
Charter and hence expired on January 7, 1968,
some 7 days prior to the time of the alleged
offenses in this case. The policy was never formally
renewed.
B. Analysis
1. The Disruption Policy was clearly
promulgated prior to ratification of the
Charter.
2. The terms of the Charter can in no way be
considered binding on such a policy, since the
Charter distinguishes clearly between those
policies promulgated prior to the Charter and
those promulgated thereafter.
Section I.E of the Charter clearly provides this
as follows:
E. Relation to Present University Policy.
Until such time as the Student Conduct
Legislative Council changes any present
University policy, that policy will remain in
effect. It is recommended that the first order
of business of the SCLC be the consideration
of areas in which there are currently conflicts
of law.
Section lI.D of the Charter obligates this
Council to enforce "present policy" until
altered in the following terms:
D. Relation to University Policy. Each
member of the Stanford Judicial Council is
obligated to enforce the regulations of the
Student Conduct Legislative Council or the
legislative product of the President acting
after consultation with the SCLC as provided
in Article I, section D.2b. Until such time as
the SCLC changes present policy, the SJC will
be obligated in the case of conflicts of law to
enforce the University policy.
3. The policy was terned an "interim" one by
Dr. Glaser at the time of its announcement, as
he clearly hoped for student approval of the
Charter and a subsequent consideration of the
policy by the Student Conduct Legislative
Council. Dr. Glaser's statement was as follows:
The consensus was that the policy should be
issued on an interim basis. Its interim
character is emphasized because we anticipate
further action by appropriate governing
bodies of the faculty and students, and in
particular by the proposed Student Conduct
Legislative Council. Subsequent actions of
these bodies may confirm, amend or
supercede the temporary policy, which will be
in effect until such actions are taken.
Obviously this statement in no way impugns,
but rather affirms the fact that the policy was
promulgated without time limit and was to be
considered in force until such time as the SCLC,
if established, altered that policy.
4. As of January 14, 1969, the SCLC had not
altered the Policy on Disruptions.
C. Holding
The University Policy on Campus Disruption
Issued October 7, 1968, was in full force and effect
on January 14,1969.
11. Does Paragraph 2of
the Policy Apply
A. Nature of the Argument
1. Paragraph 2 of the Policy on Campus
Disruption reads as follows:
Members of the faculty, staff, and student body
have an obligation to leave a university building
or facility when asked to do so in the
furtherance of the above regulations by a
member of the university community acting in
an official role, and identifying himself as such;
members of the faculty, staff, or student body
also have an obligation to identify themselves,
when requested to do so by such a member of
the university community who has reasonable
grounds to believe that the person(s) has
violated section (1) or (2) of this policy and
who has so informed the person(s).
2. Although a general announcement was
made by Dean Wyman that the students in the
Faculty Club had violated the Policy, the
evidence is legally insufficient to show that this
message was heard by any or all of the
defendants.
3. The evidence clearly shows that Dean
Wyman failed to announce that he was "a
member of the university community acting in
an official role," and, furthermore, reveals
conclusively that at least some defendants did
not know him.

4. It is thus argued that the Council can find no
violation of paragraph two of the Policy.
B. Analysis
1. Paragraph two of the Policy is quite clear in
its requirements. Individuals should not be
forced to leave a university building or reveal
their identify until they know that the
individual who requires them to do so is
properly authorized. Otherwise paragraph two
could be an instrument of widespread abuse.
2. It is easy enough for university officials,
once informed of this decision, to comply
strictly with the paragraph two requirements.
The Council finds such strict compliance
necessary even when it might appear that
persons making the request are doing so in their
official capacity.
3. The evidence is clear and uncontradicted
that the requirements of paragraph two of the
Policy were not met.
C. Holding
No defendant shall be held guilty of a violation
of paragraph two of the Policy on Campus
Disruption of October 7,1968.
111. Is Paragraph One of the
Policy Separate from Paragraph Two
A. Nature of the Argument
1. Paragraph one of the Policy states as
follows:
It is a violation of university policy for a
member of the faculty, staff, or student body
to (1) prevent or disrupt the effective carrying
out of a university function or approved
activity, such as lectures, meetings, interviews,
ceremonies, the conduct of university business
in a university office, and public events; (2)
obstruct the legitimate movement of any
person about the campus or in any university
building or facility.
2. Paragraph two of the Policy is in
"furtherance" of paragraph one. Hence, it is
argued that paragraph one is to be enforced
only through paragraph two. Since the
requirements of paragraph two have not been
met, there can be no guilt under the policy.
B. Analysis
1. Paragraph one of the Policy on Campus
Disruption clearly states that certain disruptive
conduct is improper. There is no logical way by
which paragraph one can be considered
dependent upon paragraph two. Otherwise an
individual who engaged in such disruption
could, merely by leaving before being told to do
so, immunize himself from liability under the
Policy. This would be an open invitation for
members of the University community to
engage in "hit-and-run" raids.
2. Paragraph two has an entirely different
focus than does paragrpah one. It is often
necessary to clear a building to prevent
disruption or to end disruption in progress.
Thus persons can be required to leave and their
failure to do so is a violation in and of itself,
apart from any disruption which does in fact
occur.
The required notification of paragraph two is
meaningless with regard to an individual who
has already broken up a lecture or a meeting.
The present case clearly illustrates this point.
Dean Wyman's failure to properly identify
himself eliminates any guilt for mere failure to
leave the building; surely, however, it does not
justify acts of disruption done both before and
after his statements.
As to such acts of disruption if the defendants
did not know Dean Wyman or know that he was
acting in his official capacity, as they
successfully argued regarding II above, what he
said or didn't say was of no relevance.
C. Holding
Paragraph one of the Policy on Campus
Disruption is wholly independent from paragraph
two and failure to comply with the terms of the
latter does not prohibit a charge under the former.
SPECIFIC FINDINGS AS TO GUILT
The Council finds as follows:
1. That in addition to those fourteen students
who admitted disruption, the remaining fifteen
defendants, who received a hearing on the facts,
were guilty of acts that disrupted "the effective
carrying out of a university function," under
the Policy on Campus Disruption of October 7,
1968.
(a) From the time the students first entered
the inner patio at the Faculty Club until
shortly after 2:00 p.m., they attempted to
force the trustees to discontinue their regular
meeting by shouting, pounding on doors and
windows, and making statements through a
bullhorn.
(b) That these acts disrupted the trustees'
meeting is unmistakably clear. Although the
trustees attempted to continue with their
regular business, the noise from outside made
it extremely difficult for them to do so.
(c) That these acts by defendants were
intended to disrupt the trustees' meeting is
also clear. The refusal of the trustees to
acknowledge the presence of the students, the
fact that the trustees shut and locked the
doors, and the fact that entry of the students
into the meeting room was resisted at all times
is substantial evidence that the trustees did
not want or intend to meet with the students
at that time and that the students knew this.
(d) Quite apart from the noisy attempts to
disrupt the trustees' meeting, the actual entry
of the students into the meeting room at
approximately 2:25 to 2:30 p.m., through a
line of university officials who clearly were
attempting to keep them out, itself
constituted a flagrant act of disruption. At
that point, the trustees who were attempting
to deal with items on their regular agenda, had
no choice but to stop what they were doing.
(e) It is clear from the evidence, including the
pictures taken at the scene, that all but one of
the fifteen defendants who requested a
hearing, entered or pushed forward in
attempting to enter the open door of the room
where the trustees were meeting. The
exception is James Johnson and the testimony
regarding Mr. Johnson unmistakably shows
him to have engaged in acts of disruption by
banging and kicking on the locked doors to
the meeting room.
2. That Mr. Richard F. Bogart has no defense
on the ground that he was present as a reporter
for KZSU Radio Station.
(a) An individual who engages in illegal acts is
not immunized merely because he belongs, or
in the present case, has reason to believe he
belongs, to a news organization. By his own
statements Mr. Bogart showed that he was
present as a participant in the demonstration.
(b) The Council finds no credible evidence
sufficient for a finding that Mr. Bogart should
be exonerated as a KZSU reporter. Obviously,
participation by a person in illegal activities
cannot be excused even if that person
ultimately reports upon those activities in the
news media.
(c) Furthermore, the evidence regarding Mr.
Bogart is clearly distinguishable from that
available to the Council regarding other
reporters who were not charged or against

whom charges were brought and then
dismissed. These other persons were in
attendance as assigned reporters or
photographers. They took photographs and
notes for news stories which were published
shortly thereafter, and in doing so they clearly
distinguished themselves from the defendants
who were engaged in the disruption. This is
simply not the case with Mr. Bogart.
FINDINGS REGARDING CULPABILITY
The Council finds as follows:
1. That like the fourteen defendants who
admitted to the charge against them, the
following twelve defendant who received a
hearing on the facts engaged in no acts of
aggravation beyond general disruption:
John W. Avery
Anne C. Bauer
Richard F. Bogart
Marc D. Heller
Virginia A. Linsley
David F. Pugh
George C. Reinhardt
James E. Shoch
Leonard M. Siegel
Michael D. Vawter
Joan Williams (Mrs. Rodney W.)
Rodney W. Williams
2. That in addition to general disruption the
following students engaged in specific
aggravating acts as indicated:
(a) Fred H.Cohen
(1) Threatened a University official who
blocked his entry into the trustees meeting
room by stating words such as "get your
hands off me baby or I'll bust your head,"
upon gaining entry into the room further
threatened the trustees not to meet on the
campus again, and in general was so violent
in his manner that several of hiscodefendants
restrained him, and
(2) Took from inside the room a folder
containing the agenda of the trustees
meeting and placed it under his coat.
(b) James E. Johnson
Violently kicked and beat on the doors and
windows to the trustees' room, with his
heavy boots and with a stick.
(c) Stephen S. Smith
(1) At approximaetely 2:25 p.m. managed
to open one of the sliding glass doors from
the patio into the turstees' room, walked
across that room, and, after a struggle with
several university officials, opened the
doorway to the hall and invited the students
congregated there to come into the room.
[At this point the Council would note the
fact that it was unable to locate any witness
who could testify as to how Mr. Smith
succeeded in opening the door from the
patio into the trustees' room. Mr. Smith was
not called in deference to his privilege
against self-incrimination and he chose not
to testify. The Council does find, however,
the circumstantial evidence is overwhelming
that Mr. Smith entered the room knowing
that it was disruptive for him to do so. This is
clearly shown by his subsequent actions in
immediately attempting to open the door to
the hallway against the will of those
present. ]
(2) Took a folder containing an agenda of
the trustees meeting and refused to return it
at the request of a number of University
personnel who finally were forced to engage
in a struggle with Mr. Smith to retrieve it.
3. That the University administration and the
Board of Trustees failed to make clear to the
defendants what proper channels, if any,
existed for communication between students
on the one hand and the administration and the
Board on the other.
4. That the defendants were strongly
motivated by sincerely held beliefs and felt
frustrated by their apparent inability to state
those beliefs to the Board.
5. That the failure of the University
administration and the Board of Trustees to
develop and maintain methods for the orderly
exchange of views with the student body
regarding issues relevant to the University was a
contributing factor of the disruption.
6. That the defendants in the present case were
less interested in the orderly exchange of views
than they were in the imposition of their views
on the rest of the community.

Autumn Quarter of the 1969-70 academic
year.

5. That with respect to orders to pay money
under 1(b), 2(b), 3(b) and 4(b) above
(a) The Dean of Students, in his discretion
may upon application by a defendant,
postpone payment of any sum when it appears
necessary to avoid undue financial hardship.
(b) Provided, however, that in no event shall a
university degree be awarded to any
defendant until he has paid the full amount
due.
Analysis of the Recommendations on Penalty
1. The Council's recommendations as to
penalty are based on a total view of the
defendants' conduct in light of the Council's
desire, as set forth in its Rules, to utilize
penalties to strengthen the Stanford
community.
2. The penalties would have been more severe
had the defendants been aware of the existence
of a reasonably means by which to make their
views known to the Board of Trustees.
3. At the same time, however, the Council
considered the offense to be a very serious one
that must not be repeated. If every member of
the Stanford community who feels strongly
about an issue is permitted to disrupt the
campus to impose his views on others, the result
would be chaos. Indeed such actions are
counterproductive in that they tend to
eliminate opportunity for legitimate discussion
and resolution of vital issues.
4. The Council's imposition of periods of
probation takes into consideration the threat
by defendants, made at the motivational
hearing, to engage in further serious acts of
disruption. The Council takes the position that
if during the period of probation any defendant
carries out such a threat, and is duly convicted
thereof, the University community has the
right to insist upon his suspension.
5. The Council views as most serious those acts
which, directly or by implication, threaten
violence to any person. Fortunately, in the
present case no one was injured and there was

no serious damage to property. Nevertheless, a
real danger of personal injury exists when
persons ostensibly engaged in a demonstration
to present their views, lose their tempers or
engage in physical altercations. The penalties to
three individuals reflect the Council's position,
based on clear evidence, that in varying degrees,
these individuals materially increased the
danger of physical violence and personal injury.
6. In order that the University community not
be misled, the Council wishes to make clear that
its decision in this case was not based on the
military draft policy of the United States or on
the draft status of any of the defendants.
Findingson Collateral Matters
The Council finds as follows:
1. That in light of the fact that every defendant
was clearly in violation of the Policy on Campus
Disruption of October 7, 1968, which policy
was valid and in force, the Council feels it
unnecessary to determine whether or not the
defendants were also in violation of the
Fundamental Standard. The answer to this
question would in no way affect the penalties
imposed.
2. That student witnesses have the obligation
to testify when called before the Council.
(a) In the present case a student was called to
testify as to events he observed at the Faculty
Club at the time of the disruption. He claimed
that he had been present as a reporter for the
Stanford Daily and therefore he was privileged
not to testify.
(b) The Council subpoenaed this witness
because he was known to have been present
and it was felt that defendants might have
wished to elicit information from him. The
defendants declined to ask him questions and
he was excused.
(c) The Council at that time, however, and
now, holds that the claimed privilege does not
exist, that it has not been recognized by the
courts of the land, that there is no justification
for such a privilege, and that the refusal to

testify on such grounds cannot and will not be
tolerated. [This in no way, however, governs
the Council's attitude toward the privilege of a
reporter not to reveal the name of a
confidential informant, which privilege has
both been recognized and rejected in various
courts. 1
3. That persons who attend a hearing of the
Stanford Judicial Council, including the
defendants and their counsel, have an
obligation not to impede, disrupt, or in any
manner interfere with the conduct of the
proceedings.
(a) A number of persons who attended the
factual hearing, particularly on the first night,
in obvious support of the defendants,
deliberately attempted to disrupt the
proceedings and did, in fact, cause
considerably noise and confusion.
(b) The Council is not a court of law; it has no
bailiff or sheriff's department to maintain
order. Thus any handful of persons, who are
so inclined can seriously impede the
proceedings.
(c) The defendants themselves, and their
counsel, must share the blame for the
disorder, particularly during the first night.
They continually directed their comments to
their supporters in the audience rather than to
the members of the Council and they
attempted in numerous ways, including the
muttering of threats, to ridicule the Council
and to make its job impossible. All this was
done in spite of the Council's solemn promise,
duly kept, that they would be given an
opportunity at the hearings on motivatioto
say what they so desired about the basic issues
underlying their actions.
The Council does note that the defendants did
intercede during the most serious disruptions
to assist the Council, primarily to prevent the
Council from closing the hearings, and that
after the first night of the hearings, the
defendants were more restrained. Moreover,

the Council recognizes and appreciates the
efforts of Mr. Doron Weinberg, who, as sole
counsel after the first and second evenings,
assisted in maintaining order and preserving
the decorum of the proceedings.
(d) On the basis of its experience in this case,
regarding meetings that are open to the
general public, the Council will seriously
consider in future cases limiting the number of
persons in attendance. Furthermore, the
Council serves warning on those who would
disrupt future proceedings that the Council is
disposed to find in contempt persons who
engage in disruption of its proceedings and to
recommend immediate imposition of severe
sanctions.
4. That defendant Jack Gerson, who
apparently withdrew from the University
subsequent to January 14, 1969, but prior to
the hearings in this case, has failed to respond to
summonses from the Council duly served upon
him.
The Council recommends that, in accordance
with the Legislative and Judicial Charter of
1968, the University immediately withdraw
Mr. Gerson's registration privileges until such
time as he appears before the Council for the
trial of his case.
THIS DECISION AND ALL ITS PARTS ARE
UNANIMOUSLY ADOPTED BY THE
MEMBERS OF THE COUNCIL.
Dated: February 27, 1969
Editor's Note: The Judicial Council's reference
to "the faculty advisory Committee on
Disruptions" is, in fact, the President's advisory
group on campus disruptions. After hearing from
members of this group. President Pitzer informed
Dean Wyman that the students were believed to be
in violation of the campus policy on disruptions.
The faculty members did not instruct Wyman
directly.
Incremental costs for publication of this report
have been paid for the the Stanford Newsservice.
STATEMENT OF THE PROCEEDINGS
On January 15, 1969, the Stanford Judicial
Council was notified by the office of the Dean of
Students that on the previous day a group of
persons, believed primarily to be Stanford
students, had allegedly disrupted a meeting of the
University Board of Trustees which had been held
at the Stanford Faculty Club. The Council was
asked to investigate.
Pursuant to the Legislative and Judicial Charter
of 1968, the Council sent out five judicial aides to
investigate and interview witnesses. The judicial
aides made a comprehensive report to the Council
which included photographs, lists of witnesses and
participants, transcripts of tape-recorded
interviews of many persons, and additional
statements, including those of a number of
potential defendants.
At the Council's behest, the Chairman
examined the report and, on the basis of the
information therein, determined to call before
him, and one other member of the Council sitting
with him, some thirty-nine persons for the purpose
of charging them with violations of the Campus
Policy on Disruptions of October 7, 1968, and of
the Fundamental Standard, and to show each the
evidence the Council had obtained through its
judicial aides regarding his activities.
The letter summoning these persons was sent
by mail; in addition a copy of the letter was
personally served on each of them. The letter
contained the following:
(1) A statement that the person was charged
with violations of the Disruption Policy and
of the Fundamental Standard.
(2) An outline of proceedings to be followed
during trial of the case.
(3) A copy of the Council's rules containing
the rights of defendants as set out in the
Legislative and Judicial Charter of 1968.
(4) A date and time to appear before the
Chairman of the Council for a conference.
Each person summoned duly appeared with the
sole exception of Jack Gerson, who has at no time
appeared or taken part in these proceedings.
The Council Chairman, sitting with at least one
other member of the Council, showed each
defendant the evidence regarding his activities and
explained to each defendant the procedure to be
followed for trial. That procedure required a
bifurcated hearing. The first hearing would be
designed solely to determine what acts each
student had, or had not committed; the second
hearing would be devoted solely to matters of
motivation.
With but one exception, Fred Cohen, who was
also charged with acts of intimidation, each
student, for purposes of the present hearings, was
charged only with having disrupted the Board of
Trustees meeting; no specific acts of violence,
threats, etc. were alleged. [Defendant James
Johnson was also charged with having set a false
fire alarm but all hearings on this charge were
suspended pending decision on such a charge in the
county civil courts. ]
Every defendant was given an opportunity to
admit to the charge against him. He was told that
to do so would eliminate the need for the first
hearing in his case, but that he would still be
permitted to do three things;
(1) Take part in the motivational hearing.
(2) Argue the invalidity of the Campus Policy
on Disruptions.
(3) Argue that the Fundamental Standard does
not cover disruption without a showing of
specific acts such as violence, threats,
blocking access of other persons, etc.
Each student was further informed that any
specific facts regarding his individual conduct
which were brought out during a fact hearing
would be considered by the Council in deciding his
case.
Although defendants were told they had a right
to remain silent, many wished to discuss the nature
of their participation. On the basis of their
statements and the Council's continuing
investigation of the case, charges were withdrawn
against nine persons. Of the remaining twenty-nine
defendants, the following twelve initially decided
to admit to the charges against them:
Allen Christelow
Richard Greenspan
HallamC. Hamilton
Carolyn M. Iverson
Barbara E. Lee
Michael M. Morton
Christine M. Mrak
Jeffrey J. Preefer
Guy D. Smyth
Don P. Stuart
D. Jeffrey Weil
Helen K. Williams
Thereafter, two additional students, Irwin
Busse and Marc Weiss, also decided to admit the
charges against them. Thus, when the case
proceeded to the first hearing, only the following
fifteen students were involved:
John W. Avery
Anne C. Bauer
Richard F. Bogart
Fred H. Cohen
Marc D. Heller
James E. Johnson
Virginia A. Linsley
David F. Pugh
George C. Reinhardt
James E. Shoch
Leonard M. Siegel
Stephen S. Smith
Michael D. Vawter
Joan Williams (Mrs. Rodney W.)
Rodney W. Williams
This factual hearing was open to the public and
took place on February 11, 12 and 13.
Considerable evidence was received, including the
testimony of some 24 witnesses.
The motivational hearing, also open to the
public, was held on February 21. All twenty-nine
defendants subscribed to an organized
presentation of their views. Thereafter each
defendant was given an opportunity to add further
information on his own behalf.
STATEMENT OF THE GENERAL FACTS
On the basis of the evidence presented during
the hearings, the Council finds the following facts:
At the October 1968 meeting of the Stanford
University Board of Trustees, a student, Yale
Braunstein, Speaker of the Student Legislature,
was permitted to address the board members,
urging them to hold open meetings with students.
The Board Chairman, shortly thereafter, wrote a
letter to Mr. Braunstein, thanking him for his
remarks but not specifically mentioning the issue
of open meetings. Mr. Braunstein replied with a
letter to the Board Chairman emphasizing the
importance of the open-meeting request.
Although at both the November 1968 and January
14, 1969 meetings of the Board, student leaders
were invited to and did sit with a number of Board
committees, the Board made no statement, either
to Mr. Braunstein or the Stanford student body at
large, concerning meetings of the Board itself,
which would be open to members of the Stanford
community.
On the morning of January 14,1969, a group of
students circulated throughout the campus a
document requesting that all interested persons

arrive at Bowman Alumni House at 12:30 p.m. for
the purpose of holding an open meeting with the
trustees. The document contained nine specific
demands regarding the operations of the
University and the Stanford Research Institute.
At approximately 12:30 p.m., when a group of
students had collected at Bowman, they learned
that the trustees were at the Stanford Faculty
Club. The students then held a meeting to
determine what action to take. At about this time
Associate Dean of Students, Willard Wyman,
entered Bowman where one of the students
demanded that Wyman carry a message to the
trustees asking for an open meeting. Although he
made it clear that he was not a "messenger boy"
for the students, Dean Wyman nevertheless did in
fact go to the Faculty Club to tell members of the
University administration, including President
Pitzer, that a group of students at Bowman wished
to have an open meeting with the trustees and
would not leave Bowman until such a meeting was
arranged.
Shortly thereafter Yale Braunstein, who had
observed the meeting at Bowman, and apparently
was concerned that Dean Wyman would not
deliver the message, decided to attempt to
communicate with the Board himself. He went to
the Faculty Club where he met Dean Wyman who
arranged for Braunstein to enter the rooms where
the trustees were located. Mr. Braunstein spoke to
the trustees, stating that the students at Bowman
not only demanded an open meeting but would
consider whatever meeting the trustees did hold to
be an open one. This message was given twice, once
in a room where the bulk of the trustees were
sitting and in an adjacent room where the
Investment Committee was in session.
After delivering this message, Braunstein
immediately withdrew and proceeded to Bowman
where he found the students leaving, en route to
the Faculty Club.
As soon as Braunstein left the trustees, they had
a short discussion and unanimously passed a
motion not to alter their policy which permits
non-trustees to attend Board meetings only upon
express invitation. No effort was made to
communicate this decision to the students.
Shortly thereafter, apparently just prior to
1:00 p.m., the students entered the inner patio of
the Faculty Club. They did so by proceeding up
the outer stairway facing Tresidder Union and
down the inner stairway to the courtyard.
The students gathered in the inner court where
some of them rapped on the sliding glass doors of
the rooms in which the trustees were sitting. The
students shouted and made use of a "bullhorn" to
attract the attention of and communicate with the
trustees inside. Individual students unsuccessfully
attempted to open the sliding doors.
The trustees continued with their business,
attempting as best they could to ignore the
students. A number of the students then entered
the Faculty Club from the patio and congregated
in the hallway outside the rooms where the
trustees were meeting.
From the time that the students entered the
patio, just before 1:00 p.m. until a few minutes
past 2:00 p.m., the students' attempts to attract
the attention of the trustees were intensified by
means of shouting, beating and kicking on the
doors, reading demands through a "bullhorn," etc.
From time to time students attempted to open the
doors from the trustees rooms into the hallway,
but they had been locked from the inside. On
occasion, administrative personnel and waiters
passed through these doors but did so carefully in
order to keep the students out. At one such time a
student in the hallway attempted to force his way
in but personnel inside the room managed to
reclose and lock the door.
Shortly before 2:00 p.m. the Faculty Advisory
Committee on Disruptions sent one of its
members, Professor Clebsch, to speak with
President Pitzer and Chairman of the Board Fuller.
Professor Chebsch reported that the noise inside
the room was so intense that it seriously disturbed
the conduct of the board meeting and made it
virtually impossible for the meeting to continue.
Testimony from persons who were inside the room
at the time supported this statement.
At about 2:00 p.m. the Advisory Committee
informed Dean Wyman that the students were in
violation of the Campus Policy on Disruptions and
requested that he warn them of this and take their
names. Dean Wyman then announced in the
hallway that the Disruption Policy had been
violated and that any students who did not leave
would have their names taken. He did not,
however, identify himself as an official of the
University acting as such. Substantial testimony
indicated that some students in the hallway may
not have heard his statement or known who he
was.
Dean Wyman then proceeded to take the names
of students who remained in the hallway and in the
patio. A number of students did leave and their
names were not recorded; some others who did
remain refused to reveal their identity or gave false
names. As Dean Wyman moved through the
hallway taking names he was subjected to taunts
and occasional threats of violence.
By 2:15 p.m. most of the students who
remained after the warning congregated in the
hallway where they held an informal meeting to
determine their course of action; some students
argued that they should not remain at the Faculty
Club.
While this meeting continued the noise level
subsided substantially.
At about 2:25 p.m. one of the students gained
entrance to the trustees' rooms through one of the
sliding doors from the patio. He moved directly
across the room and opened one of the doors to
the hallway. University personnel within the room
as well as some who were in the hallway attempted
to shut the door but the students in the hallway
moved forward to keep the door open.
At the door the students at first hung back,
shouting that they wanted an open meeting with
the trustees. Their demands were read through a
bullhorn. Meanwhile a line of administrative
officers within the room formed at the open door
to prevent students from gaining entry into the
room.
There ensued a period of confusion with
pushing and shoving taking place both on the part
of the students in the hallway and the personnel
from inside the room. During this time one
University official lost his balance and fell into the
hallway. Some students were shouting and at least
one was so agitated that he uttered a threat to one
of the administrative personnel at the door.
Shortly thereafter the students succeeded in
entering the room. One of the students was highly
agitated and he insulted and threatened the
trustees. At least two students grabbed copies of
the agenda of the trustees meeting and a struggle
ensued between one of these students and
university officials who sought to retrieve the
agenda he had taken.
Some of the students attempted to engage the
trustees in discussion; the trustees cut off their
meeting and left. The students remained in the
room for a short time thereafter and gradually
dispersed of their own volition.

DECISION ON LEGAL ISSUES
At the factual hearing on February 11-13,
1969, the defendants raised several legal
arguments regarding the Policy on Campus
Disruption as follows:
I. That the Policy was no longer in effect on
January 14, 1969, when the alleged acts of
disruption occurred.
11. That paragraph two of the Policy did not
apply because the facts show beyond any doubt
that University officials did not comply with
requirements set out therein, and
111. That paragraph one of the Policy was
inapplicable because it is dependent upon
University official's compliance with the
requirements of paragraph two.
I. Was the Policy in Effect
Validity of the Policy on Disruptions:
A. Nature of the Argument
1. The Policy on Campus Disruption was
issued on October 7, 1968 by Acting President
Robert Glaser.
2. On October 7, 1968, the Legislative and
Judicial Charter of 1968 was not yet in effect.
That charter was submitted to a vote of the
student body which approved its adoption until
March 1, 1969. The vote was completed on
October 15, 1968, and the results were
announced on October 16, 1968.
3. The invalidity of the Policy is based upon
Article I, Sections D(2)(b), D(2)(d), and
D(2)(e), which read as follows:
Section D(2)(b): When in his opinion an
emergency exists that requires the
promulgation of a regulation, including change
or repeal of an existing regulation, in less time
than is required under the procedure set forth
in section D.l, the President of the University
may promulgate an interim regulation to
become effective immediately upon
publication, provided the President shall first
consult with as many members of the SCLC as
practicable and, if time permits, shall first
afford the SCLC an opportunity to act under
section D.2a.
Section D(2)(d): An interim regulation
promulgated by the President under section
D.2b shall remain in effect for 90 days or until
it is repealed or amended by the SCLC,
whichever occurs first.
The SCLC may amend or repeal interim
regulations by the procedure provided in
section D.l or, with the written concurrence of
the President, SCLC may proceed under section
D.2a.
Section D(2)(e): If in the case of an interim
regulation promulgated under section D.2b, 90
days expire with no action by the SCLC, the
President may repromulgate the interim
regulation every 30 days until SCLC acts on it.
He shall inform the SCLC of each
promulgation.
The argument is that the Policy on Campus
Disruption is subject to these provisions of the
Charter and hence expired on January 7, 1968,
some 7 days prior to the time of the alleged
offenses in this case. The policy was never formally
renewed.
B. Analysis
1. The Disruption Policy was clearly
promulgated prior to ratification of the
Charter.
2. The terms of the Charter can in no way be
considered binding on such a policy, since the
Charter distinguishes clearly between those
policies promulgated prior to the Charter and
those promulgated thereafter.
Section I.E of the Charter clearly provides this
as follows:
E. Relation to Present University Policy.
Until such time as the Student Conduct
Legislative Council changes any present
University policy, that policy will remain in
effect. It is recommended that the first order
of business of the SCLC be the consideration
of areas in which there are currently conflicts
of law.
Section lI.D of the Charter obligates this
Council to enforce "present policy" until
altered in the following terms:
D. Relation to University Policy. Each
member of the Stanford Judicial Council is
obligated to enforce the regulations of the
Student Conduct Legislative Council or the
legislative product of the President acting
after consultation with the SCLC as provided
in Article I, section D.2b. Until such time as
the SCLC changes present policy, the SJC will
be obligated in the case of conflicts of law to
enforce the University policy.
3. The policy was terned an "interim" one by
Dr. Glaser at the time of its announcement, as
he clearly hoped for student approval of the
Charter and a subsequent consideration of the
policy by the Student Conduct Legislative
Council. Dr. Glaser's statement was as follows:
The consensus was that the policy should be
issued on an interim basis. Its interim
character is emphasized because we anticipate
further action by appropriate governing
bodies of the faculty and students, and in
particular by the proposed Student Conduct
Legislative Council. Subsequent actions of
these bodies may confirm, amend or
supercede the temporary policy, which will be
in effect until such actions are taken.
Obviously this statement in no way impugns,
but rather affirms the fact that the policy was
promulgated without time limit and was to be
considered in force until such time as the SCLC,
if established, altered that policy.
4. As of January 14, 1969, the SCLC had not
altered the Policy on Disruptions.
C. Holding
The University Policy on Campus Disruption
Issued October 7, 1968, was in full force and effect
on January 14,1969.
11. Does Paragraph 2of
the Policy Apply
A. Nature of the Argument
1. Paragraph 2 of the Policy on Campus
Disruption reads as follows:
Members of the faculty, staff, and student body
have an obligation to leave a university building
or facility when asked to do so in the
furtherance of the above regulations by a
member of the university community acting in
an official role, and identifying himself as such;
members of the faculty, staff, or student body
also have an obligation to identify themselves,
when requested to do so by such a member of
the university community who has reasonable
grounds to believe that the person(s) has
violated section (1) or (2) of this policy and
who has so informed the person(s).
2. Although a general announcement was
made by Dean Wyman that the students in the
Faculty Club had violated the Policy, the
evidence is legally insufficient to show that this
message was heard by any or all of the
defendants.
3. The evidence clearly shows that Dean
Wyman failed to announce that he was "a
member of the university community acting in
an official role," and, furthermore, reveals
conclusively that at least some defendants did
not know him.

4. It is thus argued that the Council can find no
violation of paragraph two of the Policy.
B. Analysis
1. Paragraph two of the Policy is quite clear in
its requirements. Individuals should not be
forced to leave a university building or reveal
their identify until they know that the
individual who requires them to do so is
properly authorized. Otherwise paragraph two
could be an instrument of widespread abuse.
2. It is easy enough for university officials,
once informed of this decision, to comply
strictly with the paragraph two requirements.
The Council finds such strict compliance
necessary even when it might appear that
persons making the request are doing so in their
official capacity.
3. The evidence is clear and uncontradicted
that the requirements of paragraph two of the
Policy were not met.
C. Holding
No defendant shall be held guilty of a violation
of paragraph two of the Policy on Campus
Disruption of October 7,1968.
111. Is Paragraph One of the
Policy Separate from Paragraph Two
A. Nature of the Argument
1. Paragraph one of the Policy states as
follows:
It is a violation of university policy for a
member of the faculty, staff, or student body
to (1) prevent or disrupt the effective carrying
out of a university function or approved
activity, such as lectures, meetings, interviews,
ceremonies, the conduct of university business
in a university office, and public events; (2)
obstruct the legitimate movement of any
person about the campus or in any university
building or facility.
2. Paragraph two of the Policy is in
"furtherance" of paragraph one. Hence, it is
argued that paragraph one is to be enforced
only through paragraph two. Since the
requirements of paragraph two have not been
met, there can be no guilt under the policy.
B. Analysis
1. Paragraph one of the Policy on Campus
Disruption clearly states that certain disruptive
conduct is improper. There is no logical way by
which paragraph one can be considered
dependent upon paragraph two. Otherwise an
individual who engaged in such disruption
could, merely by leaving before being told to do
so, immunize himself from liability under the
Policy. This would be an open invitation for
members of the University community to
engage in "hit-and-run" raids.
2. Paragraph two has an entirely different
focus than does paragrpah one. It is often
necessary to clear a building to prevent
disruption or to end disruption in progress.
Thus persons can be required to leave and their
failure to do so is a violation in and of itself,
apart from any disruption which does in fact
occur.
The required notification of paragraph two is
meaningless with regard to an individual who
has already broken up a lecture or a meeting.
The present case clearly illustrates this point.
Dean Wyman's failure to properly identify
himself eliminates any guilt for mere failure to
leave the building; surely, however, it does not
justify acts of disruption done both before and
after his statements.
As to such acts of disruption if the defendants
did not know Dean Wyman or know that he was
acting in his official capacity, as they
successfully argued regarding II above, what he
said or didn't say was of no relevance.
C. Holding
Paragraph one of the Policy on Campus
Disruption is wholly independent from paragraph
two and failure to comply with the terms of the
latter does not prohibit a charge under the former.
SPECIFIC FINDINGS AS TO GUILT
The Council finds as follows:
1. That in addition to those fourteen students
who admitted disruption, the remaining fifteen
defendants, who received a hearing on the facts,
were guilty of acts that disrupted "the effective
carrying out of a university function," under
the Policy on Campus Disruption of October 7,
1968.
(a) From the time the students first entered
the inner patio at the Faculty Club until
shortly after 2:00 p.m., they attempted to
force the trustees to discontinue their regular
meeting by shouting, pounding on doors and
windows, and making statements through a
bullhorn.
(b) That these acts disrupted the trustees'
meeting is unmistakably clear. Although the
trustees attempted to continue with their
regular business, the noise from outside made
it extremely difficult for them to do so.
(c) That these acts by defendants were
intended to disrupt the trustees' meeting is
also clear. The refusal of the trustees to
acknowledge the presence of the students, the
fact that the trustees shut and locked the
doors, and the fact that entry of the students
into the meeting room was resisted at all times
is substantial evidence that the trustees did
not want or intend to meet with the students
at that time and that the students knew this.
(d) Quite apart from the noisy attempts to
disrupt the trustees' meeting, the actual entry
of the students into the meeting room at
approximately 2:25 to 2:30 p.m., through a
line of university officials who clearly were
attempting to keep them out, itself
constituted a flagrant act of disruption. At
that point, the trustees who were attempting
to deal with items on their regular agenda, had
no choice but to stop what they were doing.
(e) It is clear from the evidence, including the
pictures taken at the scene, that all but one of
the fifteen defendants who requested a
hearing, entered or pushed forward in
attempting to enter the open door of the room
where the trustees were meeting. The
exception is James Johnson and the testimony
regarding Mr. Johnson unmistakably shows
him to have engaged in acts of disruption by
banging and kicking on the locked doors to
the meeting room.
2. That Mr. Richard F. Bogart has no defense
on the ground that he was present as a reporter
for KZSU Radio Station.
(a) An individual who engages in illegal acts is
not immunized merely because he belongs, or
in the present case, has reason to believe he
belongs, to a news organization. By his own
statements Mr. Bogart showed that he was
present as a participant in the demonstration.
(b) The Council finds no credible evidence
sufficient for a finding that Mr. Bogart should
be exonerated as a KZSU reporter. Obviously,
participation by a person in illegal activities
cannot be excused even if that person
ultimately reports upon those activities in the
news media.
(c) Furthermore, the evidence regarding Mr.
Bogart is clearly distinguishable from that
available to the Council regarding other
reporters who were not charged or against

whom charges were brought and then
dismissed. These other persons were in
attendance as assigned reporters or
photographers. They took photographs and
notes for news stories which were published
shortly thereafter, and in doing so they clearly
distinguished themselves from the defendants
who were engaged in the disruption. This is
simply not the case with Mr. Bogart.
FINDINGS REGARDING CULPABILITY
The Council finds as follows:
1. That like the fourteen defendants who
admitted to the charge against them, the
following twelve defendant who received a
hearing on the facts engaged in no acts of
aggravation beyond general disruption:
John W. Avery
Anne C. Bauer
Richard F. Bogart
Marc D. Heller
Virginia A. Linsley
David F. Pugh
George C. Reinhardt
James E. Shoch
Leonard M. Siegel
Michael D. Vawter
Joan Williams (Mrs. Rodney W.)
Rodney W. Williams
2. That in addition to general disruption the
following students engaged in specific
aggravating acts as indicated:
(a) Fred H.Cohen
(1) Threatened a University official who
blocked his entry into the trustees meeting
room by stating words such as "get your
hands off me baby or I'll bust your head,"
upon gaining entry into the room further
threatened the trustees not to meet on the
campus again, and in general was so violent
in his manner that several of hiscodefendants
restrained him, and
(2) Took from inside the room a folder
containing the agenda of the trustees
meeting and placed it under his coat.
(b) James E. Johnson
Violently kicked and beat on the doors and
windows to the trustees' room, with his
heavy boots and with a stick.
(c) Stephen S. Smith
(1) At approximaetely 2:25 p.m. managed
to open one of the sliding glass doors from
the patio into the turstees' room, walked
across that room, and, after a struggle with
several university officials, opened the
doorway to the hall and invited the students
congregated there to come into the room.
[At this point the Council would note the
fact that it was unable to locate any witness
who could testify as to how Mr. Smith
succeeded in opening the door from the
patio into the trustees' room. Mr. Smith was
not called in deference to his privilege
against self-incrimination and he chose not
to testify. The Council does find, however,
the circumstantial evidence is overwhelming
that Mr. Smith entered the room knowing
that it was disruptive for him to do so. This is
clearly shown by his subsequent actions in
immediately attempting to open the door to
the hallway against the will of those
present. ]
(2) Took a folder containing an agenda of
the trustees meeting and refused to return it
at the request of a number of University
personnel who finally were forced to engage
in a struggle with Mr. Smith to retrieve it.
3. That the University administration and the
Board of Trustees failed to make clear to the
defendants what proper channels, if any,
existed for communication between students
on the one hand and the administration and the
Board on the other.
4. That the defendants were strongly
motivated by sincerely held beliefs and felt
frustrated by their apparent inability to state
those beliefs to the Board.
5. That the failure of the University
administration and the Board of Trustees to
develop and maintain methods for the orderly
exchange of views with the student body
regarding issues relevant to the University was a
contributing factor of the disruption.
6. That the defendants in the present case were
less interested in the orderly exchange of views
than they were in the imposition of their views
on the rest of the community.

5. That with respect to orders to pay money
under 1(b), 2(b), 3(b) and 4(b) above
(a) The Dean of Students, in his discretion
may upon application by a defendant,
postpone payment of any sum when it appears
necessary to avoid undue financial hardship.
(b) Provided, however, that in no event shall a
university degree be awarded to any
defendant until he has paid the full amount
due.
Analysis of the Recommendations on Penalty
1. The Council's recommendations as to
penalty are based on a total view of the
defendants' conduct in light of the Council's
desire, as set forth in its Rules, to utilize
penalties to strengthen the Stanford
community.
2. The penalties would have been more severe
had the defendants been aware of the existence
of a reasonably means by which to make their
views known to the Board of Trustees.
3. At the same time, however, the Council
considered the offense to be a very serious one
that must not be repeated. If every member of
the Stanford community who feels strongly
about an issue is permitted to disrupt the
campus to impose his views on others, the result
would be chaos. Indeed such actions are
counterproductive in that they tend to
eliminate opportunity for legitimate discussion
and resolution of vital issues.
4. The Council's imposition of periods of
probation takes into consideration the threat
by defendants, made at the motivational
hearing, to engage in further serious acts of
disruption. The Council takes the position that
if during the period of probation any defendant
carries out such a threat, and is duly convicted
thereof, the University community has the
right to insist upon his suspension.
5. The Council views as most serious those acts
which, directly or by implication, threaten
violence to any person. Fortunately, in the
present case no one was injured and there was

no serious damage to property. Nevertheless, a
real danger of personal injury exists when
persons ostensibly engaged in a demonstration
to present their views, lose their tempers or
engage in physical altercations. The penalties to
three individuals reflect the Council's position,
based on clear evidence, that in varying degrees,
these individuals materially increased the
danger of physical violence and personal injury.
6. In order that the University community not
be misled, the Council wishes to make clear that
its decision in this case was not based on the
military draft policy of the United States or on
the draft status of any of the defendants.
Findingson Collateral Matters
The Council finds as follows:
1. That in light of the fact that every defendant
was clearly in violation of the Policy on Campus
Disruption of October 7, 1968, which policy
was valid and in force, the Council feels it
unnecessary to determine whether or not the
defendants were also in violation of the
Fundamental Standard. The answer to this
question would in no way affect the penalties
imposed.
2. That student witnesses have the obligation
to testify when called before the Council.
(a) In the present case a student was called to
testify as to events he observed at the Faculty
Club at the time of the disruption. He claimed
that he had been present as a reporter for the
Stanford Daily and therefore he was privileged
not to testify.
(b) The Council subpoenaed this witness
because he was known to have been present
and it was felt that defendants might have
wished to elicit information from him. The
defendants declined to ask him questions and
he was excused.
(c) The Council at that time, however, and
now, holds that the claimed privilege does not
exist, that it has not been recognized by the
courts of the land, that there is no justification
for such a privilege, and that the refusal to

testify on such grounds cannot and will not be
tolerated. [This in no way, however, governs
the Council's attitude toward the privilege of a
reporter not to reveal the name of a
confidential informant, which privilege has
both been recognized and rejected in various
courts. 1
3. That persons who attend a hearing of the
Stanford Judicial Council, including the
defendants and their counsel, have an
obligation not to impede, disrupt, or in any
manner interfere with the conduct of the
proceedings.
(a) A number of persons who attended the
factual hearing, particularly on the first night,
in obvious support of the defendants,
deliberately attempted to disrupt the
proceedings and did, in fact, cause
considerably noise and confusion.
(b) The Council is not a court of law; it has no
bailiff or sheriff's department to maintain
order. Thus any handful of persons, who are
so inclined can seriously impede the
proceedings.
(c) The defendants themselves, and their
counsel, must share the blame for the
disorder, particularly during the first night.
They continually directed their comments to
their supporters in the audience rather than to
the members of the Council and they
attempted in numerous ways, including the
muttering of threats, to ridicule the Council
and to make its job impossible. All this was
done in spite of the Council's solemn promise,
duly kept, that they would be given an
opportunity at the hearings on motivatioto
say what they so desired about the basic issues
underlying their actions.
The Council does note that the defendants did
intercede during the most serious disruptions
to assist the Council, primarily to prevent the
Council from closing the hearings, and that
after the first night of the hearings, the
defendants were more restrained. Moreover,

the Council recognizes and appreciates the
efforts of Mr. Doron Weinberg, who, as sole
counsel after the first and second evenings,
assisted in maintaining order and preserving
the decorum of the proceedings.
(d) On the basis of its experience in this case,
regarding meetings that are open to the
general public, the Council will seriously
consider in future cases limiting the number of
persons in attendance. Furthermore, the
Council serves warning on those who would
disrupt future proceedings that the Council is
disposed to find in contempt persons who
engage in disruption of its proceedings and to
recommend immediate imposition of severe
sanctions.
4. That defendant Jack Gerson, who
apparently withdrew from the University
subsequent to January 14, 1969, but prior to
the hearings in this case, has failed to respond to
summonses from the Council duly served upon
him.
The Council recommends that, in accordance
with the Legislative and Judicial Charter of
1968, the University immediately withdraw
Mr. Gerson's registration privileges until such
time as he appears before the Council for the
trial of his case.
THIS DECISION AND ALL ITS PARTS ARE
UNANIMOUSLY ADOPTED BY THE
MEMBERS OF THE COUNCIL.
Dated: February 27, 1969
Editor's Note: The Judicial Council's reference
to "the faculty advisory Committee on
Disruptions" is, in fact, the President's advisory
group on campus disruptions. After hearing from
members of this group. President Pitzer informed
Dean Wyman that the students were believed to be
in violation of the campus policy on disruptions.
The faculty members did not instruct Wyman
directly.
Incremental costs for publication of this report
have been paid for the the Stanford Newsservice.
STATEMENT OF THE PROCEEDINGS
On January 15, 1969, the Stanford Judicial
Council was notified by the office of the Dean of
Students that on the previous day a group of
persons, believed primarily to be Stanford
students, had allegedly disrupted a meeting of the
University Board of Trustees which had been held
at the Stanford Faculty Club. The Council was
asked to investigate.
Pursuant to the Legislative and Judicial Charter
of 1968, the Council sent out five judicial aides to
investigate and interview witnesses. The judicial
aides made a comprehensive report to the Council
which included photographs, lists of witnesses and
participants, transcripts of tape-recorded
interviews of many persons, and additional
statements, including those of a number of
potential defendants.
At the Council's behest, the Chairman
examined the report and, on the basis of the
information therein, determined to call before
him, and one other member of the Council sitting
with him, some thirty-nine persons for the purpose
of charging them with violations of the Campus
Policy on Disruptions of October 7, 1968, and of
the Fundamental Standard, and to show each the
evidence the Council had obtained through its
judicial aides regarding his activities.
The letter summoning these persons was sent
by mail; in addition a copy of the letter was
personally served on each of them. The letter
contained the following:
(1) A statement that the person was charged
with violations of the Disruption Policy and
of the Fundamental Standard.
(2) An outline of proceedings to be followed
during trial of the case.
(3) A copy of the Council's rules containing
the rights of defendants as set out in the
Legislative and Judicial Charter of 1968.
(4) A date and time to appear before the
Chairman of the Council for a conference.
Each person summoned duly appeared with the
sole exception of Jack Gerson, who has at no time
appeared or taken part in these proceedings.
The Council Chairman, sitting with at least one
other member of the Council, showed each
defendant the evidence regarding his activities and
explained to each defendant the procedure to be
followed for trial. That procedure required a
bifurcated hearing. The first hearing would be
designed solely to determine what acts each
student had, or had not committed; the second
hearing would be devoted solely to matters of
motivation.
With but one exception, Fred Cohen, who was
also charged with acts of intimidation, each
student, for purposes of the present hearings, was
charged only with having disrupted the Board of
Trustees meeting; no specific acts of violence,
threats, etc. were alleged. [Defendant James
Johnson was also charged with having set a false
fire alarm but all hearings on this charge were
suspended pending decision on such a charge in the
county civil courts. ]
Every defendant was given an opportunity to
admit to the charge against him. He was told that
to do so would eliminate the need for the first
hearing in his case, but that he would still be
permitted to do three things;
(1) Take part in the motivational hearing.
(2) Argue the invalidity of the Campus Policy
on Disruptions.
(3) Argue that the Fundamental Standard does
not cover disruption without a showing of
specific acts such as violence, threats,
blocking access of other persons, etc.
Each student was further informed that any
specific facts regarding his individual conduct
which were brought out during a fact hearing
would be considered by the Council in deciding his
case.
Although defendants were told they had a right
to remain silent, many wished to discuss the nature
of their participation. On the basis of their
statements and the Council's continuing
investigation of the case, charges were withdrawn
against nine persons. Of the remaining twenty-nine
defendants, the following twelve initially decided
to admit to the charges against them:
Allen Christelow
Richard Greenspan
HallamC. Hamilton
Carolyn M. Iverson
Barbara E. Lee
Michael M. Morton
Christine M. Mrak
Jeffrey J. Preefer
Guy D. Smyth
Don P. Stuart
D. Jeffrey Weil
Helen K. Williams
Thereafter, two additional students, Irwin
Busse and Marc Weiss, also decided to admit the
charges against them. Thus, when the case
proceeded to the first hearing, only the following
fifteen students were involved:
John W. Avery
Anne C. Bauer
Richard F. Bogart
Fred H. Cohen
Marc D. Heller
James E. Johnson
Virginia A. Linsley
David F. Pugh
George C. Reinhardt
James E. Shoch
Leonard M. Siegel
Stephen S. Smith
Michael D. Vawter
Joan Williams (Mrs. Rodney W.)
Rodney W. Williams
This factual hearing was open to the public and
took place on February 11, 12 and 13.
Considerable evidence was received, including the
testimony of some 24 witnesses.
The motivational hearing, also open to the
public, was held on February 21. All twenty-nine
defendants subscribed to an organized
presentation of their views. Thereafter each
defendant was given an opportunity to add further
information on his own behalf.
STATEMENT OF THE GENERAL FACTS
On the basis of the evidence presented during
the hearings, the Council finds the following facts:
At the October 1968 meeting of the Stanford
University Board of Trustees, a student, Yale
Braunstein, Speaker of the Student Legislature,
was permitted to address the board members,
urging them to hold open meetings with students.
The Board Chairman, shortly thereafter, wrote a
letter to Mr. Braunstein, thanking him for his
remarks but not specifically mentioning the issue
of open meetings. Mr. Braunstein replied with a
letter to the Board Chairman emphasizing the
importance of the open-meeting request.
Although at both the November 1968 and January
14, 1969 meetings of the Board, student leaders
were invited to and did sit with a number of Board
committees, the Board made no statement, either
to Mr. Braunstein or the Stanford student body at
large, concerning meetings of the Board itself,
which would be open to members of the Stanford
community.
On the morning of January 14,1969, a group of
students circulated throughout the campus a
document requesting that all interested persons

arrive at Bowman Alumni House at 12:30 p.m. for
the purpose of holding an open meeting with the
trustees. The document contained nine specific
demands regarding the operations of the
University and the Stanford Research Institute.
At approximately 12:30 p.m., when a group of
students had collected at Bowman, they learned
that the trustees were at the Stanford Faculty
Club. The students then held a meeting to
determine what action to take. At about this time
Associate Dean of Students, Willard Wyman,
entered Bowman where one of the students
demanded that Wyman carry a message to the
trustees asking for an open meeting. Although he
made it clear that he was not a "messenger boy"
for the students, Dean Wyman nevertheless did in
fact go to the Faculty Club to tell members of the
University administration, including President
Pitzer, that a group of students at Bowman wished
to have an open meeting with the trustees and
would not leave Bowman until such a meeting was
arranged.
Shortly thereafter Yale Braunstein, who had
observed the meeting at Bowman, and apparently
was concerned that Dean Wyman would not
deliver the message, decided to attempt to
communicate with the Board himself. He went to
the Faculty Club where he met Dean Wyman who
arranged for Braunstein to enter the rooms where
the trustees were located. Mr. Braunstein spoke to
the trustees, stating that the students at Bowman
not only demanded an open meeting but would
consider whatever meeting the trustees did hold to
be an open one. This message was given twice, once
in a room where the bulk of the trustees were
sitting and in an adjacent room where the
Investment Committee was in session.
After delivering this message, Braunstein
immediately withdrew and proceeded to Bowman
where he found the students leaving, en route to
the Faculty Club.
As soon as Braunstein left the trustees, they had
a short discussion and unanimously passed a
motion not to alter their policy which permits
non-trustees to attend Board meetings only upon
express invitation. No effort was made to
communicate this decision to the students.
Shortly thereafter, apparently just prior to
1:00 p.m., the students entered the inner patio of
the Faculty Club. They did so by proceeding up
the outer stairway facing Tresidder Union and
down the inner stairway to the courtyard.
The students gathered in the inner court where
some of them rapped on the sliding glass doors of
the rooms in which the trustees were sitting. The
students shouted and made use of a "bullhorn" to
attract the attention of and communicate with the
trustees inside. Individual students unsuccessfully
attempted to open the sliding doors.
The trustees continued with their business,
attempting as best they could to ignore the
students. A number of the students then entered
the Faculty Club from the patio and congregated
in the hallway outside the rooms where the
trustees were meeting.
From the time that the students entered the
patio, just before 1:00 p.m. until a few minutes
past 2:00 p.m., the students' attempts to attract
the attention of the trustees were intensified by
means of shouting, beating and kicking on the
doors, reading demands through a "bullhorn," etc.
From time to time students attempted to open the
doors from the trustees rooms into the hallway,
but they had been locked from the inside. On
occasion, administrative personnel and waiters
passed through these doors but did so carefully in
order to keep the students out. At one such time a
student in the hallway attempted to force his way
in but personnel inside the room managed to
reclose and lock the door.
Shortly before 2:00 p.m. the Faculty Advisory
Committee on Disruptions sent one of its
members, Professor Clebsch, to speak with
President Pitzer and Chairman of the Board Fuller.
Professor Chebsch reported that the noise inside
the room was so intense that it seriously disturbed
the conduct of the board meeting and made it
virtually impossible for the meeting to continue.
Testimony from persons who were inside the room
at the time supported this statement.
At about 2:00 p.m. the Advisory Committee
informed Dean Wyman that the students were in
violation of the Campus Policy on Disruptions and
requested that he warn them of this and take their
names. Dean Wyman then announced in the
hallway that the Disruption Policy had been
violated and that any students who did not leave
would have their names taken. He did not,
however, identify himself as an official of the
University acting as such. Substantial testimony
indicated that some students in the hallway may
not have heard his statement or known who he
was.
Dean Wyman then proceeded to take the names
of students who remained in the hallway and in the
patio. A number of students did leave and their
names were not recorded; some others who did
remain refused to reveal their identity or gave false
names. As Dean Wyman moved through the
hallway taking names he was subjected to taunts
and occasional threats of violence.
By 2:15 p.m. most of the students who
remained after the warning congregated in the
hallway where they held an informal meeting to
determine their course of action; some students
argued that they should not remain at the Faculty
Club.
While this meeting continued the noise level
subsided substantially.
At about 2:25 p.m. one of the students gained
entrance to the trustees' rooms through one of the
sliding doors from the patio. He moved directly
across the room and opened one of the doors to
the hallway. University personnel within the room
as well as some who were in the hallway attempted
to shut the door but the students in the hallway
moved forward to keep the door open.
At the door the students at first hung back,
shouting that they wanted an open meeting with
the trustees. Their demands were read through a
bullhorn. Meanwhile a line of administrative
officers within the room formed at the open door
to prevent students from gaining entry into the
room.
There ensued a period of confusion with
pushing and shoving taking place both on the part
of the students in the hallway and the personnel
from inside the room. During this time one
University official lost his balance and fell into the
hallway. Some students were shouting and at least
one was so agitated that he uttered a threat to one
of the administrative personnel at the door.
Shortly thereafter the students succeeded in
entering the room. One of the students was highly
agitated and he insulted and threatened the
trustees. At least two students grabbed copies of
the agenda of the trustees meeting and a struggle
ensued between one of these students and
university officials who sought to retrieve the
agenda he had taken.
Some of the students attempted to engage the
trustees in discussion; the trustees cut off their
meeting and left. The students remained in the
room for a short time thereafter and gradually
dispersed of their own volition.

DECISION ON LEGAL ISSUES
At the factual hearing on February 11-13,
1969, the defendants raised several legal
arguments regarding the Policy on Campus
Disruption as follows:
I. That the Policy was no longer in effect on
January 14, 1969, when the alleged acts of
disruption occurred.
11. That paragraph two of the Policy did not
apply because the facts show beyond any doubt
that University officials did not comply with
requirements set out therein, and
111. That paragraph one of the Policy was
inapplicable because it is dependent upon
University official's compliance with the
requirements of paragraph two.
I. Was the Policy in Effect
Validity of the Policy on Disruptions:
A. Nature of the Argument
1. The Policy on Campus Disruption was
issued on October 7, 1968 by Acting President
Robert Glaser.
2. On October 7, 1968, the Legislative and
Judicial Charter of 1968 was not yet in effect.
That charter was submitted to a vote of the
student body which approved its adoption until
March 1, 1969. The vote was completed on
October 15, 1968, and the results were
announced on October 16, 1968.
3. The invalidity of the Policy is based upon
Article I, Sections D(2)(b), D(2)(d), and
D(2)(e), which read as follows:
Section D(2)(b): When in his opinion an
emergency exists that requires the
promulgation of a regulation, including change
or repeal of an existing regulation, in less time
than is required under the procedure set forth
in section D.l, the President of the University
may promulgate an interim regulation to
become effective immediately upon
publication, provided the President shall first
consult with as many members of the SCLC as
practicable and, if time permits, shall first
afford the SCLC an opportunity to act under
section D.2a.
Section D(2)(d): An interim regulation
promulgated by the President under section
D.2b shall remain in effect for 90 days or until
it is repealed or amended by the SCLC,
whichever occurs first.
The SCLC may amend or repeal interim
regulations by the procedure provided in
section D.l or, with the written concurrence of
the President, SCLC may proceed under section
D.2a.
Section D(2)(e): If in the case of an interim
regulation promulgated under section D.2b, 90
days expire with no action by the SCLC, the
President may repromulgate the interim
regulation every 30 days until SCLC acts on it.
He shall inform the SCLC of each
promulgation.
The argument is that the Policy on Campus
Disruption is subject to these provisions of the
Charter and hence expired on January 7, 1968,
some 7 days prior to the time of the alleged
offenses in this case. The policy was never formally
renewed.
B. Analysis
1. The Disruption Policy was clearly
promulgated prior to ratification of the
Charter.
2. The terms of the Charter can in no way be
considered binding on such a policy, since the
Charter distinguishes clearly between those
policies promulgated prior to the Charter and
those promulgated thereafter.
Section I.E of the Charter clearly provides this
as follows:
E. Relation to Present University Policy.
Until such time as the Student Conduct
Legislative Council changes any present
University policy, that policy will remain in
effect. It is recommended that the first order
of business of the SCLC be the consideration
of areas in which there are currently conflicts
of law.
Section lI.D of the Charter obligates this
Council to enforce "present policy" until
altered in the following terms:
D. Relation to University Policy. Each
member of the Stanford Judicial Council is
obligated to enforce the regulations of the
Student Conduct Legislative Council or the
legislative product of the President acting
after consultation with the SCLC as provided
in Article I, section D.2b. Until such time as
the SCLC changes present policy, the SJC will
be obligated in the case of conflicts of law to
enforce the University policy.
3. The policy was terned an "interim" one by
Dr. Glaser at the time of its announcement, as
he clearly hoped for student approval of the
Charter and a subsequent consideration of the
policy by the Student Conduct Legislative
Council. Dr. Glaser's statement was as follows:
The consensus was that the policy should be
issued on an interim basis. Its interim
character is emphasized because we anticipate
further action by appropriate governing
bodies of the faculty and students, and in
particular by the proposed Student Conduct
Legislative Council. Subsequent actions of
these bodies may confirm, amend or
supercede the temporary policy, which will be
in effect until such actions are taken.
Obviously this statement in no way impugns,
but rather affirms the fact that the policy was
promulgated without time limit and was to be
considered in force until such time as the SCLC,
if established, altered that policy.
4. As of January 14, 1969, the SCLC had not
altered the Policy on Disruptions.
C. Holding
The University Policy on Campus Disruption
Issued October 7, 1968, was in full force and effect
on January 14,1969.
11. Does Paragraph 2of
the Policy Apply
A. Nature of the Argument
1. Paragraph 2 of the Policy on Campus
Disruption reads as follows:
Members of the faculty, staff, and student body
have an obligation to leave a university building
or facility when asked to do so in the
furtherance of the above regulations by a
member of the university community acting in
an official role, and identifying himself as such;
members of the faculty, staff, or student body
also have an obligation to identify themselves,
when requested to do so by such a member of
the university community who has reasonable
grounds to believe that the person(s) has
violated section (1) or (2) of this policy and
who has so informed the person(s).
2. Although a general announcement was
made by Dean Wyman that the students in the
Faculty Club had violated the Policy, the
evidence is legally insufficient to show that this
message was heard by any or all of the
defendants.
3. The evidence clearly shows that Dean
Wyman failed to announce that he was "a
member of the university community acting in
an official role," and, furthermore, reveals
conclusively that at least some defendants did
not know him.

4. It is thus argued that the Council can find no
violation of paragraph two of the Policy.
B. Analysis
1. Paragraph two of the Policy is quite clear in
its requirements. Individuals should not be
forced to leave a university building or reveal
their identify until they know that the
individual who requires them to do so is
properly authorized. Otherwise paragraph two
could be an instrument of widespread abuse.
2. It is easy enough for university officials,
once informed of this decision, to comply
strictly with the paragraph two requirements.
The Council finds such strict compliance
necessary even when it might appear that
persons making the request are doing so in their
official capacity.
3. The evidence is clear and uncontradicted
that the requirements of paragraph two of the
Policy were not met.
C. Holding
No defendant shall be held guilty of a violation
of paragraph two of the Policy on Campus
Disruption of October 7,1968.
111. Is Paragraph One of the
Policy Separate from Paragraph Two
A. Nature of the Argument
1. Paragraph one of the Policy states as
follows:
It is a violation of university policy for a
member of the faculty, staff, or student body
to (1) prevent or disrupt the effective carrying
out of a university function or approved
activity, such as lectures, meetings, interviews,
ceremonies, the conduct of university business
in a university office, and public events; (2)
obstruct the legitimate movement of any
person about the campus or in any university
building or facility.
2. Paragraph two of the Policy is in
"furtherance" of paragraph one. Hence, it is
argued that paragraph one is to be enforced
only through paragraph two. Since the
requirements of paragraph two have not been
met, there can be no guilt under the policy.
B. Analysis
1. Paragraph one of the Policy on Campus
Disruption clearly states that certain disruptive
conduct is improper. There is no logical way by
which paragraph one can be considered
dependent upon paragraph two. Otherwise an
individual who engaged in such disruption
could, merely by leaving before being told to do
so, immunize himself from liability under the
Policy. This would be an open invitation for
members of the University community to
engage in "hit-and-run" raids.
2. Paragraph two has an entirely different
focus than does paragrpah one. It is often
necessary to clear a building to prevent
disruption or to end disruption in progress.
Thus persons can be required to leave and their
failure to do so is a violation in and of itself,
apart from any disruption which does in fact
occur.
The required notification of paragraph two is
meaningless with regard to an individual who
has already broken up a lecture or a meeting.
The present case clearly illustrates this point.
Dean Wyman's failure to properly identify
himself eliminates any guilt for mere failure to
leave the building; surely, however, it does not
justify acts of disruption done both before and
after his statements.
As to such acts of disruption if the defendants
did not know Dean Wyman or know that he was
acting in his official capacity, as they
successfully argued regarding II above, what he
said or didn't say was of no relevance.
C. Holding
Paragraph one of the Policy on Campus
Disruption is wholly independent from paragraph
two and failure to comply with the terms of the
latter does not prohibit a charge under the former.
SPECIFIC FINDINGS AS TO GUILT
The Council finds as follows:
1. That in addition to those fourteen students
who admitted disruption, the remaining fifteen
defendants, who received a hearing on the facts,
were guilty of acts that disrupted "the effective
carrying out of a university function," under
the Policy on Campus Disruption of October 7,
1968.
(a) From the time the students first entered
the inner patio at the Faculty Club until
shortly after 2:00 p.m., they attempted to
force the trustees to discontinue their regular
meeting by shouting, pounding on doors and
windows, and making statements through a
bullhorn.
(b) That these acts disrupted the trustees'
meeting is unmistakably clear. Although the
trustees attempted to continue with their
regular business, the noise from outside made
it extremely difficult for them to do so.
(c) That these acts by defendants were
intended to disrupt the trustees' meeting is
also clear. The refusal of the trustees to
acknowledge the presence of the students, the
fact that the trustees shut and locked the
doors, and the fact that entry of the students
into the meeting room was resisted at all times
is substantial evidence that the trustees did
not want or intend to meet with the students
at that time and that the students knew this.
(d) Quite apart from the noisy attempts to
disrupt the trustees' meeting, the actual entry
of the students into the meeting room at
approximately 2:25 to 2:30 p.m., through a
line of university officials who clearly were
attempting to keep them out, itself
constituted a flagrant act of disruption. At
that point, the trustees who were attempting
to deal with items on their regular agenda, had
no choice but to stop what they were doing.
(e) It is clear from the evidence, including the
pictures taken at the scene, that all but one of
the fifteen defendants who requested a
hearing, entered or pushed forward in
attempting to enter the open door of the room
where the trustees were meeting. The
exception is James Johnson and the testimony
regarding Mr. Johnson unmistakably shows
him to have engaged in acts of disruption by
banging and kicking on the locked doors to
the meeting room.
2. That Mr. Richard F. Bogart has no defense
on the ground that he was present as a reporter
for KZSU Radio Station.
(a) An individual who engages in illegal acts is
not immunized merely because he belongs, or
in the present case, has reason to believe he
belongs, to a news organization. By his own
statements Mr. Bogart showed that he was
present as a participant in the demonstration.
(b) The Council finds no credible evidence
sufficient for a finding that Mr. Bogart should
be exonerated as a KZSU reporter. Obviously,
participation by a person in illegal activities
cannot be excused even if that person
ultimately reports upon those activities in the
news media.
(c) Furthermore, the evidence regarding Mr.
Bogart is clearly distinguishable from that
available to the Council regarding other
reporters who were not charged or against

whom charges were brought and then
dismissed. These other persons were in
attendance as assigned reporters or
photographers. They took photographs and
notes for news stories which were published
shortly thereafter, and in doing so they clearly
distinguished themselves from the defendants
who were engaged in the disruption. This is
simply not the case with Mr. Bogart.
FINDINGS REGARDING CULPABILITY
The Council finds as follows:
1. That like the fourteen defendants who
admitted to the charge against them, the
following twelve defendant who received a
hearing on the facts engaged in no acts of
aggravation beyond general disruption:
John W. Avery
Anne C. Bauer
Richard F. Bogart
Marc D. Heller
Virginia A. Linsley
David F. Pugh
George C. Reinhardt
James E. Shoch
Leonard M. Siegel
Michael D. Vawter
Joan Williams (Mrs. Rodney W.)
Rodney W. Williams
2. That in addition to general disruption the
following students engaged in specific
aggravating acts as indicated:
(a) Fred H.Cohen
(1) Threatened a University official who
blocked his entry into the trustees meeting
room by stating words such as "get your
hands off me baby or I'll bust your head,"
upon gaining entry into the room further
threatened the trustees not to meet on the
campus again, and in general was so violent
in his manner that several of hiscodefendants
restrained him, and
(2) Took from inside the room a folder
containing the agenda of the trustees
meeting and placed it under his coat.
(b) James E. Johnson
Violently kicked and beat on the doors and
windows to the trustees' room, with his
heavy boots and with a stick.
(c) Stephen S. Smith
(1) At approximaetely 2:25 p.m. managed
to open one of the sliding glass doors from
the patio into the turstees' room, walked
across that room, and, after a struggle with
several university officials, opened the
doorway to the hall and invited the students
congregated there to come into the room.
[At this point the Council would note the
fact that it was unable to locate any witness
who could testify as to how Mr. Smith
succeeded in opening the door from the
patio into the trustees' room. Mr. Smith was
not called in deference to his privilege
against self-incrimination and he chose not
to testify. The Council does find, however,
the circumstantial evidence is overwhelming
that Mr. Smith entered the room knowing
that it was disruptive for him to do so. This is
clearly shown by his subsequent actions in
immediately attempting to open the door to
the hallway against the will of those
present. ]
(2) Took a folder containing an agenda of
the trustees meeting and refused to return it
at the request of a number of University
personnel who finally were forced to engage
in a struggle with Mr. Smith to retrieve it.
3. That the University administration and the
Board of Trustees failed to make clear to the
defendants what proper channels, if any,
existed for communication between students
on the one hand and the administration and the
Board on the other.
4. That the defendants were strongly
motivated by sincerely held beliefs and felt
frustrated by their apparent inability to state
those beliefs to the Board.
5. That the failure of the University
administration and the Board of Trustees to
develop and maintain methods for the orderly
exchange of views with the student body
regarding issues relevant to the University was a
contributing factor of the disruption.
6. That the defendants in the present case were
less interested in the orderly exchange of views
than they were in the imposition of their views
on the rest of the community.

5. That with respect to orders to pay money
under 1(b), 2(b), 3(b) and 4(b) above
(a) The Dean of Students, in his discretion
may upon application by a defendant,
postpone payment of any sum when it appears
necessary to avoid undue financial hardship.
(b) Provided, however, that in no event shall a
university degree be awarded to any
defendant until he has paid the full amount
due.
Analysis of the Recommendations on Penalty
1. The Council's recommendations as to
penalty are based on a total view of the
defendants' conduct in light of the Council's
desire, as set forth in its Rules, to utilize
penalties to strengthen the Stanford
community.
2. The penalties would have been more severe
had the defendants been aware of the existence
of a reasonably means by which to make their
views known to the Board of Trustees.
3. At the same time, however, the Council
considered the offense to be a very serious one
that must not be repeated. If every member of
the Stanford community who feels strongly
about an issue is permitted to disrupt the
campus to impose his views on others, the result
would be chaos. Indeed such actions are
counterproductive in that they tend to
eliminate opportunity for legitimate discussion
and resolution of vital issues.
4. The Council's imposition of periods of
probation takes into consideration the threat
by defendants, made at the motivational
hearing, to engage in further serious acts of
disruption. The Council takes the position that
if during the period of probation any defendant
carries out such a threat, and is duly convicted
thereof, the University community has the
right to insist upon his suspension.
5. The Council views as most serious those acts
which, directly or by implication, threaten
violence to any person. Fortunately, in the
present case no one was injured and there was

no serious damage to property. Nevertheless, a
real danger of personal injury exists when
persons ostensibly engaged in a demonstration
to present their views, lose their tempers or
engage in physical altercations. The penalties to
three individuals reflect the Council's position,
based on clear evidence, that in varying degrees,
these individuals materially increased the
danger of physical violence and personal injury.
6. In order that the University community not
be misled, the Council wishes to make clear that
its decision in this case was not based on the
military draft policy of the United States or on
the draft status of any of the defendants.
Findingson Collateral Matters
The Council finds as follows:
1. That in light of the fact that every defendant
was clearly in violation of the Policy on Campus
Disruption of October 7, 1968, which policy
was valid and in force, the Council feels it
unnecessary to determine whether or not the
defendants were also in violation of the
Fundamental Standard. The answer to this
question would in no way affect the penalties
imposed.
2. That student witnesses have the obligation
to testify when called before the Council.
(a) In the present case a student was called to
testify as to events he observed at the Faculty
Club at the time of the disruption. He claimed
that he had been present as a reporter for the
Stanford Daily and therefore he was privileged
not to testify.
(b) The Council subpoenaed this witness
because he was known to have been present
and it was felt that defendants might have
wished to elicit information from him. The
defendants declined to ask him questions and
he was excused.
(c) The Council at that time, however, and
now, holds that the claimed privilege does not
exist, that it has not been recognized by the
courts of the land, that there is no justification
for such a privilege, and that the refusal to

testify on such grounds cannot and will not be
tolerated. [This in no way, however, governs
the Council's attitude toward the privilege of a
reporter not to reveal the name of a
confidential informant, which privilege has
both been recognized and rejected in various
courts. 1
3. That persons who attend a hearing of the
Stanford Judicial Council, including the
defendants and their counsel, have an
obligation not to impede, disrupt, or in any
manner interfere with the conduct of the
proceedings.
(a) A number of persons who attended the
factual hearing, particularly on the first night,
in obvious support of the defendants,
deliberately attempted to disrupt the
proceedings and did, in fact, cause
considerably noise and confusion.
(b) The Council is not a court of law; it has no
bailiff or sheriff's department to maintain
order. Thus any handful of persons, who are
so inclined can seriously impede the
proceedings.
(c) The defendants themselves, and their
counsel, must share the blame for the
disorder, particularly during the first night.
They continually directed their comments to
their supporters in the audience rather than to
the members of the Council and they
attempted in numerous ways, including the
muttering of threats, to ridicule the Council
and to make its job impossible. All this was
done in spite of the Council's solemn promise,
duly kept, that they would be given an
opportunity at the hearings on motivatioto
say what they so desired about the basic issues
underlying their actions.
The Council does note that the defendants did
intercede during the most serious disruptions
to assist the Council, primarily to prevent the
Council from closing the hearings, and that
after the first night of the hearings, the
defendants were more restrained. Moreover,

the Council recognizes and appreciates the
efforts of Mr. Doron Weinberg, who, as sole
counsel after the first and second evenings,
assisted in maintaining order and preserving
the decorum of the proceedings.
(d) On the basis of its experience in this case,
regarding meetings that are open to the
general public, the Council will seriously
consider in future cases limiting the number of
persons in attendance. Furthermore, the
Council serves warning on those who would
disrupt future proceedings that the Council is
disposed to find in contempt persons who
engage in disruption of its proceedings and to
recommend immediate imposition of severe
sanctions.
4. That defendant Jack Gerson, who
apparently withdrew from the University
subsequent to January 14, 1969, but prior to
the hearings in this case, has failed to respond to
summonses from the Council duly served upon
him.
The Council recommends that, in accordance
with the Legislative and Judicial Charter of
1968, the University immediately withdraw
Mr. Gerson's registration privileges until such
time as he appears before the Council for the
trial of his case.
THIS DECISION AND ALL ITS PARTS ARE
UNANIMOUSLY ADOPTED BY THE
MEMBERS OF THE COUNCIL.
Dated: February 27, 1969
Editor's Note: The Judicial Council's reference
to "the faculty advisory Committee on
Disruptions" is, in fact, the President's advisory
group on campus disruptions. After hearing from
members of this group. President Pitzer informed
Dean Wyman that the students were believed to be
in violation of the campus policy on disruptions.
The faculty members did not instruct Wyman
directly.
Incremental costs for publication of this report
have been paid for the the Stanford Newsservice.
STATEMENT OF THE PROCEEDINGS
On January 15, 1969, the Stanford Judicial
Council was notified by the office of the Dean of
Students that on the previous day a group of
persons, believed primarily to be Stanford
students, had allegedly disrupted a meeting of the
University Board of Trustees which had been held
at the Stanford Faculty Club. The Council was
asked to investigate.
Pursuant to the Legislative and Judicial Charter
of 1968, the Council sent out five judicial aides to
investigate and interview witnesses. The judicial
aides made a comprehensive report to the Council
which included photographs, lists of witnesses and
participants, transcripts of tape-recorded
interviews of many persons, and additional
statements, including those of a number of
potential defendants.
At the Council's behest, the Chairman
examined the report and, on the basis of the
information therein, determined to call before
him, and one other member of the Council sitting
with him, some thirty-nine persons for the purpose
of charging them with violations of the Campus
Policy on Disruptions of October 7, 1968, and of
the Fundamental Standard, and to show each the
evidence the Council had obtained through its
judicial aides regarding his activities.
The letter summoning these persons was sent
by mail; in addition a copy of the letter was
personally served on each of them. The letter
contained the following:
(1) A statement that the person was charged
with violations of the Disruption Policy and
of the Fundamental Standard.
(2) An outline of proceedings to be followed
during trial of the case.
(3) A copy of the Council's rules containing
the rights of defendants as set out in the
Legislative and Judicial Charter of 1968.
(4) A date and time to appear before the
Chairman of the Council for a conference.
Each person summoned duly appeared with the
sole exception of Jack Gerson, who has at no time
appeared or taken part in these proceedings.
The Council Chairman, sitting with at least one
other member of the Council, showed each
defendant the evidence regarding his activities and
explained to each defendant the procedure to be
followed for trial. That procedure required a
bifurcated hearing. The first hearing would be
designed solely to determine what acts each
student had, or had not committed; the second
hearing would be devoted solely to matters of
motivation.
With but one exception, Fred Cohen, who was
also charged with acts of intimidation, each
student, for purposes of the present hearings, was
charged only with having disrupted the Board of
Trustees meeting; no specific acts of violence,
threats, etc. were alleged. [Defendant James
Johnson was also charged with having set a false
fire alarm but all hearings on this charge were
suspended pending decision on such a charge in the
county civil courts. ]
Every defendant was given an opportunity to
admit to the charge against him. He was told that
to do so would eliminate the need for the first
hearing in his case, but that he would still be
permitted to do three things;
(1) Take part in the motivational hearing.
(2) Argue the invalidity of the Campus Policy
on Disruptions.
(3) Argue that the Fundamental Standard does
not cover disruption without a showing of
specific acts such as violence, threats,
blocking access of other persons, etc.
Each student was further informed that any
specific facts regarding his individual conduct
which were brought out during a fact hearing
would be considered by the Council in deciding his
case.
Although defendants were told they had a right
to remain silent, many wished to discuss the nature
of their participation. On the basis of their
statements and the Council's continuing
investigation of the case, charges were withdrawn
against nine persons. Of the remaining twenty-nine
defendants, the following twelve initially decided
to admit to the charges against them:
Allen Christelow
Richard Greenspan
HallamC. Hamilton
Carolyn M. Iverson
Barbara E. Lee
Michael M. Morton
Christine M. Mrak
Jeffrey J. Preefer
Guy D. Smyth
Don P. Stuart
D. Jeffrey Weil
Helen K. Williams
Thereafter, two additional students, Irwin
Busse and Marc Weiss, also decided to admit the
charges against them. Thus, when the case
proceeded to the first hearing, only the following
fifteen students were involved:
John W. Avery
Anne C. Bauer
Richard F. Bogart
Fred H. Cohen
Marc D. Heller
James E. Johnson
Virginia A. Linsley
David F. Pugh
George C. Reinhardt
James E. Shoch
Leonard M. Siegel
Stephen S. Smith
Michael D. Vawter
Joan Williams (Mrs. Rodney W.)
Rodney W. Williams
This factual hearing was open to the public and
took place on February 11, 12 and 13.
Considerable evidence was received, including the
testimony of some 24 witnesses.
The motivational hearing, also open to the
public, was held on February 21. All twenty-nine
defendants subscribed to an organized
presentation of their views. Thereafter each
defendant was given an opportunity to add further
information on his own behalf.
STATEMENT OF THE GENERAL FACTS
On the basis of the evidence presented during
the hearings, the Council finds the following facts:
At the October 1968 meeting of the Stanford
University Board of Trustees, a student, Yale
Braunstein, Speaker of the Student Legislature,
was permitted to address the board members,
urging them to hold open meetings with students.
The Board Chairman, shortly thereafter, wrote a
letter to Mr. Braunstein, thanking him for his
remarks but not specifically mentioning the issue
of open meetings. Mr. Braunstein replied with a
letter to the Board Chairman emphasizing the
importance of the open-meeting request.
Although at both the November 1968 and January
14, 1969 meetings of the Board, student leaders
were invited to and did sit with a number of Board
committees, the Board made no statement, either
to Mr. Braunstein or the Stanford student body at
large, concerning meetings of the Board itself,
which would be open to members of the Stanford
community.
On the morning of January 14,1969, a group of
students circulated throughout the campus a
document requesting that all interested persons

arrive at Bowman Alumni House at 12:30 p.m. for
the purpose of holding an open meeting with the
trustees. The document contained nine specific
demands regarding the operations of the
University and the Stanford Research Institute.
At approximately 12:30 p.m., when a group of
students had collected at Bowman, they learned
that the trustees were at the Stanford Faculty
Club. The students then held a meeting to
determine what action to take. At about this time
Associate Dean of Students, Willard Wyman,
entered Bowman where one of the students
demanded that Wyman carry a message to the
trustees asking for an open meeting. Although he
made it clear that he was not a "messenger boy"
for the students, Dean Wyman nevertheless did in
fact go to the Faculty Club to tell members of the
University administration, including President
Pitzer, that a group of students at Bowman wished
to have an open meeting with the trustees and
would not leave Bowman until such a meeting was
arranged.
Shortly thereafter Yale Braunstein, who had
observed the meeting at Bowman, and apparently
was concerned that Dean Wyman would not
deliver the message, decided to attempt to
communicate with the Board himself. He went to
the Faculty Club where he met Dean Wyman who
arranged for Braunstein to enter the rooms where
the trustees were located. Mr. Braunstein spoke to
the trustees, stating that the students at Bowman
not only demanded an open meeting but would
consider whatever meeting the trustees did hold to
be an open one. This message was given twice, once
in a room where the bulk of the trustees were
sitting and in an adjacent room where the
Investment Committee was in session.
After delivering this message, Braunstein
immediately withdrew and proceeded to Bowman
where he found the students leaving, en route to
the Faculty Club.
As soon as Braunstein left the trustees, they had
a short discussion and unanimously passed a
motion not to alter their policy which permits
non-trustees to attend Board meetings only upon
express invitation. No effort was made to
communicate this decision to the students.
Shortly thereafter, apparently just prior to
1:00 p.m., the students entered the inner patio of
the Faculty Club. They did so by proceeding up
the outer stairway facing Tresidder Union and
down the inner stairway to the courtyard.
The students gathered in the inner court where
some of them rapped on the sliding glass doors of
the rooms in which the trustees were sitting. The
students shouted and made use of a "bullhorn" to
attract the attention of and communicate with the
trustees inside. Individual students unsuccessfully
attempted to open the sliding doors.
The trustees continued with their business,
attempting as best they could to ignore the
students. A number of the students then entered
the Faculty Club from the patio and congregated
in the hallway outside the rooms where the
trustees were meeting.
From the time that the students entered the
patio, just before 1:00 p.m. until a few minutes
past 2:00 p.m., the students' attempts to attract
the attention of the trustees were intensified by
means of shouting, beating and kicking on the
doors, reading demands through a "bullhorn," etc.
From time to time students attempted to open the
doors from the trustees rooms into the hallway,
but they had been locked from the inside. On
occasion, administrative personnel and waiters
passed through these doors but did so carefully in
order to keep the students out. At one such time a
student in the hallway attempted to force his way
in but personnel inside the room managed to
reclose and lock the door.
Shortly before 2:00 p.m. the Faculty Advisory
Committee on Disruptions sent one of its
members, Professor Clebsch, to speak with
President Pitzer and Chairman of the Board Fuller.
Professor Chebsch reported that the noise inside
the room was so intense that it seriously disturbed
the conduct of the board meeting and made it
virtually impossible for the meeting to continue.
Testimony from persons who were inside the room
at the time supported this statement.
At about 2:00 p.m. the Advisory Committee
informed Dean Wyman that the students were in
violation of the Campus Policy on Disruptions and
requested that he warn them of this and take their
names. Dean Wyman then announced in the
hallway that the Disruption Policy had been
violated and that any students who did not leave
would have their names taken. He did not,
however, identify himself as an official of the
University acting as such. Substantial testimony
indicated that some students in the hallway may
not have heard his statement or known who he
was.
Dean Wyman then proceeded to take the names
of students who remained in the hallway and in the
patio. A number of students did leave and their
names were not recorded; some others who did
remain refused to reveal their identity or gave false
names. As Dean Wyman moved through the
hallway taking names he was subjected to taunts
and occasional threats of violence.
By 2:15 p.m. most of the students who
remained after the warning congregated in the
hallway where they held an informal meeting to
determine their course of action; some students
argued that they should not remain at the Faculty
Club.
While this meeting continued the noise level
subsided substantially.
At about 2:25 p.m. one of the students gained
entrance to the trustees' rooms through one of the
sliding doors from the patio. He moved directly
across the room and opened one of the doors to
the hallway. University personnel within the room
as well as some who were in the hallway attempted
to shut the door but the students in the hallway
moved forward to keep the door open.
At the door the students at first hung back,
shouting that they wanted an open meeting with
the trustees. Their demands were read through a
bullhorn. Meanwhile a line of administrative
officers within the room formed at the open door
to prevent students from gaining entry into the
room.
There ensued a period of confusion with
pushing and shoving taking place both on the part
of the students in the hallway and the personnel
from inside the room. During this time one
University official lost his balance and fell into the
hallway. Some students were shouting and at least
one was so agitated that he uttered a threat to one
of the administrative personnel at the door.
Shortly thereafter the students succeeded in
entering the room. One of the students was highly
agitated and he insulted and threatened the
trustees. At least two students grabbed copies of
the agenda of the trustees meeting and a struggle
ensued between one of these students and
university officials who sought to retrieve the
agenda he had taken.
Some of the students attempted to engage the
trustees in discussion; the trustees cut off their
meeting and left. The students remained in the
room for a short time thereafter and gradually
dispersed of their own volition.

DECISION ON LEGAL ISSUES
At the factual hearing on February 11-13,
1969, the defendants raised several legal
arguments regarding the Policy on Campus
Disruption as follows:
I. That the Policy was no longer in effect on
January 14, 1969, when the alleged acts of
disruption occurred.
11. That paragraph two of the Policy did not
apply because the facts show beyond any doubt
that University officials did not comply with
requirements set out therein, and
111. That paragraph one of the Policy was
inapplicable because it is dependent upon
University official's compliance with the
requirements of paragraph two.
I. Was the Policy in Effect
Validity of the Policy on Disruptions:
A. Nature of the Argument
1. The Policy on Campus Disruption was
issued on October 7, 1968 by Acting President
Robert Glaser.
2. On October 7, 1968, the Legislative and
Judicial Charter of 1968 was not yet in effect.
That charter was submitted to a vote of the
student body which approved its adoption until
March 1, 1969. The vote was completed on
October 15, 1968, and the results were
announced on October 16, 1968.
3. The invalidity of the Policy is based upon
Article I, Sections D(2)(b), D(2)(d), and
D(2)(e), which read as follows:
Section D(2)(b): When in his opinion an
emergency exists that requires the
promulgation of a regulation, including change
or repeal of an existing regulation, in less time
than is required under the procedure set forth
in section D.l, the President of the University
may promulgate an interim regulation to
become effective immediately upon
publication, provided the President shall first
consult with as many members of the SCLC as
practicable and, if time permits, shall first
afford the SCLC an opportunity to act under
section D.2a.
Section D(2)(d): An interim regulation
promulgated by the President under section
D.2b shall remain in effect for 90 days or until
it is repealed or amended by the SCLC,
whichever occurs first.
The SCLC may amend or repeal interim
regulations by the procedure provided in
section D.l or, with the written concurrence of
the President, SCLC may proceed under section
D.2a.
Section D(2)(e): If in the case of an interim
regulation promulgated under section D.2b, 90
days expire with no action by the SCLC, the
President may repromulgate the interim
regulation every 30 days until SCLC acts on it.
He shall inform the SCLC of each
promulgation.
The argument is that the Policy on Campus
Disruption is subject to these provisions of the
Charter and hence expired on January 7, 1968,
some 7 days prior to the time of the alleged
offenses in this case. The policy was never formally
renewed.
B. Analysis
1. The Disruption Policy was clearly
promulgated prior to ratification of the
Charter.
2. The terms of the Charter can in no way be
considered binding on such a policy, since the
Charter distinguishes clearly between those
policies promulgated prior to the Charter and
those promulgated thereafter.
Section I.E of the Charter clearly provides this
as follows:
E. Relation to Present University Policy.
Until such time as the Student Conduct
Legislative Council changes any present
University policy, that policy will remain in
effect. It is recommended that the first order
of business of the SCLC be the consideration
of areas in which there are currently conflicts
of law.
Section lI.D of the Charter obligates this
Council to enforce "present policy" until
altered in the following terms:
D. Relation to University Policy. Each
member of the Stanford Judicial Council is
obligated to enforce the regulations of the
Student Conduct Legislative Council or the
legislative product of the President acting
after consultation with the SCLC as provided
in Article I, section D.2b. Until such time as
the SCLC changes present policy, the SJC will
be obligated in the case of conflicts of law to
enforce the University policy.
3. The policy was terned an "interim" one by
Dr. Glaser at the time of its announcement, as
he clearly hoped for student approval of the
Charter and a subsequent consideration of the
policy by the Student Conduct Legislative
Council. Dr. Glaser's statement was as follows:
The consensus was that the policy should be
issued on an interim basis. Its interim
character is emphasized because we anticipate
further action by appropriate governing
bodies of the faculty and students, and in
particular by the proposed Student Conduct
Legislative Council. Subsequent actions of
these bodies may confirm, amend or
supercede the temporary policy, which will be
in effect until such actions are taken.
Obviously this statement in no way impugns,
but rather affirms the fact that the policy was
promulgated without time limit and was to be
considered in force until such time as the SCLC,
if established, altered that policy.
4. As of January 14, 1969, the SCLC had not
altered the Policy on Disruptions.
C. Holding
The University Policy on Campus Disruption
Issued October 7, 1968, was in full force and effect
on January 14,1969.
11. Does Paragraph 2of
the Policy Apply
A. Nature of the Argument
1. Paragraph 2 of the Policy on Campus
Disruption reads as follows:
Members of the faculty, staff, and student body
have an obligation to leave a university building
or facility when asked to do so in the
furtherance of the above regulations by a
member of the university community acting in
an official role, and identifying himself as such;
members of the faculty, staff, or student body
also have an obligation to identify themselves,
when requested to do so by such a member of
the university community who has reasonable
grounds to believe that the person(s) has
violated section (1) or (2) of this policy and
who has so informed the person(s).
2. Although a general announcement was
made by Dean Wyman that the students in the
Faculty Club had violated the Policy, the
evidence is legally insufficient to show that this
message was heard by any or all of the
defendants.
3. The evidence clearly shows that Dean
Wyman failed to announce that he was "a
member of the university community acting in
an official role," and, furthermore, reveals
conclusively that at least some defendants did
not know him.

4. It is thus argued that the Council can find no
violation of paragraph two of the Policy.
B. Analysis
1. Paragraph two of the Policy is quite clear in
its requirements. Individuals should not be
forced to leave a university building or reveal
their identify until they know that the
individual who requires them to do so is
properly authorized. Otherwise paragraph two
could be an instrument of widespread abuse.
2. It is easy enough for university officials,
once informed of this decision, to comply
strictly with the paragraph two requirements.
The Council finds such strict compliance
necessary even when it might appear that
persons making the request are doing so in their
official capacity.
3. The evidence is clear and uncontradicted
that the requirements of paragraph two of the
Policy were not met.
C. Holding
No defendant shall be held guilty of a violation
of paragraph two of the Policy on Campus
Disruption of October 7,1968.
111. Is Paragraph One of the
Policy Separate from Paragraph Two
A. Nature of the Argument
1. Paragraph one of the Policy states as
follows:
It is a violation of university policy for a
member of the faculty, staff, or student body
to (1) prevent or disrupt the effective carrying
out of a university function or approved
activity, such as lectures, meetings, interviews,
ceremonies, the conduct of university business
in a university office, and public events; (2)
obstruct the legitimate movement of any
person about the campus or in any university
building or facility.
2. Paragraph two of the Policy is in
"furtherance" of paragraph one. Hence, it is
argued that paragraph one is to be enforced
only through paragraph two. Since the
requirements of paragraph two have not been
met, there can be no guilt under the policy.
B. Analysis
1. Paragraph one of the Policy on Campus
Disruption clearly states that certain disruptive
conduct is improper. There is no logical way by
which paragraph one can be considered
dependent upon paragraph two. Otherwise an
individual who engaged in such disruption
could, merely by leaving before being told to do
so, immunize himself from liability under the
Policy. This would be an open invitation for
members of the University community to
engage in "hit-and-run" raids.
2. Paragraph two has an entirely different
focus than does paragrpah one. It is often
necessary to clear a building to prevent
disruption or to end disruption in progress.
Thus persons can be required to leave and their
failure to do so is a violation in and of itself,
apart from any disruption which does in fact
occur.
The required notification of paragraph two is
meaningless with regard to an individual who
has already broken up a lecture or a meeting.
The present case clearly illustrates this point.
Dean Wyman's failure to properly identify
himself eliminates any guilt for mere failure to
leave the building; surely, however, it does not
justify acts of disruption done both before and
after his statements.
As to such acts of disruption if the defendants
did not know Dean Wyman or know that he was
acting in his official capacity, as they
successfully argued regarding II above, what he
said or didn't say was of no relevance.
C. Holding
Paragraph one of the Policy on Campus
Disruption is wholly independent from paragraph
two and failure to comply with the terms of the
latter does not prohibit a charge under the former.
SPECIFIC FINDINGS AS TO GUILT
The Council finds as follows:
1. That in addition to those fourteen students
who admitted disruption, the remaining fifteen
defendants, who received a hearing on the facts,
were guilty of acts that disrupted "the effective
carrying out of a university function," under
the Policy on Campus Disruption of October 7,
1968.
(a) From the time the students first entered
the inner patio at the Faculty Club until
shortly after 2:00 p.m., they attempted to
force the trustees to discontinue their regular
meeting by shouting, pounding on doors and
windows, and making statements through a
bullhorn.
(b) That these acts disrupted the trustees'
meeting is unmistakably clear. Although the
trustees attempted to continue with their
regular business, the noise from outside made
it extremely difficult for them to do so.
(c) That these acts by defendants were
intended to disrupt the trustees' meeting is
also clear. The refusal of the trustees to
acknowledge the presence of the students, the
fact that the trustees shut and locked the
doors, and the fact that entry of the students
into the meeting room was resisted at all times
is substantial evidence that the trustees did
not want or intend to meet with the students
at that time and that the students knew this.
(d) Quite apart from the noisy attempts to
disrupt the trustees' meeting, the actual entry
of the students into the meeting room at
approximately 2:25 to 2:30 p.m., through a
line of university officials who clearly were
attempting to keep them out, itself
constituted a flagrant act of disruption. At
that point, the trustees who were attempting
to deal with items on their regular agenda, had
no choice but to stop what they were doing.
(e) It is clear from the evidence, including the
pictures taken at the scene, that all but one of
the fifteen defendants who requested a
hearing, entered or pushed forward in
attempting to enter the open door of the room
where the trustees were meeting. The
exception is James Johnson and the testimony
regarding Mr. Johnson unmistakably shows
him to have engaged in acts of disruption by
banging and kicking on the locked doors to
the meeting room.
2. That Mr. Richard F. Bogart has no defense
on the ground that he was present as a reporter
for KZSU Radio Station.
(a) An individual who engages in illegal acts is
not immunized merely because he belongs, or
in the present case, has reason to believe he
belongs, to a news organization. By his own
statements Mr. Bogart showed that he was
present as a participant in the demonstration.
(b) The Council finds no credible evidence
sufficient for a finding that Mr. Bogart should
be exonerated as a KZSU reporter. Obviously,
participation by a person in illegal activities
cannot be excused even if that person
ultimately reports upon those activities in the
news media.
(c) Furthermore, the evidence regarding Mr.
Bogart is clearly distinguishable from that
available to the Council regarding other
reporters who were not charged or against

whom charges were brought and then
dismissed. These other persons were in
attendance as assigned reporters or
photographers. They took photographs and
notes for news stories which were published
shortly thereafter, and in doing so they clearly
distinguished themselves from the defendants
who were engaged in the disruption. This is
simply not the case with Mr. Bogart.
FINDINGS REGARDING CULPABILITY
The Council finds as follows:
1. That like the fourteen defendants who
admitted to the charge against them, the
following twelve defendant who received a
hearing on the facts engaged in no acts of
aggravation beyond general disruption:
John W. Avery
Anne C. Bauer
Richard F. Bogart
Marc D. Heller
Virginia A. Linsley
David F. Pugh
George C. Reinhardt
James E. Shoch
Leonard M. Siegel
Michael D. Vawter
Joan Williams (Mrs. Rodney W.)
Rodney W. Williams
2. That in addition to general disruption the
following students engaged in specific
aggravating acts as indicated:
(a) Fred H.Cohen
(1) Threatened a University official who
blocked his entry into the trustees meeting
room by stating words such as "get your
hands off me baby or I'll bust your head,"
upon gaining entry into the room further
threatened the trustees not to meet on the
campus again, and in general was so violent
in his manner that several of hiscodefendants
restrained him, and
(2) Took from inside the room a folder
containing the agenda of the trustees
meeting and placed it under his coat.
(b) James E. Johnson
Violently kicked and beat on the doors and
windows to the trustees' room, with his
heavy boots and with a stick.
(c) Stephen S. Smith
(1) At approximaetely 2:25 p.m. managed
to open one of the sliding glass doors from
the patio into the turstees' room, walked
across that room, and, after a struggle with
several university officials, opened the
doorway to the hall and invited the students
congregated there to come into the room.
[At this point the Council would note the
fact that it was unable to locate any witness
who could testify as to how Mr. Smith
succeeded in opening the door from the
patio into the trustees' room. Mr. Smith was
not called in deference to his privilege
against self-incrimination and he chose not
to testify. The Council does find, however,
the circumstantial evidence is overwhelming
that Mr. Smith entered the room knowing
that it was disruptive for him to do so. This is
clearly shown by his subsequent actions in
immediately attempting to open the door to
the hallway against the will of those
present. ]
(2) Took a folder containing an agenda of
the trustees meeting and refused to return it
at the request of a number of University
personnel who finally were forced to engage
in a struggle with Mr. Smith to retrieve it.
3. That the University administration and the
Board of Trustees failed to make clear to the
defendants what proper channels, if any,
existed for communication between students
on the one hand and the administration and the
Board on the other.
4. That the defendants were strongly
motivated by sincerely held beliefs and felt
frustrated by their apparent inability to state
those beliefs to the Board.
5. That the failure of the University
administration and the Board of Trustees to
develop and maintain methods for the orderly
exchange of views with the student body
regarding issues relevant to the University was a
contributing factor of the disruption.
6. That the defendants in the present case were
less interested in the orderly exchange of views
than they were in the imposition of their views
on the rest of the community.

necessary to avoid undue financial hardship.
(b) Provided, however, that in no event shall a
university degree be awarded to any

due.
Analysis of the Recommendations on Penalty
1. The Council's recommendations as to
penalty are based on a total view of the
defendants' conduct in light of the Council's
desire, as set forth in its Rules, to utilize
penalties to strengthen the Stanford
community.
2. The penalties would have been more severe
had the defendants been aware of the existence
of a reasonably means by which to make their
views known to the Board of Trustees.
3. At the same time, however, the Council
considered the offense to be a very serious one
that must not be repeated. If every member of
the Stanford community who feels strongly
about an issue is permitted to disrupt the
campus to impose his views on others, the result
would be chaos. Indeed such actions are
counterproductive in that they tend to
eliminate opportunity for legitimate discussion
and resolution of vital issues.
4. The Council's imposition of periods of
probation takes into consideration the threat
by defendants, made at the motivational
hearing, to engage in further serious acts of
disruption. The Council takes the position that
if during the period of probation any defendant
carries out such a threat, and is duly convicted
thereof, the University community has the
right to insist upon his suspension.
5. The Council views as most serious those acts
which, directly or by implication, threaten
violence to any person. Fortunately, in the
present case no one was injured and there was

no serious damage to property. Nevertheless, a
real danger of personal injury exists when
persons ostensibly engaged in a demonstration
to present their views, lose their tempers or
engage in physical altercations. The penalties to
three individuals reflect the Council's position,
based on clear evidence, that in varying degrees,
these individuals materially increased the
danger of physical violence and personal injury.
6. In order that the University community not
be misled, the Council wishes to make clear that
its decision in this case was not based on the
military draft policy of the United States or on
the draft status of any of the defendants.
Findingson Collateral Matters
The Council finds as follows:
1. That in light of the fact that every defendant
was clearly in violation of the Policy on Campus
Disruption of October 7, 1968, which policy
was valid and in force, the Council feels it
unnecessary to determine whether or not the
defendants were also in violation of the
Fundamental Standard. The answer to this
question would in no way affect the penalties
imposed.
2. That student witnesses have the obligation
to testify when called before the Council.
(a) In the present case a student was called to
testify as to events he observed at the Faculty
Club at the time of the disruption. He claimed
that he had been present as a reporter for the
Stanford Daily and therefore he was privileged
not to testify.
(b) The Council subpoenaed this witness
because he was known to have been present
and it was felt that defendants might have
wished to elicit information from him. The
defendants declined to ask him questions and
he was excused.
(c) The Council at that time, however, and
now, holds that the claimed privilege does not
exist, that it has not been recognized by the
courts of the land, that there is no justification
for such a privilege, and that the refusal to

testify on such grounds cannot and will not be
tolerated. [This in no way, however, governs
the Council's attitude toward the privilege of a
reporter not to reveal the name of a
confidential informant, which privilege has
both been recognized and rejected in various
courts. 1
3. That persons who attend a hearing of the
Stanford Judicial Council, including the
defendants and their counsel, have an
obligation not to impede, disrupt, or in any
manner interfere with the conduct of the
proceedings.
(a) A number of persons who attended the
factual hearing, particularly on the first night,
in obvious support of the defendants,
deliberately attempted to disrupt the
proceedings and did, in fact, cause
considerably noise and confusion.
(b) The Council is not a court of law; it has no
bailiff or sheriff's department to maintain
order. Thus any handful of persons, who are
so inclined can seriously impede the
proceedings.
(c) The defendants themselves, and their
counsel, must share the blame for the
disorder, particularly during the first night.
They continually directed their comments to
their supporters in the audience rather than to
the members of the Council and they
attempted in numerous ways, including the
muttering of threats, to ridicule the Council
and to make its job impossible. All this was
done in spite of the Council's solemn promise,
duly kept, that they would be given an
opportunity at the hearings on motivatioto
say what they so desired about the basic issues
underlying their actions.
The Council does note that the defendants did
intercede during the most serious disruptions
to assist the Council, primarily to prevent the
Council from closing the hearings, and that
after the first night of the hearings, the
defendants were more restrained. Moreover,

the Council recognizes and appreciates the
efforts of Mr. Doron Weinberg, who, as sole
counsel after the first and second evenings,
assisted in maintaining order and preserving
the decorum of the proceedings.
(d) On the basis of its experience in this case,
regarding meetings that are open to the
general public, the Council will seriously
consider in future cases limiting the number of
persons in attendance. Furthermore, the
Council serves warning on those who would
disrupt future proceedings that the Council is
disposed to find in contempt persons who
engage in disruption of its proceedings and to
recommend immediate imposition of severe
sanctions.
4. That defendant Jack Gerson, who
apparently withdrew from the University
subsequent to January 14, 1969, but prior to
the hearings in this case, has failed to respond to
summonses from the Council duly served upon
him.
The Council recommends that, in accordance
with the Legislative and Judicial Charter of
1968, the University immediately withdraw
Mr. Gerson's registration privileges until such
time as he appears before the Council for the
trial of his case.
THIS DECISION AND ALL ITS PARTS ARE
UNANIMOUSLY ADOPTED BY THE
MEMBERS OF THE COUNCIL.

Editor's Note: The Judicial Council's reference
to "the faculty advisory Committee on
Disruptions" is, in fact, the President's advisory
group on campus disruptions. After hearing from
members of this group. President Pitzer informed
Dean Wyman that the students were believed to be
in violation of the campus policy on disruptions.
The faculty members did not instruct Wyman
directly.
