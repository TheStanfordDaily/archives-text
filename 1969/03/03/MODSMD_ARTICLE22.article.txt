# Provost's Report On BSU Talks
## 
### 
Statement by Richard W. Lyman
on the Progress of Discussions on
Minority Group Programs.
The discussions which the
President, Mr. Simmons and I
began with leaders of the Black
Student Union on February 20
have resumed following assurances
that repetition of the destructive
events of that day would be neither
encouraged nor condoned by the
BSU. These discussions have now
reached a point at which an interim
report to the community is
advisable.
The subjects which have been
discussed so far may be grouped
roughly into three categories:
student financial aid and
counseling, academic programs,
and extra-curricular activities.
What follows is a summary of the
discussions under each of those
headings.
Financial Aid and Counseling
All of the evidence that we have
suggests that many minority
students have financial problems
that differ in size and in kind from
those faced by most of the student
body. On the average, their actual
financial need is greater than that
of the average student. This has
been well documented at Stanford
and elsewhere. This basic source of
problems is further complicated by
two other considerations. First, it
is often not in the best academic
interest of minority students to
hold a job during the school year,
and second, many of these students
appear to have serious problems in
managing the money that they do
have.
In recognition of the latter
problem, a search has been in
progress for several months for a
person to serve as Associate
Director of Financial Aids and as a
member of the Dean of Students
staff. His main responsibility
would be to offer financial
counseling to minority students.
Inevitably, he will be involved in
other forms of counseling, hence
his association with the Dean of
Students. This search will be
pressed vigorously, with a view to
an early appointment.
With respect to the amount and
composition of financial aid to
minority students, it should be
noted first that the University has
been moving to the policy of full
grant aid, up to financial need, for
freshmen minority students. This
policy will apply to all freshmen
minority students in 1969, so that
no such student will need to work.
This move will be coupled with an
attempt to devise a four year
package which would be clearly
explained to incoming students at
the time of their awards and which
would start with a grant in the first
year and move progressively over
the next three years to a smaller
grant component and larger loan
and work components.

Finally, on the subject of
financial aid, the needs of all
present minority students will be
reviewed carefully this Spring by
Mr. Simmons and the Financial Aid
Office. Such adjustments as seem
appropriate will be made. Any
student having urgent problems
need not await this review; he
should consult Mr. Simmons
promptly.
Academic Programs
Stanford has been a leader
among private universities in the
development of a sound academic
program in African and
Afro-American Studies. Faculty
and students have worked well
together in this area and the
foundation that has been laid gives
ample reason for optimism about
the future of this field of study at
Stanford.
Since the undergraduate
program in African and
Afro-American Studies has just
been inaugurated, however, it is
too early toÂ» decide what
administrative structure it will
ultimately have.
For the time being, the program
can best recruit the most able
faculty by offering appointments
in traditional departments coupled
with teaching duties in the
undergraduate program.
The committee administering
the program realizes that more
course offerings in the
Afro-American area are needed, and
in conjunction with other
departments it is making every
effort to recruit faculty and
expand course listings. As the
program course offerings and
number of majors increase, the
possibility of departmental status
is not ruled out. A
recommendation for departmental
status would normally be initiated
by faculty teaching in the program.
Plans already made for the
coming academic year will increase
the size and visibility of the
program. It will have its own
budget which will include a salary
of a program director with whom
the University is now negotiating.
This man, a renowned scholar in
Afro-American studies, who is
black, will also teach the Racism
and Prejudice course. The program
budget will allow for secretarial
assistance and occasional lectures
by visiting scholars. After the fall
quarter of 1969 the director and
some other members of the
program faculty will be housed in
one location in space to be vacated
in the inner quadrangle. A
description of the program and its
course listings will appear in the
1969-70 edition of Courses and
Degrees now in press.
Extra-Curricular Activities
Many of the expressed wishes of
black students for a more
meaningful experience at Stanford
fall outside the formal curriculum.

This does not mean that they
would not be "educational" nor
does it mean that they would not
be valuable; it means only that the
University's curriculum never has
and never can embrace all of those
activities in which students engage
and from which they learn or
profit. A number of activities of
this character have been discussed
and some conclusions reached.
Since early February, a number
of black students have been
engaged in tutoring at Ravenswood
High School. Twelve of them are
being paid with funds provided by
the University. These funds will
shortly be exhausted. This is a
valuable activity, both to our
students and to the community,
and it ought to be continued.
Thirty one students are able and
willing to engage in this activity for
the rest of this academic year and
efforts are being made to solicit
private gift funds for that purpose
and for a continuation of the
program through the summer.
Assuming that these efforts are
successful, the future of the
program beyond this year is still in
doubt. We propose, therefore, to
work cooperatively with the school
authorities in the development of
an application for federal funds for
the program.
In the course of our discussion
of this subject the question of
academic credit for this activity
was raised. It was made clear that
the faculty judges what is
appropriate for credit and we
therefore encouraged the students
to take the initiative in raising the
matter with relevant departments.
I am aware of courses which make
use of field work experiences of
this or a similar kind and I
encourage departments to consider
seriously whether the work that
these students will be doing can be
used to contribute to a legitimate
academic objective.
We have had a good deal of
discussion of various kinds of
cultural programs. For several
months now, a search has been
made for adequate space to house
black student cultural activities.
Before these discussions began it
had been decided that Frehe House
would be used for that purpose. It
will be available for use in
mid-March.
Much work remains to be done
in building a lively cultural
program, and there are some
cautions to be observed. The most
obvious caution is that we have
been talking about programs to be
developed and run by students and
there is a limit to the number and
kind of activities in which students
can engage without doing serious
damage to their academic
programs. A second obvious
caution is that it is easier to make
plans than it is to raise money, and

we must be careful not to confuse a
plan with a commitment to its
fruition. With those constraints in
mind, we discussed a number of
points.
First, the creation of a student
Black Drama Group, now under
way, will be aided by financial
support for two one-act plays to be
produced this Spring in connection
with Afro-American Cultural
Week. This is, of course, contingent
on the approval of a realistic
budget, and it is our intention to
ask the ASSU to participate in the
financing of this student activity.
To assist the BSU in planning this
production a consultant will be
retained for two weeks. The details
of this arrangement will need to be
worked out.
Second, the BSU newsletter
serves as an important means of
communication among black
students on campus. Additional
funds in the amount of $50 per
week are needed to keep this going
for the rest of the academic year. I
am asking the ASSU and the Dean
of Students office to share this
cost.
Third, as encouragement to the
development of cultural programs
the BSU will consult with the
English Department for the
purpose of bringing to campus for a
few weeks in the Spring a black
writer in residence, and for the
purpose of developing such
programs in the interim.
Finally on this subject, the
students responsible for the
development of cultural programs
will be working on material for an
application for financing to be
presented to foundations. The
President's staff will assist in the
formulation of these applications
and will be responsible for their
transmittal.
That concludes the summary of
our discussions to date. In my view
they are going well and they are
producing constructive results.
One last point remains to be made:
The events of February 20 were a
bitter shock to this campus. The
quick response of the Academic
Senate is ample testimony to that.
What remains to be said about
those events is that they did not
change by one degree either the
substance or the timing of the
University's commitment to
improving educational
opportunities for minorities. The
violent acts of that day were not
only unacceptable in principle,
they were unnecessary in fact.
Therefore, it is not our intention to
ignore them or to pretend that they
did not happen. Preliminary
investigations have taken place,
and the results of these will be
turned over to the Stanford
Judicial Council for further
investigation and such action as it
may determine is appropriate.

program in African and
Afro-American Studies has just
been inaugurated, however, it is
too early toÂ» decide what
administrative structure it will
ultimately have.
For the time being, the program
can best recruit the most able
faculty by offering appointments
in traditional departments coupled
with teaching duties in the
undergraduate program.
The committee administering
the program realizes that more
course offerings in the
Afro-American area are needed, and
in conjunction with other
departments it is making every
effort to recruit faculty and
expand course listings. As the
program course offerings and
number of majors increase, the
possibility of departmental status
is not ruled out. A
recommendation for departmental
status would normally be initiated
by faculty teaching in the program.
Plans already made for the
coming academic year will increase
the size and visibility of the
program. It will have its own
budget which will include a salary
of a program director with whom
the University is now negotiating.
This man, a renowned scholar in
Afro-American studies, who is
black, will also teach the Racism
and Prejudice course. The program
budget will allow for secretarial
assistance and occasional lectures
by visiting scholars. After the fall
quarter of 1969 the director and
some other members of the
program faculty will be housed in
one location in space to be vacated
in the inner quadrangle. A
description of the program and its
course listings will appear in the
1969-70 edition of Courses and
Degrees now in press.
Extra-Curricular Activities
Many of the expressed wishes of
black students for a more
meaningful experience at Stanford
fall outside the formal curriculum.

This does not mean that they
would not be "educational" nor
does it mean that they would not
be valuable; it means only that the
University's curriculum never has
and never can embrace all of those
activities in which students engage
and from which they learn or
profit. A number of activities of
this character have been discussed
and some conclusions reached.
Since early February, a number
of black students have been
engaged in tutoring at Ravenswood
High School. Twelve of them are
being paid with funds provided by
the University. These funds will
shortly be exhausted. This is a
valuable activity, both to our
students and to the community,
and it ought to be continued.
Thirty one students are able and
willing to engage in this activity for
the rest of this academic year and
efforts are being made to solicit
private gift funds for that purpose
and for a continuation of the
program through the summer.
Assuming that these efforts are
successful, the future of the
program beyond this year is still in
doubt. We propose, therefore, to
work cooperatively with the school
authorities in the development of
an application for federal funds for
the program.
In the course of our discussion
of this subject the question of
academic credit for this activity
was raised. It was made clear that
the faculty judges what is
appropriate for credit and we
therefore encouraged the students
to take the initiative in raising the
matter with relevant departments.
I am aware of courses which make
use of field work experiences of
this or a similar kind and I
encourage departments to consider
seriously whether the work that
these students will be doing can be
used to contribute to a legitimate
academic objective.
We have had a good deal of
discussion of various kinds of
cultural programs. For several
months now, a search has been
made for adequate space to house
black student cultural activities.
Before these discussions began it
had been decided that Frehe House
would be used for that purpose. It
will be available for use in
mid-March.
Much work remains to be done
in building a lively cultural
program, and there are some
cautions to be observed. The most
obvious caution is that we have
been talking about programs to be
developed and run by students and
there is a limit to the number and
kind of activities in which students
can engage without doing serious
damage to their academic
programs. A second obvious
caution is that it is easier to make
plans than it is to raise money, and

we must be careful not to confuse a
plan with a commitment to its
fruition. With those constraints in
mind, we discussed a number of
points.
First, the creation of a student
Black Drama Group, now under
way, will be aided by financial
support for two one-act plays to be
produced this Spring in connection
with Afro-American Cultural
Week. This is, of course, contingent
on the approval of a realistic
budget, and it is our intention to
ask the ASSU to participate in the
financing of this student activity.
To assist the BSU in planning this
production a consultant will be
retained for two weeks. The details
of this arrangement will need to be
worked out.
Second, the BSU newsletter
serves as an important means of
communication among black
students on campus. Additional
funds in the amount of $50 per
week are needed to keep this going
for the rest of the academic year. I
am asking the ASSU and the Dean
of Students office to share this
cost.
Third, as encouragement to the
development of cultural programs
the BSU will consult with the
English Department for the
purpose of bringing to campus for a
few weeks in the Spring a black
writer in residence, and for the
purpose of developing such
programs in the interim.
Finally on this subject, the
students responsible for the
development of cultural programs
will be working on material for an
application for financing to be
presented to foundations. The
President's staff will assist in the
formulation of these applications
and will be responsible for their
transmittal.
That concludes the summary of
our discussions to date. In my view
they are going well and they are
producing constructive results.
One last point remains to be made:
The events of February 20 were a
bitter shock to this campus. The
quick response of the Academic
Senate is ample testimony to that.
What remains to be said about
those events is that they did not
change by one degree either the
substance or the timing of the
University's commitment to
improving educational
opportunities for minorities. The
violent acts of that day were not
only unacceptable in principle,
they were unnecessary in fact.
Therefore, it is not our intention to
ignore them or to pretend that they
did not happen. Preliminary
investigations have taken place,
and the results of these will be
turned over to the Stanford
Judicial Council for further
investigation and such action as it
may determine is appropriate.
Statement by Richard W. Lyman
on the Progress of Discussions on
Minority Group Programs.
The discussions which the
President, Mr. Simmons and I
began with leaders of the Black
Student Union on February 20
have resumed following assurances
that repetition of the destructive
events of that day would be neither
encouraged nor condoned by the
BSU. These discussions have now
reached a point at which an interim
report to the community is
advisable.
The subjects which have been
discussed so far may be grouped
roughly into three categories:
student financial aid and
counseling, academic programs,
and extra-curricular activities.
What follows is a summary of the
discussions under each of those
headings.
Financial Aid and Counseling
All of the evidence that we have
suggests that many minority
students have financial problems
that differ in size and in kind from
those faced by most of the student
body. On the average, their actual
financial need is greater than that
of the average student. This has
been well documented at Stanford
and elsewhere. This basic source of
problems is further complicated by
two other considerations. First, it
is often not in the best academic
interest of minority students to
hold a job during the school year,
and second, many of these students
appear to have serious problems in
managing the money that they do
have.
In recognition of the latter
problem, a search has been in
progress for several months for a
person to serve as Associate
Director of Financial Aids and as a
member of the Dean of Students
staff. His main responsibility
would be to offer financial
counseling to minority students.
Inevitably, he will be involved in
other forms of counseling, hence
his association with the Dean of
Students. This search will be
pressed vigorously, with a view to
an early appointment.
With respect to the amount and
composition of financial aid to
minority students, it should be
noted first that the University has
been moving to the policy of full
grant aid, up to financial need, for
freshmen minority students. This
policy will apply to all freshmen
minority students in 1969, so that
no such student will need to work.
This move will be coupled with an
attempt to devise a four year
package which would be clearly
explained to incoming students at
the time of their awards and which
would start with a grant in the first
year and move progressively over
the next three years to a smaller
grant component and larger loan
and work components.

Finally, on the subject of
financial aid, the needs of all
present minority students will be
reviewed carefully this Spring by
Mr. Simmons and the Financial Aid
Office. Such adjustments as seem
appropriate will be made. Any
student having urgent problems
need not await this review; he
should consult Mr. Simmons
promptly.
Academic Programs
Stanford has been a leader
among private universities in the
development of a sound academic
program in African and
Afro-American Studies. Faculty
and students have worked well
together in this area and the
foundation that has been laid gives
ample reason for optimism about
the future of this field of study at
Stanford.
Since the undergraduate
program in African and
Afro-American Studies has just
been inaugurated, however, it is
too early toÂ» decide what
administrative structure it will
ultimately have.

can best recruit the most able

Extra-Curricular Activities
Many of the expressed wishes of
black students for a more
meaningful experience at Stanford
fall outside the formal curriculum.

This does not mean that they
would not be "educational" nor
does it mean that they would not
be valuable; it means only that the
University's curriculum never has
and never can embrace all of those
activities in which students engage
and from which they learn or
profit. A number of activities of
this character have been discussed
and some conclusions reached.
Since early February, a number
of black students have been
engaged in tutoring at Ravenswood
High School. Twelve of them are
being paid with funds provided by
the University. These funds will
shortly be exhausted. This is a
valuable activity, both to our
students and to the community,
and it ought to be continued.
Thirty one students are able and
willing to engage in this activity for
the rest of this academic year and
efforts are being made to solicit
private gift funds for that purpose
and for a continuation of the
program through the summer.
Assuming that these efforts are
successful, the future of the
program beyond this year is still in
doubt. We propose, therefore, to
work cooperatively with the school
authorities in the development of
an application for federal funds for
the program.

this or a similar kind and I
encourage departments to consider
seriously whether the work that
these students will be doing can be
used to contribute to a legitimate
academic objective.
We have had a good deal of
discussion of various kinds of
cultural programs. For several
months now, a search has been
made for adequate space to house
black student cultural activities.
Before these discussions began it
had been decided that Frehe House
would be used for that purpose. It
will be available for use in
mid-March.
Much work remains to be done
in building a lively cultural
program, and there are some
cautions to be observed. The most
obvious caution is that we have
been talking about programs to be
developed and run by students and
there is a limit to the number and
kind of activities in which students
can engage without doing serious
damage to their academic
programs. A second obvious
caution is that it is easier to make
plans than it is to raise money, and

we must be careful not to confuse a
plan with a commitment to its
fruition. With those constraints in
mind, we discussed a number of
points.
First, the creation of a student
Black Drama Group, now under
way, will be aided by financial
support for two one-act plays to be
produced this Spring in connection
with Afro-American Cultural
Week. This is, of course, contingent
on the approval of a realistic
budget, and it is our intention to
ask the ASSU to participate in the
financing of this student activity.
To assist the BSU in planning this
production a consultant will be
retained for two weeks. The details
of this arrangement will need to be
worked out.
Second, the BSU newsletter
serves as an important means of
communication among black
students on campus. Additional
funds in the amount of $50 per
week are needed to keep this going
for the rest of the academic year. I
am asking the ASSU and the Dean
of Students office to share this
cost.
Third, as encouragement to the
development of cultural programs
the BSU will consult with the
English Department for the
purpose of bringing to campus for a
few weeks in the Spring a black
writer in residence, and for the
purpose of developing such
programs in the interim.
Finally on this subject, the
students responsible for the
development of cultural programs
will be working on material for an
application for financing to be
presented to foundations. The
President's staff will assist in the
formulation of these applications
and will be responsible for their
transmittal.
That concludes the summary of
our discussions to date. In my view
they are going well and they are
producing constructive results.
One last point remains to be made:
The events of February 20 were a
bitter shock to this campus. The
quick response of the Academic
Senate is ample testimony to that.
What remains to be said about
those events is that they did not
change by one degree either the
substance or the timing of the
University's commitment to
improving educational
opportunities for minorities. The
violent acts of that day were not
only unacceptable in principle,
they were unnecessary in fact.
Therefore, it is not our intention to
ignore them or to pretend that they
did not happen. Preliminary
investigations have taken place,
and the results of these will be
turned over to the Stanford
Judicial Council for further
investigation and such action as it
may determine is appropriate.
Statement by Richard W. Lyman
on the Progress of Discussions on
Minority Group Programs.
The discussions which the
President, Mr. Simmons and I
began with leaders of the Black
Student Union on February 20
have resumed following assurances
that repetition of the destructive
events of that day would be neither
encouraged nor condoned by the
BSU. These discussions have now
reached a point at which an interim
report to the community is
advisable.
The subjects which have been
discussed so far may be grouped
roughly into three categories:
student financial aid and
counseling, academic programs,
and extra-curricular activities.
What follows is a summary of the
discussions under each of those
headings.
Financial Aid and Counseling
All of the evidence that we have
suggests that many minority
students have financial problems
that differ in size and in kind from
those faced by most of the student
body. On the average, their actual
financial need is greater than that
of the average student. This has
been well documented at Stanford
and elsewhere. This basic source of
problems is further complicated by
two other considerations. First, it
is often not in the best academic
interest of minority students to
hold a job during the school year,
and second, many of these students
appear to have serious problems in
managing the money that they do
have.
In recognition of the latter
problem, a search has been in
progress for several months for a
person to serve as Associate
Director of Financial Aids and as a
member of the Dean of Students
staff. His main responsibility
would be to offer financial
counseling to minority students.
Inevitably, he will be involved in
other forms of counseling, hence
his association with the Dean of
Students. This search will be
pressed vigorously, with a view to
an early appointment.
With respect to the amount and
composition of financial aid to
minority students, it should be
noted first that the University has
been moving to the policy of full
grant aid, up to financial need, for
freshmen minority students. This
policy will apply to all freshmen
minority students in 1969, so that
no such student will need to work.
This move will be coupled with an
attempt to devise a four year
package which would be clearly
explained to incoming students at
the time of their awards and which
would start with a grant in the first
year and move progressively over
the next three years to a smaller
grant component and larger loan
and work components.

Finally, on the subject of
financial aid, the needs of all
present minority students will be
reviewed carefully this Spring by
Mr. Simmons and the Financial Aid
Office. Such adjustments as seem
appropriate will be made. Any
student having urgent problems
need not await this review; he
should consult Mr. Simmons
promptly.
Academic Programs
Stanford has been a leader
among private universities in the
development of a sound academic
program in African and
Afro-American Studies. Faculty
and students have worked well
together in this area and the
foundation that has been laid gives
ample reason for optimism about
the future of this field of study at
Stanford.
Since the undergraduate
program in African and
Afro-American Studies has just
been inaugurated, however, it is
too early toÂ» decide what
administrative structure it will
ultimately have.
For the time being, the program
can best recruit the most able
faculty by offering appointments
in traditional departments coupled
with teaching duties in the
undergraduate program.
The committee administering
the program realizes that more
course offerings in the
Afro-American area are needed, and
in conjunction with other
departments it is making every
effort to recruit faculty and
expand course listings. As the
program course offerings and
number of majors increase, the
possibility of departmental status
is not ruled out. A
recommendation for departmental
status would normally be initiated
by faculty teaching in the program.
Plans already made for the
coming academic year will increase
the size and visibility of the
program. It will have its own
budget which will include a salary
of a program director with whom
the University is now negotiating.
This man, a renowned scholar in
Afro-American studies, who is
black, will also teach the Racism
and Prejudice course. The program
budget will allow for secretarial
assistance and occasional lectures
by visiting scholars. After the fall
quarter of 1969 the director and
some other members of the
program faculty will be housed in
one location in space to be vacated
in the inner quadrangle. A
description of the program and its
course listings will appear in the
1969-70 edition of Courses and
Degrees now in press.
Extra-Curricular Activities
Many of the expressed wishes of
black students for a more
meaningful experience at Stanford
fall outside the formal curriculum.

This does not mean that they
would not be "educational" nor
does it mean that they would not
be valuable; it means only that the
University's curriculum never has
and never can embrace all of those
activities in which students engage
and from which they learn or
profit. A number of activities of
this character have been discussed
and some conclusions reached.
Since early February, a number
of black students have been
engaged in tutoring at Ravenswood
High School. Twelve of them are
being paid with funds provided by
the University. These funds will
shortly be exhausted. This is a
valuable activity, both to our
students and to the community,
and it ought to be continued.
Thirty one students are able and
willing to engage in this activity for
the rest of this academic year and
efforts are being made to solicit
private gift funds for that purpose
and for a continuation of the
program through the summer.
Assuming that these efforts are
successful, the future of the
program beyond this year is still in
doubt. We propose, therefore, to
work cooperatively with the school
authorities in the development of
an application for federal funds for
the program.
In the course of our discussion
of this subject the question of
academic credit for this activity
was raised. It was made clear that
the faculty judges what is
appropriate for credit and we
therefore encouraged the students
to take the initiative in raising the
matter with relevant departments.
I am aware of courses which make
use of field work experiences of
this or a similar kind and I
encourage departments to consider
seriously whether the work that
these students will be doing can be
used to contribute to a legitimate
academic objective.
We have had a good deal of

The events of February 20 were a
bitter shock to this campus. The

What remains to be said about
those events is that they did not
change by one degree either the
substance or the timing of the
University's commitment to
improving educational
opportunities for minorities. The
violent acts of that day were not
only unacceptable in principle,
they were unnecessary in fact.
Therefore, it is not our intention to
ignore them or to pretend that they
did not happen. Preliminary
investigations have taken place,
and the results of these will be
turned over to the Stanford
Judicial Council for further
investigation and such action as it
may determine is appropriate.
Statement by Richard W. Lyman
on the Progress of Discussions on
Minority Group Programs.
The discussions which the
President, Mr. Simmons and I
began with leaders of the Black
Student Union on February 20
have resumed following assurances
that repetition of the destructive
events of that day would be neither
encouraged nor condoned by the
BSU. These discussions have now
reached a point at which an interim
report to the community is
advisable.
The subjects which have been
discussed so far may be grouped
roughly into three categories:
student financial aid and
counseling, academic programs,
and extra-curricular activities.
What follows is a summary of the
discussions under each of those
headings.
Financial Aid and Counseling
All of the evidence that we have
suggests that many minority
students have financial problems
that differ in size and in kind from
those faced by most of the student
body. On the average, their actual
financial need is greater than that
of the average student. This has
been well documented at Stanford
and elsewhere. This basic source of
problems is further complicated by
two other considerations. First, it
is often not in the best academic
interest of minority students to
hold a job during the school year,
and second, many of these students
appear to have serious problems in
managing the money that they do
have.
In recognition of the latter
problem, a search has been in
progress for several months for a
person to serve as Associate
Director of Financial Aids and as a
member of the Dean of Students
staff. His main responsibility
would be to offer financial
counseling to minority students.
Inevitably, he will be involved in
other forms of counseling, hence
his association with the Dean of
Students. This search will be
pressed vigorously, with a view to
an early appointment.
With respect to the amount and
composition of financial aid to
minority students, it should be
noted first that the University has
been moving to the policy of full
grant aid, up to financial need, for
freshmen minority students. This
policy will apply to all freshmen
minority students in 1969, so that
no such student will need to work.
This move will be coupled with an
attempt to devise a four year
package which would be clearly
explained to incoming students at
the time of their awards and which
would start with a grant in the first
year and move progressively over
the next three years to a smaller
grant component and larger loan
and work components.

Finally, on the subject of
financial aid, the needs of all
present minority students will be
reviewed carefully this Spring by
Mr. Simmons and the Financial Aid
Office. Such adjustments as seem
appropriate will be made. Any
student having urgent problems
need not await this review; he
should consult Mr. Simmons
promptly.
Academic Programs
Stanford has been a leader
among private universities in the
development of a sound academic
program in African and
Afro-American Studies. Faculty
and students have worked well
together in this area and the
foundation that has been laid gives
ample reason for optimism about
the future of this field of study at
Stanford.
Since the undergraduate
program in African and
Afro-American Studies has just
been inaugurated, however, it is
too early toÂ» decide what
administrative structure it will
ultimately have.
For the time being, the program
can best recruit the most able
faculty by offering appointments
in traditional departments coupled
with teaching duties in the
undergraduate program.
The committee administering
the program realizes that more
course offerings in the
Afro-American area are needed, and
in conjunction with other
departments it is making every
effort to recruit faculty and
expand course listings. As the
program course offerings and
number of majors increase, the
possibility of departmental status
is not ruled out. A
recommendation for departmental
status would normally be initiated
by faculty teaching in the program.
Plans already made for the
coming academic year will increase
the size and visibility of the
program. It will have its own
budget which will include a salary
of a program director with whom
the University is now negotiating.
This man, a renowned scholar in
Afro-American studies, who is
black, will also teach the Racism
and Prejudice course. The program
budget will allow for secretarial
assistance and occasional lectures
by visiting scholars. After the fall
quarter of 1969 the director and
some other members of the
program faculty will be housed in
one location in space to be vacated
in the inner quadrangle. A
description of the program and its
course listings will appear in the
1969-70 edition of Courses and
Degrees now in press.
Extra-Curricular Activities
Many of the expressed wishes of
black students for a more
meaningful experience at Stanford
fall outside the formal curriculum.

This does not mean that they
would not be "educational" nor
does it mean that they would not
be valuable; it means only that the
University's curriculum never has
and never can embrace all of those
activities in which students engage
and from which they learn or
profit. A number of activities of
this character have been discussed
and some conclusions reached.
Since early February, a number
of black students have been
engaged in tutoring at Ravenswood
High School. Twelve of them are
being paid with funds provided by
the University. These funds will
shortly be exhausted. This is a
valuable activity, both to our
students and to the community,
and it ought to be continued.
Thirty one students are able and
willing to engage in this activity for
the rest of this academic year and
efforts are being made to solicit
private gift funds for that purpose
and for a continuation of the
program through the summer.
Assuming that these efforts are
successful, the future of the
program beyond this year is still in
doubt. We propose, therefore, to
work cooperatively with the school
authorities in the development of
an application for federal funds for
the program.
In the course of our discussion
of this subject the question of
academic credit for this activity
was raised. It was made clear that
the faculty judges what is
appropriate for credit and we
therefore encouraged the students
to take the initiative in raising the
matter with relevant departments.
I am aware of courses which make
use of field work experiences of
this or a similar kind and I
encourage departments to consider
seriously whether the work that
these students will be doing can be
used to contribute to a legitimate
academic objective.
We have had a good deal of
discussion of various kinds of
cultural programs. For several
months now, a search has been
made for adequate space to house
black student cultural activities.
Before these discussions began it
had been decided that Frehe House
would be used for that purpose. It
will be available for use in
mid-March.
Much work remains to be done
in building a lively cultural
program, and there are some
cautions to be observed. The most
obvious caution is that we have
been talking about programs to be
developed and run by students and
there is a limit to the number and
kind of activities in which students
can engage without doing serious
damage to their academic
programs. A second obvious
caution is that it is easier to make
plans than it is to raise money, and

we must be careful not to confuse a
plan with a commitment to its
fruition. With those constraints in
mind, we discussed a number of
points.
First, the creation of a student
Black Drama Group, now under
way, will be aided by financial
support for two one-act plays to be
produced this Spring in connection
with Afro-American Cultural
Week. This is, of course, contingent
on the approval of a realistic
budget, and it is our intention to
ask the ASSU to participate in the
financing of this student activity.
To assist the BSU in planning this
production a consultant will be
retained for two weeks. The details
of this arrangement will need to be
worked out.
Second, the BSU newsletter
serves as an important means of
communication among black
students on campus. Additional
funds in the amount of $50 per
week are needed to keep this going
for the rest of the academic year. I
am asking the ASSU and the Dean
of Students office to share this
cost.
Third, as encouragement to the
development of cultural programs
the BSU will consult with the
English Department for the
purpose of bringing to campus for a
few weeks in the Spring a black
writer in residence, and for the
purpose of developing such
programs in the interim.
Finally on this subject, the
students responsible for the
development of cultural programs
will be working on material for an
application for financing to be
presented to foundations. The
President's staff will assist in the
formulation of these applications
and will be responsible for their
transmittal.
That concludes the summary of
our discussions to date. In my view
they are going well and they are
producing constructive results.
One last point remains to be made:
The events of February 20 were a
bitter shock to this campus. The
quick response of the Academic
Senate is ample testimony to that.
What remains to be said about
those events is that they did not
change by one degree either the
substance or the timing of the
University's commitment to
improving educational
opportunities for minorities. The
violent acts of that day were not
only unacceptable in principle,
they were unnecessary in fact.
Therefore, it is not our intention to
ignore them or to pretend that they
did not happen. Preliminary
investigations have taken place,
and the results of these will be
turned over to the Stanford
Judicial Council for further
investigation and such action as it

among private universities in the
development of a sound academic
program in African and
Afro-American Studies. Faculty
and students have worked well
together in this area and the
foundation that has been laid gives
ample reason for optimism about
the future of this field of study at
Stanford.
Since the undergraduate
program in African and
Afro-American Studies has just
been inaugurated, however, it is
too early toÂ» decide what
administrative structure it will
ultimately have.
For the time being, the program
can best recruit the most able
faculty by offering appointments
in traditional departments coupled
with teaching duties in the
undergraduate program.
The committee administering
the program realizes that more
course offerings in the
Afro-American area are needed, and
in conjunction with other
departments it is making every
effort to recruit faculty and
expand course listings. As the
program course offerings and
number of majors increase, the
possibility of departmental status
is not ruled out. A
recommendation for departmental
status would normally be initiated
by faculty teaching in the program.
Plans already made for the
coming academic year will increase
the size and visibility of the
program. It will have its own
budget which will include a salary
of a program director with whom
the University is now negotiating.
This man, a renowned scholar in
Afro-American studies, who is
black, will also teach the Racism
and Prejudice course. The program
budget will allow for secretarial
assistance and occasional lectures
by visiting scholars. After the fall
quarter of 1969 the director and
some other members of the
program faculty will be housed in
one location in space to be vacated
in the inner quadrangle. A
description of the program and its
course listings will appear in the
1969-70 edition of Courses and
Degrees now in press.
Extra-Curricular Activities
Many of the expressed wishes of
black students for a more
meaningful experience at Stanford
fall outside the formal curriculum.

This does not mean that they
would not be "educational" nor
does it mean that they would not
be valuable; it means only that the
University's curriculum never has
and never can embrace all of those
activities in which students engage
and from which they learn or
profit. A number of activities of
this character have been discussed
and some conclusions reached.
Since early February, a number
of black students have been
engaged in tutoring at Ravenswood
High School. Twelve of them are
being paid with funds provided by
the University. These funds will
shortly be exhausted. This is a
valuable activity, both to our
students and to the community,
and it ought to be continued.
Thirty one students are able and
willing to engage in this activity for
the rest of this academic year and
efforts are being made to solicit
private gift funds for that purpose
and for a continuation of the
program through the summer.
Assuming that these efforts are
successful, the future of the
program beyond this year is still in
doubt. We propose, therefore, to
work cooperatively with the school
authorities in the development of
an application for federal funds for
the program.
In the course of our discussion
of this subject the question of
academic credit for this activity
was raised. It was made clear that
the faculty judges what is
appropriate for credit and we
therefore encouraged the students
to take the initiative in raising the
matter with relevant departments.
I am aware of courses which make
use of field work experiences of
this or a similar kind and I
encourage departments to consider
seriously whether the work that
these students will be doing can be
used to contribute to a legitimate
academic objective.
We have had a good deal of
discussion of various kinds of
cultural programs. For several
months now, a search has been
made for adequate space to house
black student cultural activities.
Before these discussions began it
had been decided that Frehe House
would be used for that purpose. It
will be available for use in
mid-March.
Much work remains to be done
in building a lively cultural
program, and there are some
cautions to be observed. The most
obvious caution is that we have
been talking about programs to be
developed and run by students and
there is a limit to the number and
kind of activities in which students
can engage without doing serious
damage to their academic
programs. A second obvious
caution is that it is easier to make
plans than it is to raise money, and

we must be careful not to confuse a
plan with a commitment to its
fruition. With those constraints in
mind, we discussed a number of
points.
First, the creation of a student
Black Drama Group, now under
way, will be aided by financial
support for two one-act plays to be
produced this Spring in connection
with Afro-American Cultural
Week. This is, of course, contingent
on the approval of a realistic
budget, and it is our intention to
ask the ASSU to participate in the
financing of this student activity.
To assist the BSU in planning this
production a consultant will be
retained for two weeks. The details
of this arrangement will need to be
worked out.
Second, the BSU newsletter
serves as an important means of
communication among black
students on campus. Additional
funds in the amount of $50 per
week are needed to keep this going
for the rest of the academic year. I
am asking the ASSU and the Dean
of Students office to share this
cost.
Third, as encouragement to the
development of cultural programs
the BSU will consult with the
English Department for the
purpose of bringing to campus for a
few weeks in the Spring a black
writer in residence, and for the
purpose of developing such
programs in the interim.
Finally on this subject, the
students responsible for the
development of cultural programs
will be working on material for an
application for financing to be
presented to foundations. The
President's staff will assist in the
formulation of these applications
and will be responsible for their
transmittal.
That concludes the summary of
our discussions to date. In my view
they are going well and they are
producing constructive results.
One last point remains to be made:
The events of February 20 were a
bitter shock to this campus. The
quick response of the Academic
Senate is ample testimony to that.
What remains to be said about
those events is that they did not
change by one degree either the
substance or the timing of the
University's commitment to
improving educational
opportunities for minorities. The
violent acts of that day were not
only unacceptable in principle,
they were unnecessary in fact.
Therefore, it is not our intention to
ignore them or to pretend that they
did not happen. Preliminary
investigations have taken place,
and the results of these will be
turned over to the Stanford
Judicial Council for further
investigation and such action as it
may determine is appropriate.
