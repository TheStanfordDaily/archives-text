# SC. UCLA Too Tough
## Tribe Drops Pair, Only Cal Remains 
### FRED MANN 
Stanford Dolly Barbie Feller
flashed a smile to the TV camera,
and opened Saturday afternoon's
coverage of the Pac-8 game of the
week between Stanford and USC.
It was the only pretty thing that
Stanford fans saw all day, or all
weekend for that matter.
The Indians played well against
both UCLA and the Trojans, but
,'ame up on the short end of both
contests. For their effort, they re
ceived a crippling blow to the hot
test player on the team, a perman
ent black mark in losing the official
dedication game in the new
pavilion, and fell even deeper into
the doldrums of the conference
race.
Off Night
Don Griffin, the undisputed star
of the squad who had been having
his troubles offensively of late, suf
fered the coldest scoring weekend
in memory. Griff was a mere 5-28
in the two games, and will be hard
pressed to break the 540 single
season scoring mark of Art Harris.
He must hit 32 against Cal on Fri
day.
Since Griffin has been off in his
shooting, co-captain Mai McElwain
has come on strong to take up the
slack. Mai was in the midst of one
of his best games on Saturday when
he came down limping after a de
fensive rebound. He continued
down court and took one of his
baseline jumpers. He fell in a heap
on the ground clutching his left
calf.
The injury was a severe muscle
■ cramp that finished him for the
day, but he will be back to action
against Cal on Friday night.
Easy Victory?
Friday night saw UCLA con
tinue their endless winning streak,
with an easy 81-60 win. Even
though the victory seemed to come
off without much effort by the

Bruins, perhaps they used up more
energy than they figured on.
UCLA, who notoriously take it
easy on Friday nights, (resting for
the Saturday night game,) got the
scare of their life in Berkeley. Cal's
Bears took the Bruins into over
time before the champs could
squeeze out a 84-77 victory Satur
day night.
UCLA shot 60 percent against
Stanford, to the home team's 36.9.
That was the whole game.
Curtis Rowe hit the first 12
points for the winners, and ended
up the evening with 25 for high
point honors. Lew Alcindor scored
at will in close, and had 19. Mc-
Elwain hit 17 and Griffin 10 for the
Tribe.
Stanford attempted to slow
down the quick Bruin pace from
the outset, but could not control
the ball as much as they wanted to.
UCLA's tight man-to-man defense
forced the Cards to move the ball
way outside, and Stanford found it
difficult to get off a shot.
UCLA on the other hand
opened holes in the Tribe fortifi
cations, picking off Alcindor all
night. Sidney Wicks and Rowe con
stantly hit the big center and cut
around him for open baseline
layins.
Bruin Board Strength
The Bruins controlled the back
boards and denied Coach Howie
Dallmar's team any second shots.
Alcindor was up to his old tricks,
and was virtually unstoppable. He
threw his length of the court base
ball passes, held the ball high out of
everyone's reach on numerous oc
casions, and generally ran the
show.
Lew's back up man, Steve
Patterson grabbed 11 rebounds to
only 9 for Alcindor.
Midway through the second
half, subs from both teams took to
the floor in the already decided

game. Fred Green and Bill Barber
both muscled in for baskets, and
kept the margin of victory down
under 30 points.
Overall, Stanford played well.
Against the powerful Bruins, they
could not play their own type of
game, but were more effective than
they were against the same UCLA
squad in he contest played in Los
Angeles.
Saturday's game was the wildest
40 minutes ever recorded in
Maples. All during the first half, the
basketball floor resembled a war
zone. The physically brutal and in
many cases dirty play of USC won
them the ball game, 75-66.
The Trojans staged a street
brawl in the LA meeting of the two
teams, but nothing compared to
this. Bill Palmer and 7-0 Ron Tay
lor rolled on the floor like a couple
of overgrown two year olds. Many
times players from both sides
ended up flying through the air due
to some punches or shoves.

Seventy-five percent of the fouls
were not called, and those that
were were of the ticky-tack variety.
When basketball was played, it
was high quality. SC ran the
Indians ragged early in the contest
on the speed of Mack Calvin. Tay
lor hooked shots in from tight
range, and Ernie Powell hit outside
jumpers from all over.
Down by 8 with 8:49 left in the
first period, Bill Halligan began a
Stanford charge that caught and
eventually overtook the Trojan
speedsters. Coach Dallmar
switched from his normal lineup to
match blows with the visitors, and
the new blood built up a five point

halftime lead. Halligan, McElwain,
Dave Druliner, Greg Osborn, and
Steve Kukenbecker led the way.
The spirit of the Cards seemed
to be cooled by the halftime break,
and they fell behind early in the
second perid. They never caught
up.
SC settled down to play basket
ball and hit on more of their shots.
Stanford hit another cold spell and
were finished. The Trojans ran off
eight in a row with only 5:20 re
maining, and the Tribe record
slipped to 8-17, (3-10 in Pac-8.)
Dennis O'Neill hit 16, McElwain
12, and Osborn 9 for the losers.

the ball as much as they wanted to.
UCLA's tight man-to-man defense
forced the Cards to move the ball
way outside, and Stanford found it
difficult to get off a shot.
UCLA on the other hand
opened holes in the Tribe fortifi
cations, picking off Alcindor all
night. Sidney Wicks and Rowe con
stantly hit the big center and cut
around him for open baseline
layins.
Bruin Board Strength
The Bruins controlled the back
boards and denied Coach Howie
Dallmar's team any second shots.
Alcindor was up to his old tricks,
and was virtually unstoppable. He
threw his length of the court base
ball passes, held the ball high out of
everyone's reach on numerous oc
casions, and generally ran the
show.
Lew's back up man, Steve
Patterson grabbed 11 rebounds to
only 9 for Alcindor.
Midway through the second
half, subs from both teams took to
the floor in the already decided

game. Fred Green and Bill Barber
both muscled in for baskets, and
kept the margin of victory down
under 30 points.
Overall, Stanford played well.
Against the powerful Bruins, they
could not play their own type of
game, but were more effective than
they were against the same UCLA
squad in he contest played in Los
Angeles.
Saturday's game was the wildest
40 minutes ever recorded in
Maples. All during the first half, the
basketball floor resembled a war
zone. The physically brutal and in
many cases dirty play of USC won
them the ball game, 75-66.
The Trojans staged a street
brawl in the LA meeting of the two
teams, but nothing compared to
this. Bill Palmer and 7-0 Ron Tay
lor rolled on the floor like a couple
of overgrown two year olds. Many
times players from both sides
ended up flying through the air due
to some punches or shoves.

Seventy-five percent of the fouls
were not called, and those that
were were of the ticky-tack variety.
When basketball was played, it
was high quality. SC ran the
Indians ragged early in the contest
on the speed of Mack Calvin. Tay
lor hooked shots in from tight
range, and Ernie Powell hit outside
jumpers from all over.
Down by 8 with 8:49 left in the
first period, Bill Halligan began a
Stanford charge that caught and
eventually overtook the Trojan
speedsters. Coach Dallmar
switched from his normal lineup to
match blows with the visitors, and
the new blood built up a five point

halftime lead. Halligan, McElwain,
Dave Druliner, Greg Osborn, and
Steve Kukenbecker led the way.
The spirit of the Cards seemed
to be cooled by the halftime break,
and they fell behind early in the
second perid. They never caught
up.
SC settled down to play basket
ball and hit on more of their shots.
Stanford hit another cold spell and
were finished. The Trojans ran off
eight in a row with only 5:20 re
maining, and the Tribe record
slipped to 8-17, (3-10 in Pac-8.)
Dennis O'Neill hit 16, McElwain
12, and Osborn 9 for the losers.
Stanford Dolly Barbie Feller
flashed a smile to the TV camera,
and opened Saturday afternoon's
coverage of the Pac-8 game of the
week between Stanford and USC.
It was the only pretty thing that
Stanford fans saw all day, or all
weekend for that matter.
The Indians played well against
both UCLA and the Trojans, but
,'ame up on the short end of both
contests. For their effort, they re
ceived a crippling blow to the hot
test player on the team, a perman
ent black mark in losing the official
dedication game in the new
pavilion, and fell even deeper into
the doldrums of the conference
race.
Off Night
Don Griffin, the undisputed star
of the squad who had been having
his troubles offensively of late, suf
fered the coldest scoring weekend
in memory. Griff was a mere 5-28
in the two games, and will be hard
pressed to break the 540 single
season scoring mark of Art Harris.
He must hit 32 against Cal on Fri
day.
Since Griffin has been off in his
shooting, co-captain Mai McElwain
has come on strong to take up the
slack. Mai was in the midst of one
of his best games on Saturday when
he came down limping after a de
fensive rebound. He continued
down court and took one of his
baseline jumpers. He fell in a heap
on the ground clutching his left
calf.
The injury was a severe muscle
■ cramp that finished him for the
day, but he will be back to action
against Cal on Friday night.
Easy Victory?
Friday night saw UCLA con
tinue their endless winning streak,
with an easy 81-60 win. Even
though the victory seemed to come
off without much effort by the

Bruins, perhaps they used up more
energy than they figured on.
UCLA, who notoriously take it
easy on Friday nights, (resting for
the Saturday night game,) got the
scare of their life in Berkeley. Cal's
Bears took the Bruins into over
time before the champs could
squeeze out a 84-77 victory Satur
day night.
UCLA shot 60 percent against
Stanford, to the home team's 36.9.
That was the whole game.
Curtis Rowe hit the first 12
points for the winners, and ended
up the evening with 25 for high
point honors. Lew Alcindor scored
at will in close, and had 19. Mc-
Elwain hit 17 and Griffin 10 for the
Tribe.

Steve Kukenbecker led the way.
The spirit of the Cards seemed
to be cooled by the halftime break,
and they fell behind early in the
second perid. They never caught
up.
SC settled down to play basket
ball and hit on more of their shots.
Stanford hit another cold spell and
were finished. The Trojans ran off
eight in a row with only 5:20 re
maining, and the Tribe record
slipped to 8-17, (3-10 in Pac-8.)
Dennis O'Neill hit 16, McElwain
12, and Osborn 9 for the losers.
Stanford Dolly Barbie Feller
flashed a smile to the TV camera,
and opened Saturday afternoon's
coverage of the Pac-8 game of the
week between Stanford and USC.
It was the only pretty thing that
Stanford fans saw all day, or all
weekend for that matter.
The Indians played well against
both UCLA and the Trojans, but
,'ame up on the short end of both
contests. For their effort, they re
ceived a crippling blow to the hot
test player on the team, a perman
ent black mark in losing the official
dedication game in the new
pavilion, and fell even deeper into
the doldrums of the conference
race.
Off Night
Don Griffin, the undisputed star
of the squad who had been having
his troubles offensively of late, suf
fered the coldest scoring weekend
in memory. Griff was a mere 5-28
in the two games, and will be hard
pressed to break the 540 single
season scoring mark of Art Harris.
He must hit 32 against Cal on Fri
day.
Since Griffin has been off in his
shooting, co-captain Mai McElwain
has come on strong to take up the
slack. Mai was in the midst of one
of his best games on Saturday when
he came down limping after a de
fensive rebound. He continued
down court and took one of his
baseline jumpers. He fell in a heap
on the ground clutching his left
calf.
The injury was a severe muscle
■ cramp that finished him for the
day, but he will be back to action
against Cal on Friday night.
Easy Victory?
Friday night saw UCLA con
tinue their endless winning streak,
with an easy 81-60 win. Even
though the victory seemed to come
off without much effort by the

Bruins, perhaps they used up more
energy than they figured on.
UCLA, who notoriously take it
easy on Friday nights, (resting for
the Saturday night game,) got the
scare of their life in Berkeley. Cal's
Bears took the Bruins into over
time before the champs could
squeeze out a 84-77 victory Satur
day night.
UCLA shot 60 percent against
Stanford, to the home team's 36.9.
That was the whole game.
Curtis Rowe hit the first 12
points for the winners, and ended
up the evening with 25 for high
point honors. Lew Alcindor scored
at will in close, and had 19. Mc-
Elwain hit 17 and Griffin 10 for the
Tribe.
Stanford attempted to slow
down the quick Bruin pace from
the outset, but could not control
the ball as much as they wanted to.
UCLA's tight man-to-man defense
forced the Cards to move the ball
way outside, and Stanford found it
difficult to get off a shot.
UCLA on the other hand
opened holes in the Tribe fortifi
cations, picking off Alcindor all
night. Sidney Wicks and Rowe con
stantly hit the big center and cut
around him for open baseline
layins.
Bruin Board Strength
The Bruins controlled the back
boards and denied Coach Howie
Dallmar's team any second shots.
Alcindor was up to his old tricks,
and was virtually unstoppable. He
threw his length of the court base
ball passes, held the ball high out of
everyone's reach on numerous oc
casions, and generally ran the
show.
Lew's back up man, Steve
Patterson grabbed 11 rebounds to
only 9 for Alcindor.
Midway through the second
half, subs from both teams took to
the floor in the already decided

game. Fred Green and Bill Barber
both muscled in for baskets, and
kept the margin of victory down
under 30 points.
Overall, Stanford played well.
Against the powerful Bruins, they
could not play their own type of
game, but were more effective than
they were against the same UCLA
squad in he contest played in Los
Angeles.
Saturday's game was the wildest
40 minutes ever recorded in
Maples. All during the first half, the
basketball floor resembled a war
zone. The physically brutal and in
many cases dirty play of USC won
them the ball game, 75-66.
The Trojans staged a street
brawl in the LA meeting of the two
teams, but nothing compared to
this. Bill Palmer and 7-0 Ron Tay
lor rolled on the floor like a couple
of overgrown two year olds. Many
times players from both sides
ended up flying through the air due
to some punches or shoves.

Seventy-five percent of the fouls
were not called, and those that
were were of the ticky-tack variety.
When basketball was played, it
was high quality. SC ran the
Indians ragged early in the contest
on the speed of Mack Calvin. Tay
lor hooked shots in from tight
range, and Ernie Powell hit outside
jumpers from all over.
Down by 8 with 8:49 left in the
first period, Bill Halligan began a
Stanford charge that caught and
eventually overtook the Trojan
speedsters. Coach Dallmar
switched from his normal lineup to
match blows with the visitors, and
the new blood built up a five point

halftime lead. Halligan, McElwain,
Dave Druliner, Greg Osborn, and
Steve Kukenbecker led the way.
The spirit of the Cards seemed
to be cooled by the halftime break,
and they fell behind early in the
