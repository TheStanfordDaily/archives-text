# Axe Stays
## 
### 
The Scrum Axe remains at Stan
ford.
The Indian ruggers lost the
battle but won the war on Satur
day, losing to the California team,
13-12. The loss to Cal was in the
second game of the traditional
series. Stanford had won the first
encounter, 18-8, and on the total
of both scores retains the Axe for
another year.
The game was scheduled to be
played at Berkeley, but due to field
conditions there, was switched to
the Farm at the last minute.
Cal fullback Les Williams led all
scorers with seven points. It was
the second defeat of the year for
the Tribe who went into the season
ranked as the top team in the
nation. UCLA defeated them two
weeksago.
