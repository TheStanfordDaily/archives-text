# 'Science In Society'
## Scientists' Role To Be Studied 
### 
Stanford will join more than 40
college campuses tomorrow in staging a
one-day demonstration of scientific and
technological concern for social
problems. ,
Entitled "March 4 Convocation:
Science in Society,'' the
student-organized demonstration will
consist of a series of speeches and panel
discussions featuring Con. Jeffrey
Cohelan (D.-Alameda) a vocal opponent
of the anti-ballistic missile (ABM)
progiam. The convocation will end with a
9 p.m. teach-in and discussion of future
plans.
According to Paul Grobstein, graduate

student in biology and a member of the
all-student March 4 Committee which
organized the program, it will be "a
convocation of the scientific and
technological community to consider the
goals of scientific and technological
community to consider the goals of
scientific and technological research, the
consequences of such research for society
as a whole, the responsibility of scientists
themselves for those consequences, and
the ways of recognizing and exercising
that responsibility."
Grobstein added, however, that it
"will not be an apology for anyone or
anything."

The one-day observance was initially
planned by students and faculty at MIT.
Although Stanford's programs promises
to be one of the most elaborate of the
presentations planned, the Stanford
group has pointedly disassociated itself
from the one-day "research strikes" that
are expected to characterize the March 4
observance on 01 her campuses across the
country.
The work stoppage at other
universities will represent an open
anti-war protest. Although it is not
expected to interrupt defense research on
the campuses, it is expected to
draw large numbers of faculty and
students from their war-related
experiments.
Speeches in Memorial Church
The convocation will be opened
at 1:15 p.m. in Memorial Church
by Grobstein, who will introduce
the afternoon speakers. These
consist of Joshua Lederberg,
professor of genetics, speaking on
"Humanities and Its Dilemmas";
Sidney Drell, SLAC physicist,
discussing "ABM: The Scientist in
Public Policy"; Leonard Schiff,
physics professor, talking on "The
Value and Support of Basic
Science"; and John Linvill,
chairman of the Electrical
Engineering Department,
discussing "The Role of the
Engineer in Society."
Panel Discussions
At 3:30 p.m. the audience will
re-convene in nearby classrooms
for panel discussions by the earlier
speakers and others. The panel
sessions, to be moderated by
student members of the March 4
Committee, will be:
"Biology and Its Implications,"
with Prof. Lederberg;Prof. Donald
Kennedy, chairman of the
Biological Sciences Department;
and another participant to be
named.
"Basic Science: Who Should
Support It?" with Prof. Schiff;
Nobel laureate Prof. Arthur
Romberg, biochemist; and another
to be named.
"Technological and Social
Development: Opportunities and

Dangers," with Dr. Sidney
Slomich, social scientist of
Stanford Research Institute; Ira
Hall, director of the
Stanford-Mid-Peninsula Urban
Coalition; Dean Joseph M. Pettit of
the Stanford School of
Engineering; Rolf Elliason,
professor of Civil Engineering.
"The Military-Industrial-
University Complex," with
electrical engineering Prof. Hubert
Heffner; history Prof. Barton
Bernstein; and David Ransom,
editor of the Peninsula Observer.
In the evening three additional
panel sessions will be given
beginning at 7:30 p.m.
At 9 p.m. the meeting will
reconvene in Memorial Church.
