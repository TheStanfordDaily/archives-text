# Defendants Found Guilty In Trustees' Meeting Case
## 
### THOMAS C. DAWSON 
Fines and suspended suspensions have
been leveled against the 29 students who
broke up the January 14th meeting of the
Board of Trustees at the Faculty Club.
In a 20-page decision rendered Friday
(and reprinted on page 4) the Stanford
Judicial Council unanimously
recommended $50 fines, one year
suspended suspensions and one year
probation for 26 defendants. The other
three defendants were given fines totaling
$600, suspended indefinite suspensions
and probation for the rest of their
enrollment at Stanford.
President Pitzer immediately accepted
the Council's recommendations. (See
Pitzer's statement at end of this story .) A
suspended suspension means that the
defendants can remain as registered
students.
The Council coupled their
recommendations with a strong warning
that "if during the period of probation"
any defendant takes part in "further
serious acts of disruption" and is
convicted of such an act, "the University
community has the right to insist upon
his suspension."
Council Makeup
The Judicial Council consists of four
faculty, four students and a faculty
chairman who votes in case of ties. The
Council's decision was adopted
unanimously in "all its parts" by the
members.
Given suspended indefinite
suspensions were Stephen Smith (also
fined $300), Fred Cohen ($200), and
James Johnson ($100).
Smith was given the stiffest sentence
for entering the Trustees' meeting room
"knowing that it was disruptive for him
to do so." After entering the room he
opened another door letting in other
demonstrators. He was also charged with

taking a copy of the trustees' agenda and
refusing to return it until forced to by
University officials.
Cohen Accused
Cohen was accused of threatening a
University official and Trustees, of being
"so violent in his manner that several of
his codefendants restrained him," and of
taking a copy of the agenda.
Johnson was accused of kicking and
beating "on the doors and windows to
the trustees' room, with his heavy boots
and a stick." Civil charges of placing a
false fire alarm have also been filed in civil
court against Johnson and this charge was
not considered by the Council.
All 29 defendants were found guilty
of violating the Policy on Campus
Disruption which prohibits disruption of
university functions or approved
activities.
King Fund Gains
The Council's decision stipulated that

the fines were to be paid to the Martin
Luther King Fund to aid Stanford's
minority group program. One-half of
each defendant's fine is due before
registration Spring quarter with the
balance due before Autumn quarter
registration.
The Council also found that part of
the disruption policy had not been
violated by the defendants because of a
procedural error. The policy provides
that all students, faculty or staff "have an
obligation to leave" the scene of any
disorder when requested to do so by a
University official who identifies himself
and his position.
The judicial body ruled that Associate
Dean of Students Bill Wyman failed to
identify himself properly and that the
related section of the policy was
therefore not violated.
The Council did uphold the
validity of the policy saying that
the policy had been promulgated
by acting president Glaser prior to
the new Judicial Charter's
ratification and is therefore in
effect until superceded by the
Student Conduct Legislative
Council.
Both the defendants and the
University administration came
under criticism in the Council's
decision.
The Council decision stated
"... the University administration
and the Board of Trustees failed to
make clear to the defendants what
proper channels, if any, existed for
communication between students
on the one hand and the
administration and the Board on
the other."
They went on to say that this
failure "was a contributing factor
of the disruption."
The bulk of the Council's
criticism was directed at the
defendants, however. Conceding

that the defendants "were strongly
motivated by sincerely held
beliefs," the Council said "... the
defendants were less interested in
the orderly exchange of views than
they were in the imposition of their
views on the rest of the
community."
The decision also stated, "If
every member of the Stanford
community who feels stringly
about an issue is permitted to
disrupt the campus to impose his
views on others, the result would
be chaos."
Criticism was leveled by the
Council toward the defendants and
their supporters for the disruption
of the first night of the
proceedings. The Council said,
"The defendants themselves, and
their counsel, must share the blame
for the disorder, particularly
during the first night."
The 26 defendants given one
year suspended suspensions and
$50 fines were:
John W. Avery, Anne C. Bauer,
Richard F. Bogart, Irwin A. Busse,

Allan Christelow, Richard
Greenspan, Hallam C. Hamilton,
Marc D. Heller, Carolyn M. Iverson,
Barbara E. Lee, Virginia A. Linsley,
Michael M. Morton, Christine M.
Mrak, Jeffrey J. Preefer, David F.
Pugh, George C. Reinhardt, James
E. Shoch, Leonard M. Siegel, Guy
D. Smyth, Don P. Stuart, Michael
D. Vawter, D. Jeffrey Weil, Marc A.
Weiss, Helen K. Williams, Joan
Williams (Mrs. Rodney W.) and
Rodney W. Williams.

Pitzer's Statement
"Formation of the Stanford Judicial
Council last year was the culmination of
three years' effort by faculty, students,
and University officers to build a system
of campus rule-making and enforcement
in which primary responsibility is shared
by students and faculty.
"In this, its first major test, the
Judicial Council has gone to great
lengths (1) to investigate carefully and
completely the facts; (2) to insure
procedural safeguards for each
defendant; and (3) to provide students
charged with rules violation ample

opportunity to explain the rationale for
their behavior.
"It has now reached a unanimous
verdict, which clearly attempts to
distinguish the actions of different
individuals and to recommend penalties
appropriate to the acts of each person.
These penalties may be seen by some as
too severe and by others as too lenient.
"What seems to me significant is that
the Council has been formally
sanctioned by students, faculty, and
officers of the University. When it was
created, its authors anticipated that
different individuals, including the
president, might not be entirely happy
with its recommendations. That feeling
may well extend to others, both inside
and outside the University, as well as
those on either side of a particular case.
But it does not constitute grounds for
lightly or arbitrarily setting aside the
judgement of the Council in any case.
"I therefore accept the findings and
recommendations of the Council and, in
accord with die powers accorded the
president, have decided to implement
them without delay ..

Pitzer's Statement
"Formation of the Stanford Judicial
Council last year was the culmination of
three years' effort by faculty, students,
and University officers to build a system
of campus rule-making and enforcement
in which primary responsibility is shared
by students and faculty.
"In this, its first major test, the
Judicial Council has gone to great
lengths (1) to investigate carefully and
completely the facts; (2) to insure
procedural safeguards for each
defendant; and (3) to provide students
charged with rules violation ample

opportunity to explain the rationale for
their behavior.
"It has now reached a unanimous
verdict, which clearly attempts to
distinguish the actions of different
individuals and to recommend penalties
appropriate to the acts of each person.
These penalties may be seen by some as
too severe and by others as too lenient.
"What seems to me significant is that
the Council has been formally
sanctioned by students, faculty, and
officers of the University. When it was
created, its authors anticipated that
different individuals, including the
president, might not be entirely happy
with its recommendations. That feeling
may well extend to others, both inside
and outside the University, as well as
those on either side of a particular case.
But it does not constitute grounds for
lightly or arbitrarily setting aside the
judgement of the Council in any case.
"I therefore accept the findings and
recommendations of the Council and, in
accord with die powers accorded the
president, have decided to implement
them without delay ..
Fines and suspended suspensions have
been leveled against the 29 students who
broke up the January 14th meeting of the
Board of Trustees at the Faculty Club.
In a 20-page decision rendered Friday
(and reprinted on page 4) the Stanford
Judicial Council unanimously
recommended $50 fines, one year
suspended suspensions and one year
probation for 26 defendants. The other
three defendants were given fines totaling
$600, suspended indefinite suspensions
and probation for the rest of their
enrollment at Stanford.
President Pitzer immediately accepted
the Council's recommendations. (See
Pitzer's statement at end of this story .) A
suspended suspension means that the
defendants can remain as registered
students.
The Council coupled their
recommendations with a strong warning
that "if during the period of probation"
any defendant takes part in "further
serious acts of disruption" and is
convicted of such an act, "the University
community has the right to insist upon
his suspension."
Council Makeup
The Judicial Council consists of four
faculty, four students and a faculty
chairman who votes in case of ties. The
Council's decision was adopted
unanimously in "all its parts" by the
members.
Given suspended indefinite
suspensions were Stephen Smith (also
fined $300), Fred Cohen ($200), and
James Johnson ($100).
Smith was given the stiffest sentence
for entering the Trustees' meeting room
"knowing that it was disruptive for him
to do so." After entering the room he
opened another door letting in other
demonstrators. He was also charged with

taking a copy of the trustees' agenda and
refusing to return it until forced to by
University officials.
Cohen Accused
Cohen was accused of threatening a
University official and Trustees, of being
"so violent in his manner that several of
his codefendants restrained him," and of
taking a copy of the agenda.
Johnson was accused of kicking and
beating "on the doors and windows to
the trustees' room, with his heavy boots
and a stick." Civil charges of placing a
false fire alarm have also been filed in civil
court against Johnson and this charge was
not considered by the Council.
All 29 defendants were found guilty
of violating the Policy on Campus
Disruption which prohibits disruption of
university functions or approved
activities.
King Fund Gains
The Council's decision stipulated that

the fines were to be paid to the Martin
Luther King Fund to aid Stanford's
minority group program. One-half of
each defendant's fine is due before
registration Spring quarter with the
balance due before Autumn quarter
registration.
The Council also found that part of
the disruption policy had not been
violated by the defendants because of a
procedural error. The policy provides
that all students, faculty or staff "have an
obligation to leave" the scene of any
disorder when requested to do so by a
University official who identifies himself
and his position.
The judicial body ruled that Associate
Dean of Students Bill Wyman failed to
identify himself properly and that the
related section of the policy was
therefore not violated.
The Council did uphold the
validity of the policy saying that
the policy had been promulgated
by acting president Glaser prior to
the new Judicial Charter's
ratification and is therefore in
effect until superceded by the
Student Conduct Legislative
Council.
Both the defendants and the
University administration came
under criticism in the Council's
decision.
The Council decision stated
"... the University administration
and the Board of Trustees failed to
make clear to the defendants what
proper channels, if any, existed for
communication between students
on the one hand and the
administration and the Board on
the other."
They went on to say that this
failure "was a contributing factor
of the disruption."
The bulk of the Council's
criticism was directed at the
defendants, however. Conceding

that the defendants "were strongly
motivated by sincerely held
beliefs," the Council said "... the
defendants were less interested in
the orderly exchange of views than
they were in the imposition of their
views on the rest of the
community."
The decision also stated, "If
every member of the Stanford
community who feels stringly
about an issue is permitted to
disrupt the campus to impose his
views on others, the result would
be chaos."
Criticism was leveled by the
Council toward the defendants and
their supporters for the disruption
of the first night of the
proceedings. The Council said,
"The defendants themselves, and
their counsel, must share the blame
for the disorder, particularly
during the first night."
The 26 defendants given one
year suspended suspensions and
$50 fines were:
John W. Avery, Anne C. Bauer,
Richard F. Bogart, Irwin A. Busse,

Allan Christelow, Richard
Greenspan, Hallam C. Hamilton,
Marc D. Heller, Carolyn M. Iverson,
Barbara E. Lee, Virginia A. Linsley,

ratification and is therefore in
effect until superceded by the
Student Conduct Legislative
Council.
Both the defendants and the
University administration came
under criticism in the Council's
decision.
The Council decision stated
"... the University administration
and the Board of Trustees failed to
make clear to the defendants what
proper channels, if any, existed for
communication between students
on the one hand and the
administration and the Board on
the other."
They went on to say that this
failure "was a contributing factor
of the disruption."
The bulk of the Council's
criticism was directed at the
defendants, however. Conceding

that the defendants "were strongly
motivated by sincerely held
beliefs," the Council said "... the
defendants were less interested in
the orderly exchange of views than
they were in the imposition of their
views on the rest of the
community."
The decision also stated, "If
every member of the Stanford
community who feels stringly
about an issue is permitted to
disrupt the campus to impose his
views on others, the result would
be chaos."
Criticism was leveled by the
Council toward the defendants and
their supporters for the disruption
of the first night of the
proceedings. The Council said,
"The defendants themselves, and
their counsel, must share the blame
for the disorder, particularly
during the first night."
The 26 defendants given one
year suspended suspensions and
$50 fines were:
John W. Avery, Anne C. Bauer,

Pitzer's Statement
"Formation of the Stanford Judicial
Council last year was the culmination of
three years' effort by faculty, students,
and University officers to build a system
of campus rule-making and enforcement
in which primary responsibility is shared
by students and faculty.
"In this, its first major test, the
Judicial Council has gone to great
lengths (1) to investigate carefully and
completely the facts; (2) to insure
procedural safeguards for each
defendant; and (3) to provide students
charged with rules violation ample

opportunity to explain the rationale for
their behavior.
"It has now reached a unanimous
verdict, which clearly attempts to
distinguish the actions of different
individuals and to recommend penalties
appropriate to the acts of each person.
These penalties may be seen by some as
too severe and by others as too lenient.
"What seems to me significant is that
the Council has been formally
sanctioned by students, faculty, and
officers of the University. When it was
created, its authors anticipated that
different individuals, including the
president, might not be entirely happy
with its recommendations. That feeling
may well extend to others, both inside
and outside the University, as well as
those on either side of a particular case.
But it does not constitute grounds for
lightly or arbitrarily setting aside the
judgement of the Council in any case.
"I therefore accept the findings and
recommendations of the Council and, in
accord with die powers accorded the
president, have decided to implement
them without delay ..
Fines and suspended suspensions have
been leveled against the 29 students who
broke up the January 14th meeting of the
Board of Trustees at the Faculty Club.
In a 20-page decision rendered Friday
(and reprinted on page 4) the Stanford
Judicial Council unanimously
recommended $50 fines, one year
suspended suspensions and one year
probation for 26 defendants. The other
three defendants were given fines totaling
$600, suspended indefinite suspensions
and probation for the rest of their
enrollment at Stanford.
President Pitzer immediately accepted
the Council's recommendations. (See
Pitzer's statement at end of this story .) A
suspended suspension means that the
defendants can remain as registered
students.
The Council coupled their
recommendations with a strong warning
that "if during the period of probation"
any defendant takes part in "further
serious acts of disruption" and is
convicted of such an act, "the University
community has the right to insist upon
his suspension."
Council Makeup
The Judicial Council consists of four
faculty, four students and a faculty
chairman who votes in case of ties. The
Council's decision was adopted
unanimously in "all its parts" by the
members.
Given suspended indefinite
suspensions were Stephen Smith (also
fined $300), Fred Cohen ($200), and
James Johnson ($100).
Smith was given the stiffest sentence
for entering the Trustees' meeting room
"knowing that it was disruptive for him
to do so." After entering the room he
opened another door letting in other
demonstrators. He was also charged with

taking a copy of the trustees' agenda and
refusing to return it until forced to by
University officials.
Cohen Accused
Cohen was accused of threatening a
University official and Trustees, of being
"so violent in his manner that several of
his codefendants restrained him," and of
taking a copy of the agenda.
Johnson was accused of kicking and
beating "on the doors and windows to
the trustees' room, with his heavy boots
and a stick." Civil charges of placing a
false fire alarm have also been filed in civil
court against Johnson and this charge was
not considered by the Council.
All 29 defendants were found guilty
of violating the Policy on Campus
Disruption which prohibits disruption of
university functions or approved
activities.
King Fund Gains
The Council's decision stipulated that

the fines were to be paid to the Martin
Luther King Fund to aid Stanford's
minority group program. One-half of
each defendant's fine is due before
registration Spring quarter with the
balance due before Autumn quarter
registration.
The Council also found that part of
the disruption policy had not been
violated by the defendants because of a
procedural error. The policy provides
that all students, faculty or staff "have an
obligation to leave" the scene of any
disorder when requested to do so by a
University official who identifies himself
and his position.
The judicial body ruled that Associate
Dean of Students Bill Wyman failed to
identify himself properly and that the
related section of the policy was
therefore not violated.
The Council did uphold the
validity of the policy saying that
the policy had been promulgated
by acting president Glaser prior to
the new Judicial Charter's
ratification and is therefore in
effect until superceded by the
Student Conduct Legislative
Council.
Both the defendants and the
