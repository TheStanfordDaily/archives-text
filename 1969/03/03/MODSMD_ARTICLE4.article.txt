# Defendants Found Guilty In Trustees' Meeting Case
## 
### THOMAS C. DAWSON 
Fines and suspended suspensions have
been leveled against the 29 students who
broke up the January 14th meeting of the
Board of Trustees at the Faculty Club.
In a 20-page decision rendered Friday
(and reprinted on page 4) the Stanford
Judicial Council unanimously
recommended $50 fines, one year
suspended suspensions and one year
probation for 26 defendants. The other
three defendants were given fines totaling
$600, suspended indefinite suspensions
and probation for the rest of their
enrollment at Stanford.
President Pitzer immediately accepted
the Council's recommendations. (See
Pitzer's statement at end of this story .) A
suspended suspension means that the
defendants can remain as registered
students.
The Council coupled their
recommendations with a strong warning
that "if during the period of probation"
any defendant takes part in "further
serious acts of disruption" and is
convicted of such an act, "the University
community has the right to insist upon
his suspension."
Council Makeup
The Judicial Council consists of four
faculty, four students and a faculty
chairman who votes in case of ties. The
Council's decision was adopted
unanimously in "all its parts" by the
members.
Given suspended indefinite
suspensions were Stephen Smith (also
fined $300), Fred Cohen ($200), and
James Johnson ($100).
Smith was given the stiffest sentence
for entering the Trustees' meeting room
"knowing that it was disruptive for him
to do so." After entering the room he
opened another door letting in other
demonstrators. He was also charged with

taking a copy of the trustees' agenda and
refusing to return it until forced to by
University officials.
Cohen Accused
Cohen was accused of threatening a
University official and Trustees, of being
"so violent in his manner that several of
his codefendants restrained him," and of
taking a copy of the agenda.
Johnson was accused of kicking and
beating "on the doors and windows to
the trustees' room, with his heavy boots
and a stick." Civil charges of placing a
false fire alarm have also been filed in civil
court against Johnson and this charge was
not considered by the Council.
All 29 defendants were found guilty
of violating the Policy on Campus
Disruption which prohibits disruption of
university functions or approved
activities.
King Fund Gains
The Council's decision stipulated that

the fines were to be paid to the Martin
Luther King Fund to aid Stanford's
minority group program. One-half of
each defendant's fine is due before
registration Spring quarter with the
balance due before Autumn quarter
registration.
The Council also found that part of
the disruption policy had not been
violated by the defendants because of a
procedural error. The policy provides
that all students, faculty or staff "have an
obligation to leave" the scene of any
disorder when requested to do so by a
University official who identifies himself
and his position.
The judicial body ruled that Associate
Dean of Students Bill Wyman failed to
identify himself properly and that the
related section of the policy was
therefore not violated.
