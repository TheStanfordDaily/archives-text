# Sentenced Defendants Review SJC Decision
## 
### BARBARA RITZ 
Almost all 29 students, convicted for
the disruption of last month's Trustee
meeting, met in Tresidder large lounge
yesterday to discuss what action to take
regarding the Student Judicial decisions.
The sentenced students, mostly SDS
members, voted to present a unified
statement concerning the 29 convictions
before making any individual student
comment.
"Monday night SDS members will dis
cuss the decisions of the Judicial Council

and will consider proposals for action,"
stated Len Siegel, one of the sentenced
students.
"Our decision and explanation will be
presented Wednesday."
Discussion at the Sunday meeting
ranged from criticism of Stanford's de
cision in issuing "suspended sus
pensions," to what kind of action to take
regarding the university fines.
One of the students made the sug
gestion that the fines not be paid, and
that the money be donated to the Black
Panthers Breakfast Fund, or to another
similar organization. The argument given
was that the university would now have
to back up whatever decisions they made
regarding the "suspended suspensions."
The university has tried to put an end
to SDS political activity, commented
another of the students present at the
meeting. He suggested that SDS is now in
a position to challenge the university
ruling regarding campus disruptions.
An alternative idea suggested was to
appeal the Council decision to the Uni
versity.
However the majority of those stu
dents at Sunday's meeting voted to
present SDS action as a "collective
whole."
Immediate plans include a meeting in
Tresidder tonight at 8:00, and a noon
rally Wednesday in White Plaza.
