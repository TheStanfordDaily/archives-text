# Lyman Issues Report On BSU Discussions
## 
### 
Last week's attack on the Stanford
Bookstore "did not change by one degree
either the substance or the timing of the
University's commitment to improving
educational opportunities for
minorities," Provost Richard W. Lyman
said Friday. (See text on page 5.)
In an interim report to the campus
community, Lyman said he felt
discussions with the Black Student Union
started before the incident and
continuing this week with minority
group leaders "are going well and are
producing constructive results."
The attack, which caused losses now
estimated in excess of $6,000, "were a
bitter shock to this campus," he declared.
"The violent acts of that day were not
only unacceptable in principle, they were
unnecessary in fact. Therefore it is not

our intention to ignore them or pretend
that they did not happen."
Preliminary investigations have taken
place, and results will be turned over to
the Stanford Judicial Council for further
investigation and such action as it may
deem appropriate, he said.
No Meetings Set
No meeting dates have been set for
this week for a continuation of talks
between the administration and the BSU.
Leo Bazile, BSU vice-chairman, said that
the groups would meet if the BSU
Executive Committee, which met
Sunday afternoon, found Lyman's
statement satisfactory.
BSU Chairman Nate Kirtman reported
late last night that discussions would be
held.
As for disciplinary action against the
approximately 15 individuals who
rampaged through the Bookstore, Bazile
noted that reports he had received
indicated that most if not all of those
responsible were not Stanford students.
Full Proof Asked
"I want to see proof beyond a shadow
of a doubt that the individuals singled out
did any destruction," he said.
"We've been waiting to see what
happens," he continued, "but we're not
playing games. We don't want any
bullshit kangaroo court like they had for
SDS."
Initial reports, published last week,
indicated that whites as well as blacks
may have been involved in the incident.
After receiving assurances that the
destructive events of Feb. 20 would be
neither encouraged nor condoned by the
Black Student Union, Lyman said
University officers resumed talks with
BSU and other minority group leaders on
financial aid, academic programs,
and extra curricular programs.
Lyman said the University has
been moving toward a policy of
providing grants sufficient to cover
the full financial need of freshman
minority students, and this policy
will be in effect next fall. It means
that no freshman minority student
will need to work to earn part of his
educational expenses.
The University previously had
announced its commitment to
increase its financial aid to
minority students by $168,000
1969-70. Incoming students also
will be advised of the University's
effort to develop a four-year
financial package for minority
students, starting with grants for
freshmen and moving progressively
over the next three (upper class)
years toward smaller grant and
larger loan and work components.
Both at Stanford and elsewhere,
he noted, "many minority students
have financial problems that differ
in size and in kind from those faced
by most of the student body."
