# SF State Strike Ends
## 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO (AP)-San
Francisco State College's American
Federation of Teachers Local 1352 voted
Sunday night to return to work Monday.
They have been on strike since Jan. 6.
Gary Hawkins, union president,
announced at the end of a four-hour
closed-door meeting "We will return to
our classes in the morning."
He said no offical figures on the vote
would be released. However, it was
learned unofficially that the third ballot
of the night showed 112 favoring return,
97 against and seven abstaining.
Hawkins was asked whether the
striking teachers would cross student
picket lines. Some had been overheard to
say earlier in the meeting that regardless
of the vote they would not go back.
"We'll simply have to see," Hawkins
replied, adding that he would have no
further report on the meeting until a
union news conference today.
Among about 30 students who
waited outside the hall during the
long and noisy teachers' meeting
was Roger Alvarado, a student
leader of the Third World
Liberation Front strike. Alvarado
said student strikers would stage a
rally on the SFS campus at 10 a.m.
today.
The vote came after the college
administration had moved earlier
Sunday to cancel classes of striking
teachers who don't return to work
today.
Frank Dollard, college
executive vice president, told a
news conference the school "will
cancel all classes still not being
taught according to schedule"
today.
Dr. S.I. Hayakawa, acting
college president, had given the
teachers until Saturday night to
decide, or else be fired.
Hayakawa said he had to have a
reply from the union by Saturday
night if courses taught by striking
teachers were to be reinstated by
today.
