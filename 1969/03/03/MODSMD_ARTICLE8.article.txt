# Tresidder Union 'Liberated' By 200 Student Bodies
## 
### CRAIG WILSON KAREN DAVIDSON 
It all began about 9:45 p.m. when a
cluster of students entered the cafeteria
armed with drums, wine, and food.
Publicity had been circulating since
the middle of the week and from all signs
at least University officers had come, if
for no other reason ihan to watch.
By 10 p.m. the normally closed com
plex was transformed into a rollicking
den of noise accentuated by bongos, clap
ping hands, stomping feet and a lone tam
borine.
Tresidder Memorial Union was being
"liberated" and from all indications so
were the people inside.
Decision Made
It all started a week ago when Tresid
der officials made the decision to close
the building at 10 p.m.—an hour and a
half earlier than the previous closing
time. Officials claimed that the longer
hours had proved unprofitable.
Since that time an organization called
the Protestors, Troublemakers, and An
archists (PTA) had called the second
demonstration in a week to protest the
hour change.
And now the liberation was well on its
way.

The usually sedate surroundings were
instantly converted into a spacious dance
floor. Students pushed back tables and
chairs and hooked up amplifiers.
Snake dancing students began winding
their way in and out of the union an
amplifiers blared.
About a dozen products of a body
painting spree in Cedro and Arroyo
Houses appeared, enlightening the
psychedelic atmosphere,
Outside growing numbers of specta
tors began to appear.
The crowd inside swelled to about
200.
"Liberated Zone"
One of the demonstrators scrawled
the words "liberated zone" across a sign
identifying the Union. As an audience in
Dinkelspiel began to empty outside fol
lowing a presentation of Mozart they
found they had to cross the "zone" in
order to observe the proceedings in Tre
sidder.
The inside of the union, normally a
composition of small groups of students
had suddenly been transformed into a
"liberated" community.
People seemed unaware of spectators
as theygyrated to emanations from botha
live guitar and at times recorded music.

MUSIC TO MY EARS-Drums resound throughout the cafetrria, with frequent accompanyment
from buugos, harmonica, and even an electric guitar.
In between songs participants
fell exhausted into heaps of liber
ated flesh. But as the music began
again the massed bodies sprang to
life and the ritual of flailing arms
and contorting bodies was begun
again.
One student was heard to say
"this is very genuine, like a dance
should be."
A middle-aged couple who
seemed to be viewing the proceed
ings with apparent enjoyment had
only one remark, "great!"
During one of the more anim
ated piles three couples, obviously
abreast of the issue, participated in
a shirt exchange.
A member of the Committee for
New Democratic Politics called the
event, "participation politics at its
best."
Police Chief Bell who was pre
sent viewing the proceedings, said
"I'm just looking . . .just curious."
The liberation ended as spon
taneously as it began. Instruments
disappeared intermittenly, chairs

and tables were replaced, broken
glass removed, the lights dimmed,
doors were locked, and the liber
ators vanished as quickly as they
had appeared.
Tresidder Union had been
liberated —at least for another
week.
In response to last Friday
night's liberation, the Tresidder
Union Board has announced it is
sponsoring a pre-dead week dance
this Friday night in the cafeteria,
from 10p.m. to 12:30 a.m.
The Board has also announced
an open hearing this Tuesday even
ing at 8 p.m. in Tresidder "to dis
cuss and ask for suggestions regard
ing the use of Union facilities."
