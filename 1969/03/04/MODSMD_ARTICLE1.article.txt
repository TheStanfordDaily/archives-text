# Massive Advising Changes Suggested In SES Report
## 
### MARSHALL E. SCHWARTZ 
The Advising and Counseling
Committee of the Study of Education
at Stanford (SES) has recommended
major revisions in the present advising
structure for undergraduates in a report
released today.
Proposed changes include placing
responsibility for academic advising of
undergraduates in the hands of the
proposed Dean of Undergraduate
Education. Establishment of an advising
office under the direction of- an
associate dean was also suggested.
Other recommendations include:
•establishing a committee of the
Academic Senate to study advising;
•revising procedures for faculty
appointment and promotion to take
into account work as an adviser;
•paying freshman advisers up to
$500 per year in addition to their
regular salary;
•increasing the amount of literature
available to both students and faculty;
•establishing a Career Guidances
Center through expanding the
Placement Services, and setting up a
psychological services unit as part of the
Cowell Health Center.
Follows Position Paper
The report follows a preliminary
position paper issued by the committee
last April. It is the sixth of the ten SES
reports and will be considered by the
Academic Senate and Student
Education Council.
The committee found present
advising and counseling at Stanford
sorely lacking. "The Committee is
agreed that a single word would fairly
accurately sum up the situation of
advising and counseling at Stanford and
the problems to which we addressed
ourselves," the report said.
"That word is 'indifferent.'
"The faculty are, on the whole,
indifferent to advising; the advising they
give is generally indifferent in quality;

students are indifferent to it ... As a
result of this indifference, students
progress haphazardly in many ways."
New Structures Not Solution
But the group feels that new
structures are not the real solution to
the problems.
"The Committee believes that
changes of attitude are a key to the
solution or amelioration of these
problems," the report noted. "The
Committee realizes that reports do not
change attitudes, but that people change
attitudes. The\jost reports can do—and
this one attempts to do it—is to propose
symbolic actions that may draw
attention to problems and imply
possible changes of attitude."
Despite these difficulties, "we firmly
believe that the . . . proposals can help
bring the crucial changes in attitude that
good advising and counseling depend
on," the SES Steering Committee said
in its introduction to the report.
Graduate Advising
Besides recommending that the
undergraduate dean be in charge of
undergraduate advising, the report notes
that "since most graduate advising takes
place in departments, the Graduate
Dean's function is that of surveying the
departments and schools with regard to
their advising arrangements for graduate
students."
The University Adviser system for
undergraduates should be retained, the
committee noted.
The full system of advising for
undergrads as recommended would be
as follows:
Incoming freshmen will be given an
adviser, "as far as possible on the basis
of the student's area of academic
interest." The committee suggested that
fresman advisers should be involved
with the residence system, but this was
altered by the Steering Committee.
Freshman Tutorial Program
They recommended that any

freshman in the tutorial program (as
proposed in the SES report on
undergraduate education) have as their
advisers their freshman tutorial
instructors, while others be assigned
advisers from a pool of faculty members
interested in such work.
By the beginning of his sophomore
year-if not sooner—all students must
select a University Adviser, any member
of the faculty or staff willing to assume
the role.
"The Committee conceives the
University Adviser to ' the adviser for
the student," the report asserts—"in the
words of the position paper, 'the
student's academic advocate, the
particular educator who agrees to
concern himself with his advisee's best
education.'
Graduate Advising
For graduates, the reports notes that
each student "should be assigned by the
department to his adviser ... The
graduate adviser is responsible for aiding
the student in planning and executing
his degree program and in determining
his eventual career."
Also, "administrative and staff
officers of the University who are in
close contact with the academic
programs of the University should be
encouraged to assume formal advising
responsibilities."
The report also notes that "every
faculty member should understand the
advising program of his department."
Referring to recent experiments in
some departments, the committee
suggests that more use be made of
upperclassmen as advisers to lowerclass
students in their departments.
"Most advising of students at
Stanford is now and will continue to be
done by other students," the report
comments. "Such informal advising
should not be discouraged. Even when it
is misinformed, it does no greater harm
than advising done by misinformed
faculty members."

VANDALISM—Vandals hit the offices of the Stanford Judicial Council twice over the weekend, according to campus police and ASSU officials.
The pictures above are from an "inkhombing" of the Council's office in the second floor Tresidder Union Sunday night. The officers have been
used by the Council in their recent investigation of last month's Faculty Club disruption. Campus police, investigating the incident, have not
uncovered any leads. Saturday, officials discovered obscenities painted on the office door but did not release any information 011 that incident
until yesterday.

position paper issued by the committee
last April. It is the sixth of the ten SES
reports and will be considered by the
Academic Senate and Student
Education Council.
The committee found present
advising and counseling at Stanford
sorely lacking. "The Committee is
agreed that a single word would fairly
accurately sum up the situation of
advising and counseling at Stanford and
the problems to which we addressed
ourselves," the report said.
"That word is 'indifferent.'
"The faculty are, on the whole,
indifferent to advising; the advising they
give is generally indifferent in quality;

students are indifferent to it ... As a
result of this indifference, students
progress haphazardly in many ways."
New Structures Not Solution
But the group feels that new
structures are not the real solution to
the problems.
"The Committee believes that
changes of attitude are a key to the
solution or amelioration of these
problems," the report noted. "The
Committee realizes that reports do not
change attitudes, but that people change
attitudes. The\jost reports can do—and
this one attempts to do it—is to propose
symbolic actions that may draw
attention to problems and imply
possible changes of attitude."
Despite these difficulties, "we firmly
believe that the . . . proposals can help
bring the crucial changes in attitude that
good advising and counseling depend
on," the SES Steering Committee said
in its introduction to the report.
Graduate Advising
Besides recommending that the
undergraduate dean be in charge of
undergraduate advising, the report notes
that "since most graduate advising takes
place in departments, the Graduate
Dean's function is that of surveying the
departments and schools with regard to
their advising arrangements for graduate
students."
The University Adviser system for
undergraduates should be retained, the
committee noted.
The full system of advising for
undergrads as recommended would be
as follows:
Incoming freshmen will be given an
adviser, "as far as possible on the basis
of the student's area of academic
interest." The committee suggested that
fresman advisers should be involved
with the residence system, but this was
altered by the Steering Committee.
Freshman Tutorial Program
They recommended that any

freshman in the tutorial program (as
proposed in the SES report on
undergraduate education) have as their
advisers their freshman tutorial
instructors, while others be assigned
advisers from a pool of faculty members
interested in such work.
By the beginning of his sophomore
year-if not sooner—all students must
select a University Adviser, any member
of the faculty or staff willing to assume
the role.
"The Committee conceives the
University Adviser to ' the adviser for
the student," the report asserts—"in the
words of the position paper, 'the
student's academic advocate, the
particular educator who agrees to
concern himself with his advisee's best
education.'
Graduate Advising
For graduates, the reports notes that
each student "should be assigned by the
department to his adviser ... The
graduate adviser is responsible for aiding
the student in planning and executing
his degree program and in determining
his eventual career."
Also, "administrative and staff
officers of the University who are in
close contact with the academic
programs of the University should be
encouraged to assume formal advising
responsibilities."
The report also notes that "every
faculty member should understand the
advising program of his department."
Referring to recent experiments in
some departments, the committee
suggests that more use be made of
upperclassmen as advisers to lowerclass
students in their departments.
"Most advising of students at
Stanford is now and will continue to be
done by other students," the report
comments. "Such informal advising
should not be discouraged. Even when it
is misinformed, it does no greater harm
than advising done by misinformed
faculty members."

VANDALISM—Vandals hit the offices of the Stanford Judicial Council twice over the weekend, according to campus police and ASSU officials.
The pictures above are from an "inkhombing" of the Council's office in the second floor Tresidder Union Sunday night. The officers have been
used by the Council in their recent investigation of last month's Faculty Club disruption. Campus police, investigating the incident, have not
uncovered any leads. Saturday, officials discovered obscenities painted on the office door but did not release any information 011 that incident
until yesterday.
The Advising and Counseling
Committee of the Study of Education
at Stanford (SES) has recommended
major revisions in the present advising
structure for undergraduates in a report
released today.
Proposed changes include placing
responsibility for academic advising of
undergraduates in the hands of the
proposed Dean of Undergraduate
Education. Establishment of an advising
office under the direction of- an
associate dean was also suggested.
Other recommendations include:
•establishing a committee of the
Academic Senate to study advising;
•revising procedures for faculty
appointment and promotion to take
into account work as an adviser;
•paying freshman advisers up to
$500 per year in addition to their
regular salary;
•increasing the amount of literature
available to both students and faculty;
•establishing a Career Guidances
Center through expanding the
Placement Services, and setting up a
psychological services unit as part of the
Cowell Health Center.

attitudes. The\jost reports can do—and
this one attempts to do it—is to propose
symbolic actions that may draw
attention to problems and imply
possible changes of attitude."
Despite these difficulties, "we firmly
believe that the . . . proposals can help
bring the crucial changes in attitude that
good advising and counseling depend
on," the SES Steering Committee said
in its introduction to the report.
Graduate Advising
Besides recommending that the
undergraduate dean be in charge of
undergraduate advising, the report notes
that "since most graduate advising takes
place in departments, the Graduate
Dean's function is that of surveying the
departments and schools with regard to
their advising arrangements for graduate
students."
The University Adviser system for
undergraduates should be retained, the
committee noted.
The full system of advising for
undergrads as recommended would be
as follows:
Incoming freshmen will be given an
adviser, "as far as possible on the basis
of the student's area of academic
interest." The committee suggested that
fresman advisers should be involved
with the residence system, but this was
altered by the Steering Committee.
Freshman Tutorial Program
They recommended that any

freshman in the tutorial program (as
proposed in the SES report on
undergraduate education) have as their
advisers their freshman tutorial
instructors, while others be assigned
advisers from a pool of faculty members
interested in such work.
By the beginning of his sophomore
year-if not sooner—all students must
select a University Adviser, any member
of the faculty or staff willing to assume
the role.
"The Committee conceives the
University Adviser to ' the adviser for
the student," the report asserts—"in the
words of the position paper, 'the
student's academic advocate, the
particular educator who agrees to
concern himself with his advisee's best
education.'
Graduate Advising
For graduates, the reports notes that
each student "should be assigned by the
department to his adviser ... The
graduate adviser is responsible for aiding
the student in planning and executing
his degree program and in determining
his eventual career."
Also, "administrative and staff
officers of the University who are in
close contact with the academic
programs of the University should be
encouraged to assume formal advising
responsibilities."
The report also notes that "every
faculty member should understand the
advising program of his department."
Referring to recent experiments in
some departments, the committee
suggests that more use be made of
upperclassmen as advisers to lowerclass
students in their departments.
"Most advising of students at
Stanford is now and will continue to be
done by other students," the report
comments. "Such informal advising
should not be discouraged. Even when it
is misinformed, it does no greater harm
than advising done by misinformed
faculty members."

VANDALISM—Vandals hit the offices of the Stanford Judicial Council twice over the weekend, according to campus police and ASSU officials.
The pictures above are from an "inkhombing" of the Council's office in the second floor Tresidder Union Sunday night. The officers have been
used by the Council in their recent investigation of last month's Faculty Club disruption. Campus police, investigating the incident, have not
uncovered any leads. Saturday, officials discovered obscenities painted on the office door but did not release any information 011 that incident
until yesterday.
The Advising and Counseling
Committee of the Study of Education
at Stanford (SES) has recommended
major revisions in the present advising
structure for undergraduates in a report
released today.
Proposed changes include placing
responsibility for academic advising of
undergraduates in the hands of the
proposed Dean of Undergraduate
Education. Establishment of an advising
office under the direction of- an
associate dean was also suggested.
Other recommendations include:
•establishing a committee of the
Academic Senate to study advising;
•revising procedures for faculty
appointment and promotion to take
into account work as an adviser;
•paying freshman advisers up to
$500 per year in addition to their
regular salary;
•increasing the amount of literature
available to both students and faculty;
•establishing a Career Guidances
Center through expanding the
Placement Services, and setting up a
psychological services unit as part of the
Cowell Health Center.
Follows Position Paper
The report follows a preliminary
position paper issued by the committee
last April. It is the sixth of the ten SES
reports and will be considered by the
Academic Senate and Student
Education Council.
The committee found present
advising and counseling at Stanford
sorely lacking. "The Committee is
agreed that a single word would fairly
accurately sum up the situation of
advising and counseling at Stanford and
the problems to which we addressed
ourselves," the report said.
"That word is 'indifferent.'
"The faculty are, on the whole,
indifferent to advising; the advising they
give is generally indifferent in quality;

students are indifferent to it ... As a
result of this indifference, students
progress haphazardly in many ways."
New Structures Not Solution
But the group feels that new
structures are not the real solution to
the problems.
"The Committee believes that
changes of attitude are a key to the
solution or amelioration of these
problems," the report noted. "The
Committee realizes that reports do not
change attitudes, but that people change
attitudes. The\jost reports can do—and
this one attempts to do it—is to propose
symbolic actions that may draw
attention to problems and imply
possible changes of attitude."
