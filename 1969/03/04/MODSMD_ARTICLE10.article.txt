# Letters To The Editor
## Understanding Is Possible 
### 
Editor,THE DAILY:
I agree partially to the recent
letter in the Daily concerning the
"left" and "right." I will explain
my disagreement. In the
development of any individual into
a mature, respectable, and
respecting human being, the
feelings, which in any human
interaction are clouded by the
intellectual self-defense
mechanisms, are of the highest
importance in dealing with and
solving any difference or road
block to understanding between
two individuals or groups. If the so
called "left" and "right", and I
realize each will be self-defensive
about this statement, would drop
some of their intellectual
self-defense mechanisms and
attempt to see why the others feel
the way they do, possibly an
understanding could be reached.
I agree with the article that
attacking the other side and telling
them that they are immature is not
the optimal means to achieve
understanding, because as soon as
they are attacked they are
self-defensive and as such do not
attempt to logically perceive why
the other side feels the way they
do. I believe the issue is
complicated, and as such has no
one right answer. The means to
achieve answers is not to
continually attack the other side,
but to try and understand what -
they feel and WHY they feel this
way.
Also, if there is any chance to
achieve any understanding of the
feelings involved, it is extremely
important to let each know that
they are not being attacked, but
simply trying to be understood, as
we are trying to understand
ourselves.

• "State Of The School'
Editor,THE DAILY:
Deans and senior administrative
officials of the University would do
well to consider the example of the
Acting Dean of the Graduate
School of Business. Last
Wednesday Dean Pond gave a -
"State of the School" message to
the students of the Business
School. The presentation was
informal and well attended, but
most importantly it served to
communicate to the students the
Dean's thoughts on what he felt
were the important issues. The
students responded with questions
and statements regarding their
concerns. No demands were made
by either side and, if such meetings
are held regularly in the future, it is
unlikely that either side will find it
necessary to even contemplate
making demands.
This type of dialogue is perhaps
the ounce of prevention which has
been too long neglected and it may
even serve well in some of the more
critical situations in the University
community.

Editor,THE DAILY:
Regarding the recent vandalism
at Stanford caused by minority
students, I wish to express an
opinion as an aJumnus: "I don't
want to pay for it."
Stanford is an endowed
institution and I feel that the
students who attend are privileged
to do so.
I do not feel that I should be
called upon to make a donation to
pay for their damage.
I also presume that you have
heard of the recent
pronouncement made by the
President of Notre Dame and hope
that you will make your position
just as clear and as firm.

• Double Standard?
Editor, THE DAILY:
The conflict between the
necessity to judge men's actions in
context and the necessity for a
standard of conduct which will
apply to all our citizens seems
irreconcilable because a resolution
based on either is unfair and
unacceptable to the other group.
Blacks have been discriminated
against by whites for centuries;
therefore, they should not be

judged by white standards.
Although they damaged the
bookstore and took food from the
cafeteria, their act is so
overbalanced by their past of
misery and want that little
attention should be focused on this
one act. It must be seen in context.
On the other hand, can a double
standard work? If there is no basic
assumption of what a man can or
cannot do to another without some
action by the society as a whole,
then, there is no freedom for
anybody, except negative freedom
obtained by vigilante action—by
goon squads who, we must admit,
are judging within the context of
their experience (or, more likely,
the experience of some other
person or persons).
What is the answer? There must
be an answer.

obtained by vigilante action—by

Editor,THE DAILY:
I agree partially to the recent
letter in the Daily concerning the
"left" and "right." I will explain
my disagreement. In the
development of any individual into
a mature, respectable, and
respecting human being, the
feelings, which in any human
interaction are clouded by the
intellectual self-defense
mechanisms, are of the highest
importance in dealing with and
solving any difference or road
block to understanding between
two individuals or groups. If the so
called "left" and "right", and I
realize each will be self-defensive
about this statement, would drop
some of their intellectual
self-defense mechanisms and
attempt to see why the others feel
the way they do, possibly an
understanding could be reached.
I agree with the article that
attacking the other side and telling
them that they are immature is not
the optimal means to achieve
understanding, because as soon as
they are attacked they are
self-defensive and as such do not
attempt to logically perceive why
the other side feels the way they
do. I believe the issue is
complicated, and as such has no
one right answer. The means to
achieve answers is not to
continually attack the other side,
but to try and understand what -
they feel and WHY they feel this
way.
Also, if there is any chance to
achieve any understanding of the
feelings involved, it is extremely
important to let each know that
they are not being attacked, but
simply trying to be understood, as
we are trying to understand
ourselves.

• "State Of The School'
Editor,THE DAILY:
Deans and senior administrative
officials of the University would do
well to consider the example of the
Acting Dean of the Graduate
School of Business. Last
Wednesday Dean Pond gave a -
"State of the School" message to
the students of the Business
School. The presentation was
informal and well attended, but
most importantly it served to
communicate to the students the
Dean's thoughts on what he felt
were the important issues. The
students responded with questions
and statements regarding their
concerns. No demands were made
by either side and, if such meetings
are held regularly in the future, it is
unlikely that either side will find it
necessary to even contemplate
making demands.
This type of dialogue is perhaps
the ounce of prevention which has
been too long neglected and it may
even serve well in some of the more
critical situations in the University
community.

Regarding the recent vandalism
at Stanford caused by minority
students, I wish to express an
opinion as an aJumnus: "I don't
want to pay for it."
Stanford is an endowed
institution and I feel that the
students who attend are privileged
to do so.
I do not feel that I should be
called upon to make a donation to
pay for their damage.
I also presume that you have
heard of the recent

that you will make your position
just as clear and as firm.

• Double Standard?
Editor, THE DAILY:
The conflict between the
necessity to judge men's actions in

irreconcilable because a resolution

unacceptable to the other group.
Blacks have been discriminated

therefore, they should not be

at Stanford caused by minority
students, I wish to express an
opinion as an aJumnus: "I don't
want to pay for it."
Stanford is an endowed
institution and I feel that the
students who attend are privileged
to do so.
I do not feel that I should be
called upon to make a donation to
pay for their damage.
I also presume that you have
heard of the recent
pronouncement made by the
President of Notre Dame and hope
that you will make your position
just as clear and as firm.

• Double Standard?
Editor, THE DAILY:
The conflict between the
necessity to judge men's actions in
context and the necessity for a
standard of conduct which will
apply to all our citizens seems
irreconcilable because a resolution
based on either is unfair and
unacceptable to the other group.
Blacks have been discriminated
against by whites for centuries;
therefore, they should not be

judged by white standards.
Although they damaged the
bookstore and took food from the
cafeteria, their act is so
overbalanced by their past of
misery and want that little
attention should be focused on this
one act. It must be seen in context.
On the other hand, can a double
standard work? If there is no basic
assumption of what a man can or
cannot do to another without some
action by the society as a whole,
then, there is no freedom for
anybody, except negative freedom
obtained by vigilante action—by
goon squads who, we must admit,
are judging within the context of
their experience (or, more likely,
the experience of some other
person or persons).
What is the answer? There must
be an answer.
