# Notes From Tresidder
## State Of The Union 
### 
Editor's note: The following was
written by Tresidder Union Hoard
(Jiairman I'eter Haas, as an open letter
to the Stanford eoininunity.
The Tresidder Union Board is
sponsoring a pre-dead week free
dance this Friday night, in the
cafeteria, from 10:00 to 12:30.
We are also calling for an open
hearing this Tuesday evening at
8:00 in room 270 at Tresidder to
discuss and ask for suggestions
regarding the use of Union
facilities. We also plan to clarify the
decision-making channels at the
Union, and further elaborate on
the recent decision to reduce the
Union's hours of operation.
Even though we cannot
condone the unauthorized
"liberation of the Union," the
unintentional damage to property,
the non-student support, the
handing of liquor out to minors, we
recognize the need and possible
demand for some facility on
campus where students can initiate
programs of their design. The
Union should be for students, and
they are the ones who should plan
its programs. We have tried to
encourage a casual and
unstructured atmosphere; it would
be ideal if the Union could remain
open 24 hours a day.
However, the facts remain that
we cannot operate the Union in a

financial deficit (estimated at a
possible $27,000 for the current
fiscal year), nor can we neglect the
maintenance of the building, and in
particular the cafeteria area. Most
of the revenues come from the
cafeteria. We have declined in the
past to substantially raise food
prices since we are aware that this
might present additional financial
burden to students. The Union
derives only a portion of its
revenues from the University.
Due to rising costs and
decreasing revenues, the students
on the Union Board and the
members of the tripartite Union
Committee felt it necessary to
achieve a closer balance between
expenses and income. Several
alternatives were reviewed: a)
initiate a general price increase for
food and other services; b) lower
maintenance; c) eliminate free
services (meeting rooms, music
listening facilities, etc.); d) curtail
programs (art exhibits, jazz casuals,
film series, etc.) e) obtain
additional funds from the
University; 112) modify hours of
service.
The first four were seen to be
undesirable because of the Union's
basic purpose to serve the
community (in particular, the price
increase would be a burden to
students) and offer programs of
interest to the campus. We felt
under the circumstances that a
request for more support from the
University would be out of line at
this time because of existing
high-priority demands on its
resources. Based on the records for
sales it was found that only four
percent of the total business is
done after 9:30, whereas about
34% is done between 11:30 AM
and 1:30 PM., and 17% between
4:30 and 6:30 PM.
We felt that reducing the closing
time to 10:00 PM would be least
burdensome to the community.
Thus, on February 17 we
established the new hours in order
to realize a possible savings of up to
10,000 dollars during the balance
of the fiscal year. It must be
pointed out that meetings and
movies starting before 10:00 PM
will continue past the closing time.
Also the Coffee House remains
open until 2:00 AM every night.
It is our intent to remain
responsive to fellow students and
other members of the community
and attempt to remain flexible in
making policy decisions for
Tresidder Union.

undesirable because of the Union's
basic purpose to serve the
community (in particular, the price
increase would be a burden to
students) and offer programs of
interest to the campus. We felt
under the circumstances that a
request for more support from the
University would be out of line at
this time because of existing
high-priority demands on its
resources. Based on the records for
sales it was found that only four
percent of the total business is
done after 9:30, whereas about
34% is done between 11:30 AM
and 1:30 PM., and 17% between
4:30 and 6:30 PM.
We felt that reducing the closing
time to 10:00 PM would be least
burdensome to the community.
Thus, on February 17 we
established the new hours in order
to realize a possible savings of up to
10,000 dollars during the balance
of the fiscal year. It must be
pointed out that meetings and
movies starting before 10:00 PM
will continue past the closing time.
Also the Coffee House remains
open until 2:00 AM every night.
It is our intent to remain
responsive to fellow students and
other members of the community
and attempt to remain flexible in
making policy decisions for
Tresidder Union.

The Tresidder Union Board is
sponsoring a pre-dead week free
dance this Friday night, in the
cafeteria, from 10:00 to 12:30.
We are also calling for an open
hearing this Tuesday evening at
8:00 in room 270 at Tresidder to
discuss and ask for suggestions
regarding the use of Union
facilities. We also plan to clarify the
decision-making channels at the
Union, and further elaborate on
the recent decision to reduce the
Union's hours of operation.
Even though we cannot
condone the unauthorized
"liberation of the Union," the
unintentional damage to property,
the non-student support, the
handing of liquor out to minors, we
recognize the need and possible
demand for some facility on
campus where students can initiate
programs of their design. The
Union should be for students, and
they are the ones who should plan
its programs. We have tried to
encourage a casual and
unstructured atmosphere; it would
be ideal if the Union could remain
open 24 hours a day.
However, the facts remain that
we cannot operate the Union in a

financial deficit (estimated at a
possible $27,000 for the current
fiscal year), nor can we neglect the
maintenance of the building, and in
particular the cafeteria area. Most
of the revenues come from the
cafeteria. We have declined in the
past to substantially raise food
prices since we are aware that this
might present additional financial
burden to students. The Union
derives only a portion of its
revenues from the University.
Due to rising costs and
decreasing revenues, the students
on the Union Board and the
members of the tripartite Union
Committee felt it necessary to
achieve a closer balance between
expenses and income. Several
alternatives were reviewed: a)
initiate a general price increase for
food and other services; b) lower
maintenance; c) eliminate free
services (meeting rooms, music
listening facilities, etc.); d) curtail
programs (art exhibits, jazz casuals,
film series, etc.) e) obtain
additional funds from the
University; 112) modify hours of
service.
The first four were seen to be
undesirable because of the Union's
basic purpose to serve the
community (in particular, the price
increase would be a burden to
students) and offer programs of
interest to the campus. We felt
