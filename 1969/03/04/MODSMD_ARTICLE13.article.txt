# Multi-Media Happening
## 
### 
A large group encounter that
will "generate a powerful and
unforgetable learning experience
for the participants involved" will
be presented tonight at 7:30 p.m.
in theTMU large lounge.
The four-hour program entitled
Knowledge in The 70's—A
Multi-Media Experience is based
on the idea that real learning
involves the emotions as well as the
intellect. Using an atmosphere that
includes intensive sight and sound,
interpersonal communication
dynamics, and non-verbal
exercises, the TMU and
Communication Department
sponsored program will "let people
explode under an information
overload." The program will cost
$2 for the public and $1 for
students.
"Not everyone makes it through
these stages," stated Giuliano. "A
certain percentage of the audience
will freak out and never make it
past the first or second step.
However, they will still benefit
from their encounters with each
other over the perception of the
situation they're in. They will learn
how they are different from those
who were not turned off."
The benefit of program is that it
teaches the individual to "relate
himself to information," believes
Giuliano. "We live in an
environment that has an
information overlay and this
program shows the individual how
he reacts to stimuli and how to
react more explicitly to his
environment."
Giuliano emphasized that this is
a far out educational experience.
For the best results, come dressed
casually and don't have any fixed
expectations.
