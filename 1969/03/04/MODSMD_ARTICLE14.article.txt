# Campus Film Reviews
## Yet Another Week 
### TODD McCARTHY 
This week's campus films
include one of the Tracy-Hepburn
series, two by Bergman, the best of
Fields, and one of the important
films of the New Wave as well as the
phenomenal The Graduate.
Tonight and Wednesday in
Geology 320, Clive Miller will
present Fat and Mike and The Mask
of Dimitrios. Pat and Mike,
directed in 1952 by George Cukor,
was one of Spencer Tracy's and
Katharine Hepburn's funnier
soirees. The Mask of Dimitrios isan
Eric Ambler mystery starring
Sydney Greenstreet and Peter
Lorre, two of the personalities who
appear so often in Bogart's
pictures. And there's always Clive.
This week's Western Civ film, to
be shown tonight only at 4:15 and
7:30 in Cubberley, is Ingmar
Bergman's The Seventh Seal. This
highly praised allegory of Man is
played out during the time of the
Black Death and many of the film's
images remain in the mind long
after the film is over.
I-Ccnter Flick
Another Bergman film, Saw dust
and Tinsel, is the I-Center picture
at Cubberley on Thursday. Made in
1954, the film is considered

Bergman's first work as a "mature"
film-maker is full of "intricate and
bizarre" compositions, and
established Bergman as an auteur in
certain critical circles.
The Island, directed by Kaneto
Shindo, is the Japanese film at
Cubberley on Friday night. The
picture has been praised and
damned from various sides but is
compelling in that no dialogue is
spoken throughout, all being told
through the camera, action and
actors.
The Bank Dick, at Tresidder on
Friday, is pure W.C. Fields. For one
of the few times in his career, the
old child-hater is allowed to carry
on unburdened by competing
comedians or sideplots. The result:
Field's best film and a comedy
classic. Showing with it is a Harry
Langdon short, Soldier Man.
Experimental*
Six experimental films will be
shown on Friday at 11 pm in
Geology 320.
San Franciscan Robert Nelson's
Oh Dem Watermelons, "an assault
on conceptions about Negroes and
movies," has become an
underground classic. Ed
Emshwiller's Thanatopsis is a

remarkable technical achievement,
having a "ghostly, almost
science-fiction quality." Also being
shown are Mike Kuchar's Green
Desire, Keep Off the Crass, Chinese
Firedrilland Off-()n.
Alain Resnais' Hiroshima Mon
Amour, at Tresidder on Saturday,
is regarded as one of the most
important films of the past decade.
A love story set in the ashes of the
Japanese city, Roy Armes notes
that the film "proved to be as
masterly and revolutionary as
Orson Welles' Citizen Kane
eighteen years earlier." The film's
most innovative trait is its disregard
for story and plot in deference to
"a new narrative technique of
balancing image and text."
Everyone must have seen The
Graduate by now but I have a
feeling everyone is going to want to
see it again. Take a tip from your
spring quarter calendar and "get
there early."
