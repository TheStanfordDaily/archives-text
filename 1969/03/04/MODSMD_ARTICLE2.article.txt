# Fleshy Fraternity Raffle Finishes Before Climax
## 
### MARSHALL KILDUFF 
The Ten Commandments may forbid
adultery, but the Fundamental Standard
certainly makes no stipulations. Taking
full advantage of this moral omission, an
enterprising student adapted one of
modern capitalism's first tenets, "Find a
need and fill it."
His plan was brilliantly simple: hold
a benefit raffle with the winner
receiving a free evening with a lady of
negotiable virtue.
"Like most fraternities, we need
money. So I decided to come up with a
money-making idea." This latter-day
Horatio Alger was too shy to mention
his name or his fraternity's, but he did
explain his plan.
Horny Flicks
''I figured $150 for
expenses—running the raffle, the motel
room, and the whore." But there was
more in store for the participants than
just the staid raffle drawing. "We were
going to have a really big party. You
know, horny flicks and each house
could bring a keg."
"If we could sell 300 tickets at a
dollar apiece, we'd clear about $150.
Over 350 tickets were printed.

How did he know that the idea was
going to be such a sure-fire hit?"Well,l
took a survey. I phoned a few friends in
other houses, and they all thought the
idea was good. So I made a conservative
estimate and then added a few more; I
figured that some extra guys would buy
tickets once they saw that their friends
were in it. They'd want a chance to be
the big man in he house too."
Tickets Printed
A few weeks ago the procurer
printed up the tickets and posted
announcements in several select
fraternities. It was impossible to locate a
poster since they became coveted
collector's items almost as soon as they
went out.
Soon after the sales campaign got
under way, the fraternity received a
phone call from the sheriff's office. "We
thought it was an RF. He read us the
entire penal code over the phone. But
then we made some checks on our own,
and we found out that the
administration was watching. If the
administration knew, there was a good
chance that the police knew."

According to the student capitalist,
the police were threatening to arrest the
house en masse for pimping. About
then, he said, "We decided we'd better
call it off."
What about the winner's prize?"ln
San Francisco there's a certain
underworld figure we know. He's the
same guy that supplies us with our
horny flicks. He'd find us one for about
$110." Isn't that a lot, even if she's
attractive? "Well, hell, it's for all night."

horny flicks. He'd find us one for about
$110." Isn't that a lot, even if she's
attractive? "Well, hell, it's for all night."
The Ten Commandments may forbid
adultery, but the Fundamental Standard
certainly makes no stipulations. Taking
full advantage of this moral omission, an
enterprising student adapted one of
modern capitalism's first tenets, "Find a
need and fill it."
His plan was brilliantly simple: hold
a benefit raffle with the winner
receiving a free evening with a lady of
negotiable virtue.
"Like most fraternities, we need
money. So I decided to come up with a
money-making idea." This latter-day
Horatio Alger was too shy to mention
his name or his fraternity's, but he did
explain his plan.
Horny Flicks
''I figured $150 for
expenses—running the raffle, the motel
room, and the whore." But there was
more in store for the participants than
just the staid raffle drawing. "We were
going to have a really big party. You
know, horny flicks and each house
could bring a keg."
"If we could sell 300 tickets at a
dollar apiece, we'd clear about $150.
Over 350 tickets were printed.

How did he know that the idea was
going to be such a sure-fire hit?"Well,l
took a survey. I phoned a few friends in
other houses, and they all thought the
idea was good. So I made a conservative
estimate and then added a few more; I
figured that some extra guys would buy
tickets once they saw that their friends
were in it. They'd want a chance to be
the big man in he house too."
Tickets Printed
A few weeks ago the procurer
printed up the tickets and posted
announcements in several select
fraternities. It was impossible to locate a
poster since they became coveted
collector's items almost as soon as they
went out.
Soon after the sales campaign got
under way, the fraternity received a
phone call from the sheriff's office. "We
thought it was an RF. He read us the
entire penal code over the phone. But
then we made some checks on our own,
and we found out that the
administration was watching. If the
administration knew, there was a good
chance that the police knew."

According to the student capitalist,
the police were threatening to arrest the
house en masse for pimping. About
then, he said, "We decided we'd better
call it off."
What about the winner's prize?"ln
San Francisco there's a certain
underworld figure we know. He's the
same guy that supplies us with our
horny flicks. He'd find us one for about
