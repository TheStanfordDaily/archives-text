# New Goals For SRI Urged By 'Coalitions'
## 
### BILL BANKS 
A movement to redirect the goals of
the Stanford Research Institute (SRI)
has been initiated by a group of
"concerned members of the Stanford
community."
The group, operating under the title
of the SRI Coalition, has announced
that it will "urge that SRI be brought
under closer control by the University
community and that no further
chemical-biological warfare or
counter-insurgency contracts be
accepted by SRI."
The coalition is circulating a petition
expressing its distress over the fact that
SRI has renewed its major
counter-insurgency project and that two
Chemical-Biological Warfare contracts
are pending.
The statement pointed out that a
University Committee is presently
studying SRl's relationship to Stanford
and that "there is a danger that the
committee will recommend that the
University sever its ties with SRI, thus
absolving the University of
responsibility for the work of the
institute."
'Humane Goals'
It continued, saying that "SRI
should direct its work toward creative
and humane goals, and that the
university community has a
responsibility to make such .moral
judgments."

The petition was signed by Yale
Braunstein, LASSU Speaker, Robert
McAfee Brown, professor of religion,
Martin Cornoy, assistant professor of
education, Father John Duryea,
Catholic chaplain of the University,
David W. Jones, chairman of the
Committee for a New Democratic
Politics, Michael Wald, assistant
professor of law, Philip Taubman, editor
of The Daily, Dwight Clark, director of
Volunteers in Asia, and sixteen others.
Involvement Shameful
Commenting on the statement,
Father Duryea said, "I am against the
involvement of anyone in such research,
particularly the University." He stated
further that he thought it "a shame that
Stanford is involved." Michael Wald
added that, "It is a difficult problem.
This is not clearly an ideal solution but
it is the best solution to this particular
problem." Ward emphasized that the
coalition is addressing the specific
problem of Chemical-biological warfare.
Also commenting along this line,
Jones stated that the coalition is not
questioning the values of all military
research. He explained that the
distinctions between pure science and
the entirety of the military research
effort were difficult to draw.
Jones said that Stanford should not
sell SRI. "We want a situation in which
the university is ethically accountable."
