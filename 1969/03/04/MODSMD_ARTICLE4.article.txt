# Civic Center Vigil
## March For 'Presidio 27' Slated 
### LYNNE McCALLISTER 
"Go as individuals, to speak to
people, not to scream at the
authorities," Paul Wesley, a leader of
the non-violent March on the Presidio,
urged a crowd of 300 people at the
noon rally in White Plaza yesterday.
Joan Baez Harris and Dean of the
Chapel B. Davie Napier also spoke at
the rally, which was sponsored by the
Resistance and The Committee for New
Democratic Politics (CNDP).
The rally was held in support of a
150 mile walk from the Institute of
Non-violence in Carmel to the Presidio
,1 San Francisco. The march is in
protest of the 14 to 16 year sentences
recently given to three of the Presidio
"mutineers." These soldiers had held a
sit-down strike in the military stockade
after the shooting of one of their
comrades, mentally deranged Richard
Bunch. They were charged with mutiny.

Morley asked the crowd to join the
last leg of the walk, through San
Francisco to a night-long vigil in the
Civic Center. He asked them to do this
"in a non-violent frame of mind,
because this is what these guys did." He
also emphasized that they are marching,
not just for a reduction of sentences,
but for a complete dismissal.
Incident Not Unusual
Paul Rupert, of the Resistance and
the United Christian Ministry, stressed
the idea that in the military, "the
Presidio incident is no great exception."
He said that the mutineers received "a
lot lighter punishment than most people
get when they stand up to the military."
In speaking at the rally Dean Napier
used an extended metaphor, dealing
with the contradictions in our society
and country. "A house divided against
itself will fall," he said. In speaking
about "the military wing of our house,"

he said that there are "rules which
pertained long before our house was
built." "It must be brought into
context," he went on, "with what we
propose to be." "I support this
non-violent, but passionate protest," he
concluded.
Joan Baez Harris, taking he place of
her husband, former Stanford student
body president Dave Harris, told the
crowd that "militarism is a disease
which is crawling over the earth." She
emphasized Rupert's claim that the
Presidio incident was not unusual.
Baez's Explanation
"It's as if someone threw up in your
lap instead of the bathroom. Except
that they're not throwing up in the
bathrooms. They're dropping dead in
the bathrooms." She told the students
that it was up to them to effect a
change.
"This rally will give us all a plan of

action," said David Jones chairman of
the CNDP. He has arranged rides for
those who wish to join the march. Cars
will be leaving the ASSU office at 5:30
and 7 p.m. on Tuesday.
The marchers will leave the San
Mateo Peace Center, on Second Avenue
at 9:30 this morning. They will walk up
El Camino Real, which becomes Mission
St. From 4-6 p.m. they will be at the
Church of Our Lady of Perpetual Help
at 60 Wellington St. in Daly City, just
off Mission. The route to the Civic
Center will be by way of Valencia,
Market, and Polk Streets.
"The vigil at the Civic Center will
start at 8 p.m. We feel that it is very
important that supporters be there
during the evening before teh marchers
arrive," said Jones. "People that are
driving to either the 6:00 march or the
8:00 vigil should be encouraged to call
the ASSU office to offer rides."
