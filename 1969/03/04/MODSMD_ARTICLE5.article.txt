# Social Role To Be Examined
## 'Science In Society' Forum Today 
### DOUGLAS D. ANDERSON 
Two general meetings in Memorial
Church and a series of panel discussion
will highlight today's "March 4
Convocation" on "Science in Society."
Some 500 people both scientists and
non-scientists, from the Stanford area
community are expected to participate
in the program.
The student-organized convocation is
designed to encourage dialogue on the
major moral issues facing the scientific
and technological fields today and
promote concern for these social
problems. Unlike demonstrations
planned at some of the 40-plus colleges
around the nation, Stanford's
convocation is not a work stoppage or
strike.
Featured speakers will include
Stanford President Kenneth Pitzer and
Congressman Jeffrey Cohelan
(D.-Alameda), at the 9 p.m. meeting in
Memorial Church. They will share the
platform with Dr. Martin Perl, professor
at SLAC, and an expert in high energy
physics.
Mem Chu Addresses
The day's meetings will begin at 1:15

in Memorial Church with addresses by
Nobel laureate, Joshua Lederberg
speaking on "Humanities and Its
Dilemmas"; Professor Sidney Drell,
member of the President's Science
Advisory Committee (PSAC) who will
discuss "ABM: The Scientist in Public
Policy"; physics professor Leonard
Schiff, addressing "The Value and
Support of Basic Science"; and
Professor John Linvill, chairman of the
Electrical Engineering Department, who
will discuss "The Role of the Engineer
in Society."
Following the opening addresses, the
audience will reconvene in nearby
classrooms for a number of different
afternoon forums and panel discussions
starting at 3:30 p.m.
Moderated by student members of
the "Committee for March 4" the
afternoon panels will include:
"The Military-Industrial-University
Complex," to be held in Bishop
Auditorium with electrical engineering
Professor, Hubert Heffner; history
Professor Barton Bernstein; and David
Ransom, former Stanford graduate
student and instructor in english, and

currently editor of the Peninsula
Observer.
"The Implications of Recent
Developments in Biology" to be held in
Engineering 300, will feature Prof.
Lederberg and Prof. D. Donald
Kennedy, chairman of the Biological
Sciences Department.
''Technology and Social
Development: Opportunities and
Dangers," to be held in Mem Chu with
Dr. Sidney Slomich, social scientist of
Stanford Research Institute; Ira Hall,
director of the Stanford-Mid-Peninsula
Urban Coalition; Dean Joseph M. Pettit
of the Stanford School of Engineering;
and Prof. Rolf Elliason of the civil
engineering department.
"Basic Science: Its Value and
Support" to be held in Old Business 121
with Prof. Schiff and Nobel laureate and
biochemical professor, Arthus
Kornberg.
After an evening recess for dinner,
the convocation will continue with
three additional panels, starting at 7:30
p.m. These are:
"Chemical-Biological Warfare" to be
held in Mem Chu.

"Anti-Ballistic Missiles" to be held in
History 213.
"Population and Pollution" to be
held in Engineering 300.
Congressman Cohelan, an out-spoken
opponent of the anti-ballistic missile
(ABM) program is expected to
participate in the ABM forum.
The chemical-biological warfare
panel will include participants of a
variety of different viewpoints. Merrill
Snyder of the department of
micro-biology at the University of
Maryland is engaged in "non-classified"
research involving chemical warfare and
sees it as a valid means for national
security. He favors a greater degree of
non-classified university research.
Jerry Marr chairman of the
department of micro-biology at the
University of California at Davis offers
and believes that the university should
remain out of chemical warfare
research.
The idea for the convocation
originally grew out of a call by MIT
physicists for a "day of concern" about
government supported scientific
research.
