# Teacher Or Friend?
## Sponsors Perceive Varying Roles 
### BARBARA HYLAND (First Of A Series) 
In September when bewildered
freshman move into all-freshman dorms,
they discover that they are not truly in a
freshman ghetto for there are
upperclassmen living on every corridor.
TTiese older, questionably wiser, students
are considered sponsors and in exchange
for their room live in a freshman dorm for
a year.
No one dictates to them what being a
sponsor means; it is left up to the
individual to define his role. Thus there
are as many roles as there are sponsors

and sponsoring becomes a very personal
experience.
Often one's conception of sponsoring
is intricately connected with one's
motives for becoming a sponsor. In
talking with numerous sponsors, one
becomes aware of the scope of
interpretations of the role of the sponsor.
For Corky Dilworth in Paloma, being
a sponsor is pprimarily being a friend. She
grinned and remarked, "It's kind of neat
having a defined role of being friendly
and having people come into your room
to talk naturally."

She had initially felt, "I had some
attitudes toward life that might be
imparted to some people." She found
that in the sponsor situation this was not
true for it was impossible to tell people
what they should know. "Ideas became
so much subordinated to people."
Summers Goff in Loro agreed and
said, "I started thinking about sponsoring
in terms of teaching. You think you're
going to win converts." Corky added,
"But they convert you."
"I became a sponsor for the wrong
reasons," admitted Barb Hazard in
Arroyo. She felt that she was needed and
that she could meet the demands. She
stressed, "It had to be something more
than a responsibility."
Barb felt that a sponsor is a friend
before a teacher. From the concern and
tolerance that evolves from a friend
relationship, learning "comes naturally."
"Within any friendship there is going to
be interaction through which both
parties expect to learn.
She said that fall quarter was spent
just "talking about very superficial
things. Tolerance pays off and they open
up." Although not consciously trying to
challenge the freshmen's ideas, she
stated, "My presence here without
opening my mouth, is a provocation."
She explained that this was not so
much due to her personality as it was to
her being two years older and therefore
having a different perspective on both
college and high school.
Minds Not Molded
Paul Witt, a sponsor last year in
Rinconada, disclaimed the idea that
sponsors want to mold minds or that they
can. "Not with the caliber of students
that come here," he stated. Rather than
attempting to tell the freshmen about the
meaning of life, he tried to show them
"how to go about finding the meaning of
life."
"When you get to college, you don't

even know what the alternatives are," he
said. "I laid out the alternatives and
saidâ€”pick one."
Stu Purkey in Branner said he became
a sponsor in order "to try to do
something with people, with my ideas."
He criticized Stanford for not providing
enough of a challenge to life styles. He
claimed that "Stanford doesn't
encourage a questioning attitude."
As a sponsor he hoped to expose the
freshmen to critical thinking. He said that
the freshmen "get to see me, a radical, as
a person," and that this was his greatest
influence "Political activities are a part of
my life style," he said.
Roger Boesche in Dormer defined a
sponsor as "one who should draw strong
reactions. The best thing I could do in
order to communicate with the freshmen
was to let them know I was a human. I try
to get everyone thinking. In the end
result, I think more than they do."
He too stressed that a sponsor must
have a "real concern for critical
thinking." Describing himself as a
"soft-spoken leftist," he said that an
integral part of being a sponsor is "just
living there and having the freshman see
someone live differently.
Head Sponsor Speaks
Eric Larsen, Head Sponsor, said that
as a sponsor he felt "compelled and yet
not compelled to communicate a sense of
political urgency" to the freshmen.
"Frankly I've failed," he admitted. His
goal has been to "make a closed mind a
little more open."
Friend, teacher, or disciplinarian the
sponsor must decide what kind of role he
will play in the freshman dorm. Yet, as
Fred Tileston in Branner said, "A sponsor
is what your personality makes it." How
he fulfills his intended role and how his
freshmen respond to him determine his
success as a sponsor. In the next two
articles in this series, these two aspects
will be analyzed.
