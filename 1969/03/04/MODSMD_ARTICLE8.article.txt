TEEN ORGY AT TRESIDDER
The above was a headline in the
San Jose Mercury after a
"liberation" of the Stanford
Student Union on the evening of
February 28,1969.
Our narrator Walter Crankite
will provide an exclusive film of the
meeting the night before as student
radicals planned their action—and
YOU ARE THERE. Brought to
you by Crudential and the Rock of
Gibraltor (apologies to CBS.)
Scene: An upstairs "pad",
suitably unkempt, of the radical
leader Gripely Grommet (apologies
to Arthur Hoppe). We find Gripely
talking to his top aide K. Losit
Downe . . .
K. Losit: "Well, it's raining so
we can't have our usual illegal party
at Lytton Plaza. What do you think
we should do for kicks this
weekend?"
Gripely: "Why not go to
Tresidder? It's dry, and the
bureaucratic establishment has just
decided to close it early thus
prohibiting the five students who
buy late coffee there from doing
their thing."
K. Losit: "Say, that's groovy.
Shall I start passing out leaflets on
the campus?"
Gripely: "No, the students
there are too apathetic. Besides
anybody who just approved ROTC
won't want to goof at Tresidder.
We gotta go to the real hotbed of
local protestors."
K. Losit: "You mean . . .
Gripely: "That's right, the
junior high schools."
K. Losit: "But won't that look
strange—high school students
liberating a college student union
from the college students who run
it and giving it to the college
students who use it?"
Gripely: "It's a natural; such a
situation starts out being so
confused that nobody'll know
what's going on and then someone
calls the pigs and bingo—front
page!"
K. Losit: "Yeah! I'll start
printing leaflets right now and get
them out to the teenyboppers
tomorrow (He goes off humming a
medley of Close It Down, Student
Union for Students, and Joshua
Fought the Battle of Jericho).
FROM THE STUDENTS WHO
RUN THE STUDENT UNION TO
THE STUDENTS WHO USE IT.
