Life lias clearly gone astray when the
local PTA decides to liberate a union.
Not quite, if PTA abbreviates Protestors,
Troublemakers, and Anarchists and the
liberated union is named after Donald
Tresidder.
For the past two Friday nights, the PTA
had led liberation festivals at Tresidder to
protest new, early closing hours. It is
somewhat ironic that the majority of
demonstrators appeared to be of junior high
school age and the leaders of the PTA are
non-students. Yet the Friday
demonstrations spotlight some central
problems facing the management of
Tresidder, problems which concern Stanford
and not tlie neighborhood junior high
schools.
The Tresidder management, composed of
students and Tresidder staff, decided to
close the cafeteria section at 10 p.m. rather
than 11:30 because of rapidly increasing
expenses. (See letteron Page 3) Regrettably,
the union failed to circulate its plans in
advance, and the seemingly autocratic action
catalyzed active criticismof Tresidder.
Much of the criticism is legitimate. Some
is entirely unjustified. The Union is a big
organization with a budget of more than $1
million annually. To some it means excellent
films and jazz concerts. To others it means

an often frenetic lunge for a cold hamburger
or yellowed mayonaise to spread on limp
salad.
The image of Tresidder is bleak. It begins
with an architectural handicap that
accentuates . the sterile and plastic motif,
and for too many years it suffered from
unimaginative, conservative planning. But
changes are occuring. Since the arrival of a
new director. Forest Tregea, there have been
signs of life and vigor. The major credit for
the establishment of a coffee house must go
to Tregea who placed $20,000 trust in
student ability to organize and manage a
coffee house.
The solution to misfit liberation festivals
is not difficult. Tresidder should remain
open later on Friday and Saturday nights
and plan attractive festivals of its own.
Efforts should be made to cheer up the
atmosphere and service, the later often being
crotchety and terse. More care should be
taken in food preparation, storage, and
service.
Although there exists a hard-working
student board at Tresidder which meets at
regular intervals, only a few students make
use of it or provide it with feedback. More
students must devote considerable
extra-curricular time in an effort to make
Tresidder not just a functioning institution
but one attractive to students.

local PTA decides to liberate a union.
Not quite, if PTA abbreviates Protestors,
Troublemakers, and Anarchists and the
liberated union is named after Donald
Tresidder.
For the past two Friday nights, the PTA
had led liberation festivals at Tresidder to
protest new, early closing hours. It is
somewhat ironic that the majority of
demonstrators appeared to be of junior high
school age and the leaders of the PTA are
non-students. Yet the Friday
demonstrations spotlight some central
problems facing the management of
Tresidder, problems which concern Stanford
and not tlie neighborhood junior high
schools.
The Tresidder management, composed of
students and Tresidder staff, decided to
close the cafeteria section at 10 p.m. rather
than 11:30 because of rapidly increasing
expenses. (See letteron Page 3) Regrettably,
the union failed to circulate its plans in
advance, and the seemingly autocratic action
catalyzed active criticismof Tresidder.
Much of the criticism is legitimate. Some
is entirely unjustified. The Union is a big
organization with a budget of more than $1
million annually. To some it means excellent
films and jazz concerts. To others it means

an often frenetic lunge for a cold hamburger
or yellowed mayonaise to spread on limp
salad.
The image of Tresidder is bleak. It begins
with an architectural handicap that
accentuates . the sterile and plastic motif,
and for too many years it suffered from
unimaginative, conservative planning. But
changes are occuring. Since the arrival of a
new director. Forest Tregea, there have been
signs of life and vigor. The major credit for
the establishment of a coffee house must go
to Tregea who placed $20,000 trust in
student ability to organize and manage a
coffee house.
The solution to misfit liberation festivals
is not difficult. Tresidder should remain
open later on Friday and Saturday nights
and plan attractive festivals of its own.
Efforts should be made to cheer up the
atmosphere and service, the later often being
crotchety and terse. More care should be
taken in food preparation, storage, and
service.
Although there exists a hard-working
student board at Tresidder which meets at
regular intervals, only a few students make
use of it or provide it with feedback. More
students must devote considerable
extra-curricular time in an effort to make
Tresidder not just a functioning institution
but one attractive to students.
