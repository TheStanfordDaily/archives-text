Responding to requests from the
Stanford Community of the Right,
President Kenneth S. Pitzer urged
campus unity in opposing coercive
tactics.
"I pledge to do everything in my
power to ensure that our university
remains free for serious debate and
dissent, and at the same time fulfills its
fundamental obligation to scholarship
and the communication of knowledge,"
Pitzer declared. "I urge all members of
the Stanford community to join me in
this effort."
In commenting on Pitzer's statement,
Young Republican president William E.
Boyd said, "We look forward to meeting
with president Pitzer next week to
discuss the proposals."
On Feb. 17 approximately 30
students, drawn mainly from Young
Americans for Freedom and the Young
Republicans, requested Pitzer intensify
recruitment of conservative professors,
retain ROTC academic credit, and
suspend any student who disrupts
campus judicial proceedings.
"If there are political imbalances in
certain departments or schools it is
because such a balance reflects the
political persuasions of the most
distinguished men in the field, not
because of the hiring practice of that
particular department or school," Pitzer
replied.
Professor's Criterion
"The criterion for each appointment
is the distinction of a candidate in his
field, including his ability as a teacher, his
capacity in research or other creative
work, and his suitability for that
particular position.
"Always an effort is made to see that
no extraneous matter, such as a
candidate's political stance, influences
the decision."
So far as ROTC is concerned, Pitzer
noted that the entire Academic Council
will review the 25-8 vote of its Senate
calling for an end to academic credit for
military training and education, starting
in 1970.
"After the vote of the Academic
Council, I expect that there will be
discussions with the Defense Department
concerning possible modifications in the
program and that a new committee will
make recommendations concerning the
proper role of ROTC at Stanford," Pitzer
said.
Faculty Senate Committee
In their Feb. 23 vote, the faculty
representatives on the Senate called for a
committee composed of students,
faculty, administrators and
representatives of the ROTC
departments to work out details of any
transition.

The composition of any new
committee on ROTC probably would
depend on the outcome of the Academic
Council vote.
If the Council decides to retain
academic credit, then faculty
representation on the transitional
committee probably would be greater
than if the decision was reached to deny
credit.
An increased faculty role would be
necessary to decide on matters of
accreditation.
It would be more concerned with
implementing the results of the Council's
decisions rather than initiating a whole
new review of this subject.
In his reply to the Community of the
Right, Pitzer noted that the Legislative
and Judicial Charter gives the chairman
of the Judicial Council "absolute
authority to control the conduct of
persons in the Council's chambers."
"If the chairman or the full council
judges that the behavior of a student
warrants suspension and recommends
such action to me, I am prepared to act
on that recommendation."

"The criterion for each appointment
is the distinction of a candidate in his
field, including his ability as a teacher, his
capacity in research or other creative
work, and his suitability for that
particular position.
"Always an effort is made to see that
no extraneous matter, such as a
candidate's political stance, influences
the decision."
So far as ROTC is concerned, Pitzer
noted that the entire Academic Council
will review the 25-8 vote of its Senate
calling for an end to academic credit for
military training and education, starting
in 1970.
"After the vote of the Academic
Council, I expect that there will be
discussions with the Defense Department
concerning possible modifications in the
program and that a new committee will
make recommendations concerning the
proper role of ROTC at Stanford," Pitzer
said.
Faculty Senate Committee
In their Feb. 23 vote, the faculty
representatives on the Senate called for a
committee composed of students,
faculty, administrators and
representatives of the ROTC
departments to work out details of any
transition.

The composition of any new
committee on ROTC probably would
depend on the outcome of the Academic
Council vote.
If the Council decides to retain
academic credit, then faculty
representation on the transitional
committee probably would be greater
than if the decision was reached to deny
credit.
An increased faculty role would be
necessary to decide on matters of
accreditation.
It would be more concerned with
implementing the results of the Council's
decisions rather than initiating a whole
new review of this subject.
In his reply to the Community of the
Right, Pitzer noted that the Legislative
and Judicial Charter gives the chairman
of the Judicial Council "absolute
authority to control the conduct of
persons in the Council's chambers."
"If the chairman or the full council
judges that the behavior of a student
warrants suspension and recommends
such action to me, I am prepared to act
on that recommendation."
Responding to requests from the
Stanford Community of the Right,
President Kenneth S. Pitzer urged
campus unity in opposing coercive
tactics.
"I pledge to do everything in my
power to ensure that our university
remains free for serious debate and
dissent, and at the same time fulfills its
fundamental obligation to scholarship
and the communication of knowledge,"
Pitzer declared. "I urge all members of
the Stanford community to join me in
this effort."
In commenting on Pitzer's statement,
Young Republican president William E.
Boyd said, "We look forward to meeting
with president Pitzer next week to
discuss the proposals."
On Feb. 17 approximately 30
students, drawn mainly from Young
Americans for Freedom and the Young
Republicans, requested Pitzer intensify
recruitment of conservative professors,
retain ROTC academic credit, and
suspend any student who disrupts
campus judicial proceedings.
"If there are political imbalances in
certain departments or schools it is
because such a balance reflects the
political persuasions of the most
distinguished men in the field, not
because of the hiring practice of that
particular department or school," Pitzer
replied.
