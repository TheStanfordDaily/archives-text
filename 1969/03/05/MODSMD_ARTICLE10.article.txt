### Tom Goodhue 
What this campus needs is a
return to nonsense.
We need more power failures,
UGLY riots and Burbank House
Beer-Can Rolls to disrupt the
pattern of Things As Usual with
ripples of the ridiculous.
We need more UGLYs —
community centers disguised as
libraries, places where people come
to meet other people more than to
study. We need more carpeted
stairwells, first-floor lounges and
doughnut-ring discussion floors.
The UGLY is comfortable, casual,
not conducive to study, and that's
good. We need to sit a spell and talk
a while.

We need more Street Theaters,
Freshman Flicks and Jitterbug
Inaugurals for Dick and Spiro—we
can use the glimpse of reality which
is offered by those who can point
out the absurd.
We need to cultivate our
common humanity along with our
separate intellects. We should
liberate Tresidder more often, fly
kites together in White Plaza and
run laughing and jumping through
the tall green grass.
We need to light fires in our
fireplaces and watch them glow
and crackle without feeling
compelled to comment. We need to
stand silently together, just holding
hands in right relation. We need to
sit in the woods sometimes at night
and just listen.
