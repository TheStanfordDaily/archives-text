# Peanuts In Europe
## 
### Art Buchwald 
W AS HIN GTONâ€”Since
everyone is so confused about what
is going on in Western Europe, I
think the only way to explain it is
in terms of the comic strip
"Peanuts."
Try to imagine that Lucy is
France. She wants to be the leader
of the gang and her greatest
pleasure is getting into everyone's
hair.
Linus represents Great Britain,
and he keeps sucking his thumb
and holding a blanket which says
"Made in the U.S.A."
Charlie Brown, for obvious
reasons, is the United States, and
every time Lucy does something to
him, all he can say is "Good Grief."
Schroeder, of course, is West
Germany, and Snoopy is Italy.
Long ago, Charlie Brown
formed a baseball team called the
NATO Defenders and Lucy played
first base. But a few years ago she
got mad at Charlie Brown, quit the
team and made everyone get out of
her yard. She also urged everyone
else to quit, too. But the other
members of the team refused,
because Charlie Brown had the
only bat and ball that meant
anything.
Lucy, Schroeder, Snoopy and
the other kids have a club which
they formed to sell lemonade to
each other. Linus has been trying
to join this club since it started, but
Lucy said she won't let him in until
he gets rid of his "Made in the
U.S.A." blanket.
Linus is deathly afraid to give up

his blanket because if he did he
might also have to give up his
thumb sucking. Besides, Charlie
Brown gave it to him for Christma
and he doesn't want to hurt
Charlie's feelings.
Last week Lucy told Linus
secretly that he could come into
the lemonade club if he quit
Charlie Brown's team. She
proposed that Linus, Schroeder
and Snoopy could be the leaders of
the new club, and the rest of the
gang, instead of being equal
partners, could become associate
club members.
Linus was horrified at Lucy's
suggestion, so he told Schroeder,
Snoopy, Charlie Brown and the
rest of the gang about Lucy's
proposal.
Everyone was furious at Lucy
for what they considered a double
cross. When Charlie Brown heard
the proposal he said "Good Grief."
Schroeder said he could never
leave Charlie Brown's team because
there would be no one to protect
him if the gang down the next
street tried to steal second base.
Snoopy, who usually is very
quiet, also thought Lucy's idea was
a lousy one, and he had no
intention of getting in the
doghouse with Charlie Brown.
