## Grad Discontent 
### 
Editor,THE DAILY:
Dean Smith's letter to the Daily
(2/27/69) implies that, roughly
speaking, graduate student
attitudes toward their education at
Stanford divide along
departmental lines. According to
Smith, students in the sciences, at
least, are happy with their
programs and feel they are
contributing constructively to the
world around them. While I admit
that such a divergence of opinion
may in fact exist between graduate
students in the sciences and those
in the social sciences and
humanities, I emphatically deny
that it should.
First let me point out to Mr.
Smith that the graduate research
"directly related to the most
pressing needs of our society:
population control, medical
research, synthetic materials to
bolster dwindling natural
resources" is no monopoly of the
exact sciences. In the last analysis
these problems demand primarily
political if not moral solutions. For
example, the development of
synthetics has often had disastrous
consequences for the
underdeveloped nations whose
economies are based on the export
of raw materials. This happened
with Brazilian rubber, Chilean
nitrates and partly explains the
glutted world sugar market today.
Obviously population control is
now technically achievable; we
lack the political means to
implement our technology.
It is, of course, debatable
whether these problems are in fact
"the most pressing" and what
comprises "our society."
Increasingly graduate students at
Stanford are beginning to realize
that "our society" includes not
only the geographical boundaries
of the U.S., the "free" world, or
even the developed societies of the
Northern Hemisphere; increasingly
we are redefining our "most
pressing problems" to include
imperialism, racism and war.
Referring, in conclusion, to the
specific comments made by Mr.
Smith concerning the nature of
graduate student education, it is
clear that he misinterpreted the
attitude being expressed by
reform-minded graduate students
on the issue of teaching. Teaching
experience is seen not only as an
indispenseable part of graduate
education, but student taught
courses can provide greater variety
in course offerings and respond to
undergraduate interests. Finally,
Smith's characterization of
graduate student-faculty
relationships as analogous to
"foreman-worker relations"

implies the kind of hierarchical
technical training which might be
indicated were our problems
merely technical.
Smith's contentment with his
graduate education, I suspect, is
not unrelated to his narrow
technocratic world view. But his
views do not represent a necessary
division between science graduate
students and their counterparts in
other disciplines.

• 'Disenfranchised?
Editor, THE DAILY:
In a letter, written in reply to
our inquiry concerning the
elections for the Education
Council, we were informed that
"The Hare system requires the
physical presence of all ballots.
Overseas Campuses may be
disenfranchised by the mails." This
letter was dated Feb. 24. In the
Feb. 25 Daily, we read the results
of the election. Today is March 1,
and we have yet to receive ballots.
Quite evidently we have been
"disenfranchised". Four hundred
undergraduates attend overseas
campuses, about 8% of the
undergraduate population. We
would like to suggest that this is a
significant number of students to
warrant sending them ballots, and
waiting until the return of those
ballots to finalize the elections.

• Old Whathisname
Editor, THE DAILY:
I demand that my name be
correctly spelled/spaced whenever
it appears in The Daily. I have
worked on the staff for two years
and this volume has been the only
one where, after six weeks, the
name is still incorrectly
represented. The Daily should be
organized enough to know the
correct spelling—or how to find
it—of the staff's names. Some
people who don't even know me
can space my name correctly, so
why people who know do so?
Constant attempts through normal
Daily channels to effect this change
have been unsuccessful, so I turn to
you, the public, to help rectify this
error; write your editor today.
