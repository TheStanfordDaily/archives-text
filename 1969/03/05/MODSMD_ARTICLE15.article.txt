# Student Committee Report
## Experimental Colleges Proposed 
### CICELY BATES 
Copies of the committee
report are on file in the
reference section of the
undergraduate library. The
report is entitled "Educational
Innovation."

For the student who wants his
education through direct
experience, who wants his
education to be self-motivated,
self-determined, and problem
oriented—an experimental college
may be the answer.
This is the conclusion of a
committee of students who
recently inquired into the
deficiences in the educational
processes at Stanford. Out of the
study came two proposals for
on-campus experimental colleges,
an urban extension college, a
community involvement project
on white racism, and a student
oriented institute to study
contemporary higher education.
Each of the proposals are meant
to answer the needs of students
who are not, reports the
committee, "satisfied with the
prospect of merely acting out a
foreordained role in society." The
colleges will be for those who "are
searching instead for
fundamentally new ways to live, to
think, and to learn."
The first on-campus college

proposal envisions "a small group
of students and faculty, who
convene in the absence of grades,
credits, and formalized class in
attempts. . .to re-kindle the
curiousity of childhood, to
eliminate the dichotomy between
living and learning, and to
demonstrate that learning can be
enjoyable."
Under this plan the student in
the experimental college would be
registered in no formal course
work, would disappear from the
grade books, and yet could take
whatever courses the EC offered.
As a unit, the members of the EC
would take courses centered
around the academic interests of its
members.
The focal point of the EC would
be a weekly "Education Meeting,"
whose nature would be determined
by the members of the group and
their interests.
Faculty would be drawn from
departments at Stanford and from
the "outside," but would give no
exams or grades. So students would
not be pressured into making up
units, they would be automatically
given 12 units per quarter on a
pass/no credit basis for their
participation in the college.
The second on-campus proposal
was aimed at freshmen and
sophomores. These students "leave
high school eager for an

educational experience which is
significantly different than what
they are used to." But at Stanford
they are "channeled into the
traditional academic mazeway of
introductory courses, fragmented
disciplines, and institutional life.
Excitement is soon lost."
The proposed EC would help
the student retain the excitement
of new educational experiences. In
an unstructured framework the
student could feel related to what
he is studying.
The Urban Extension College
was proposed on the premise that
"America is in the throes of the
Urban Revolution." Stanford
students are "intellectually
concerned about the crisis yet
physically are sitting in an ivory
tower." The proposal suggests
moving a group of students and
faculty into San Francisco, who
would study and work on real
problems in the city. The members
of the College would gain personal
experience about the environment
in which many of them will
eventually live.
Students and faculty would live
in the city and would study and
actively participate in such areas as
city-planning, the urban political
structure, or city health. Members
of the college would pursue
independent projects such as

teaching in an urban school,
working on an ACT production, or
assisting in a health clinic.
This urban college would
provide off-campus learning that
would, believes the SES report,
"develop a personal sense of
competence and responsibility
without which intellectual skills
would remain immature and
impotent."
The project on white racism is
based on the assumption that "the
race problem is still . . .a white
problem, and white America must
be prepared for the new Black
America."
To help accomplish this task,
the rascism project proposes "to
take a group of white, upper
middle-class, suburban Stanford
students, educate them in the facts,
beliefs, feelings, and effects of
racism, and send them out to
educate a white, upper
midd 1 e-c1 ass, surburban
neighborhood."
To educate white America,
students in the field work part of
the college would establish a center
in one of the mid-Peninsula
communities and would put on
programs, distribute information,
and challenge people to become
involved in programs going on at
the center.
Students at the center would
reach out to the schools, clubs,
businesses, and the city

government in their attempts to
educate the community.
Students would participate in
the field work after one term of
self-education at Stanford that
would center on the problems of
rascism.
The last proposal will study the
problem of the academic
community itself. The college will
attempt to answer the questions
often asked of an academic
community: what are its purposes?
How are these objectives best met?
And many other queries that come
from those who often view such
institutions as seemingly more
dysfunctional than functional.
The study will assume three
premises. 1. Higher education is in
trouble. 2. Students are the most
discontented element on campus.
3. Students have a unique and
valuable perspective to bring to
educational problems. The study
feels that Stanford, as does "any
institution of change, must subject
itself to continuous self-scrutiny if
it is to remain relevant to its own
programs."
"These proposals are only a
preliminary report," emphasized
committee member Jeff Kane.
"Like the SES reports, this report
should only be thought of as a
guideline and as a general frame of
reference in which to review the
whole system of education at
Stanford."

The project on white racism is
based on the assumption that "the
race problem is still . . .a white
problem, and white America must
be prepared for the new Black
America."
To help accomplish this task,
the rascism project proposes "to
take a group of white, upper
middle-class, suburban Stanford
students, educate them in the facts,
beliefs, feelings, and effects of
racism, and send them out to
educate a white, upper
midd 1 e-c1 ass, surburban
neighborhood."
To educate white America,
students in the field work part of
the college would establish a center
in one of the mid-Peninsula
communities and would put on
programs, distribute information,
and challenge people to become
involved in programs going on at
the center.
Students at the center would
reach out to the schools, clubs,
businesses, and the city

government in their attempts to
educate the community.
Students would participate in
the field work after one term of
self-education at Stanford that
would center on the problems of
rascism.
The last proposal will study the
problem of the academic
community itself. The college will
attempt to answer the questions
often asked of an academic
community: what are its purposes?
How are these objectives best met?
And many other queries that come
from those who often view such
institutions as seemingly more
dysfunctional than functional.
The study will assume three
premises. 1. Higher education is in
trouble. 2. Students are the most
discontented element on campus.
3. Students have a unique and
valuable perspective to bring to
educational problems. The study
feels that Stanford, as does "any
institution of change, must subject
itself to continuous self-scrutiny if
it is to remain relevant to its own
programs."
"These proposals are only a
preliminary report," emphasized
committee member Jeff Kane.
"Like the SES reports, this report
should only be thought of as a
guideline and as a general frame of
reference in which to review the
whole system of education at
Stanford."
Copies of the committee
report are on file in the
reference section of the
undergraduate library. The
report is entitled "Educational
Innovation."

For the student who wants his
education through direct
experience, who wants his
education to be self-motivated,
self-determined, and problem
oriented—an experimental college
may be the answer.
This is the conclusion of a
committee of students who
recently inquired into the
deficiences in the educational
processes at Stanford. Out of the
study came two proposals for
on-campus experimental colleges,
an urban extension college, a
community involvement project
on white racism, and a student
oriented institute to study
contemporary higher education.
Each of the proposals are meant
to answer the needs of students
who are not, reports the
committee, "satisfied with the
prospect of merely acting out a
foreordained role in society." The
colleges will be for those who "are
searching instead for
fundamentally new ways to live, to
think, and to learn."
The first on-campus college

proposal envisions "a small group
of students and faculty, who
convene in the absence of grades,
credits, and formalized class in
attempts. . .to re-kindle the
curiousity of childhood, to
eliminate the dichotomy between
living and learning, and to
demonstrate that learning can be
enjoyable."
Under this plan the student in
the experimental college would be
registered in no formal course
work, would disappear from the
grade books, and yet could take
whatever courses the EC offered.
As a unit, the members of the EC
would take courses centered
around the academic interests of its
members.
The focal point of the EC would
be a weekly "Education Meeting,"
whose nature would be determined
by the members of the group and
their interests.
Faculty would be drawn from
departments at Stanford and from
the "outside," but would give no
exams or grades. So students would
not be pressured into making up
units, they would be automatically
given 12 units per quarter on a
pass/no credit basis for their
participation in the college.
The second on-campus proposal
was aimed at freshmen and
sophomores. These students "leave
high school eager for an

educational experience which is
significantly different than what
they are used to." But at Stanford
they are "channeled into the
traditional academic mazeway of
introductory courses, fragmented
disciplines, and institutional life.
Excitement is soon lost."
The proposed EC would help
the student retain the excitement
of new educational experiences. In
an unstructured framework the
student could feel related to what
he is studying.
The Urban Extension College
was proposed on the premise that
"America is in the throes of the
Urban Revolution." Stanford
students are "intellectually
concerned about the crisis yet
physically are sitting in an ivory
tower." The proposal suggests
moving a group of students and
faculty into San Francisco, who
would study and work on real
problems in the city. The members
of the College would gain personal
experience about the environment
in which many of them will
eventually live.
Students and faculty would live
in the city and would study and
actively participate in such areas as
city-planning, the urban political
structure, or city health. Members
of the college would pursue
independent projects such as

teaching in an urban school,
working on an ACT production, or
assisting in a health clinic.
This urban college would
provide off-campus learning that
would, believes the SES report,
"develop a personal sense of
competence and responsibility
without which intellectual skills
would remain immature and
impotent."
The project on white racism is
based on the assumption that "the
race problem is still . . .a white
problem, and white America must
be prepared for the new Black
America."

around the academic interests of its
members.
The focal point of the EC would
be a weekly "Education Meeting,"
whose nature would be determined
by the members of the group and
their interests.
Faculty would be drawn from
departments at Stanford and from
the "outside," but would give no
exams or grades. So students would
not be pressured into making up
units, they would be automatically
given 12 units per quarter on a
pass/no credit basis for their
participation in the college.
The second on-campus proposal
was aimed at freshmen and
sophomores. These students "leave
high school eager for an

educational experience which is
significantly different than what
they are used to." But at Stanford
they are "channeled into the
traditional academic mazeway of
introductory courses, fragmented
disciplines, and institutional life.
Excitement is soon lost."
The proposed EC would help
the student retain the excitement
of new educational experiences. In
an unstructured framework the
student could feel related to what
he is studying.
The Urban Extension College
was proposed on the premise that
"America is in the throes of the
Urban Revolution." Stanford
students are "intellectually
concerned about the crisis yet
physically are sitting in an ivory
tower." The proposal suggests
moving a group of students and
faculty into San Francisco, who
would study and work on real
problems in the city. The members
of the College would gain personal
experience about the environment
in which many of them will
eventually live.
Students and faculty would live
in the city and would study and
actively participate in such areas as
city-planning, the urban political
structure, or city health. Members
of the college would pursue
independent projects such as

teaching in an urban school,
working on an ACT production, or
assisting in a health clinic.
This urban college would
provide off-campus learning that
would, believes the SES report,
"develop a personal sense of
competence and responsibility
without which intellectual skills
would remain immature and
impotent."
The project on white racism is
based on the assumption that "the
race problem is still . . .a white
problem, and white America must
be prepared for the new Black
America."
To help accomplish this task,
the rascism project proposes "to
take a group of white, upper
middle-class, suburban Stanford
students, educate them in the facts,
beliefs, feelings, and effects of
racism, and send them out to
educate a white, upper
midd 1 e-c1 ass, surburban
neighborhood."
To educate white America,
students in the field work part of
the college would establish a center
in one of the mid-Peninsula
communities and would put on
programs, distribute information,
and challenge people to become
involved in programs going on at
the center.
Students at the center would
reach out to the schools, clubs,
businesses, and the city

government in their attempts to
educate the community.
Students would participate in
the field work after one term of
self-education at Stanford that
would center on the problems of
rascism.
The last proposal will study the
problem of the academic
community itself. The college will
attempt to answer the questions
often asked of an academic
community: what are its purposes?
How are these objectives best met?
And many other queries that come
from those who often view such
institutions as seemingly more
dysfunctional than functional.
The study will assume three
premises. 1. Higher education is in
trouble. 2. Students are the most
discontented element on campus.
3. Students have a unique and
valuable perspective to bring to
educational problems. The study
feels that Stanford, as does "any
institution of change, must subject
itself to continuous self-scrutiny if
it is to remain relevant to its own
programs."
"These proposals are only a
preliminary report," emphasized
committee member Jeff Kane.
"Like the SES reports, this report
should only be thought of as a
guideline and as a general frame of
reference in which to review the
whole system of education at
Stanford."
Copies of the committee
report are on file in the
reference section of the
undergraduate library. The
report is entitled "Educational
Innovation."

For the student who wants his
education through direct
experience, who wants his
education to be self-motivated,
self-determined, and problem
oriented—an experimental college
may be the answer.
This is the conclusion of a
committee of students who
recently inquired into the
deficiences in the educational
processes at Stanford. Out of the
study came two proposals for
on-campus experimental colleges,
an urban extension college, a
community involvement project
on white racism, and a student
oriented institute to study
contemporary higher education.
Each of the proposals are meant
to answer the needs of students
who are not, reports the
committee, "satisfied with the
prospect of merely acting out a
foreordained role in society." The
colleges will be for those who "are
searching instead for
fundamentally new ways to live, to
think, and to learn."
The first on-campus college

proposal envisions "a small group
of students and faculty, who
convene in the absence of grades,
credits, and formalized class in
attempts. . .to re-kindle the
curiousity of childhood, to
eliminate the dichotomy between
living and learning, and to
demonstrate that learning can be
enjoyable."
Under this plan the student in
the experimental college would be
registered in no formal course
work, would disappear from the
grade books, and yet could take
whatever courses the EC offered.
As a unit, the members of the EC
would take courses centered
around the academic interests of its
members.
