# Population Forum Panel
## Birth Control: Genocide? 
### MARK WEINBERGER 
Debate at a panel last Thursday
night on population control
focused on the recent charge of
"genocide" leveled against birth
control organizations.
The fight against birth control is
led by a group known as Endeavor
to Raise Our Side (EROS), a group
of black people who see population

control efforts as an extermination
plot against the Negro race.
The "cultural genocide" that
white America has subjected the
black American to for hundreds of
years has a new partner â€”direct
extermination, claimed Miss
Harriet Smith.
Miss Smith, founder and
chairman of EROS, addressed an

audience of about 200 in
Cubberley Auditorium at a
Stanford Population and
Environment Control Forum
program.
She told the audience that the
cultural genocide of the black
people of America includes bad
education, poor judicial systems,
and "pervasive institutional
rascism."
But added to all this, Miss Smith
claimed, are "methods of direct
extermination" of her race:
Vietnam deaths of black soldiers,
police ghetto brutality, and the
introduction of drugs into the
ghetto environment.
Miss Smith, an instructor in
Black Studies at Merritt College
and California State College at
Hayward, added to this list the
efforts of planned parenthood
organizations to allegedly reduce
the percentage of blacks in the
United States. She claims this
curtailment would lead to race
extinction.
Among the goals of Miss Smith's
EROS group is the raising of the
black population in America to 60
million by 1980, thus keeping up
the current 11.5 per cent level of
black citizens.
The other side of the birth
control issue was presented by
Douglas Stewart, director of
community affairs for Planned
Parenthood and World Population.
Stewart stressed his group's
efforts to "make available family
planning services to the poor as
well as the rich."
"We are trying to equalize
access for the poor, medically
neglected women who can not get

the help that suburbanites can,"
Stewart continued.
He categorized the plight of the
poor black woman without
adequate health information and
care as "desperate," citing criminal
abortions, unplanned births, and
inadequate pre- and post-natal care
as examples.
Stewart answered charges that
Planned Parenthood's goals are the
extinction of the black race: "Our
intentions certainly aren't black
genocide; we're not even close to
genocide. Our goal is the freedom
to choose, full freedom. But that
freedom must be based on
knowledge, not ignorance. Our
intentions are to inform the poor
on the alternatives."
The other member of the panel,
Dr. Paul O'Rourke, took a positon
somewhere between that of the
other two panelists. O'Rourke, the
only white on the panel, isdirector
of the East Palo Alto
Neighborhood Health Center.
O'Rourke explained that "there
are rescists who advocate birth
control in an extermination effort.
There is no doubt about it." This is
linked to the current anti-welfare
feeling among state legislators, who
see birth control as the solution to
poverty, he stated.
However., "as a doctor, there is a
paradox here," he said. "Poor
people, regardless of race, are
denied access to family planning
services, pre-natal care, and
theraputic abortions.
"A distinction must be made
between family planning services
and actual birth control efforts.
These services must be available,
but must be elective, with no
coercion," O'Rourke asserted.
