## Marxist Views Budget, Neo-Capitalism 
### BILL EVERS 
Last Thursday economics
professor James O'Connor from
San Jose State College presented a
Marxian perspective on the budget
of the government, who uses it, and
to what ends. O'Connor drew a
relatively small audience of about
50 to Bishop Auditorium. This was
perhaps the result of sentiment
among his audience the previous
week that his lecturing on
neocapitalism was too vague.
Beginning his talk with a
somewhat historical approach,
O'Connor described the function
of the state's budget in feudal
times, in the classical liberal
nineteenth century, and in the
neo-capitalist twentieth century.

Under O'Connor's ideal feudal
model, the budget was the prince's
way of controlling the feudal
economy. But during the
nineteenth century, the English
parliament, for example, used the
power of the purse to control the
crown. State expenditures were
kept to a minimum. "Tax
exploitation" was disguised by
using indirect taxes and tariffs.
There was a distinction between
the private and state economies.
Professor O'Connor maintained
that neo-capitalism was, in a sense,
a return to feudal principles. The
budget is an instrument through
which the corporate oligarchy's
very own executive branch of the
government plans the economy, he
said.

"The synthesis of base and
superstructure," was the way in
which O'Connor described the
fusion of the private economy and
the state economy. Today,
economic efficiency criteria
inform government
decision-making; political criteria
inform private economic
decision-making.
It was O'Connor's contention
that the corporate oligarchy has
socialized many of its costs by
using the machinery of the state.
That is, the public pays in taxes for
the social overhead which keeps
the neo-capitalist economy
working. The colleges save the
corporations the costs of job
training. Costs of retraining are also
met through government
programs. Research and
development is financed by the
state. Considerable risk capital in
fields like aerospace and atomic
energy is provided for in the state's
budget.
In addition, O'Connor found
that the state is being used to
subsidize demand. For instance,
the highway system subsidizes
automobile production. Federal
programs that encourage the
construction of suburban housing,
through guaranteeing mortgages
and keeping iriterest rates down,
also subsidize the production of
the items which will go into the
houses. O'Connor emphasized that
"the state is definitely in the
business of making sure private
consumption is rising."
According to O'Connor, the
state is employed at every level of
capital accumulation abroad:
maintaining cheap labor havens
(like Puerto Rico), stabilizing
banking centres (like Lebanon),
ensuring the reign of the dollar as
international reserve currency,
building infrastructures
(transportation systems in
underdeveloped areas), promoting
exports, bankrolling militaries (as
in Iran), and negotiating tariff
agreements which because of their
reciprocal nature keep the status
quo.
O'Connor saw the neo-capitalist
state as facing two important
crises. One is that people are
spending, with state
encouragement, more out of their
disposable incomes while a high
level of taxation is required as state
budgetary programs continue to
rise as a percentage of the GNP.

The other is that people
dependent on the state—blacks,
hospital workers, social workers,
welfare clients—are organizing
against the state. As an example,
O'Connor cited the fact that the
majority of the members of his
union, the American Federation of
Teachers, had been on strike at
least one day in the last year. The
state is responding with
mechanisms of social control:
more welfare officialdom, more
poverty bureaucrats, more police.
O'Connor hoped that those
organized against the state would
form a united front and press for
qualitative and not quantitative
demands.
