# YAF Chapter At Local High School
## 
### LANG ATWOOD 
REDWOOD ClTYâ€”Politically
conservative students at Sequoia
High School in Redwood City have
formed a chapter of Young
Americans for Freedom (YAF).
The new chapter, led by
Gregory Shade, 16, has expressed
concern over the predominance of
liberal faculty members and has
asked for the hiring of more social
studies teachers with a conservative
viewpoint.
Stanford YAF chieftan Harvey
Hukari attended the Sequoia
group's second rally and expressed
his support for their goals. Shade
explained that his organization
hopes to combat a growing trend
toward "violence, hate, and
murder" by bringing "strong
pressure to bear against
disruption."
YAF's emergence at the high
school level comes at a time when
conservative groups across the
country are beginning to challenge
such left-wing groups as Students
for a Democratic Society (SDS) in
the political arena.
Responding to the proposal to
hire more conservative faculty
members, Robert Biggs, principal
of Sequoia, said, "If we had to hire
people on the basis of their
political background, then we are
way off the track."
The Sequoia students were
originally concerned over the
alleged lack of conservative books
in the library. They formed an
organization called Students for an
Equal Library (SEL) and asked
that a better balance be maintained
between liberal and conservative
authors.
George Dragan, vice-principal of
Sequoia, said that according to the
social studies department most of
the books asked for by SEL were
"already there, out-of-print or on
order."
Sequoia has no organized left,
although Tom Hayden, a national
SDS figure, spoke in the cafeteria
last Friday. Hukari comments that
it was not unusual to see the first
high school YAF chapter emerge at
Sequoia. "They had over a hundred
kids working for Rafferty last fall
and are one of the most

conservative high schools in this
whole area," he explained.
Biggs tended to confirm this,
saying, "We are in a conservative
community."
Shade said that if YAF proves
successful at Sequoia, where it now
has over 40 members, attempts will
be made to set up chapters in other
schools. Hukari, who is fighting a
battle with the liberals and the left
at Stanford, is backing these
efforts.
He has been speaking to many
groups and organizations,
including high schools, in recent
weeks explaining YAF's purpose
and goals.
In addition, Burl Hubbel, a
California YAF officer, has been
working in northern California to
organize YAF chapters in the
colleges and high schools. He
reportedly helped organize the
Sequoia High chapter.
School officials at Sequoia
don't seem very concerned, and are
not taking the proposals too
seriously at this time. What may be
viewed as a fad today, however,
may be the embryonic stage of a
new movement in the high schools
to counteract the recent call by
SDS leaders to export the college
revolution to the high schools.
