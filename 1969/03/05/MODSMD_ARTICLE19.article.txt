# Engineers Told:
## Self Help For Ghetto-Colony 
### CLAIRE DARLEY 
"When one looks at the black
community in the central city it is
possible to find all the social,
economic, political, and cultural
characteristics of a colony,"
explained Mr. Percy Moore,
executive director of the Oakland
Economic Development Council,
addressing an audience Wednesday
night of primarily engineering
students and faculty.
In his speech, "The Engineer's
Role in the Ghetto," sponsored by
the Stanford Branch of the
American Society for Civil
Engineers, Moore first suggested
ways in which the black urban
community can "begin to work out
for themselves their own
destinies."
"There's been a growing spirit
of nationalism in the black
community —the feeling that the
values of the majority community
really hold little hope for black
people. The black people have the

responsibility therefore to begin to
decide for themselves their own
value system.
"If one looks at the whole
system of control," said Moore,
"then it is possible to begin to
discuss a colonial administration.
The most obvious element of this
administration is the police
department."
"From the point of view of the
black community, the police force
represents a colonial occupation
army. They define the law and they
enforce it . . .Each policeman
defines what is right and what is
wrong based on his own personal
evaluations and feelings."
Other groups which Moore feels
control the black community from
the outside include the school
system, the welfare system, and
organized religion.
Liberate the Com in unity
"The OEDC," Moore explained,
"attempts to provide
neighborhood structures and to

form them in order to give the
kinds of things that participants in
those structures decide are of value
of them . . .so that things now
done in other parts of society can
be initiated in the colonial part.
This serves to liberate the
community from its traditional
role as being a receiver of services.
"The society begins to perceive
of itself in new terms—in more
human terms. Because, as they
make their own decisions, they
begin to understand the nature of
power-how it is organized and
manipulated. They begin to think
in terms of other ways in which to
exercise their power."
In the question-answer period
following the speech, three main
topics discussed were urban
freeways, urban housing, and
funding and job training programs.
The freeways, according to
Moore, make it possible for the
suburban population to come into
the city where they create wealth

and then alter expoliting the area,
allow them to leave and spend the
money outside the city. "It's
impossible to hold the money in
the city to become a tax base to
provide funds for the kinds of
services the city needs. We need a
way to distribute wealth to the
people who live in the city."
Engineers Express Concern
Several engineers expressed
concern about their relations to
blacks in housing projects they are
involved in. Moore feels that
"housing plans should not be
stufled down residents' throats."
But, he admitted that "many
urban blacks need to think of
housing as a system including
taxation and economics rather
than an individual thing like forty
acresand a mule."
"The community may not
understand that private home
ownership is not the best answer
for them . . .Dealing with big
pressures can't be done
individually . . .They must get
exposure to options. Owning a
piece of land in the city does not
insure security like owning a
farm . . .The community must
understand the whole system
before it makes decisions on what
is appropriate."
Use of funds given for
employment projects is another
responsibility that should be given
to the black community, feels
Moore. "Communities should have
access to funds within some
framewor'- and then be allowed to
use the money in ways which the
community accepts."
The job training provided by
private businesses is better than
institutionalized programs, Moore
believes. Unlike the institutional
training, the private employer is
committed to train men for
specific job openings.
