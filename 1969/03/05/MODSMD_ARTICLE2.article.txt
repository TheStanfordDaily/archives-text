# More Than Toothpaste
## Sponsors Widen Freshman Year 
### BARBARA HYLAND (Part two of a Series) 
When an upperclassman agrees to
become a sponsor in a freshman dorm, he
undertakes an undefined responsibility
that involves contact with the freshmen.
It is not enough to just sleep in close
proximity to them in a single room down
the hall or to see them in the bathroom
over toothpaste. Each sponsor must
decide what his activities as a sponsor are
and then reconcile his being a sponsor
with his other interests.
A Source of Advice
Fred Tileston in Branner felt that
since he was being paid he was "willing
and compelled to spend a lot of time
here." He said, "The time commitment is
very proportional to how good a sponsor
you'll be."
He thought that his own freshman
year had been wasted. "I could have done
something a little more constructive." He
viewed a sponsor as a person who
encourages the freshman to get involved.
To make it easier for the boys on his
corridor to get to know each other he has
given parties like a "Laugh In Party"
when they came to watch T.V. in his
room and eat.
Tileston said that a sponsor should
"be around to help" and in return the
freshman help him. He felt that he had
become more aware and sensitive to
other people by having the experience of
sponsoring for "you can't help but be
involved in their problems."
He spoke of the vitality of the
freshman and its effect on him. "Being a
sponsor is by far the best way I could
think of to spend senior year."
An Organizer
John Grube from Trancos, too, noted
the time commitment. "A sponsor
should spend a lot of time in the dorm
and make sponsoring his greatest
concern," he said. The result is valuable
for both the freshman and the sponsor.
"I've learned a lot about myself and
possibly how I've changed over these four
years."
For him a sponsor is an organizer.
Rather than trying to mold the freshmen,
he has tried to "help freshmen define
their own needs and show them how to
satisfy them."
One difficulty is trying to find a
balance between being a sponsor or just a
member of the house. In fighting apathy
Grube explained, "I never know when to
push or when to stop pushing."

Tyana Payne in Branner felt that she
was there "to keep my kids happy." With
so much emphasis on studying, she felt
that they need someone to "keep things
on a light side." Her corridor likes to have
parties, especially ice cream or popcorn
ones. "Studying isn't the only thing;
people are the most important thing in
their college careers," she remarked.
Next quarter she has invited a doctor
to come to talk about sex. She explained
that as a nursing major she has helped the
freshmen more with medical advising
than with academic problems.
Informal Seminars
Sara Wolfe also in Branner said that
she had tried to get people together in an
informal versatile seminar that has done
everything from kite making to spending
the weekend at Carmel and baking bread.
Although she had originally
envisioned it as more structured, she said

that it became looser, with different
people attending each week. "Whatever
comes out of it is worthwhile," she
believes.
Encouragement to Think Critically
Roger Boesche in Donner said that a
sponsor would be "dull if he didn't have a
lot of outside interests." He said
however, "I spend almost every
conceivable minute in the dorm. It's too
challenging to leave here."
To encourage the freshmen to think
critically and challenge their beliefs he
has tried a "monumental campaign to get
speakers." During fall quarter they had
one or two speakers each week. The
speakers came from various segments of
the political spectrum.
Boesche has tried to participate in the
freshmen's activities and concurrently to
introduce them to new interests. The first
