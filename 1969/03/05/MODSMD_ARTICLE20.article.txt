## Isadora 'Unsuccessful' 
### TODD McCARTHY 
When studying films from an
artistic-economic point of view
(that is, the relevance of artistic
merit to commercial success), the
conscientious observer can discern
three general catagories: good films
that succeed, good films that fail
and bad films that succeed (bad
films that fail are of little interest).
Within this framework, the case
of Isadora becomes intriguing, for
it was made with obvious artistic
intentions yet, in falling a bit short
of the mark in quality, created an
empty commerciai market for
itself and fits comfortably into
none of the above catagories.
In the past few years, several
low-budget productions with
little-known casts have become
gianthits, such aslllow-Up, Georgy
Girl, Bonnie and Clyde and even
The Graduate. These films were
intended for the art house circuit
but contained a great amount of
appeal for a select but ever-growing
portion of the film audience, the
young people.
The success of these films were
complete surprises to everyone
concerned with their production.
Seeing this trend, the producers
at Universal seemed to consciously
try to create such a film, intending
to release it as an art film while
fully expecting, due to public
demand, to release it more widely.
Well Isadora has been released,
has received luke-warm notices and
few people are attending. Thus,
there is nothing the company can
do with their movie.
If the four films listed above had
failed critically, all of them could
have been sold to the general public
on their sex and/or violence
themes. But with a $4 million
budget and a roster of elite actors,
Isadora is too "exclusive" to be
cheapened in such a manner.
Therefore, no audience.
The basic mistake, of course,
was the assumption by the
producers that the film would be
artistically worthy. They left no
room for error.
For its release in San Francisco

and other cities, the film's title has
been changed to The Loves of
Isadora, which is a belated
admission by Universal that it's got
a lemon on its hands.
I found Isadora much more
compelling as a case history than as
a movie. The film itself is long and
rather placid.
Furthermore, I could not detect
for one instance why the film was
made; Isadora (the woman; a
dancer around the turn of the
century for those not familiar) as
presented here was not particularly
interesting and her dancing style
was certainly unimpressive.
The actors were, surprisingly,
limited by the project. Vanessa
Redgrave performs a tour de force,
notoflsadora, but of herself.
As suggested by previous films,
she is a beautiful, versatile actress;
she deserves better than this or
Camelot. Jason Robards, as to be

expected, steals the scenes in which
he appears.
He portrays sewing machine
magnate Paris Singer and manages
to make the decadence of
monetary extravagance quite
attractive. James Fox, a superb,
consistant British actor (The
Servant, King Rat; the best thing in
Thoroughly Modern Millie) is
forceful as Isadora's first lover.
Ultimately, "the loves of
Isadora" failed to intrigue me, the
director (Karel Reisz of Morgan!)
failed to attract me visually and the
ideas presented in the picture were
quite unoriginal.
The film does not entertain,
stimulate or impress. Whatever the
shortcomings of commerical
cinema, the nature of the form
does require a film to fulfill at least
one of these requisites and Isadora,
despite its consciously intended
artistry, does not succeed in any of
these respects.

consistant British actor (The
Servant, King Rat; the best thing in
Thoroughly Modern Millie) is
forceful as Isadora's first lover.
Ultimately, "the loves of
Isadora" failed to intrigue me, the
director (Karel Reisz of Morgan!)
failed to attract me visually and the
ideas presented in the picture were
quite unoriginal.
The film does not entertain,
stimulate or impress. Whatever the
shortcomings of commerical
cinema, the nature of the form
does require a film to fulfill at least
one of these requisites and Isadora,
despite its consciously intended
artistry, does not succeed in any of
these respects.
When studying films from an
artistic-economic point of view
(that is, the relevance of artistic
merit to commercial success), the
conscientious observer can discern
three general catagories: good films
that succeed, good films that fail
and bad films that succeed (bad
films that fail are of little interest).
Within this framework, the case
of Isadora becomes intriguing, for
it was made with obvious artistic
intentions yet, in falling a bit short
of the mark in quality, created an
empty commerciai market for
itself and fits comfortably into
none of the above catagories.
In the past few years, several
low-budget productions with
little-known casts have become
gianthits, such aslllow-Up, Georgy
Girl, Bonnie and Clyde and even
The Graduate. These films were
intended for the art house circuit
but contained a great amount of
appeal for a select but ever-growing
portion of the film audience, the
young people.
The success of these films were
complete surprises to everyone
concerned with their production.
Seeing this trend, the producers
at Universal seemed to consciously
try to create such a film, intending
to release it as an art film while
fully expecting, due to public
demand, to release it more widely.
Well Isadora has been released,
has received luke-warm notices and
few people are attending. Thus,
there is nothing the company can
do with their movie.
If the four films listed above had
failed critically, all of them could
have been sold to the general public
on their sex and/or violence
themes. But with a $4 million
budget and a roster of elite actors,
Isadora is too "exclusive" to be
cheapened in such a manner.
Therefore, no audience.
The basic mistake, of course,
was the assumption by the
producers that the film would be
artistically worthy. They left no
room for error.
For its release in San Francisco

and other cities, the film's title has
been changed to The Loves of
Isadora, which is a belated
admission by Universal that it's got
a lemon on its hands.
I found Isadora much more
compelling as a case history than as
a movie. The film itself is long and
rather placid.
Furthermore, I could not detect
for one instance why the film was
made; Isadora (the woman; a
dancer around the turn of the
century for those not familiar) as
presented here was not particularly
interesting and her dancing style
was certainly unimpressive.
The actors were, surprisingly,
limited by the project. Vanessa
Redgrave performs a tour de force,
notoflsadora, but of herself.
As suggested by previous films,
she is a beautiful, versatile actress;
she deserves better than this or
Camelot. Jason Robards, as to be

expected, steals the scenes in which
he appears.
He portrays sewing machine
magnate Paris Singer and manages
to make the decadence of
monetary extravagance quite
attractive. James Fox, a superb,
consistant British actor (The
Servant, King Rat; the best thing in
Thoroughly Modern Millie) is
forceful as Isadora's first lover.
