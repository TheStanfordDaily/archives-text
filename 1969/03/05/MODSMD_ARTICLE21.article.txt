# New Conduct Rule
## 
### 
The Student Conduct
Legislative Council (SCLC)
tentatively has approved the first
part of a demonstration policy
which specifically defines illegal
acts during demonstrations and
rallies.
The policy is not yet official.
The Judicial Charter requires that
SCLC rules be made public
twenty-one days before the
Council votes on them. Members of
the University can then offer
suggestions concerning the rules.
After the Council votes for the
policy the first time, it must
approve it in the same form at a
later date or the process must begin
again.
The current demonstration
proposal is:
"It is the obligation of all
members of the University com

munity while on campus, or en
gaged in a University activity,
not to:
1. Cause a harmful or
substantially offensive physical
contact, or a substantial risk of
harmful contact with any person;
2. Destroy or damage the
property of any person or of the
University;
3. Substantially interfere with
the use by any person of any
necessary means of access to any
place to which such a person has a
legal right of access;
4. Substantially interfere with
the enjoyment of private
residential property; or
5. Prevent the effective
conduct of any activity by any
person or group which such person
or group may lawfully conduct.
Any intentional or reckless
breach of such obligations by any
person is a violation of the rules of
the SCLC, for which such person
may be subject to a disciplinary
hearing before the Stanford
Judicial Council and to a
disciplinary action prescribed by
the said Council.
