# Hoover Hits Counseling
## 
### 
Typical black counseling
programs produce "mental
drop-outs" according to Robert
Hoover, head of the College of San
Mateo's experimental "College
Readiness Program."
Hoover made this remark in a
speech to the School of Education
Issues Forum last Friday.
Hoover, a black, commented
that elementary, junior and high
school and junior college black
students are typically counseled
into vocational programs that do
not present a realistic view of that
vocation rather than being
counseled in college prepartory
programs.
This unrealistic counseling
results in a distorted picture of the
blacks involvement with his
community as well as that
community's relation to the larger
society.
Hoover commented that the
irrelevancy of this traditional
school program is resulting in
"mental drop-outs" and
disciplinary problems such as lack
of motivations.
