# Visitors From Down Under
## Ruggers Face Foreign Foe 
### DAVE NOLAND 
Sydney University has the best
college rugby team in Australia,
which is sort of like being the best
bullfighter in Spain or the
champion beer-drinker of
Germany. Better than that, it is
pretty hard to get.
Stanford will host the
Australians this afternoon at Harry
Maloney Field. KTVU (channel
38) will cover the game for
rebroadcast later this evening, so
fans will be able to watch the game
twice and maybe even see
themselves on the tube.
Stanford will be the fifth
opponent for Sydney in their
American tour. The Aussies rolled
up 125 points to win their first four

matches in Southern California,
and were tested only by UCLA
whom they defeated, 9-3.
The Bruins beat Stanford 11-3
two weeks ago, and are the
number-one ranked college team in
the United States.
Although Indian fans probably
won't have much to cheer about,
they will get a demonstration of
how the game can be played if
you've spent your life at it. The
Sydney team includes five
Australian International team
members, and every member of the
team is highly skilled in the subtle
techniques and strategies of the
game.
The Australian style of play is
wide open, with emphasis on speed

and passing. Stanford Coach Pete
Kmetovic expects the Sydney
backfield to use quick pass outs to
their very fast wingers.
Aussie rugby has evolved into
less of a kicking game than in other
countries. The Tribe has been
playing the Australian rule this
year which requires kicks to
bounce into touch when kicked
from between the 25-yard lines. If
it goes out on the fly, the line out
occurs at the place the ball was
kicked.
Despite this de-emphasis of
kicking, a couple of Aussies are
known for their 50-yard drop kicks
(with either foot, of course).
Kmetovic will make a couple of
lineup changes this week. Doug
Logan will start at fullback in place
of Mike Forster who hurt his knee
and won't be able to play against
his countrymen.
The game will be played under
Australian rules which prohibit
substitutions, except in case of
injury.


NO RCA L STAR-Stanford's Don
Griffin was named to the Northern
California Basketball Writers
Association All-Star Team, Monday.
Griff was a first team selection along
with Dennis Awtrey (Player of the
Year), and Bud Ogdcn of Santa Clara,
Jackie Ridglc of Cal, and Pete Cross of
USF. The 64 senior guard from
Oakland is second in the Pac-8 in
scoring, and needs 33 points in the finale
against Cal on Friday to set a new
single-season school scoring record. Mai
McElwain was an honorable mention
choice.

their very fast wingers.
Aussie rugby has evolved into
less of a kicking game than in other
countries. The Tribe has been
playing the Australian rule this
year which requires kicks to
bounce into touch when kicked
from between the 25-yard lines. If
it goes out on the fly, the line out
occurs at the place the ball was
kicked.
Despite this de-emphasis of
kicking, a couple of Aussies are
known for their 50-yard drop kicks
(with either foot, of course).
Kmetovic will make a couple of
lineup changes this week. Doug
Logan will start at fullback in place
of Mike Forster who hurt his knee
and won't be able to play against
his countrymen.
The game will be played under
Australian rules which prohibit
substitutions, except in case of
injury.


NO RCA L STAR-Stanford's Don
Griffin was named to the Northern
California Basketball Writers
Association All-Star Team, Monday.
Griff was a first team selection along
with Dennis Awtrey (Player of the
Year), and Bud Ogdcn of Santa Clara,
Jackie Ridglc of Cal, and Pete Cross of
USF. The 64 senior guard from
Oakland is second in the Pac-8 in
scoring, and needs 33 points in the finale
against Cal on Friday to set a new
single-season school scoring record. Mai
McElwain was an honorable mention
choice.
Sydney University has the best
college rugby team in Australia,
which is sort of like being the best
bullfighter in Spain or the
champion beer-drinker of
Germany. Better than that, it is
pretty hard to get.
Stanford will host the
Australians this afternoon at Harry
Maloney Field. KTVU (channel
38) will cover the game for
rebroadcast later this evening, so
fans will be able to watch the game
twice and maybe even see
themselves on the tube.
Stanford will be the fifth
opponent for Sydney in their
American tour. The Aussies rolled
up 125 points to win their first four

matches in Southern California,
and were tested only by UCLA
whom they defeated, 9-3.
The Bruins beat Stanford 11-3
two weeks ago, and are the
number-one ranked college team in
the United States.
Although Indian fans probably
won't have much to cheer about,
they will get a demonstration of
how the game can be played if
you've spent your life at it. The
Sydney team includes five
Australian International team
members, and every member of the
team is highly skilled in the subtle
techniques and strategies of the
game.
The Australian style of play is
wide open, with emphasis on speed

and passing. Stanford Coach Pete
Kmetovic expects the Sydney
backfield to use quick pass outs to
their very fast wingers.
