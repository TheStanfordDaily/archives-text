# Tribe Tracksters Comeback Time?
## 
### 
Coach Payton Jordan, not resting on the achievements of the 1968
United States Olympic track and field team, is busy at work these days
on Angell Field building one of the most exciting Indian track
aggregations in recent years. The weather of the past several weeks has
kept Coach Jordan from bringing the team along as quickly as he would
like, especially so with the triangular meet featuring Fresno State and
Occidental coming up in Stanford Stadium on Saturday.
Bolstered by the return of three leading point winners from the 1968
squad and an outstanding array of sophomores, Coach Jordan may have
the material to fashion a strong Stanford track and field team in 1969.
Last year's edition of the Indian track contingent sank to an
unsensational 2-8 mark in dual meets and a disappointing last-place
finish in the Pacific-8, but the performance of three individuals enabled
the Tribe to snatch a tie for 10th place in the NCAA finals. High jumper
Peter Boyce (1969 track captain) soared 7-0 to take a third, and Tom
Colby followed suit with a 245'-7" heave in the javelin. Distance man
Greg Brock was the other Stanford standout, finishing fifth in the
grueling 10,000 meter run in 30:05.6.
The reason for optimism in the Tribe camp this spring is that all three
NCAA point-winners return in 1969. Boyce has cleared 7-3 (last year
against Fresno State), and competed for his native Australia in the '68
Olympics. Brock, a standout on Stanford's second-place NCAA cross
country team, holds school records in the 2-mile (8:49.8) and 3-mile
(13:37.2). Colby bettered the old school standard by 17 feet last year
when he hurled the javelin 258'-4".
A number of key performers were lost to graduation in
June—including ace 440 man Jim Ward, long jumper Craig Vaughan,
triple jumper lan Arnold, miler Jim Letterer, and sprinters Andy Sears
and Roger Cox. But the fantastic 1968 freshman team, which
overwhelmed ten straight opponents en route to an undefeated season,
should more than make up for the losses.
Leading the way will be hurdlers Randy White and Rick Tipton.
White clocked a blazing 52.2 in the 440 Intermediate Hurdles last spring
to set a new school record. Tipton, who has run the century in 9.8, went
14.3 in the 120 highs last year to establish himself as potentially the
finest high hurdler ever to attend Stanford.
Jim Kauffman, one of the greatest all-around athletes (football,
track, rugby) ever to attend Stanford, will be a big asset to the Indian
varsity thisspring. Kauffmann,co-MVP on the frosh with White last year,
was easily the team's leading point-winner, competing in the 100, 440,
high jump, long jump, triple jump, and 440 relay. This season he'll
concentrate on the 440 and long jump.
Two sprinters and a pair of distance men will also move up from the
'68 frosh squad to give a boost to varsity hopes. Chuck Francis (9.5 in
the 100 and 21.3 in the 220) and Kevin McNair (9.7, 21.8) are two of the
finest sprinters Stanford has had in years. Pete Fairchild has gone 1:52.2
in the 880, while Duncan Macdonald has a 4:10.3 mile and a 1:52.5 880.
A handful of other key performers will be back from the '68 varsity
assemblage—including high jumper-triple jumper Tom Massey (6-8,
50-6), miler Allen Sanford (4:07.5), 2-milers Brook Thomas (9:05.0)
and Chuck Menz (9:05.5), and EM hurdler Tom Kommers(s3 flat).

unsensational 2-8 mark in dual meets and a disappointing last-place
finish in the Pacific-8, but the performance of three individuals enabled
the Tribe to snatch a tie for 10th place in the NCAA finals. High jumper
Peter Boyce (1969 track captain) soared 7-0 to take a third, and Tom
Colby followed suit with a 245'-7" heave in the javelin. Distance man
Greg Brock was the other Stanford standout, finishing fifth in the
grueling 10,000 meter run in 30:05.6.
The reason for optimism in the Tribe camp this spring is that all three
NCAA point-winners return in 1969. Boyce has cleared 7-3 (last year
against Fresno State), and competed for his native Australia in the '68
Olympics. Brock, a standout on Stanford's second-place NCAA cross
country team, holds school records in the 2-mile (8:49.8) and 3-mile
(13:37.2). Colby bettered the old school standard by 17 feet last year
when he hurled the javelin 258'-4".
A number of key performers were lost to graduation in
June—including ace 440 man Jim Ward, long jumper Craig Vaughan,
triple jumper lan Arnold, miler Jim Letterer, and sprinters Andy Sears
and Roger Cox. But the fantastic 1968 freshman team, which
overwhelmed ten straight opponents en route to an undefeated season,
should more than make up for the losses.
Leading the way will be hurdlers Randy White and Rick Tipton.
White clocked a blazing 52.2 in the 440 Intermediate Hurdles last spring
to set a new school record. Tipton, who has run the century in 9.8, went
14.3 in the 120 highs last year to establish himself as potentially the
finest high hurdler ever to attend Stanford.
Jim Kauffman, one of the greatest all-around athletes (football,
track, rugby) ever to attend Stanford, will be a big asset to the Indian
varsity thisspring. Kauffmann,co-MVP on the frosh with White last year,
was easily the team's leading point-winner, competing in the 100, 440,
high jump, long jump, triple jump, and 440 relay. This season he'll
concentrate on the 440 and long jump.
Two sprinters and a pair of distance men will also move up from the
'68 frosh squad to give a boost to varsity hopes. Chuck Francis (9.5 in
the 100 and 21.3 in the 220) and Kevin McNair (9.7, 21.8) are two of the
finest sprinters Stanford has had in years. Pete Fairchild has gone 1:52.2
in the 880, while Duncan Macdonald has a 4:10.3 mile and a 1:52.5 880.
A handful of other key performers will be back from the '68 varsity
assemblage—including high jumper-triple jumper Tom Massey (6-8,
50-6), miler Allen Sanford (4:07.5), 2-milers Brook Thomas (9:05.0)
and Chuck Menz (9:05.5), and EM hurdler Tom Kommers(s3 flat).
Coach Payton Jordan, not resting on the achievements of the 1968
United States Olympic track and field team, is busy at work these days
on Angell Field building one of the most exciting Indian track
aggregations in recent years. The weather of the past several weeks has
kept Coach Jordan from bringing the team along as quickly as he would
like, especially so with the triangular meet featuring Fresno State and
Occidental coming up in Stanford Stadium on Saturday.
Bolstered by the return of three leading point winners from the 1968
squad and an outstanding array of sophomores, Coach Jordan may have
the material to fashion a strong Stanford track and field team in 1969.
