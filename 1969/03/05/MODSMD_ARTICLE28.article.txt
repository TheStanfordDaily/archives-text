# Documentary Germ War's Extent
## 
### 
Dangerously near a city
reservoir, a herd of Utah sheep
were killed by a badly aimed gas
bombardment. A remote island off
Scotland was sprayed by the
British 28 years ago to test a nerve
gas; people will not walk safely on
that island for another 100 years.
These and related events are
some of the awesome beginnings of
American and Allied research into
chemical and biological warfare
documented in an NBC News
videotape circulated around
campus over the past week. The
film is related to the recent March
4th Convocation on Science and
Society.
The United States spent $70
million for combat gases in Word
War I. Since then military sources

have put a secrecy clamp on all
"CBW" research more stringent
than that involving hydrogen
bombs. However, the Utah sheep
incident was one of a series of
informational leaks which give the
public a notion of the immense
quantity of germ warfare that goes
on today.
The Army emphasizes that any
CBW work is done strictly for
defensive purposes. However,
differentchemical non-lethal gases,
including tear gas, are being
employed in Vietnam now.
American military does not yet
have a delivery system immediately
available for its gas stocks, but as
defensive precautions against what
Russia and Red China might have,
the work goes on.
