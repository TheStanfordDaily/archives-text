# 600 Hold Vigil In San Francisco To Protest Presidio Mutiny Trials
## 
### CRAIG WILSON MARSHALL SCHWARTZ 
SAN FRANCISCO—The Civic Center
Plaza was the scene of an all-night vigil
last night as a group of about 600
protested the mutiny charges the Army
has brought against 27 Gls at the San
Francisco Presidio.
The vigil followed a march which
began last week in Carmei at the Institute
for the Study of Nonviolence.
A group of nearly 300 marchers, at
least half of them Stanford students,
concluded the walk by winding their way
through the streets of the city earlier in
the evening. The group was made up
almost exclusively of students.
They began last night's candlelight
march at 7:30, when they left Our Lady
of Perpetual Help Church in Daly City.
The group arrived at the Civic Center
about three hours later, and were greeted
by 300 waiting supporters.
Marin and Berkeley Groups
Shortly before the main group
appeared about 25 marchers from Marin
County arrived. Another contingent of
supporting marchers, about 100 students
from Berkeley, got to the Civic Center at
11:15 p.m.

Other schools represented in the
Carmel march were UC Santa Cruz and
numerous high schools.
Plans were to march to the Presidio
this morning to conclude the protest.
Courts-martial for the 27 men are still
continuing, and are open to the public.
The evening's original group of
marchers numbered about 150, but it
nearly doubled as growing numbers
joined the ranks of the walk as it
progressed towards the Civic Center.
Teachers Join March
As the group approached its
destination, the marchers encountered a
group of secondary school teachers here
for a convention who had just left a
meeting. Several of the protestors spoke
to the teachers, urging them to join the
march. About 50 of the 200 there did so.
San Francisco police escorted the
marchers in squad cars, blocking side
streets along the path of the march to
allow the group to pass.
Throughout the evening, protestors
distributed leaflets to people they passed
urging them to support the "mutineers"
and to join the march.
As they walked, the group sang such
songs as "We Shall Overcome." Some

observers in buildings and passing cars
gave the"V" sign as the marchers passed.
Lights Fill Plaza
People began to assemble in the Plaza
as early as 7:30. From a distance, the area
appeared to be a mass of flickering lights,
as most of the group carried candles.
Insence was burned, and coffee and food
was distributed among the group.
Included in the protestors at the Plaza
was a busload of Stanford students who
left campus earlier in the evening.
Stanford participation was organized
by the Committee for a New Democratic
Politics (the outgrowth of the former
McCarthy forces), led by David Jones,
and the Resistance. A rally in support of
the march was held in White Plaza
Monday. Among the speakers were Dean
of the Chapel B. Davie Napier, Joan Baez
Harris, and Resistance member Paul
Rupert.
Spurred By Convictions
The march was spurred by the
convictions of the first three of the 27
Gls to be tried, with accompanying
sentences totalling 45 years at hard labor.
The incident for which the soldiers are
being tried took place last October 14.
During the morning roll call, 27 of the
prisoners in the Presidio stockade broke
ranks and sat down in the middle of the
stockade yard.
They began chanting, and demanded
to see the officer in charge of the
stockade in order to present him with a
list of grievances concerning the stockade
facilities and treatment of prisoners.
They were later carried away by MPs.
The courts-martial of some of the
group have been moved to an Army base
in the Mojave Desert, because of security
problems at the Presidio.

CANDLELIGHT PROCESSION —Marchers on their way to the San Francisco Civic Center for an
all-night vigil in support of the 27 Presidio Gls charged with mutiny walk down Mission Street last
night.
SAN FRANCISCO—The Civic Center
Plaza was the scene of an all-night vigil
last night as a group of about 600
protested the mutiny charges the Army
has brought against 27 Gls at the San
Francisco Presidio.
The vigil followed a march which
began last week in Carmei at the Institute
for the Study of Nonviolence.
A group of nearly 300 marchers, at
least half of them Stanford students,
concluded the walk by winding their way
through the streets of the city earlier in
the evening. The group was made up
almost exclusively of students.
They began last night's candlelight
march at 7:30, when they left Our Lady
of Perpetual Help Church in Daly City.
The group arrived at the Civic Center
about three hours later, and were greeted
by 300 waiting supporters.
Marin and Berkeley Groups
Shortly before the main group
appeared about 25 marchers from Marin
County arrived. Another contingent of
supporting marchers, about 100 students
from Berkeley, got to the Civic Center at
11:15 p.m.

Other schools represented in the
Carmel march were UC Santa Cruz and
numerous high schools.
Plans were to march to the Presidio
this morning to conclude the protest.
Courts-martial for the 27 men are still
continuing, and are open to the public.
The evening's original group of
marchers numbered about 150, but it
nearly doubled as growing numbers
joined the ranks of the walk as it
progressed towards the Civic Center.
Teachers Join March
As the group approached its
destination, the marchers encountered a
group of secondary school teachers here
for a convention who had just left a
meeting. Several of the protestors spoke
to the teachers, urging them to join the
march. About 50 of the 200 there did so.
San Francisco police escorted the
marchers in squad cars, blocking side
streets along the path of the march to
allow the group to pass.
Throughout the evening, protestors
distributed leaflets to people they passed
urging them to support the "mutineers"
and to join the march.
As they walked, the group sang such
songs as "We Shall Overcome." Some

observers in buildings and passing cars
gave the"V" sign as the marchers passed.
Lights Fill Plaza
People began to assemble in the Plaza
as early as 7:30. From a distance, the area
appeared to be a mass of flickering lights,
as most of the group carried candles.
Insence was burned, and coffee and food
was distributed among the group.
Included in the protestors at the Plaza
was a busload of Stanford students who
left campus earlier in the evening.
Stanford participation was organized
by the Committee for a New Democratic
Politics (the outgrowth of the former
McCarthy forces), led by David Jones,
and the Resistance. A rally in support of
the march was held in White Plaza
Monday. Among the speakers were Dean
of the Chapel B. Davie Napier, Joan Baez
Harris, and Resistance member Paul
Rupert.
Spurred By Convictions
The march was spurred by the
convictions of the first three of the 27
Gls to be tried, with accompanying
sentences totalling 45 years at hard labor.
The incident for which the soldiers are
being tried took place last October 14.
During the morning roll call, 27 of the
prisoners in the Presidio stockade broke
ranks and sat down in the middle of the
stockade yard.
They began chanting, and demanded
to see the officer in charge of the
stockade in order to present him with a
list of grievances concerning the stockade
facilities and treatment of prisoners.
They were later carried away by MPs.
The courts-martial of some of the
group have been moved to an Army base
in the Mojave Desert, because of security
problems at the Presidio.
