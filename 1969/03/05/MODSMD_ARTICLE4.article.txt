# 'SJC Faces Tough Judicial Tasks'
## 
### SUSAN SWARD 
The shelves of law books behind the
desk may look ominous, but Jack
Friedenthal's face beams good humor
when he smiles.
When he is listening to someone else
speak, his face takes on an intense set,
and the responses that come out of his
mouth are precise and to the point.
The chairman of the Stanford Judicial
Council is willing to talk about anything
that doesn t relate directly or indirectly
to the recent SJC hearings on the
SDS-Trustee confrontation in early
February.
"I think you can understand why I
can't give my opinions on SRI, the
Trustees and so on," said Friedenthal, a
law professor who joined the Stanford
law faculty in 1958 after graduating from
Harvard Law School.
Stanford Undergraduate
The law professor, who was an
undergraduate at Stanford, initially
became interested in law at the end of his
junior year. He was planning to go to
Harvard or Stanford Law School after his
senior year here, but the Army drafted
him for a two year stretch.
Friedenthal became temporary
Chairman of the SJC last October when
the regular members of the Council
selected him for that position. When a
student election extended the Legislative

Charter and the SJC through March 1, the
Council asked Friedenthal to stay on as
chairman until that date, and he
accepted.
The student election of February 18
and 19 approved the Charter with certain
changes in the method of selection of
faculty members of the Council. In the
past the President had a voice in the
selection, but under the ruling finalized
by the student election, the Academic
Senate will now choose the SJC's faculty
membership.
According to Friedenthal, the SJC
formulated by the new selection methods
will have to vote again for a chairman.
There are four students, four faculty and
a chairman from the law school faculty
on the Council.
"The chairman only votes in case a tie
occurs, "Friedenthal explained, "and
there's never been a tie yet. If it's felt that
a student should be chairman of the SJC,
I see no reason why not. The Council
rarely splits on faculty-student lines
when a question comes to a vote.
The SJC Chairman outlined the kinds
of cases that come up before the Council.
"Honor code violations like copying or
cheating, property destruction through
pranks, stealing from the bookstore and,
of course, the demonstration case we're
working on now," Friedenthal
concluded.

Friedenthal, who grew up in Denver,
Colorado, feels that because he has been
around Stanford off and on since 1949,
he can sense "the dramatic change that
has been taking place within the
institution. I feel Stanford has made great
strides since I first arrived on the scene,
and it's important to be part of that
process. Changes have to be made in a
meaningful fashion to continue the
integrity of the institution."
He feels very strongly that a body like
the SJC has a very important function
within the university.
"The Council can be much more
sensitive to the people within the
university community. A detached court,
on the other hand, may be less sensitive
to a particular situation within the
community."
Friedenthal illustrated his opinion.
Students on the Council, he
hypothesized, might be able to
understand why a student stole some
object in the bookstore, whereas a judge
might look on the case as one of hndreds
dealing with theft.
Private Or Public
The professor emphasized, however,
that the case for a private handling of
offenses occurring within the university
is by no means closed in many people's
minds. There is a segment of the
community that feels criminal actsought

to be referred to the county district
attorney.
If there were no body like the SJC on
campus, Friedenthal feels "unfairness
may develop. So you want a formalized
process which can't be handled by
anybody else. This tribunal can
determine the truth of charges in an
orderly way. The notion of the SJC is
based upon the recognition that there are
certain types of activities that can only be
dealt with in a university context."
Friedenthal leaned back in his chair
and continued, "The major problems
with the SJC are two. It takes an
inordinate amount of time to do the job
correctly, and it is difficult to find people
who are willing to give the time. This
particular Council is a great group of
individuals in terms of their integrity and
balance.
"This job, in one sense, has been
tremendously enjoyable because of the
eight people I've worked with on the
Council," Friedenthal said.
Friedenthal currently teaches two
courses in the law school —Civil
Procedure, a basic first year course, and a
seminar in the Legal Problems of the
Poor. His wife is also a lawyer who got her
degree from Stanford Law School in
1960 and is presently managing a
household containing three young
children.

process. Changes have to be made in a
meaningful fashion to continue the
integrity of the institution."
He feels very strongly that a body like
the SJC has a very important function
within the university.
"The Council can be much more
sensitive to the people within the
university community. A detached court,
on the other hand, may be less sensitive
to a particular situation within the
community."
Friedenthal illustrated his opinion.
Students on the Council, he
hypothesized, might be able to
understand why a student stole some
object in the bookstore, whereas a judge
might look on the case as one of hndreds
dealing with theft.
Private Or Public
The professor emphasized, however,
that the case for a private handling of
offenses occurring within the university
is by no means closed in many people's
minds. There is a segment of the
community that feels criminal actsought

to be referred to the county district
attorney.
If there were no body like the SJC on
campus, Friedenthal feels "unfairness
may develop. So you want a formalized
process which can't be handled by
anybody else. This tribunal can
determine the truth of charges in an
orderly way. The notion of the SJC is
based upon the recognition that there are
certain types of activities that can only be
dealt with in a university context."
Friedenthal leaned back in his chair
and continued, "The major problems
with the SJC are two. It takes an
inordinate amount of time to do the job
correctly, and it is difficult to find people
who are willing to give the time. This
particular Council is a great group of
individuals in terms of their integrity and
balance.
"This job, in one sense, has been
tremendously enjoyable because of the
eight people I've worked with on the
Council," Friedenthal said.
Friedenthal currently teaches two
courses in the law school —Civil
Procedure, a basic first year course, and a
seminar in the Legal Problems of the
Poor. His wife is also a lawyer who got her
degree from Stanford Law School in
1960 and is presently managing a
household containing three young
children.
The shelves of law books behind the
desk may look ominous, but Jack
Friedenthal's face beams good humor
when he smiles.
When he is listening to someone else
speak, his face takes on an intense set,
and the responses that come out of his
mouth are precise and to the point.
The chairman of the Stanford Judicial
Council is willing to talk about anything
that doesn t relate directly or indirectly
to the recent SJC hearings on the
SDS-Trustee confrontation in early
February.
"I think you can understand why I
can't give my opinions on SRI, the
Trustees and so on," said Friedenthal, a
law professor who joined the Stanford
law faculty in 1958 after graduating from
Harvard Law School.
Stanford Undergraduate
The law professor, who was an
undergraduate at Stanford, initially
became interested in law at the end of his
junior year. He was planning to go to
Harvard or Stanford Law School after his
senior year here, but the Army drafted
him for a two year stretch.
Friedenthal became temporary
Chairman of the SJC last October when
the regular members of the Council
selected him for that position. When a
student election extended the Legislative

Charter and the SJC through March 1, the
Council asked Friedenthal to stay on as
chairman until that date, and he
accepted.
The student election of February 18
and 19 approved the Charter with certain
changes in the method of selection of
faculty members of the Council. In the
past the President had a voice in the
selection, but under the ruling finalized
by the student election, the Academic
Senate will now choose the SJC's faculty
membership.
According to Friedenthal, the SJC
formulated by the new selection methods
will have to vote again for a chairman.
There are four students, four faculty and
a chairman from the law school faculty
on the Council.
"The chairman only votes in case a tie
occurs, "Friedenthal explained, "and
there's never been a tie yet. If it's felt that
a student should be chairman of the SJC,
I see no reason why not. The Council
rarely splits on faculty-student lines
when a question comes to a vote.
The SJC Chairman outlined the kinds
of cases that come up before the Council.
"Honor code violations like copying or
cheating, property destruction through
pranks, stealing from the bookstore and,
of course, the demonstration case we're
working on now," Friedenthal
concluded.

Friedenthal, who grew up in Denver,
Colorado, feels that because he has been
around Stanford off and on since 1949,
he can sense "the dramatic change that
has been taking place within the
institution. I feel Stanford has made great
strides since I first arrived on the scene,
and it's important to be part of that
process. Changes have to be made in a
meaningful fashion to continue the
integrity of the institution."

law faculty in 1958 after graduating from
Harvard Law School.
Stanford Undergraduate
The law professor, who was an
undergraduate at Stanford, initially
became interested in law at the end of his
junior year. He was planning to go to
Harvard or Stanford Law School after his
senior year here, but the Army drafted
him for a two year stretch.
Friedenthal became temporary
Chairman of the SJC last October when
the regular members of the Council
selected him for that position. When a
student election extended the Legislative

Charter and the SJC through March 1, the
Council asked Friedenthal to stay on as
chairman until that date, and he
accepted.
The student election of February 18
and 19 approved the Charter with certain
changes in the method of selection of
faculty members of the Council. In the
past the President had a voice in the
selection, but under the ruling finalized
by the student election, the Academic
Senate will now choose the SJC's faculty
membership.
According to Friedenthal, the SJC
formulated by the new selection methods
will have to vote again for a chairman.
There are four students, four faculty and
a chairman from the law school faculty
on the Council.
"The chairman only votes in case a tie
occurs, "Friedenthal explained, "and
there's never been a tie yet. If it's felt that
a student should be chairman of the SJC,
I see no reason why not. The Council
rarely splits on faculty-student lines
when a question comes to a vote.
The SJC Chairman outlined the kinds
of cases that come up before the Council.
"Honor code violations like copying or
cheating, property destruction through
pranks, stealing from the bookstore and,
of course, the demonstration case we're
working on now," Friedenthal
concluded.

Friedenthal, who grew up in Denver,
Colorado, feels that because he has been
around Stanford off and on since 1949,
he can sense "the dramatic change that
has been taking place within the
institution. I feel Stanford has made great
strides since I first arrived on the scene,
and it's important to be part of that
process. Changes have to be made in a
meaningful fashion to continue the
integrity of the institution."
He feels very strongly that a body like
the SJC has a very important function
within the university.
"The Council can be much more
sensitive to the people within the
university community. A detached court,
on the other hand, may be less sensitive
to a particular situation within the
community."
Friedenthal illustrated his opinion.
Students on the Council, he
hypothesized, might be able to
understand why a student stole some
object in the bookstore, whereas a judge
might look on the case as one of hndreds
dealing with theft.
Private Or Public
The professor emphasized, however,
that the case for a private handling of
offenses occurring within the university
is by no means closed in many people's
minds. There is a segment of the
community that feels criminal actsought

to be referred to the county district
attorney.
If there were no body like the SJC on
campus, Friedenthal feels "unfairness
may develop. So you want a formalized
process which can't be handled by
anybody else. This tribunal can
determine the truth of charges in an
orderly way. The notion of the SJC is
based upon the recognition that there are
certain types of activities that can only be
dealt with in a university context."
Friedenthal leaned back in his chair
and continued, "The major problems
with the SJC are two. It takes an
inordinate amount of time to do the job
correctly, and it is difficult to find people
who are willing to give the time. This
particular Council is a great group of
individuals in terms of their integrity and
balance.
"This job, in one sense, has been
tremendously enjoyable because of the
eight people I've worked with on the
Council," Friedenthal said.
Friedenthal currently teaches two
courses in the law school —Civil
Procedure, a basic first year course, and a
seminar in the Legal Problems of the
Poor. His wife is also a lawyer who got her
degree from Stanford Law School in
1960 and is presently managing a
household containing three young
children.
