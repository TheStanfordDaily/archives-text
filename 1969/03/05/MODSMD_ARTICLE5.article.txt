# Scientists Praise Government Ties
## 
### 
Four nationally prominent Stanford
scientists defended the links between the
University and government in scientific
research and development at yesterday
afternoon's opening round of speeches in
the March 4th Convocation: Science and
Society.
Nobel laureate geneticist Joshua
Lederberg, Academic Senate chairman
and physicist Leonard Schiff, SLAC
professor and President's Scientific
Advisory Committee member Sidney
Drell and electrical engineering professor
and department chairman John Linvill all
echoed the theme that the positive social
benefits to be garnered from the
government-university ties far outweigh
the possible dangers.
The speakers stressed to the 1200
people gathered in Memorial Church that
many of the technological breakthroughs
of recent years were produced through
the government-university cooperation
often criticized today.
The afternoon speakers were
introduced by biology graduate student
Paul Grobstein who expressed his
concern that "the directions that science
and technology are taking are not well
considered, that science and technology
are having effects on society in ways that
are not intended."
Grobstein also indicated a concern
that "we cannot affect the direction that
society is moving. We are frustrated for a
way of action."
Lederberg's Specch
Following Grobstein's keynote
speech, Joshua Lederberg departed from
his prepared text to discuss some of the
problems and prospects of science in
today's world.
Lederberg singled out "nationalism"
as the "root problem" of science today.
"Nationalism, whether it be to the stars
and stripes or based on the color of a
man's skin, is inviable in the present
world. Its disadvantages loom too large
for us to ignore."
The Nobel Laureate said that "social
institutions" rather than science are
responsible for the majority of the
world's problems. He was not completely
enthusiastic about the purity of science
however.
"I am not an optimist about good
things coming from science, per se," he
said, adding that "science is one of the
most effective means of non-national
communication."
Biological Policy
Touching on matters closer to his
speciality, biochemistry, Lederberg said
without advocating it, "We need to think

about setting up a national biological
policy." He told the Memorial Church
gathering that "we already have a de
facto biological policy."
"One question is whether life is the
system-value to be optimized," he said.
"We haven't determined what alternative
values might be stressed."
He covered some of the recent
developments in molecular biology
saying that the time was quite near when
man will be able to augment human
genetic deficiencies "through molecular
biology." He asserted that this
development would not be as great a
change as one might think because ever
since vaccinations were developed
molecular blueprints have been changed
by man.
Social Questions
Lederberg took notice of the social
questions raised by such developments
saying that as our knowledge advanced it
"becomes more and more difficult" for
man to make decisions without
considering the rest of society.
He cited the detection of malformed
fetuses as an example. Science will soon
be able to detect such tragedies, and there
will be raised "the problems of
compulsion (compulsive abortions) in
such cases."
At the same time Lederberg insisted
that he should be allowed to continue
work on human genetic characteristics,
even to the point of a few test cases.
"There is some merit in studying
vegetative propagation in man," he said.
Schiff's Speech
Academic Senate chairman Leonard
Schiff followed Lederberg with a defense
of scientists accepting money from
mission-oriented agencies for
defense work. He also emphasized
that basic science is much more
knowledge-oriented rather than
mission-oriented.
"To use present or potential
applicability as a criterion for
support of basic science would be
to rob it of its unique contribution
to human life."
Replying to critics who would
have scientists refuse research
funds from military or similarly
mission-oriented agencies, Prof.
Schiff expressed approval of
diversified support, including the
military, and fear of consolidation
of support into one government
agency.
Valuable To Society
"Basic scientific research is
valuable to society and should
draw support from all sources that
supply untrammeled sustenance,"
he said. "The most important word
here, especially for the university
scientist, is 'untrammeled.' The
working scientist is the only person
who can get support for his
research; not his department
chairman, nor his dean, nor his
president, and most particularly
not his board of trustees.
"The thought that any
military-industrial connections of
trustees can affect the support of
university research by the
government is so far removed from
reality that it would be laughable if
it were not taken seriously by some
elements of the university
community."
The fourth speaker was SLAC
physicist Sidney Drell whose
theme was a quotation of Albert
Einstein, "Politics is much harder
than physics." He said that the
scientist has a definite contribution
to make to decisions on nuclear
arms agreements, but that the most
difficult part of the decision is
political.
Deterrence Now Policy
He also said that "defense and
security are now a thing of the
past" in an age when missiles can
travel 6000 miles in half an hour.
He said deterrence is now the basis
for United States strategic policy.
With this as a background Drell
proceeded to outline the technical
aspects and tradeoffs in the
proposed antiballistic missile
system. He drew no conclusion as
to the advisability of the proposed
system, however.
Instead he said, "I find that
correct, sound technical inputs
make it more difficult and not
easier to come to a decision.
"Scientists in government can
by their work protect against
technological surprises or the

unexpected; they can help improve
what we know about the enemy
and his technology and thus guard
against over or under-exaggerations
of his technical capabilities, the
better to define plausible enemy
threats. They cannot tell you so
easily what ought to be doneâ€”of
course we all have our opinions."
Linvill's Comments
The final speaker was electrical
engineering professor John Linvill
who briefly discussed some of the
work going on in his department in
developing reading aids for blind
people, medical research
instruments and communication
satellites for blind people.
He pointed out that the work on
reading aids was originally
supported by funds from the
Office of Naval Research, an
unlikely source at first glance.
In an afternoon panel session
Professor Merrill Snyder,
University of Maryland
microbiologist discussed the uses
for bio-chemical warfare as either
"welfare or warfare." By learning
more about the pathological causes
of some of the diseases caused by
biological warfare, scientists
through their research could
"lessen its effectiveness and find
potential limitations and principles
against its use."
Professor Leonard Hertzenberg,
professor of genetics at Stanford
stated that scientists over a period
of years have not gotten involved
with the results of their research in
order to see how the
chemical-biological research is
being applied to warfare. He
explained that twice as much
federal money is being spent for
biological research in defense
measures than is being spent to find
the causes of allegenic and
infectious diseases.
Dr. Sumner Kalman, professor
of pharmacology at Stanford Med
School, described mace as being
"similar to a squirt can of
insecticide, that squirts a screen of
an irritating chemical substance in
a solvent." On contact, the
chemical produces deleterious
effects to the central and nervous
system of the victim's body.
Dr. Kalman objected to the lack
of studies done on a chemical that
was so abundantly used on the
population. "The public assumes it
is chemically safe if it passes all
requirements of the Federal Food
and Drug Administration."
Professor Jerry Marr, chairman
of the Bacteriology Department at
UC-Davis, described what
biological warfare might be like.
You infect small numbers of
people, he explained, and it may

not be the end of the population,
but the infected population can
distribute the disease to the
unaffected areas and thus a
reservoir of the disease could be
maintained. "Our normal defense
mechanism may not be effective in
confronting it,"he commented.
ABM Discussion
Another afternoon panel
discussed plans for the anti-ballistic
missile system (ABM) focusing
primarily on who was making the
decisions on the system's
implementation, and who
influenced those decision makers.
Members of the panel seemed to
agree that the ABM system would
be "a disaster to proceed with," in
the words of U.S. Congressman
Jeffrey Cohelan, of Alameda
County. Professor Sidney Drell of
SLAC, declined to express an
opinion, presumably because it
could conflict with his position on
the President's Science Advisory
Council.
Cohelan, who served as a
member of the House Armed
Services Committee, was afraid
that spending money on the ABM
would "be a first step in a new
expansion of our strategic forces, a
trend which hopefully has been
reversed."
Pollution Panel
In a third panel entitled
"Population and Pollution," Prof.
Peter Raven of Stanford's biology
department predicted, "If the
human race doesn't get down to
brass tacks in the next five to ten
years, the ball game will be over,
and we won't have to worry about
future generations."
Raven, along with Prof. G.L.
Stebbins, a geneticist from
University of California at Davis;
Prof. Pierre Noyes, SLAC; Prof.
R.A. Falk, a political scientist from
Princeton; O. Dickason, a graduate
student in engineering; and panel
moderator G. Gutman, a graduate
student in biology; emphasized
that if the entire planet does not
unite in an effort to control
population and eliminate
pollution, "we only have 30 more
years to worry about it.
"Nothing can keep the world
population from growing
indefinitely," began Raven to a
standing-room-only crowd in
Engineering 300. "And the more
people there are in the world, the
worse the quality of environment
for the existing lot."
The present population of 3.5
billion people, of which 2 billion
are not properly-fed, is expected to
double in 37 years.
Prof. Stebbins cited several new
food sources that biologists have
synthesized in recent years. "It
used to be a dream that there might
be a 'chicken in every pot," he
chuckled. "Now chicken is cheaper
than red meat, and it's all due to
technology."
Regarding political global
control of population and
pollution, Prof. Falk commented,
"If you think about it rationally,
you end up horribly pessimistic.
You have to get as angry about
overpopulation as you do about
racial issues before you can begin
to penetrate the power structure."
