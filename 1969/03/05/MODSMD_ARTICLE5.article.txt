# Scientists Praise Government Ties
## 
### 
Four nationally prominent Stanford
scientists defended the links between the
University and government in scientific
research and development at yesterday
afternoon's opening round of speeches in
the March 4th Convocation: Science and
Society.
Nobel laureate geneticist Joshua
Lederberg, Academic Senate chairman
and physicist Leonard Schiff, SLAC
professor and President's Scientific
Advisory Committee member Sidney
Drell and electrical engineering professor
and department chairman John Linvill all
echoed the theme that the positive social
benefits to be garnered from the
government-university ties far outweigh
the possible dangers.
The speakers stressed to the 1200
people gathered in Memorial Church that
many of the technological breakthroughs
of recent years were produced through
the government-university cooperation
often criticized today.
The afternoon speakers were
introduced by biology graduate student
Paul Grobstein who expressed his
concern that "the directions that science
and technology are taking are not well
considered, that science and technology
are having effects on society in ways that
are not intended."
Grobstein also indicated a concern
that "we cannot affect the direction that
society is moving. We are frustrated for a
way of action."
Lederberg's Specch
Following Grobstein's keynote
speech, Joshua Lederberg departed from
his prepared text to discuss some of the
problems and prospects of science in
today's world.
Lederberg singled out "nationalism"
as the "root problem" of science today.
"Nationalism, whether it be to the stars
and stripes or based on the color of a
man's skin, is inviable in the present
world. Its disadvantages loom too large
for us to ignore."
The Nobel Laureate said that "social
institutions" rather than science are
responsible for the majority of the
world's problems. He was not completely
enthusiastic about the purity of science
however.
"I am not an optimist about good
things coming from science, per se," he
said, adding that "science is one of the
most effective means of non-national
communication."
Biological Policy
Touching on matters closer to his
speciality, biochemistry, Lederberg said
without advocating it, "We need to think

about setting up a national biological
policy." He told the Memorial Church
gathering that "we already have a de
facto biological policy."
"One question is whether life is the
system-value to be optimized," he said.
"We haven't determined what alternative
values might be stressed."
He covered some of the recent
developments in molecular biology
saying that the time was quite near when
man will be able to augment human
genetic deficiencies "through molecular
biology." He asserted that this
development would not be as great a
change as one might think because ever
since vaccinations were developed
molecular blueprints have been changed
by man.
Social Questions
Lederberg took notice of the social
questions raised by such developments
saying that as our knowledge advanced it
"becomes more and more difficult" for
man to make decisions without
considering the rest of society.
He cited the detection of malformed
fetuses as an example. Science will soon
be able to detect such tragedies, and there
will be raised "the problems of
compulsion (compulsive abortions) in
such cases."
At the same time Lederberg insisted
that he should be allowed to continue
work on human genetic characteristics,
even to the point of a few test cases.
"There is some merit in studying
vegetative propagation in man," he said.
Schiff's Speech
Academic Senate chairman Leonard
Schiff followed Lederberg with a defense
