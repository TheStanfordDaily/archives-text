# Tresidder To Follow Earlier Closing Hours
## 
### BILL BANKS 
Tresidder Union will continue to close
at ten each night unless there is greater
response from the students, the Union
Board announced in an open meeting last
night.
Peter Hass, Chairman of the Board,
emphasized that the union is run for the
most part by the student board and not
by an "authoritarian administration."
Responding to the recent protests against
the new closing hour, Hass explained that
the union is losing money and that the
money lost after ten o'clock is creating
very difficult financial problems.
Mark Heller, speaking for the group
known as the Protestors, Troublemakers
and Anarchists (PTA), suggested that
since the union is a student function, it
should be operated solely by the
students.
Heller continued saying that a student
operated union would create a greater
feeling of communial responsibility for
the financial aspects. Heller also
suggested that the union enlarge its

social function by sponsoring free, ail
school dances.
Major Burden
Haas, although in agreement with the
idea of a greater feeling of community for
the union, pointed out that no more than
five of the school's eleven thousand
students had bothered to attend the
meeting to discuss possible
improvements.
Haas stated further that maintenance
costs were a major financial burden and
that unless students start taking an
interest in the maintenance of the union,
little could be done to reduce the
expenditures.
Forest Tregea, Director of the union,
said that students who demand that the
union remain open until mid-night, tend
to lose sight of the human element of the
union's operation. He emphasized that
the union staff has to be working every
hour that the union is open. "Keep in
mind," he said, "that custodians are
people."
Coffee Spot
A possible alternative to the new
closing hours was offered by Haas. He
said that a small part of the union,
probably the area around the booths,
might be left open until midnight. Coffee
and doughnuts could be made available
and in this way the union could serve the
students who prefer not to spend the
later hours in the coffee house.
This idea, he said, would be
considered and might be implemented
sometime next week.
The union's other activities, movies,
jazz shows and lectures, also came under
discussion at the meeting. It was observed
that many Stanford students find that
they cannot attend the movies shown in
the union because so many non-students
attend and the rooms are too small to
accommodate the students who want to
see them.
In answer to this, Haas said that the
functions of the union are open to all
who care to come and that there was no
way in which admission could be
restricted to students. For the most part,
Haas continued, the union welcomes the
local residents who want to attend the
various events held in the union.
A suggestion to increase the efficiency
of the food service at noon, was offered
by PTA member, Heller. Heller said that
tables could be set up outside on the deck
which would sell sandwiches, thus
eliminating the necessity of waiting on
long lines.
Heller also proposed that a special
"lunch pail" be instituted. The "lunch
pnil" would be a complete lunch that
would sell at a set price and would
eliminate the high cost of eating a la
carte.

long lines.
Heller also proposed that a special
"lunch pail" be instituted. The "lunch
pnil" would be a complete lunch that
would sell at a set price and would
eliminate the high cost of eating a la
carte.
Tresidder Union will continue to close
at ten each night unless there is greater
response from the students, the Union
Board announced in an open meeting last
night.
Peter Hass, Chairman of the Board,
emphasized that the union is run for the
most part by the student board and not
by an "authoritarian administration."
Responding to the recent protests against
the new closing hour, Hass explained that
the union is losing money and that the
money lost after ten o'clock is creating
very difficult financial problems.
Mark Heller, speaking for the group
known as the Protestors, Troublemakers
and Anarchists (PTA), suggested that
since the union is a student function, it
should be operated solely by the
students.
Heller continued saying that a student
operated union would create a greater
feeling of communial responsibility for
the financial aspects. Heller also
suggested that the union enlarge its

social function by sponsoring free, ail
school dances.
Major Burden
Haas, although in agreement with the
idea of a greater feeling of community for
the union, pointed out that no more than
five of the school's eleven thousand
students had bothered to attend the
meeting to discuss possible
improvements.
Haas stated further that maintenance
costs were a major financial burden and
that unless students start taking an
interest in the maintenance of the union,
little could be done to reduce the
expenditures.
Forest Tregea, Director of the union,
said that students who demand that the
union remain open until mid-night, tend
to lose sight of the human element of the
union's operation. He emphasized that
the union staff has to be working every
hour that the union is open. "Keep in
mind," he said, "that custodians are
people."
Coffee Spot
A possible alternative to the new
closing hours was offered by Haas. He
said that a small part of the union,
probably the area around the booths,
might be left open until midnight. Coffee
and doughnuts could be made available
and in this way the union could serve the
students who prefer not to spend the
later hours in the coffee house.
This idea, he said, would be
considered and might be implemented
sometime next week.
The union's other activities, movies,
jazz shows and lectures, also came under
discussion at the meeting. It was observed
that many Stanford students find that
they cannot attend the movies shown in
the union because so many non-students
attend and the rooms are too small to
accommodate the students who want to
see them.
In answer to this, Haas said that the
functions of the union are open to all
who care to come and that there was no
way in which admission could be
restricted to students. For the most part,
Haas continued, the union welcomes the
local residents who want to attend the
various events held in the union.
A suggestion to increase the efficiency
of the food service at noon, was offered
by PTA member, Heller. Heller said that
tables could be set up outside on the deck
which would sell sandwiches, thus
eliminating the necessity of waiting on
long lines.
Heller also proposed that a special
"lunch pail" be instituted. The "lunch
