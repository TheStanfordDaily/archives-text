# Students' Dean
## 
### 
The search committee for a new dean of
students must do more than find a
replacement for Joel Smith. It must redefine
the very nature of the job.
Joel Smith or any other man with good
intentions and sympathy for students
cannot possibly remain a friend of students
while serving as dean. The position is
primarily administrative and the functions
are dominated by paper work and rule
enforcement. Essentially, the dean of
students acts as the administration's public
policeman and spokesman, relaying
directives and warnings to the masses.
In short order, the dean loses contact
with students. Even worse, he gains the
image of bookkeeper, name-taker,
rule-maker, and straight-play-it-by-the
fundaniental standard enforcer. To find the
proper man for this image, the search
committee might begin with Chicago's
Richard Daley.
Joel Smith and his staff have fought this
image. Time and again, however, they were
forced into antagonistic positions with
students because the dean's office is built
into the University governance structure as
the center for rule enforcement and neces
sary but stifling bureaucratic busy work.
Many of the student services provided by the
dean's office are invaluable. Assistant to the
Dean Barbara Dray performs daily miracles
helping students plan extracurricular
programs. Associate Deal Sally Mahoney
helped lead the change to coed housing.
Yet always lurking in the background are
the unpleasant jobs most often done by
Associate Dean Bill Wyman. These include
name taking, and roadblocking student
activities that violate one rule or another.
Smith was never in the public eye, usually

bogged down with work as Associate
Provost.
Neither Smith nor Wyman have enjoyed
every minute of the past two years. Wyman,
contrary to popular beliefs, did not relish
taking names during the disruption of the
January trustee meeting. Too many times,
Wyman and Smith have done a job despite
their personal feelings.
In sum, the built in defects of the office
compromise the effectiveness of its
personnel and therefore of its functions.
Stanford has a marvelous bureaucracy for
students. It has failed to supply some
constant friendship in the process.
The time is perfect for a shift. As the
search committee begins its work, it's top
priority criteria for a new dean should
include youth, energy, and a vision of the
position that places student needs higher
than University wants or faculty whims.
The dean of students should be a
spokesman for students. He should stand
apart from the administrative paper work
and even from administrative policies. He
must be free to criticize the faculty and the
administration and, as astonishing as it
sounds, support student interests.
In structural terms, the new dean should
not have responsibilities in the provost's or
president's office. Furthermore, he should
escape from most of the administrative work
in his own office. It would be a new day at
Stanford if the dean of students met with the
president to discuss what more could be
done for students rather than what should be
done about students.
If these criteria are not important, then
the dean might as well be the chief of police
and 1 5 secretaries. Services and threats are
not all students desire from their dean.

Dean Barbara Dray performs daily miracles
helping students plan extracurricular
programs. Associate Deal Sally Mahoney
helped lead the change to coed housing.
Yet always lurking in the background are
the unpleasant jobs most often done by
Associate Dean Bill Wyman. These include
name taking, and roadblocking student
activities that violate one rule or another.
Smith was never in the public eye, usually

bogged down with work as Associate
Provost.
Neither Smith nor Wyman have enjoyed
every minute of the past two years. Wyman,
contrary to popular beliefs, did not relish
taking names during the disruption of the
January trustee meeting. Too many times,
Wyman and Smith have done a job despite
their personal feelings.
In sum, the built in defects of the office
compromise the effectiveness of its
personnel and therefore of its functions.
Stanford has a marvelous bureaucracy for
students. It has failed to supply some
constant friendship in the process.
The time is perfect for a shift. As the
search committee begins its work, it's top
priority criteria for a new dean should
include youth, energy, and a vision of the
position that places student needs higher
than University wants or faculty whims.
The dean of students should be a
spokesman for students. He should stand
apart from the administrative paper work
and even from administrative policies. He
must be free to criticize the faculty and the
administration and, as astonishing as it
sounds, support student interests.
In structural terms, the new dean should
not have responsibilities in the provost's or
president's office. Furthermore, he should
escape from most of the administrative work
in his own office. It would be a new day at
Stanford if the dean of students met with the
president to discuss what more could be
done for students rather than what should be
done about students.
If these criteria are not important, then
the dean might as well be the chief of police
and 1 5 secretaries. Services and threats are
not all students desire from their dean.
The search committee for a new dean of
students must do more than find a
replacement for Joel Smith. It must redefine
the very nature of the job.
Joel Smith or any other man with good
intentions and sympathy for students
cannot possibly remain a friend of students
while serving as dean. The position is
primarily administrative and the functions
are dominated by paper work and rule
enforcement. Essentially, the dean of
students acts as the administration's public
policeman and spokesman, relaying
directives and warnings to the masses.
In short order, the dean loses contact
with students. Even worse, he gains the
image of bookkeeper, name-taker,
rule-maker, and straight-play-it-by-the
fundaniental standard enforcer. To find the
proper man for this image, the search
committee might begin with Chicago's
Richard Daley.
Joel Smith and his staff have fought this
image. Time and again, however, they were
forced into antagonistic positions with
students because the dean's office is built
into the University governance structure as
the center for rule enforcement and neces
sary but stifling bureaucratic busy work.
Many of the student services provided by the
dean's office are invaluable. Assistant to the
Dean Barbara Dray performs daily miracles
helping students plan extracurricular
programs. Associate Deal Sally Mahoney
