# Deterrence

### 
We've all heard about deterrence and
flexible response and quantum escalation in
war and international relations. Well,
President Nixon, in effect, endorsed
deterrence the other day. But the interesting
element in the story is that he endorsed the
application of deterrence theory on college
campuses.
Nixon wrote a letter to the Reverend
Theodore Hesburgh, president of Notre
Dame, which hinted at Federal and state
action to halt student rebellions. Nixon's
intention was forthright endorsement of
Father Hesburgh's plan to give students who
use violent or non-violent force instead of
rational persuasion 15 minutes to think
things over and then to suspend them.
The relation of deterrence to matters of
punishment has a long history. Cesare
Beccaria once wrote: "The aim of
chastisement is nothing but to prevent the
criminal from injuring society any more, and
to deter his fellow-citizens from attempting
similar crimes." Deterrence theory can be
seen today in Stanford professor Herbert
Packer's writings, which to some extent
return to the concerns of the Benthamite

penal reformers of the nineteenth century.
Lately, Stanford University has moved
away from the vague Fundamental Standard
somewhat in the direction of deterrence,
through its instituting and implementing the
University policy on demonstrations. That
there is a potential for repression in all this
can beseen in the extreme policy set at Notre
Dame and in Nixon's attempt to use Father
Hesburgh's statement as an opening wedge in
the campaign of "law and order" politicians
to pacify campuses by intervening from
outside. Commendably, Hesburgh replied:
"The best salvation for the university in the
face of any crisis is for the university
community to save itself."
At Stanford, the problems of deterrence
must be kept constantly in mind. We can't
expect our administrators to be
philosopher-kings in applying deterrence
theory. Also they and the judicial bodies
operate in an atmosphere where political
opposition is increasingly regarded not as
dissent but as subversive deviance. There is a
temptation to use deterrence against
deviates. And who is to judge who are the
deviates?
