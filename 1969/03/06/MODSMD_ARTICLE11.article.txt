## Convicted But Not Guilty 
### 
Editor,THE DAILY:
The Stanford community is a
closed system. Whatever takes
place within this community
affects only this community. The
consequences of any and all
activity here go no further than El
Camino Real. This is exactly the
assumption underlying Stanford's
entire judicial system. This is also
bullshit.
Here at Stanford we value above
all else individual and academic
freedom. We are free to do
whatever we want so long as we
don't limit the freedom of other
members of the university
community—freedom with
responsibility. This all sounds
perfectly reasonable to us in our
cloistered and comfortable
community—but—how reasonable
do you think it sounds to the
Vietnamese or Thais who get the
other end of the stick? To them
academic freedom means having a
Stanford trained aerospace
engineer design F-lll's for Roger
Lewis (trustee) and General
Dynamics which drop William
Hewlett's (trustee) and FMC's
anti-personnel bombs on them
while on bombing runs plotted at
SRI in the furtherance of a S.E.
Asia policy justified by Stanford
political scientists.
Because of the assumption on
which it is based, Stanford's
judicial system operates, in effect,
to insure that the freedom to aid in
the burning, starving and
murdering of thousands of
third-world people will not be
interfered with. SDS has
constantly been criticised for being
irresponsible in disregarding the
rights of others. I think that they
have been the only ones to show
any responsibility, any regard for
the rights of those people outside
the university who are most
directly affected by what happens
within this community. What SDS
has said both verbally and in its
actions is that the right of the
Vietnamese to continue living is
greater than the right of Stanford's
trustees to make money off their
death.
Because SDS has made a value
judgement, and because a value
judgement in itself is such a rare
occurance at Stanford, they have
been called self-righteous. Because
of their action at the trustees'
meeting and elsewhere, they've
been likened to fascists, accused of
violence and lawlessness, and have
been prosecuted and convicted as
criminals. In all the shit that's
coming down on SDS it is easy to
loose sight of the fact that there is a
lot more than just pushing and
shoving going on "out there" in the
"outside world" and Stanford is
knee-deep in it.
SDS is not guilty. They are not
the criminals, yet they have been
tried and convicted. Stanford's
trustees are the real criminals, and
SRI and AEL are at least
accomplices. What kind of a
judicial system is it that sanctions
murder and punishes those who
object?

Editor, THE DAILY:
Just a short note on movements.
SDS is not Mohammed, but the
students at Stanford are definitely
a large mass of hard rock. The only
movement they feel is biological,
which occasionally they reorient to
other channels and thereby fill the
air with waste material.
Monday's editorial is classic,
and indirectly speaks to the liberal
problem of Stanford University; it
speaks of SDS as not building a
movement. What this suggests is
that you, the editors, and you, the
students, are waiting for someone
to come to you and tap your
humanity. Maybe SDS has tapped
the barrel too high, the only drops
of humanity are languishing
somewhere on the bottom. If you
don't like our movement, but agree
with our goals, form your own
movement; don't place blame upon
SDS and wallow in your ability to
be critical. Move yourself and show
us another way, if there is another
way.
Surely SDS may be up against
the wall because they have dared to
move, but you don't even have the
slightest idea where the wall is.

•Rehabilitate Teaching
Editor, THE DAILY:
Many graduate students would
agree wholeheartedly that graduate
education is a disaster area.
One trend that is so disturbing
to many graduate students is the
tendency of too many professors
to exalt their own narrow
definition of professionalism above
the traditionally held view of the
professor's role in humanistic
education. This latter tradition
held that the professor, as well as
being a qualified scholar in his
chosen field of specialty, ought
also to be a teacher and inspirer of
his students, ideally that together
they might become a true
"community of scholars."
What is disturbing is the fact
that so much "scholarly concern"
which is so vociferously defended
seems increasingly empty of any
redeeming human content. In a
speech to the San Francisco Rotary
Club last week, President Pitzer
affirmed that the modern
university ought "to put concern
for the development of individual
students back to the center of
education, where it belongs." But
how can this be done when
students are almost superfluous to
a man's scholarly career, when his
reputation and position are
determined not by his teaching
ability in the classroom but
primarily by his ability to churn
out reams of written pages to be
applauded (and hopefully read) by
fellow specialists in other far-off
pastures? As Robert M. Hutchins
has observed: "As long as the
purpose of the university is to turn
out research and train researchers, I
don't see how any other result can
be expected. Why should a man
waste time with students when his
future depends on his using that
time for other purposes?"
If one is searching for a reason
behind much of the present

student alienation, the current
definition of professionalization
not a whole person in the eyes of
his professor but only another
"potential scholar" to carry on the
enterprise, then what is to stop the
student from concluding that
professors are irrelevant to his life,
and that he ought to seek moral,
ethical, perhaps even intellectual
guidance elsewhere? The fact that
this conclusion has already been
drawn by many graduate students
ought to cause some rather critical
re-evaluation of present
departmental policies and
priorities.
What is needed is a revolution in
values, a conversion experience, if
you will, so that professors and
their students will no longer bend
the knee in idolatrous worship of
scholarly success and intellectual
prestige purchased at the price of
conscience and one's own
humanity. What is needed is a
return, in penitence and humility,
to a professorial concern for
communicating to students not
only an academic specialty but a
way of critically evaluating the
world in which one lives, to "give
academia a human face." One can,
like Benjamin Disraeli, finally
climb to the top of the greasy pole
in the scholarly world as well as in
the political world. But is it worth
the cost to gain the whole world at
the price of losing one's own soul?
Perhaps Myron Filene was right in
his concluding lines to a Daily
letter last week: "The world is
bigger than you accept; your
context is false."

•Rehabilitate Teaching
Editor, THE DAILY:
Many graduate students would
agree wholeheartedly that graduate
education is a disaster area.
One trend that is so disturbing
to many graduate students is the
tendency of too many professors
to exalt their own narrow
definition of professionalism above
the traditionally held view of the
professor's role in humanistic
education. This latter tradition
held that the professor, as well as
being a qualified scholar in his
chosen field of specialty, ought
also to be a teacher and inspirer of
his students, ideally that together
they might become a true
"community of scholars."
What is disturbing is the fact
that so much "scholarly concern"
which is so vociferously defended
seems increasingly empty of any
redeeming human content. In a
speech to the San Francisco Rotary
Club last week, President Pitzer
affirmed that the modern
university ought "to put concern
for the development of individual
students back to the center of
education, where it belongs." But
how can this be done when
students are almost superfluous to
a man's scholarly career, when his
reputation and position are
determined not by his teaching
ability in the classroom but
primarily by his ability to churn
out reams of written pages to be
applauded (and hopefully read) by
fellow specialists in other far-off
pastures? As Robert M. Hutchins
has observed: "As long as the
purpose of the university is to turn
out research and train researchers, I
don't see how any other result can
be expected. Why should a man
waste time with students when his
future depends on his using that
time for other purposes?"
If one is searching for a reason
behind much of the present

student alienation, the current
definition of professionalization
not a whole person in the eyes of
his professor but only another
"potential scholar" to carry on the
enterprise, then what is to stop the
student from concluding that
professors are irrelevant to his life,
and that he ought to seek moral,
ethical, perhaps even intellectual
guidance elsewhere? The fact that
this conclusion has already been
drawn by many graduate students
ought to cause some rather critical
re-evaluation of present
departmental policies and
priorities.
What is needed is a revolution in
values, a conversion experience, if
you will, so that professors and
their students will no longer bend
the knee in idolatrous worship of
scholarly success and intellectual
prestige purchased at the price of
conscience and one's own
humanity. What is needed is a
return, in penitence and humility,
to a professorial concern for
communicating to students not
only an academic specialty but a
way of critically evaluating the
world in which one lives, to "give
academia a human face." One can,
like Benjamin Disraeli, finally
climb to the top of the greasy pole
in the scholarly world as well as in
the political world. But is it worth
the cost to gain the whole world at
the price of losing one's own soul?
Perhaps Myron Filene was right in
his concluding lines to a Daily
letter last week: "The world is
bigger than you accept; your
context is false."

The Stanford community is a
closed system. Whatever takes
place within this community
affects only this community. The
consequences of any and all
activity here go no further than El
Camino Real. This is exactly the
assumption underlying Stanford's
entire judicial system. This is also
bullshit.
Here at Stanford we value above
all else individual and academic
freedom. We are free to do
whatever we want so long as we
don't limit the freedom of other
members of the university
community—freedom with
responsibility. This all sounds
perfectly reasonable to us in our
cloistered and comfortable
community—but—how reasonable
do you think it sounds to the
Vietnamese or Thais who get the
other end of the stick? To them
academic freedom means having a
Stanford trained aerospace
engineer design F-lll's for Roger
Lewis (trustee) and General
Dynamics which drop William
Hewlett's (trustee) and FMC's
anti-personnel bombs on them
while on bombing runs plotted at
SRI in the furtherance of a S.E.
Asia policy justified by Stanford
political scientists.
Because of the assumption on
which it is based, Stanford's
judicial system operates, in effect,
to insure that the freedom to aid in
the burning, starving and
murdering of thousands of
third-world people will not be
interfered with. SDS has
constantly been criticised for being
irresponsible in disregarding the
rights of others. I think that they
have been the only ones to show
any responsibility, any regard for
the rights of those people outside
the university who are most
directly affected by what happens
within this community. What SDS
has said both verbally and in its
actions is that the right of the
Vietnamese to continue living is
greater than the right of Stanford's
trustees to make money off their
death.
Because SDS has made a value
judgement, and because a value
judgement in itself is such a rare
occurance at Stanford, they have
been called self-righteous. Because
of their action at the trustees'
meeting and elsewhere, they've
been likened to fascists, accused of
violence and lawlessness, and have
been prosecuted and convicted as
criminals. In all the shit that's
coming down on SDS it is easy to
loose sight of the fact that there is a
lot more than just pushing and
shoving going on "out there" in the
"outside world" and Stanford is
knee-deep in it.
SDS is not guilty. They are not
the criminals, yet they have been
tried and convicted. Stanford's
trustees are the real criminals, and
SRI and AEL are at least
accomplices. What kind of a
judicial system is it that sanctions
murder and punishes those who
object?

Just a short note on movements.
SDS is not Mohammed, but the
students at Stanford are definitely
a large mass of hard rock. The only
movement they feel is biological,
which occasionally they reorient to
other channels and thereby fill the
air with waste material.
Monday's editorial is classic,
and indirectly speaks to the liberal
problem of Stanford University; it
speaks of SDS as not building a
movement. What this suggests is
that you, the editors, and you, the
students, are waiting for someone
to come to you and tap your
humanity. Maybe SDS has tapped
the barrel too high, the only drops
of humanity are languishing
somewhere on the bottom. If you
don't like our movement, but agree
with our goals, form your own
movement; don't place blame upon
SDS and wallow in your ability to
be critical. Move yourself and show
us another way, if there is another
way.

perfectly reasonable to us in our
cloistered and comfortable
community—but—how reasonable
do you think it sounds to the
Vietnamese or Thais who get the
other end of the stick? To them
academic freedom means having a
Stanford trained aerospace
engineer design F-lll's for Roger
Lewis (trustee) and General
Dynamics which drop William
Hewlett's (trustee) and FMC's
anti-personnel bombs on them
while on bombing runs plotted at
SRI in the furtherance of a S.E.
Asia policy justified by Stanford
political scientists.
Because of the assumption on
which it is based, Stanford's
judicial system operates, in effect,
to insure that the freedom to aid in
the burning, starving and
murdering of thousands of
third-world people will not be
interfered with. SDS has
constantly been criticised for being
irresponsible in disregarding the
rights of others. I think that they
have been the only ones to show
any responsibility, any regard for
the rights of those people outside
the university who are most
directly affected by what happens
within this community. What SDS
has said both verbally and in its
actions is that the right of the
Vietnamese to continue living is
greater than the right of Stanford's
trustees to make money off their
death.
Because SDS has made a value
judgement, and because a value
judgement in itself is such a rare
occurance at Stanford, they have
been called self-righteous. Because
of their action at the trustees'
meeting and elsewhere, they've
been likened to fascists, accused of
violence and lawlessness, and have
been prosecuted and convicted as
criminals. In all the shit that's
coming down on SDS it is easy to
loose sight of the fact that there is a
lot more than just pushing and
shoving going on "out there" in the
"outside world" and Stanford is
knee-deep in it.
SDS is not guilty. They are not
the criminals, yet they have been
tried and convicted. Stanford's
trustees are the real criminals, and
SRI and AEL are at least
accomplices. What kind of a
judicial system is it that sanctions
murder and punishes those who
object?

Just a short note on movements.
SDS is not Mohammed, but the
students at Stanford are definitely
a large mass of hard rock. The only
movement they feel is biological,
which occasionally they reorient to
other channels and thereby fill the
air with waste material.
Monday's editorial is classic,
and indirectly speaks to the liberal
problem of Stanford University; it
speaks of SDS as not building a
movement. What this suggests is
that you, the editors, and you, the
students, are waiting for someone
to come to you and tap your
humanity. Maybe SDS has tapped
the barrel too high, the only drops
of humanity are languishing
somewhere on the bottom. If you
don't like our movement, but agree
with our goals, form your own
movement; don't place blame upon
SDS and wallow in your ability to
be critical. Move yourself and show
us another way, if there is another
way.
Surely SDS may be up against
the wall because they have dared to
move, but you don't even have the
slightest idea where the wall is.

•Rehabilitate Teaching
Editor, THE DAILY:
Many graduate students would
agree wholeheartedly that graduate
education is a disaster area.
One trend that is so disturbing
to many graduate students is the
tendency of too many professors
to exalt their own narrow
definition of professionalism above
the traditionally held view of the
professor's role in humanistic
education. This latter tradition
held that the professor, as well as
being a qualified scholar in his
chosen field of specialty, ought
also to be a teacher and inspirer of
his students, ideally that together
they might become a true
"community of scholars."
What is disturbing is the fact
that so much "scholarly concern"
which is so vociferously defended
seems increasingly empty of any
redeeming human content. In a
speech to the San Francisco Rotary
Club last week, President Pitzer
affirmed that the modern
university ought "to put concern
for the development of individual
students back to the center of
education, where it belongs." But
how can this be done when
students are almost superfluous to
a man's scholarly career, when his
reputation and position are
determined not by his teaching
ability in the classroom but
primarily by his ability to churn
out reams of written pages to be
applauded (and hopefully read) by
fellow specialists in other far-off
pastures? As Robert M. Hutchins
has observed: "As long as the
purpose of the university is to turn
out research and train researchers, I
don't see how any other result can
be expected. Why should a man
waste time with students when his
future depends on his using that
time for other purposes?"
If one is searching for a reason
behind much of the present

student alienation, the current
definition of professionalization
not a whole person in the eyes of
his professor but only another
"potential scholar" to carry on the
enterprise, then what is to stop the
student from concluding that
professors are irrelevant to his life,
and that he ought to seek moral,
ethical, perhaps even intellectual
guidance elsewhere? The fact that
this conclusion has already been
drawn by many graduate students
ought to cause some rather critical
re-evaluation of present
departmental policies and
priorities.
What is needed is a revolution in
values, a conversion experience, if
you will, so that professors and
their students will no longer bend
the knee in idolatrous worship of
scholarly success and intellectual
prestige purchased at the price of
conscience and one's own
humanity. What is needed is a
return, in penitence and humility,
to a professorial concern for
communicating to students not
only an academic specialty but a
way of critically evaluating the
world in which one lives, to "give
academia a human face." One can,
like Benjamin Disraeli, finally
climb to the top of the greasy pole
in the scholarly world as well as in
the political world. But is it worth
the cost to gain the whole world at
the price of losing one's own soul?
Perhaps Myron Filene was right in
his concluding lines to a Daily
letter last week: "The world is
bigger than you accept; your
context is false."

also to be a teacher and inspirer of
his students, ideally that together
they might become a true
"community of scholars."
What is disturbing is the fact
that so much "scholarly concern"
which is so vociferously defended
seems increasingly empty of any
redeeming human content. In a
speech to the San Francisco Rotary
Club last week, President Pitzer
affirmed that the modern
university ought "to put concern
for the development of individual
students back to the center of
education, where it belongs." But
how can this be done when
students are almost superfluous to
a man's scholarly career, when his
reputation and position are
determined not by his teaching
ability in the classroom but
primarily by his ability to churn
out reams of written pages to be
applauded (and hopefully read) by
fellow specialists in other far-off
pastures? As Robert M. Hutchins
has observed: "As long as the
purpose of the university is to turn
out research and train researchers, I
don't see how any other result can
be expected. Why should a man
waste time with students when his
future depends on his using that
time for other purposes?"
If one is searching for a reason
behind much of the present

student alienation, the current
definition of professionalization
not a whole person in the eyes of
his professor but only another
"potential scholar" to carry on the
enterprise, then what is to stop the
student from concluding that
professors are irrelevant to his life,
and that he ought to seek moral,
ethical, perhaps even intellectual
guidance elsewhere? The fact that
this conclusion has already been
drawn by many graduate students
ought to cause some rather critical
re-evaluation of present
departmental policies and
priorities.
What is needed is a revolution in
values, a conversion experience, if
you will, so that professors and
their students will no longer bend
the knee in idolatrous worship of
scholarly success and intellectual
prestige purchased at the price of
conscience and one's own
humanity. What is needed is a
return, in penitence and humility,
to a professorial concern for
communicating to students not
only an academic specialty but a
way of critically evaluating the
world in which one lives, to "give
academia a human face." One can,
like Benjamin Disraeli, finally
climb to the top of the greasy pole
in the scholarly world as well as in
the political world. But is it worth
the cost to gain the whole world at
the price of losing one's own soul?
Perhaps Myron Filene was right in
his concluding lines to a Daily
letter last week: "The world is
bigger than you accept; your
context is false."
