# The 						Bad Mouth
## Not Roses From A Carcass 
### Johnie Scott 
The last days of the old
freedoms are upon us. Fan mail
now floods the Daily in protest of
the "Rape," carried out two weeks
ago, by BSU. Price estimates
approach new ceilings, once
Tresidder Memorial Union
Bookstore discovers that the
Insurance Company will pick up
the price of damages. Cold hard
cash.
Stanford's News Service
discreetly puts the lid on any news
leaking out from the disaster area
on said causes, for fear of a
repetition of this "touchy affair."
Everyone ignorant, everyone to
remain in ignorance.
It is to be expected that the BSU
has gone insane, wreaking in a brief
three minutes a damage that is
psychological, culturally
castrating,'sociologically revealing,
materialistically beneficial,
propagandistically fruitful for the
greedy, rapacious, decidedly
unaesthetic hands of the detached,
governing few. Flame and smoke
and electric bombast twitching in
mad, orgiastic verbiage from on
high and on bottom, in the coldest
Hells.
It is where we are today. At
Stanford University, trying to
determine whether we are really as
political as the mass media would
have the mass public believe. The
San Francisco Examiner can
"leak" two "top-level memoes"
from the hierarchy of SDS, in
which secret plottings against the
corporate-imperialistic regime are
revealed. Moreover, one sees where
29 students have been suspended.
Two plus two makes four, or does
it?
Those who go to Stanford, who
are there to examine its workings
everyday, know better. Why does
no one speak out? Why does no one
call out what the truth is? Why is
everyone, after all of this is said and
done, then so uptight when I, as a
black man, come out on the line
and tell you why?
"It is the blackness of the
sufferers, their absolute existence
as a Different race, that cheapens
any further social description as *
what, actually, is going on?
Explanation is a selfish act. But
The Man says, What's going on?
What do you mean people are
suffering? I didn't
realize . . . What? That it was real
and really happening and real and
really happening, but only to
niggers, and those white people too
stupid to be rich in this last fat
bastion of the white man, doomed
now to go downjhard, and eaten,
smashed at, from its insides by its

acquisitions, and the 'holiness' of
them. Black People will prove to be
the most costly of these
acquisitions."
Still Too Strong
Leßoi Jones, my Stanford
readers and you amongst the
general public, from"The Last
Days of the American Empire." A
book still too strong for these fag
ears and jellyfish faces floating all
around, more than willing to go out
in the night seeking cheap thrills, or
to sit up against the walls in their
cubbyholes, blowing their minds
with LSD or THC, anything to get
them further out of touch with this
present reality.
But the truth is that we, that we
who are not ashamed to call
ourselves Black People—which also
means that we are not and will not
be fazed by your so-called
lamentations of property losses,
who after all among you cried out
so loudly and for so long when the
dogs freed from their chains by the
powers-which-is entered Oakland
Tech and took a beautiful 14
year-old Black Youth, put that
person in Juvenile Hall, and for a
crime no less than demanding a
Black Studies course at Oakland
Technical High School.
Yes! It is easy enough for Dr.
Pitzer and Vice-Provost Lyman to
go on record as saying the
university's prime commitment is
to its own—meaning all of us, we
who go here. This implies that
detached air of scholasticism,
fostering that atmosphere of pure
research which incubates atomic
bombs, germ warfare, riot control
study (Thank God! The Brothers at
Harvard shut down that course as it
was called in "Ghetto
Root Issues
But root issues are what
everyone wants to talk about now.
Root issues, mind you, yourselves,
your own words as they appeared
in print in this newspaper for the
past two weeks. And so preface the
demands made by the BSU with
the following thought emanating
from the consciousness, the black
National Consciousness, of the
peoples here who have undertaken
to make a delving into the
life-senses of 25 million colonized
peoples right here in the bowels of
this castrated cow worthwhile to
the survival of the individual.
You corny, racist, bigoted,
hypocritical white people and
bootlicking, shadow-worshipping
would-be lackeys of the power
structure (and the closest Black
People ever got to the Big Money
was the top of one hill so that they
could look over to a higher hill at

where the white folks live)—it
was/is you people who always ask
what is the problem? what is the
problem? and then, when you are
told, who turn to the side and
immediately begin talking about
how that cannot be the problem!
About the need to search for
something much deeper, much
more involved and complex. You
hated, you still hate, you will no
doubt die hating Leßoi Jones, but
he told you what was happening:
"The rebels among us have
become merely people like myself
who grow beards and will not
participate in politics. Drugs,
juvenile delinquency, complete
isolation from the vapid mores of
the country, a few current ways
out. But name an alternative here.
Something not inextricably bound
up in a lie. Something not part of
liberal stupidity or the actual filth
of vested interest. There is none.
It's much too late. We are an old
people already. Even the vitality of
our art is like bright flowers
pushing up through a rotting
carcass."
Those in the know already
know that Stanford, like a good
many other schools, is beginning to
pay its dues. Those of us on the
inside who are faced with another
generation's worth of
whitewashing are simply not going
to go for it. If the alumni can't
understand this, it's not our faulty.
We have apologized, begged, sat in
and listened, been talked to and
reasoned out of (just like what is

going on in Dr. Pitzer's office
between he and the BSU right now)
for the better part of 400 years!
Stanford Not Committed
Stanford has not committed
itself to listening to its Black
People. The only moments when it
does are moments of crisis. First,
following the murder of Dr. Martin
L. King. Then, they "granted"
demands that have yet to be met.
Not even to a fair degree of
partiality. Then, after the twin
rallies held in this past February,
snowing us with the jargon of Time
Magazine ("Anti-Semitism" and all
the rest of that bullshit) until jarred
out of their lethargy by the
Bookstore incident.
It is symbolic that the Blacks
would attack, would throw on the
floors, Books. Books, books,
books, books, books, and more
books. That white boys would
swing from chandeliers, whooping
in ecstasy. That hundreds would
look on, the quiet stirrings of a new
knowledge coming in. It is the War
Babies who are here now. It is the
Children of those who destroyed
Hiroshima, Nagasaki, who
napalmed IndoChina and raped
Mother Africa, it is we who are here
now. And we are not about to be
silenced. Not here, not no where
else. It is for a greater freedom that
we push, not roses grown out of a
dead carcass.
