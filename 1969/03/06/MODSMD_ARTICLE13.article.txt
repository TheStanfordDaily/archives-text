# Caught In The Middle
## SDS Half-Truths 
### Thom as C. Dawson 
Lies, distortions and half-truths
are a typical product of Stanford
SDS rallies and yesterday was no
exception.
At least two points stressed by
speakers at the noon rally
yesterday are fallacious.
Two speakers, James Johnson
and English professor H. Bruce
Franklin, alleged that due process
was being denied the 29 students
given suspended suspensions. Due
process is being denied, they
argued, because the students are
subject to suspension without a
hearing if they are suspected of
taking part in any serious disorder
on campus.
This is an utter and complete
fabrication. The record can be set
straight by the following passage
from the Judicial Council's
decision with regard to the 29
students: "The Council takes the
position that if during the period of
probation any defendant carries
out such a threat ("to engage in
further serious acts of
disruption"), and is duly convicted
thereof, the University community
has the right to insist upon his

suspension" (Page 18, item 4 of the
decision).
I may be a simple-minded
moderate but my reading of the
phrase "and is duly convicted
thereof" is that the Council would
hold a complete set of hearings on
the new incident.
The second mis-statement of
fact I wish to comment on is an
allegation by Doren Weinberg, the
defendants' counsel. He said that
students were the only ones subject
to the jurisdiction of the Judicial
Council. This is simply untrue as
faculty are subject to the
jurisdiction of the Council. I do not
have chapter and verse to cite in
this case, but the Academic Senate
last Fall placed the faculty under
the jurisdiction of the Council.
I do not wish to engage in a
battle of charge and countercharge
with SDS, but I do wish they would
get at least easily demonstrable
facts straight. Think before feeling.
