## Stabilizing Reform 
### Bill Evers 
Last week, the Judicial Council
convicted some SDS members of
disrupting a Trustees' meeting. The
disruption had been an effort to
demonstrate against what SDS said
was Stanford Research Institute's
participation in current efforts to
maintain order in the outlying
Southeast Asia province of the
American empire.
America does not have a formal
colonial arrangement in Asia. But
the U.S. government has granted
big business a privileged and
protected status in the area by
guarding the "open doors" and
subsidizing business efforts.
American hegemony is
preserved through link-ups with
local elites, often feudal remnants.
The old order of status and
privilege is fertilized with
American aid in order to stabilize
conditions. As a final quarantee the
whole scheme of neo-mercantilism
is policed by the U.S. armed forces,
which can step in where necessary
and short circuit social revolution.
Recently, here on the Stanford
campus, a liberal-radical coalition
has emerged. Its proclaimed
purpose is to channel SRl's work
toward "creative and humane
goals." The coalition seems to have
a single-issue focus on
chemical-biological warfare and
cou n ter in surge nc y.
On the other hand, numerous
people at SDS meetings have
pointed out that it wasn't just the
"evil work" being done by SRI
which SDS should oppose. With
good intentions and for
humanitarian reasons, the men at
SRI are working to preserve
America's informal empire.
SRI projects in Southeast Asia
serve to stabilize America's
dominion by suggesting needed
reforms and offering development
plans. Reforming the procedures of
a welfare system is an important
part of the theory and practice of
benevolent despotism.
Stanford's Judicial Council,
which recently convicted SDS
members, is an example of the
farming out by top leadership of
the problems of internal
administration. (Can you image the
Trustees feeling compelled to
answer a subpoena from this

community judicial body?) In like
manner, the U.S. government and
its favored international
corporations maintain hegemony
partly through SRI, which watches
for signs of disturbances and
specializes in "Problem solving."
The reforms of Stanford's
judicial system have made it more
humanitarian, more equitable. But
it still enforces law and keeps order
for the Trustees.
Stanford humanitarians have
joined VISTA and the Peace Corps
in droves in the hope of reforming
world conditions. They have
thereby directly aided the
operation of America's domestic
and overseas colonial system. While
the U.S. government and
corporations are maintaining the
existing social and political order,
America's idealistic youth are
keeping the natives happy.
In the case of the new SRI
Coalition, will humanitarian
concerns lead to a perpetuation of
a reformed SRI? As with the
reformed Judicial Council, a
reformed SRI will continue to
serve the interests of America's
corporate-liberal system.

the problems of internal
administration. (Can you image the
Trustees feeling compelled to
answer a subpoena from this

community judicial body?) In like
manner, the U.S. government and
its favored international
corporations maintain hegemony
partly through SRI, which watches
for signs of disturbances and
specializes in "Problem solving."
The reforms of Stanford's
judicial system have made it more
humanitarian, more equitable. But
it still enforces law and keeps order
for the Trustees.
Stanford humanitarians have
joined VISTA and the Peace Corps
in droves in the hope of reforming
world conditions. They have
thereby directly aided the
operation of America's domestic
and overseas colonial system. While
the U.S. government and
corporations are maintaining the
existing social and political order,
America's idealistic youth are
keeping the natives happy.
In the case of the new SRI
Coalition, will humanitarian
concerns lead to a perpetuation of
a reformed SRI? As with the
reformed Judicial Council, a
reformed SRI will continue to
serve the interests of America's
corporate-liberal system.

Last week, the Judicial Council
convicted some SDS members of
disrupting a Trustees' meeting. The
disruption had been an effort to
demonstrate against what SDS said
was Stanford Research Institute's
participation in current efforts to
maintain order in the outlying
Southeast Asia province of the
American empire.
America does not have a formal
colonial arrangement in Asia. But
the U.S. government has granted
big business a privileged and
protected status in the area by
guarding the "open doors" and
subsidizing business efforts.
American hegemony is
preserved through link-ups with
local elites, often feudal remnants.
The old order of status and
privilege is fertilized with
American aid in order to stabilize
conditions. As a final quarantee the
whole scheme of neo-mercantilism
is policed by the U.S. armed forces,
which can step in where necessary
and short circuit social revolution.
Recently, here on the Stanford
campus, a liberal-radical coalition
has emerged. Its proclaimed
purpose is to channel SRl's work
toward "creative and humane
goals." The coalition seems to have
a single-issue focus on
chemical-biological warfare and
cou n ter in surge nc y.
On the other hand, numerous
people at SDS meetings have
pointed out that it wasn't just the
"evil work" being done by SRI
which SDS should oppose. With
good intentions and for
humanitarian reasons, the men at
SRI are working to preserve
America's informal empire.
SRI projects in Southeast Asia
serve to stabilize America's
dominion by suggesting needed
reforms and offering development
plans. Reforming the procedures of
a welfare system is an important
part of the theory and practice of
benevolent despotism.

which recently convicted SDS
members, is an example of the
