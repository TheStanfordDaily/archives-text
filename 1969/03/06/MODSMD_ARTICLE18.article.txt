# Lambda Nu Votes To End Selectivity
## 
### 
Lambda Nu Fraternity voted
Monday night to drop selectivity,
maintain a co-educational
residence and to negotiate with the
Dean's Office of the details of the
draw mechanism to be instituted
next year.
By a vote of 21 to 6, the active
male members of Lambda Nu
Fraternity at a house meeting
voted to become "indefinitely
co-ed" and to maintain the
fraternity's independent status
apart from the university residence
system.
In short, Lambda Nu would be
handling its own draw, but it would
be on a non-selective basis.
When informed of the result of
Lambda Nu's vote, Dean of
Students, Joel Smith, said, "I am
very pleased with the progress at
Lambda Nu this year and with the
decision to go ahead as a
co-educational house. This
decision establishes an attractive
new model for residences at
Stanford."
No Exact Specifications
No exact specifications have
been set down so far to determine
how Lambda Nu's draw
mechanism will work next year.
The Dean of Students' Office has
to approve the move, but several
conferences have already prepared
them for the results of Monday

night's vote. There is no general
feeling at the fraternity that the
resolution will get much, if any,
opposition from the Dean's Office.
Carl Cruetz, Lambda Nu's
House President, noted, "We plan
to have our own rush program. We
hope to operate the draw
mechanism on the basis of people
who come up to the house and
express an interest in the house."
According to Cruetz, the Dean's
Office is aware of the fact that
Lambda Nu was planning to go
co-ed and to run its own draw. The
precise mechanism of the draw
remains to be worked out.
Option To Return
Cruetz went on to explain what
the phrase "indefinitely co-ed"
means. "Lambda Nu has the option
to go back to being an all male
fraternity any time it wants to.
Such a move would require the
support of two-thirds of the active
members present at a house
meeting. Some girls would have to
support the move in the future if it
ever came to a vote."
People interested in drawing
into Lambda Nu next year would
be asked to come up to the house
and become acquainted with the
members. Perspective members
could leave their names with the
House President.

how Lambda Nu's draw
mechanism will work next year.
The Dean of Students' Office has
to approve the move, but several
conferences have already prepared
them for the results of Monday

night's vote. There is no general
feeling at the fraternity that the
resolution will get much, if any,
opposition from the Dean's Office.
Carl Cruetz, Lambda Nu's
House President, noted, "We plan
to have our own rush program. We
hope to operate the draw
mechanism on the basis of people
who come up to the house and
express an interest in the house."
According to Cruetz, the Dean's
Office is aware of the fact that
Lambda Nu was planning to go
co-ed and to run its own draw. The
precise mechanism of the draw
remains to be worked out.
Option To Return
Cruetz went on to explain what
the phrase "indefinitely co-ed"
means. "Lambda Nu has the option
to go back to being an all male
fraternity any time it wants to.
Such a move would require the
support of two-thirds of the active
members present at a house
meeting. Some girls would have to
support the move in the future if it
ever came to a vote."
People interested in drawing
into Lambda Nu next year would
be asked to come up to the house
and become acquainted with the
members. Perspective members
could leave their names with the
House President.
