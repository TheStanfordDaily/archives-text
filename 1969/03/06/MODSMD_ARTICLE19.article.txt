# ABM System Hit By Cohelan, Others
## 
### 
Congressman Jeffrey Cohelan
of Berkeley repeated his
opposition to the anti-ballistic
missile (ABM) program here
Tuesday night and asked his
audience of 1200 scientists,
engineers and students to make
their opposition to ABM known to
President Nixon.
"The ABM program was
approved last year," Cohelan told
the student-organized "March
Fourth Convocation: Science and
Society" gathering in MemoriaL
Church. "The money is there, ana
the program would be going ahead
now if the President hadn't decided
to reconsider it.
"Only the President can stop it
now, and his decision is expected
next week. I hope as a result of this
great convocation you will make
your views known to him."
Prof. Martin Perl of the
Stanford Linear Accelerator
Center (SLAC), another evening
speaker, also condemned the ABM
program as ill-advised.
Despite Opposition
"The ABM system was
approved in spite of almost
unanimous opposition by scientific
advisers," he declared, "and the
introduction of the multiple
reentry warheads on nuclear
missiles is perhaps only a few
monthsaway."
Student organizers of the
convocation circulated an
anti-ABM petition among the
audience and obtained 338
signatures. The petition declares
the signers, members of the "Palo
A 1 to-S t a n 112 or d scientific
community," are opposed to
"unproductive and unnecessary
military expenditures" and to the
Sentinel ABM system in particular.
Copies of the petition will be
sent to President Nixon and his
science adviser, Dr. Lee Dubridge,
as well as to Defense Secretary
Laird, California senators and
congressmen, and to members of
appropriate Senate and House
committees urging them to "direct
(their) energies against deployment
of the ABM system."
Advisory Committee Needed
At an evening panel discussion,
Cohelan said Congress needs its
own science advisory committee so
that it can properly evaluate new
weapons systems. A member of the
House Armed Forces Committee
and former professor of economics
at U.C., he called the ABM "a
disaster in terms of present
strategic forces" upsetting the
delicate balance of great power
deterrence capability.
The real values behind the fuss
over the ABM, the congressman
said, are moral and philosophical.
"Do we want to launch a new
escalation in the arms race? Do we
need to spend $3 to $400 billion
(cq) on this kind of weapon? Are
we sure it will work? Are we even

sure it is needed?" Cohelan asked
the audience.
"And,"he added, "the ABM is
not the only weapons system under
consideration. Wait till you see
what we've got in the pipeline!"
Missile History Reviewed
Dr. James Stone, visiting scholar
in economics and former Stanford
Research Institute staff member,
reviewed the history of America's
ballistic missile system and
suggested the ABM was being
pushed on the public by a coalition
of aero-space industry firms with
the encouragement of the Defense
Department. "We've got a
juggernaut going," he said.
He said he espoused the
"crackpot theory of history" in
which attack from a totally
unexpected source of angle
destroys "the lines of force along
which everything operates." He
urged the scientists and members
of the audience to fight the ABM
by doing some hard thinking about
how to do it.
"Pick your fights, then hit 'em
from the blind side," he urged.
Floor sentiment at the panel
discussion was obviously
anti-ABM. One speaker described
the project as "not relevant to the
real world to keep devising things
to blast people off the planet."
