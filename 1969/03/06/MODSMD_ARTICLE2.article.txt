# Legislature Will Not Meet On Proposed Constitution
## 
### DAVID DAVENPORT 
The Stanford student legislature
(LASSU) will not meet this evening,
according to Speaker Yale Braunstein.
Nor is it scheduled to hold any sessions
until the first Thursday of the Spring
Quarter.
To some legislators, this means that
Denis Hayes, in accordance with his
threat issued last week, will be resigning
as president of the Associated Students.
To others, it holds no such connotations.
At last week's LASSU meeting, Hayes
presented a new constitution, his second
of this year, which he wanted LASSU to
submit to the student body for approval.
His plan called for a card to be placed
in each student's registration packet for
Spring Quarter. As the student filled out
his other registration material, he would
be asked to vote "yes" or "no" on the
new constitution.
LASSU Reps Disagreed
Many of the LASSU representatives,
however, felt that it was not desirable to
place the issue in registration packets.
Among other problems, many students
would probably not have had an
opportunity to read the new proposal.

After some discussion, the legislature
determined to table the issue until a later
meeting.
It was at that point that Denis Hayes
delivered his resignation threat. He told
the legislature that he was about to leave
for a trip to the East Coast and would be
returning in a week. If the legislature had
not acted on the bill when he returned, he
planned to submit his resignation.
Meaning Questioned
Many LASSU representatives
understood Hayes to say that if the issue
was still on the table, or in a
constitutional committee when he
returned, that he would immediately
resign. The issue is currently on the table,
and in constitutional committee. With no
LASSU meeting until Spring Quarter,
Hayes will likely find the bill in the same
situation when he returns.
However, other LASSU members
perceived Hayes comment to be that he
would resign if some action had not been
taken when he returned, without
specifying what the action was to be.
Yale Braunstein, Speaker of the

legislature, pointed out that action is
currently being taken: the constitution
has been sent to LASSU members, copies
will be available for all students, and
comments from the student body at large
will be solicited. According to
Braunstein, this action might be
sufficient for Hayes to remain.
