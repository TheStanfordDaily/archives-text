# Pitzer's Response To Right
## 
### 
(Editor's Note: The following is the
text of an open letter from President
Kenneth S. Pitzer to the Stanford
Community in response to the seven
requests made by the Community of
the Right. A story on die reply appeared
in yesterday's DAILY.)
To Members of the Stanford
Community:
On February 17, 1969, a group
of students called the "Community
of the Right" presented seven
proposals for my consideration.
These recommendations were
brought to Associate Dean, of
Students Willard Wyman, who was
asked to pass them on to me and
my administration for careful
review. It is refreshing that these
matters were presented as
proposals, not demands. I will most
certainly address myself
conscientiously to these and all
other serious concerns of students
on this campus.
I have offered to meet with
representatives of the
"Community of the Right" to
discuss the entire list of proposals
in more detail if they so desire.
Much in these recommendations
deserves our immediate attention,
and I would like to respond briefly
now.
1. We urge the adoption of a
firm policy which would
deny the use of University
facilities to any student
organization or group of
individuals that employs
violence and force as tactics
for change in the academic
community.
I agree that violence and force
cannot be countenanced as tactics
for change in a university
community. The Student Conduct
Legislative Council now has the
authority to promulgate legislation
regarding "... such non-academic
conduct as may warrant
disciplinary sanctions against
individual students or against
membership organizations of
students." I shall forward this
proposal to the Council for
consideration at their earliest
convenience.
2. We urge that the
University administration
take action to suspend any
student who interferes with
or disrupts the proceedings
of the Stanford Judicial
Council.
As the Legislative and Judicial
Charter makes clear, "The
Chairman of the Stanford Judicial
Council has absolute authority to
control the conduct of persons in
the Council chambers." (Article 11,
section G,l) In a recent decision
the S.J.C. stated, "Furthermore,
the Council serves warning on
those who would disrupt future
proceedings that the Council is
disposed to find in contempt
persons who engage in disruption
of its proceedings and to
recommend immediate imposition
of severe sanctions." If the
Chairman or the full Council judges
that the behavior of a student
warrants suspension and
recommends such action to me, I
am prepared to act on that
recommendation.
3. We ask that you take
immediate action to redress
the deplorable imbalance of
political and philosophic
perspectives in the various

departments of the
Humanities and Sciences
division. We ask that you
enlist the services of
conservative and moderate
students in the recruitment
of conservative professors to
fill departmental vacancies.
We fully anticipate that by
Fall Quarter of this year
there will be a substantial
increase in the number of
conservative faculty
members at Stanford.
Faculty appointments in the
School of Humanities and Sciences
are initiated by a specific
department or—in the case of a
position which concerns more than
one department—by a special
search committee. The criterion
for each appointment is the
distinction of a candidate in his
field, including his ability as a
teacher, his capacity in research or
other creative work, his suitability
for the particular position. Always
an effort is made to see that no
extraneous matter —such as a
candidate's political
stance—influences the decision. If
there are political imbalances in
certain departments or schools it is
because such a balance reflects the
political persuasions of the most
distinguished men in the field, not
because of the hiring practice of
that particular department or
school.
4. We strongly urge that the
Reserve Officer Training
Program be retained at
Stanford and given full
academic credit for those
courses which merit it.
Although the Senate of the
Academic Council has voted to
remove credit from Reserve Officer
Training Corps courses at Stanford,
a student referendum has called for
the continuation of ROTC at
Stanford with credit for "those
parts of the program that are of
genuine academic interest." Also,
the Senate action has been
appealed; hence, there will be a
vote by the entire. Academic
Council on this matter. After the
vote of the Academic Council I
expect that there will be
discussions with the Defense
Department concerning possible
modifications in the program and
that a new committee will make
recommendations concerning the
proper role of ROTC at Stanford.
5. We urge that you appoint
a committee composed of
administrators and students
to revise the present
selection system for
freshman sponsors.
A variety of questions are being
raised about the sponsor system,
including the method by which
they are selected, i have appointed
a committee —composed of faculty
as well as administrators and
students—to look into these
questions and other residential
problems. The committee's

recommendations will have much
to do with the residence program
for 1969-70.
6. We ask that the
University administration
provide the Community of
the Right with adequate
on-campus office space for
the use of the Young
Republicans, Project HELP,
the Young Americans for
Freedom and the editorial
staff on the Arena.
Representatives of these groups
have already begun negotiations
with both Alan Grundmann
(Provost's Office) and Donald Price
(Humanities and Sciences), who
are responsible for the assignment
of space in University buildings.
Space is provided to student
groups, after a demonstration of
need, on a first-come, first-serve
basis. I understand that some
locations have already been
suggested for the use of these
groups, and I trust that a solution
of this problem is already in sight.
7. We ask that you remain
constantly aware of the
Stanford student body's
opposition, as expressed
through referendums and
petitions, to use of force and
coercion by extremist groups
on this campus. We urge you
to continue working towards
the achievement of a truly
free academic community
and we ask that you reject all
those demands which would
compromise the academic
freedom of others.
The student body's expression
of opposition to coercive and
disruptive tactics is an encouraging
and welcome development in this
troubled area. All of us who are
devoted to maintaining an open
and free academic community
must join together and make clear
our opposition to those who would
destroy that freedom. I am sure we
ail agree that Stanford, as one of
society's principal intellectual
guardians, should provide a forum
for the most critical evaluation of
problems and for the expression of
different viewpoints. And it is
fitting that during this time of
widespread dissatisfaction with the
course of human events almost
everywhere in the world dissent is
exercised more vigorously than it
has been at any time in our history.
But no matter how deeply some
feel their position to be the right
one, we must make sure that they
are not allowed to limit the
freedom of others. I pledge to do
everything in my power to ensure
that our University remains free for
serious debate and dissent and at
the same time fulfills its
fundamental obligation to
scholarship and the
communication of knowledge. I
urge all other members of the
Stanford community to join me in
this effort.

political and philosophic
perspectives in the various

departments of the
Humanities and Sciences
division. We ask that you
enlist the services of
conservative and moderate
students in the recruitment
of conservative professors to
fill departmental vacancies.
We fully anticipate that by
Fall Quarter of this year
there will be a substantial
increase in the number of
conservative faculty
members at Stanford.
Faculty appointments in the
School of Humanities and Sciences
are initiated by a specific
department or—in the case of a
position which concerns more than
one department—by a special
search committee. The criterion
for each appointment is the
distinction of a candidate in his
field, including his ability as a
teacher, his capacity in research or
other creative work, his suitability
for the particular position. Always
an effort is made to see that no
extraneous matter —such as a
candidate's political
stance—influences the decision. If
there are political imbalances in
certain departments or schools it is
because such a balance reflects the
political persuasions of the most
distinguished men in the field, not
because of the hiring practice of
that particular department or
school.
4. We strongly urge that the
Reserve Officer Training
Program be retained at
Stanford and given full
academic credit for those
courses which merit it.
Although the Senate of the
Academic Council has voted to
remove credit from Reserve Officer
Training Corps courses at Stanford,
a student referendum has called for
the continuation of ROTC at
Stanford with credit for "those
parts of the program that are of
genuine academic interest." Also,
the Senate action has been
appealed; hence, there will be a
vote by the entire. Academic
Council on this matter. After the
vote of the Academic Council I
expect that there will be
discussions with the Defense
Department concerning possible
modifications in the program and
that a new committee will make
recommendations concerning the
proper role of ROTC at Stanford.
5. We urge that you appoint
a committee composed of
administrators and students
to revise the present
selection system for
freshman sponsors.
A variety of questions are being
raised about the sponsor system,
including the method by which
they are selected, i have appointed
a committee —composed of faculty
as well as administrators and
students—to look into these
questions and other residential
problems. The committee's

recommendations will have much
to do with the residence program
for 1969-70.
6. We ask that the
University administration
provide the Community of
the Right with adequate
on-campus office space for
the use of the Young
Republicans, Project HELP,
the Young Americans for
Freedom and the editorial
staff on the Arena.
Representatives of these groups
have already begun negotiations
with both Alan Grundmann
(Provost's Office) and Donald Price
(Humanities and Sciences), who
are responsible for the assignment
of space in University buildings.
Space is provided to student
groups, after a demonstration of
need, on a first-come, first-serve
basis. I understand that some
locations have already been
suggested for the use of these
groups, and I trust that a solution
of this problem is already in sight.
7. We ask that you remain
constantly aware of the
Stanford student body's
opposition, as expressed
through referendums and
petitions, to use of force and
coercion by extremist groups
on this campus. We urge you
to continue working towards
the achievement of a truly
free academic community
and we ask that you reject all
those demands which would
compromise the academic
freedom of others.
The student body's expression
of opposition to coercive and
disruptive tactics is an encouraging
and welcome development in this
troubled area. All of us who are
devoted to maintaining an open
and free academic community
must join together and make clear
our opposition to those who would
destroy that freedom. I am sure we
ail agree that Stanford, as one of
society's principal intellectual
guardians, should provide a forum
for the most critical evaluation of
problems and for the expression of
different viewpoints. And it is
fitting that during this time of
widespread dissatisfaction with the
course of human events almost
everywhere in the world dissent is
exercised more vigorously than it
has been at any time in our history.
But no matter how deeply some
feel their position to be the right
one, we must make sure that they
are not allowed to limit the
freedom of others. I pledge to do
everything in my power to ensure
that our University remains free for
serious debate and dissent and at
the same time fulfills its
fundamental obligation to
scholarship and the
communication of knowledge. I
urge all other members of the
Stanford community to join me in
this effort.

text of an open letter from President
Kenneth S. Pitzer to the Stanford
Community in response to the seven
requests made by the Community of
the Right. A story on die reply appeared
in yesterday's DAILY.)
To Members of the Stanford
Community:
On February 17, 1969, a group
of students called the "Community
of the Right" presented seven
proposals for my consideration.
These recommendations were
brought to Associate Dean, of
Students Willard Wyman, who was
asked to pass them on to me and
my administration for careful
review. It is refreshing that these
matters were presented as
proposals, not demands. I will most
certainly address myself
conscientiously to these and all
other serious concerns of students
on this campus.
I have offered to meet with
representatives of the
"Community of the Right" to
discuss the entire list of proposals
in more detail if they so desire.
Much in these recommendations
deserves our immediate attention,
and I would like to respond briefly
now.
1. We urge the adoption of a
firm policy which would
deny the use of University
facilities to any student
organization or group of
individuals that employs
violence and force as tactics
for change in the academic
community.
I agree that violence and force
cannot be countenanced as tactics
for change in a university
community. The Student Conduct
Legislative Council now has the
authority to promulgate legislation
regarding "... such non-academic
conduct as may warrant
disciplinary sanctions against
individual students or against
membership organizations of
students." I shall forward this
proposal to the Council for
consideration at their earliest
convenience.
2. We urge that the
University administration
take action to suspend any
student who interferes with
or disrupts the proceedings
of the Stanford Judicial
Council.
As the Legislative and Judicial
Charter makes clear, "The
Chairman of the Stanford Judicial
Council has absolute authority to
control the conduct of persons in
the Council chambers." (Article 11,
section G,l) In a recent decision
the S.J.C. stated, "Furthermore,
the Council serves warning on
those who would disrupt future
proceedings that the Council is
disposed to find in contempt
persons who engage in disruption
of its proceedings and to
recommend immediate imposition
of severe sanctions." If the
Chairman or the full Council judges
that the behavior of a student
warrants suspension and
recommends such action to me, I
am prepared to act on that
recommendation.
3. We ask that you take
immediate action to redress
the deplorable imbalance of
political and philosophic
perspectives in the various

departments of the
Humanities and Sciences
division. We ask that you

Freedom and the editorial
staff on the Arena.
Representatives of these groups
have already begun negotiations
with both Alan Grundmann
(Provost's Office) and Donald Price
(Humanities and Sciences), who
are responsible for the assignment
of space in University buildings.
Space is provided to student
groups, after a demonstration of
need, on a first-come, first-serve
basis. I understand that some
locations have already been
suggested for the use of these
groups, and I trust that a solution
of this problem is already in sight.
7. We ask that you remain
constantly aware of the
Stanford student body's
opposition, as expressed
through referendums and
petitions, to use of force and
coercion by extremist groups
on this campus. We urge you
to continue working towards
the achievement of a truly
free academic community
and we ask that you reject all
those demands which would
compromise the academic
freedom of others.
The student body's expression
of opposition to coercive and
disruptive tactics is an encouraging
and welcome development in this
troubled area. All of us who are
devoted to maintaining an open
and free academic community
must join together and make clear
our opposition to those who would
destroy that freedom. I am sure we
ail agree that Stanford, as one of
society's principal intellectual
guardians, should provide a forum
for the most critical evaluation of
problems and for the expression of
different viewpoints. And it is
fitting that during this time of
widespread dissatisfaction with the
course of human events almost
everywhere in the world dissent is
exercised more vigorously than it
has been at any time in our history.
But no matter how deeply some
feel their position to be the right
one, we must make sure that they
are not allowed to limit the
freedom of others. I pledge to do
everything in my power to ensure
that our University remains free for
serious debate and dissent and at
the same time fulfills its
fundamental obligation to
scholarship and the
communication of knowledge. I
urge all other members of the
Stanford community to join me in
this effort.

(Editor's Note: The following is the
text of an open letter from President
Kenneth S. Pitzer to the Stanford
Community in response to the seven
requests made by the Community of
the Right. A story on die reply appeared
in yesterday's DAILY.)
To Members of the Stanford
Community:
On February 17, 1969, a group
of students called the "Community
of the Right" presented seven
proposals for my consideration.
These recommendations were
brought to Associate Dean, of
Students Willard Wyman, who was
asked to pass them on to me and
my administration for careful
review. It is refreshing that these
matters were presented as
proposals, not demands. I will most
certainly address myself
conscientiously to these and all
other serious concerns of students
on this campus.
I have offered to meet with
representatives of the
"Community of the Right" to
discuss the entire list of proposals
in more detail if they so desire.
Much in these recommendations
deserves our immediate attention,
and I would like to respond briefly
now.
1. We urge the adoption of a
firm policy which would
deny the use of University
facilities to any student
organization or group of
individuals that employs
violence and force as tactics
for change in the academic
community.
I agree that violence and force
cannot be countenanced as tactics
for change in a university
community. The Student Conduct
Legislative Council now has the
authority to promulgate legislation
regarding "... such non-academic
conduct as may warrant
disciplinary sanctions against
individual students or against
membership organizations of
students." I shall forward this
proposal to the Council for
consideration at their earliest
convenience.
2. We urge that the
University administration
take action to suspend any
student who interferes with
or disrupts the proceedings
of the Stanford Judicial
Council.
As the Legislative and Judicial
Charter makes clear, "The
Chairman of the Stanford Judicial
Council has absolute authority to
control the conduct of persons in
the Council chambers." (Article 11,
section G,l) In a recent decision
the S.J.C. stated, "Furthermore,
the Council serves warning on
those who would disrupt future
proceedings that the Council is
disposed to find in contempt
persons who engage in disruption
of its proceedings and to
recommend immediate imposition
of severe sanctions." If the
Chairman or the full Council judges
that the behavior of a student
warrants suspension and
recommends such action to me, I
am prepared to act on that
recommendation.
3. We ask that you take
immediate action to redress
the deplorable imbalance of
political and philosophic
perspectives in the various

departments of the
Humanities and Sciences
division. We ask that you
enlist the services of
conservative and moderate
students in the recruitment
of conservative professors to
fill departmental vacancies.
We fully anticipate that by
Fall Quarter of this year
there will be a substantial
increase in the number of
conservative faculty
members at Stanford.
Faculty appointments in the
School of Humanities and Sciences
are initiated by a specific
department or—in the case of a
position which concerns more than
one department—by a special
search committee. The criterion
for each appointment is the
distinction of a candidate in his
field, including his ability as a
teacher, his capacity in research or
other creative work, his suitability
for the particular position. Always
an effort is made to see that no
extraneous matter —such as a
candidate's political
stance—influences the decision. If
there are political imbalances in
certain departments or schools it is
because such a balance reflects the
political persuasions of the most
distinguished men in the field, not
because of the hiring practice of
that particular department or
school.
4. We strongly urge that the
Reserve Officer Training
Program be retained at
Stanford and given full
academic credit for those
courses which merit it.
Although the Senate of the
Academic Council has voted to
remove credit from Reserve Officer
Training Corps courses at Stanford,
a student referendum has called for
the continuation of ROTC at
Stanford with credit for "those
parts of the program that are of
genuine academic interest." Also,
the Senate action has been
appealed; hence, there will be a
vote by the entire. Academic
Council on this matter. After the
vote of the Academic Council I
expect that there will be
discussions with the Defense
Department concerning possible
modifications in the program and
that a new committee will make
recommendations concerning the
proper role of ROTC at Stanford.
5. We urge that you appoint
a committee composed of
administrators and students
to revise the present
selection system for
freshman sponsors.
A variety of questions are being
raised about the sponsor system,
including the method by which
they are selected, i have appointed
a committee —composed of faculty
as well as administrators and
students—to look into these
questions and other residential
problems. The committee's

recommendations will have much
to do with the residence program
for 1969-70.
6. We ask that the
University administration
provide the Community of
the Right with adequate
on-campus office space for
the use of the Young
Republicans, Project HELP,
the Young Americans for
Freedom and the editorial
staff on the Arena.
Representatives of these groups
have already begun negotiations
with both Alan Grundmann
(Provost's Office) and Donald Price
(Humanities and Sciences), who

Students Willard Wyman, who was
asked to pass them on to me and
my administration for careful
review. It is refreshing that these
matters were presented as
proposals, not demands. I will most
certainly address myself
conscientiously to these and all
other serious concerns of students
on this campus.
I have offered to meet with
representatives of the
"Community of the Right" to
discuss the entire list of proposals
in more detail if they so desire.
Much in these recommendations
deserves our immediate attention,
and I would like to respond briefly
now.
1. We urge the adoption of a
firm policy which would
deny the use of University
facilities to any student
organization or group of
individuals that employs
violence and force as tactics
for change in the academic
community.
I agree that violence and force
cannot be countenanced as tactics
for change in a university
community. The Student Conduct
Legislative Council now has the
authority to promulgate legislation
regarding "... such non-academic
conduct as may warrant
disciplinary sanctions against
individual students or against
membership organizations of
students." I shall forward this
proposal to the Council for
consideration at their earliest
convenience.
2. We urge that the
University administration
take action to suspend any
student who interferes with
or disrupts the proceedings
of the Stanford Judicial
Council.
As the Legislative and Judicial
Charter makes clear, "The
Chairman of the Stanford Judicial
Council has absolute authority to
control the conduct of persons in
the Council chambers." (Article 11,
section G,l) In a recent decision
the S.J.C. stated, "Furthermore,
the Council serves warning on
those who would disrupt future
proceedings that the Council is
disposed to find in contempt
persons who engage in disruption
of its proceedings and to
recommend immediate imposition
of severe sanctions." If the
Chairman or the full Council judges
that the behavior of a student
warrants suspension and
recommends such action to me, I
am prepared to act on that
recommendation.
3. We ask that you take
immediate action to redress
the deplorable imbalance of
political and philosophic
perspectives in the various

departments of the
Humanities and Sciences
division. We ask that you
enlist the services of
conservative and moderate
students in the recruitment
of conservative professors to
fill departmental vacancies.
We fully anticipate that by
Fall Quarter of this year
there will be a substantial
increase in the number of
conservative faculty
members at Stanford.
Faculty appointments in the
School of Humanities and Sciences
are initiated by a specific
department or—in the case of a
position which concerns more than
one department—by a special
search committee. The criterion
for each appointment is the
distinction of a candidate in his
field, including his ability as a
teacher, his capacity in research or
other creative work, his suitability
for the particular position. Always
an effort is made to see that no
extraneous matter —such as a
candidate's political
stance—influences the decision. If
there are political imbalances in
certain departments or schools it is
because such a balance reflects the
political persuasions of the most
distinguished men in the field, not
because of the hiring practice of
that particular department or
school.
4. We strongly urge that the
Reserve Officer Training
Program be retained at
Stanford and given full
academic credit for those
courses which merit it.
Although the Senate of the
Academic Council has voted to
remove credit from Reserve Officer
Training Corps courses at Stanford,
a student referendum has called for
the continuation of ROTC at
Stanford with credit for "those
parts of the program that are of
genuine academic interest." Also,
the Senate action has been
appealed; hence, there will be a
vote by the entire. Academic
Council on this matter. After the
vote of the Academic Council I
expect that there will be
discussions with the Defense
Department concerning possible
modifications in the program and
that a new committee will make
recommendations concerning the
proper role of ROTC at Stanford.
5. We urge that you appoint
a committee composed of
administrators and students
to revise the present
selection system for
freshman sponsors.
A variety of questions are being
raised about the sponsor system,
including the method by which
they are selected, i have appointed
a committee —composed of faculty
as well as administrators and
students—to look into these
questions and other residential
problems. The committee's

recommendations will have much
to do with the residence program
for 1969-70.
6. We ask that the
University administration
provide the Community of
the Right with adequate
on-campus office space for
the use of the Young
Republicans, Project HELP,
the Young Americans for
Freedom and the editorial
staff on the Arena.
Representatives of these groups
have already begun negotiations
with both Alan Grundmann
(Provost's Office) and Donald Price
(Humanities and Sciences), who
are responsible for the assignment
of space in University buildings.
Space is provided to student
groups, after a demonstration of
need, on a first-come, first-serve
basis. I understand that some
locations have already been
suggested for the use of these
groups, and I trust that a solution
of this problem is already in sight.
7. We ask that you remain
constantly aware of the
Stanford student body's
opposition, as expressed
through referendums and
petitions, to use of force and
coercion by extremist groups
on this campus. We urge you
to continue working towards
the achievement of a truly
free academic community
and we ask that you reject all
those demands which would
compromise the academic
freedom of others.
The student body's expression
of opposition to coercive and
disruptive tactics is an encouraging
and welcome development in this
troubled area. All of us who are
devoted to maintaining an open
and free academic community
must join together and make clear
our opposition to those who would
destroy that freedom. I am sure we
ail agree that Stanford, as one of
society's principal intellectual
guardians, should provide a forum
for the most critical evaluation of
problems and for the expression of
different viewpoints. And it is
fitting that during this time of
widespread dissatisfaction with the
course of human events almost
everywhere in the world dissent is
exercised more vigorously than it
has been at any time in our history.
But no matter how deeply some
feel their position to be the right
one, we must make sure that they
are not allowed to limit the
freedom of others. I pledge to do
everything in my power to ensure
that our University remains free for
serious debate and dissent and at
the same time fulfills its
fundamental obligation to
scholarship and the
communication of knowledge. I
urge all other members of the
Stanford community to join me in
this effort.
