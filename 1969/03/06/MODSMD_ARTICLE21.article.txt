# Is California Slipping Away? |

### CLAIRE DARLEY 
bo you know the swim, ya belter
learn quick, Jiin.
If you don't know the swim, you
better sing the hymn.
Day after day more people come to
L.A.
Shh, don't ya tell anybody the
whole place is slipping away.
Where will we go when there's no
San Francisco?
Better get ready to tie up the boat
in Idaho.
This calypso song, played
regularly by local radio stations, is
a product of the earthquake scare
that has hit the West coast this
winter. An imminent earthquake,
predicted by seeresses and authors
of several recent books is not
viewed so lightly by some
Californians.
The Reverend Donald
Abernathy of a suburban Los
Angeles church convinced his
200-member congregation to move

to Atlanta, Georgia after he
received a vision that God was
going to punish California for its
sins by sending a giant earthquake
to sink the state into the ocean.
Stanford geologists receive calls
daily from citizens wondering if
they are going to slide into the sea.
"People must think there is a
deep void into which the state will
slide," stated Dr. Richard Jahns,
Dean of the School of Earth
Sciences during a recent interview.
"There's no such thing. It's
impossible for it to happen."
"An earthquake is a real
possibility any time," explains
Jahns. "California has a large
number of active faults. The San
Andreas is the grandaddy of them
all. It was the place of the 1906
quake and is the most likely
candidate for the next . . .But
when the earthquake will come is
anybody's guess."
Publicity Causes INervousness
Jahns attributed public
nervousness about earthquakes to
recent publicity. "One author of a
new book (not a geologist) predicts
a catestrophic earthquake. He is
convinced all of California west of
the San Andreas fault will slip
bodily into the ocean. It is just
frightening enough to be believable
to some people. Others just want
assurance that it won't happen."
One thoery of the causes of
earthquakes suggests that along a
fault, or deep crack in the earth's
crust, friction prevents the slow
slippage of land around a fault.
Instead, the land near the fault

bends elastically. Eventually the
bending stress exceeds the friction
and the land straightens out with a
quick snap causing an earthquake.
The San Andreas fault, which
extends 650 miles through
California, is a right lateral fault.
This means the land to the east of
the fault tends to move south
horizontally while that on the west
side moves north.
Slip Several Keel
In a large earthquake, the land
could slip several feet or twenty
feet, according to Jahns. "There
would be a lot of split level
structures never designed that
way."
"We can hope the quake will hit
when people are at home rather
than in auditoriums or driving. The
frame structure is the most
earthquake resistant. It bends and
moves, but it hangs together. Most
structures built after 1933 are
earthquake resistant." (This does
not include the geology building at
Stanford.)
In a great earthquake, with the
worst combination of secondary
circumstances, the damage could
be in the billions of dollars,"
speculated Jahns. Secondary
circumstances include fires and
explosions, a period of rains after
the quake leading to landslides, and
also the time when the quake
happens.
Highway of Jello
"If it happened during rush
hour traffic, The Bayshore would
be lurching. It would shake like
jello in a bowl. The road would
crack and the sections would
displace in relation to each other.
There would be temporary fissures.
Imagine just one car hitting a four
foot fissure at 60 miles an hour."
"There will probably be another
earthquake in our lifetime, but by
then we hope to have an hour or

two warning . . .A warning system
would have a tremendous impact in
reducing loss of life. With an hour's
warning, a good plan and education
of the public, the loss of life could
be cut to nearly zero. Without
these, the loss of life could be the
tens of thousands."
Work on earthquake prediction
is being done by Robert L. Kovach,
associate professor of geophysics at
Stanford.
Earthquake Prediction
'Earthquakes cannot yet be
predicted with complete
certainty," explains Kovach,
"because we don't fully
comprehend the mechanism that
produces them. However we
believe an earthquake is the
culmination of a series of events.
We can try and monitor these
steps."
Phenomena now being
monitored include horizontal and
verticle movement of the earth's
crust, tilt of the crust, local seismic
activity (micro earthquakes), and
magnetic field changes.
One way to observe movement
of land near a fault is to line up
concrete monuments on both sides
of the fault and survey between
them. By surveying it is possible to
tell if it is moving in some areas and
quiet in others. "We don't know
however, if the moving places or
the quiet places are the danger
areas."
Since 1965 Kovach has been
monitoring changes in the
magnetic field in the rocks along
the San Andreas fault at Hollister,
California. He explains, "Rocks are
weakly magnitized. This
magnetism is quite susceptible to
change. It is dependent on stress.
Prior to creep, or slippage, there is a
build up of stress. This perturbs the
magnetic field. This sequence
happens some tens of hours before
the creeping."
Another promising area is
earthquake control feels Kovach.
In Denver, Colorado, by accident
some radio active material escaped
into the ground. As a result, small
earthquakes began in an area where
there had been no history of them.
"We could drill holes near the
faults and put radio active material
into them." suggests Kovach. "The
effect would be a lot of little
earthquakes rather than one big
one."
In response to the recent
predictions of an April earthquake,
Kovach replied, "There is no
scientific basis for making this
specific a prediction. In California
it has been predicted that a major
earthquake will occur roughly
every 60 years. This is what led to
some of the recent predictions.
According to these calculations, we
are overdue for a large earthquake.
This may very well be, but there
were no records on earthquakes
before 1850 so the basis of the
prediction is a very limited
statistical sample."
He warned however that
Californians should be prepared for
the after effects of earthquakes by
arranging emergency supplies.
"Very few die as a direct cause of
an earthquake. It is the secondary
fires. If an earthquake came today,
there would be general
pandemonium.
