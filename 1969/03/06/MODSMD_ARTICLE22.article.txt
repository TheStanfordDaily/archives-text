# Special Minority Students Adjusting To Stanford Life
## 
### 
The 10 students are closely
related, yet never have met as a
group and probably never will.
What makes them noteworthy is
their participation in Stanford's
first experiment in special
admissions (over and above regular
admissions) of disadvantaged
students from minority groups.
Tutoring is available if
requested, but not forced upon
them. Only a few administrators
and students know these students'
identity—and then only on an
individual basis because of
counseling or tutoring.
Robert Anchondo, senior
political science major from El
Paso, directs the tutoring program
for James E. Simmons, assistant
provost for intergroup relations.
How are the students doing
after their first quarter as freshmen?
"In individual instances," says
Simmons, "better than some
students who meet normal
admissions standards."
Grade-Point Averages
"Their grade-point average at
the end of fall quarter," says
Anchondo, "varies from 2.8 to 1.3
(4.O=A). The one who made 2.8
took 17 units. They are motivated
and have drive. They want to do
something."

The 10 students (there were 11
but one left for personal reasons)
are part of a program, urged by the
Black Student Union last spring,
designed to increase minority
enrollment.
"They were chosen for their
university potential," says
Simmons, "despite academic
records which would make their
admission very doubtful. What our
interviewers looked for was a
strong desire to succeed, and
qualities such as imagination,
ingenuity, creativity, and potential
leadership—human strengths which
would provide a reasonable hope
the academic gap could be closed."
Anchondo adds that these are
students "who never would have
considered Stanford. And in this
new environment, they have
encountered personal problems,
but that's not surprising because it
happens to many freshmen."
TTie BSU also has a
book-loaning program, to help
with finances. Each of the 10 is
receiving financial assistance from
the University.
Anchondo's request to
department heads last fall for
recommendations on tutors drew
more than 50 names. The student
tutors are paid $2.75 an hour, but

some have volunteered to work
without pay. The average tutor
works three hours a day.
The tutoring program is "very
informal," says Anchondo,
"because these students feel more
comfortable that way. They're
very proud, and it's not easy for
them. They know they're starting
with an academic deficiency." Last
fall he urged the students, eight of
whom are black and two
Mexican-American, to let him
know if they ran into academic
trouble. By mid-term, some were
doing "better than expected," but
there were some Ds and Fs, mostly
in science. All but one accepted
tutoring assistance. Anchondo
does his best to match tutors and
students for personalities and
interests, as well as for academic
needs.
"Four of the students have
extra-curricular activities, mostly
in team sports," says Anchondo.
"One worked 20 hours a week, and
his grades were above average.
They have become very much a
part of the student body, and don't
feel at all alienated. What happened
to them in their first quarter is
what happens to many frosh. They
have to prove to themselves that
they can do it."

something."

The 10 students (there were 11
but one left for personal reasons)
are part of a program, urged by the
Black Student Union last spring,
designed to increase minority
enrollment.
"They were chosen for their
university potential," says
Simmons, "despite academic
records which would make their
admission very doubtful. What our
interviewers looked for was a
strong desire to succeed, and
qualities such as imagination,
ingenuity, creativity, and potential
leadership—human strengths which
would provide a reasonable hope
the academic gap could be closed."
Anchondo adds that these are
students "who never would have
considered Stanford. And in this
new environment, they have
encountered personal problems,
but that's not surprising because it
happens to many freshmen."
TTie BSU also has a
book-loaning program, to help
with finances. Each of the 10 is
receiving financial assistance from
the University.
Anchondo's request to
department heads last fall for
recommendations on tutors drew
more than 50 names. The student
tutors are paid $2.75 an hour, but

some have volunteered to work
without pay. The average tutor
works three hours a day.
The tutoring program is "very
informal," says Anchondo,
"because these students feel more
comfortable that way. They're
very proud, and it's not easy for
them. They know they're starting
with an academic deficiency." Last
fall he urged the students, eight of
whom are black and two
Mexican-American, to let him
know if they ran into academic
trouble. By mid-term, some were
doing "better than expected," but
there were some Ds and Fs, mostly
in science. All but one accepted
tutoring assistance. Anchondo
does his best to match tutors and
students for personalities and
interests, as well as for academic
needs.
"Four of the students have
extra-curricular activities, mostly
in team sports," says Anchondo.
"One worked 20 hours a week, and
his grades were above average.
They have become very much a
part of the student body, and don't
feel at all alienated. What happened
to them in their first quarter is
what happens to many frosh. They
have to prove to themselves that
they can do it."
The 10 students are closely
related, yet never have met as a
group and probably never will.
What makes them noteworthy is
their participation in Stanford's
first experiment in special
admissions (over and above regular
admissions) of disadvantaged
students from minority groups.
Tutoring is available if
requested, but not forced upon
them. Only a few administrators
and students know these students'
identity—and then only on an
individual basis because of
counseling or tutoring.
Robert Anchondo, senior
political science major from El
Paso, directs the tutoring program
for James E. Simmons, assistant
provost for intergroup relations.
How are the students doing
after their first quarter as freshmen?
"In individual instances," says
Simmons, "better than some
students who meet normal
admissions standards."
Grade-Point Averages
"Their grade-point average at
the end of fall quarter," says
Anchondo, "varies from 2.8 to 1.3
(4.O=A). The one who made 2.8
took 17 units. They are motivated
and have drive. They want to do
something."
