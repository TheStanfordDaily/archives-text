# C-15 Approves Hare System For Most Campus Elections

By SUSAN SWAIU)
The Committee of Fifteen
(C-15) has recommended the
adoption of the Hare System of
proportional representation in
most campus-wide elections.
Clarifying the phrase
"proportional representation", the
committee has passed the
following resolution:
"Wherever 'proportional
representation' appears in the
'Legislative and Judicial Charter of
1968', the phrase should be taken
to refer to the Hare System, as
applied in elections to the
Academic Senate."
The Hare System is a method of

preferential voting in which the
voter ranks a certain number of
candidates in the order of his
choice. The recent campus election
for members of the Student
Education Council was an example
of the Hare System voting method.
Clarifying Charter
The C-15 concerned itself with
clarifying the Legislative and
Judicial Charter on this point
because it is the committee's
responsibility to discuss changes in
university policy of concern to
faculty, administration and
students alike. The committee may
also recommend specific changes in
policy to the Academic Senate, the
administration and the student
body.
The C-15—as its name
indicates—is composed of 15
members: 5 students, 5 faculty and
5 administrators. The students are
selected by the Academic Senate
and the administrators by the
President.
The minutes of the C-15
meetings are kept secret, but the
final vote on resolutions is made
public.
J. Merrill Carlsmith, an associate
professor of psychology and a
member of the C-15, commented
on the resolution in an attempt to
clarify its purpose.
'Best Method'
"The Hare System is the best

method of voting for a number of
candidates from a mixed
constituency," Carlsmith
explained. "It was necessary to
clarify the wording of the Charter
because there area large number of
schemes of proportional
representation, and it wasn't clear
which one had been meant.
"The Hare System is the one
scheme that doesn't require the
existence of political parties, in
which no votes are wasted, in
which everyone's vote counts, in
which no potential manipulation
by organized pressure groups is
possible and in which there is a fair
expression of the will of the
people."
Carlsmith went on to discuss the
history of the Hare System. Its
principal advocate in the past was
John Stuart Mill. The system has
been used in some locations in the
United States, but becuase it
"works too well, it has been
discarded in many places."
New York City discarded the
system in 1947. The system in New
York had worked too well,
apparently: in 1945 some
communists had been elected to
the city government, and this
election didn't settle very well with
the members of Tammany Hall.
The result of the group's
dissatisfaction was the death of the
Hare System in New York City.
