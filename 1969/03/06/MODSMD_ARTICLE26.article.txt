# USC Favored
## Indians Eye Pac-8 Swimming Crown 
### 
Stanford swimmers enter the
Pacific-8 Championships today in
Long Beach, as a sort of formality
in anticipation of the NCAA
Championships March 28-30 at
Indiana.
USC, which won the first
conference championship more
than ten years ago and hasn't
relinquished it since, must once
again rank the favorite despite the
Trojans' 57-56 dual meet loss to
Stanford three weeks ago.
Neither Stanford nor Southern
Cal will "sprint down" for the
conference meet, except for those
individuals who must make NCAA
qualifying times.
The break in training routine
and psychological priming that

would go into peaking for the Pac-8
meet is regarded by most West
Coast schools as detrimental to the
more significant push for the
NCAA Championships.
Stanford and USC have
maintained a heavy training regime
right up to the meet. The
swimming fan can expect good but
not great times out of the three-day
competition.
USC's greater depth, especially
in distance freestyle, should put
the Trojans in good shape.
Points are scored through 12
places. In the last two conference
meets, Stanford and USC
swimmers have monopolized over
half the places in certain events.


SOPH SENSATION-Intermediate hurdler Randy White leads a pack of talented
sophomores who figure to provide Coach Payton Jordan with enough material to
build a strong Stanford track squad in '69. While, who set a school record in the
440 IH last year with a 52.2 clocking, may develop into one of the nation's top
hurdlers. Saturday White and the rest of Jordan's sophomore stars will get their
first taste of varsity competition, as the Indians host Fresno State and Occidental.
