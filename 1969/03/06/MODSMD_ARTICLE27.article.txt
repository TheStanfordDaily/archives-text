ALL-AMERICAN-Stanford wrestler Len Borchers was named to the All-American wrestling team last week by Amateur
Wrestling News. Borchers is favored to win the Pacific-8 championship in the 160 lb. class this weekend, when Oreon hosts the
conference meet beginning Friday afternoon. Teamwise, the Indians do not have much of a chance. The squad was hit by a
contagious skin disease a month ago, forcing cancellation of several meets and curtailing nearly all workouts until this week.
