# Frosh Cop Nor Cal Title
## Netmen Bow To Michigan 
### 
Excellent performances in the
first four singles matches weren't
enough to give Stanford a win over
a very tough Michigan squad
Tuesday, as the touring Wolverines
prevailed 5-2.
Senior Dean Schlobohm upset
Michigan's Pete Fishback 2-6, 6-4,
7-5 in the No. 1 singles match, and
Stan Pasarell followed suit with a
7-9, 6-4, 6-3 triumph over Mark
Conti in the third singles
encounter. No. 2 man John Spiegel
fell to Dick Dell in an evenly fought
7-5, 3-6, 6-4 battle, while
sophomore Paul Marienthal had
match point on Michigan's Brian
Marcus before losing 6-4, 6-8, 9-7.
The visitors claimed both the
fifth and sixth singles matches, plus
the third doubles, for their margin
of victory. Both the first and
second doubles matches were
halted by darkness.
Coach Dick Gould's Indians fell
one point short in their quest for
the NorCal tennis title last
weekend, as California and San
Jose State tied for the
championship with 24 points,
Stanford running third with 23.
Pasarell, just getting back in
shape after being out several weeks
with a bad muscle pull in his lower
back, played some outstanding
tennis for Stanford. The
sophomore from San Juan, Puerto
Rico, knocked off four straight

opponents before falling to Cal's
Bob Alloo in the singles finals.
Stanford's top doubles team of
Spiegel and Schlobohm reached
the finals in doubles competition
before being eliminated by San
Jose State's No. 1 team of Greg
Shephard and John Zwieg.
Mac Claflin led the Stanford
frosh to an impressive win in the
Frosh-JC division of the NorCal
tournament. Claflin lost only one
set, as he overran all opposition to
claim the singles title. The blond
bomber from Coral Gables, Fla.

then paired with Bill Rompf to
take the doubles title from Indian
teammates John Wright and Chris
Chapin 6-4, 6-4.
This weekend both the Tribe
varsity and frosh contingents will
take on the University of Utah on
the Stanford courts. The Redskins,
rated one of the top 10 teams in the
country in pre-season polls, are
favored to win the Skyline
Conference this year. Both
Stanford squads should give them a
tough battleâ€”the varsity, Friday at
2:30, the frosh, Saturday at 2:30.
