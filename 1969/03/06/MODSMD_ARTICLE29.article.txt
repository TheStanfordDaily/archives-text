# Boone's Blast Boosts Tribe To 5-1 Triumph
## 
### 
Stanford bounced back from a
14-1 slaughter at the hands of
Santa Clara to subdue the
University of Pacific 5-1 Tuesday
afternoon in Stockton. The win
gave Coach Ray Young's
baseballers a 3-2 record for the
rain-drenched 1969 season.
Senior co-captain Bob Boone
unloaded a ninth-inning, three-run
homer to clinch the victory for the
Indians. Boone's blast, a screaming
330-foot line drive down the left
field line, was one of three hits the
talented third baseman collected.
Shortstop Russ Tweet and left

fielder Jack Hodges each stroked
two hits for Stanford.
Lanky right-hander Rod
Poteete limited the Tigers to two
hits in the eight innings he worked.
Poteete had excellent control, was
never in serious trouble, and
fanned 12 batters. Boone hurled
the ninth frame for Stanford,
striking out the side.
Stanford hosts Cal Poly of
Pomona for a three-game series this
weekend. The first game will be
held Friday at 3:00, with a
double-header slated for 12:00
Saturday.
