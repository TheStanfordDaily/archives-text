# Not Entirely Satisfied
## 'Right' Discusses Pitzer's Response 
### LINDA WINTHROP 
The reactions of the Community of
the Right to President Pitzer's response
to their proposals presented February 17
can be best termed conservative.
Michael Kuhl, former Stanford Area
Young Republican President and present
chairman of the San Mateo County
Young Republicans was "encouraged by
the forthright and honest manner in
which President Pitzer recognized
the . . .proposals."
Eric Salveson, executive

vice-president of the Stanfbrd Area
Young Republicans had a more qualified
response, "President Pitzer seems to be
avoiding us. I think if the BSU or SDS had
made demands, there would have been
more reaction."
Salveson called the proposals
"reasonable" and added that "We're
trying to wake the student body up to the
fact that we can get just as much done
within the system, without destroying
it."
Wait-And-See
Dan Bennett, junior in Statistics, held
a wait-and-see attitude, indicating that he
was hopeful that "Pitzer will answer our
proposals more directly.
Regarding Pitzer's statement that any
"political imbalance . . .reflects the
political persuasions of the most
distinguished men in the field and
not . . .the hiring practice of that
particular department . . ." Kuhl
responsed, "If such is the case I would
hope that the eduational process would
emphasize a method of learning and

inquiry instead of a philosophical style or
approach."
Salveson also expressed his
dissatisfaction by saying that "The
people who are hiring tend to hire people
similar to themselves. If there are no
conservatives in a given department who
are hiring, then there will be no
conservatives hired. '
Anti-cÂ« nservative Bias
Kuhl erlarged upon the
anti-conservative bias by stating that
"Pitzer's reply doesn't speak to the
problem of intolerance toward some
members of the Academic community,
Republicans in general, conservatives in
particular."
Harvey Hukari, President of YAF,
indicated that the official response to
Pitzer's statement from the Community
of the Right would be included in the
editorial in Wednesday's edition of The
Arena. He added that "We look forward
to meeting with President Pitzer next
Wednesday."
