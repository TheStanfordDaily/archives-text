## Two One-Acts By Ram's Head 
### ROBIN LAKE 
Ram's Head is presenting two
theatrical hors-d'oeuvres in Toyon
Lounge. The two one-acters
opened Wednesday to a select
audience and will play through
Friday, at 8:00 p.m. each night.
The evening is directed by Don
Currie. First on the bill is Samuel
Beckett's Play. The device used is
familiar, c.f. The Outrage (the
Western remake of Rashomon) or
the current T.V. series on Net
Playhouse, John Hopkins'
"Talking to a Stranger."
Play presents the menage-a-trois
from the three different
perspectives of the eternal triangle.
The twist is that the players are
completely isolated from each
other, motionless in three huge
jars. This Ali Baba presentation
with its huge Übuesque shadows is
visually very effective.
The split-second lighting
ensures continuous dead-on focus.
The gray pallor and the vocal
monotone add to the feeling of the
impossibility of communication.
The three neckless heads are well
sustained by S. Bales, J. Kason and
M. Hasse.
Several familiar Beckett
techniques re-occur: the garbage
can characters of Endgame, the

burial of Happy Days, the isolation
of Krapp, and the seeming
repetition of Godot. In Play the
repetition, by giving us the comfort
of travelling a familiar route, helps
to clarify the situation. Beckett's
celebrated language is at its most
effective with the cliche, the half
phrase and their apologetic
hollowness.
The second part of the evening
is director Currie's original She Got
Out. It is a delightfully
straightforward allegory of "a life
in the day of the female species."
From womb to emancipation the
collages range from very funny to
the edges of restlessness.
Some tightening is in order in
the audition sequence, and more
visual effects could be created with
the shadows if the changes behind
the screens must take that long.
The five women, played by Polly
Adams, Gail Anderson, Lynne
Dusenberry, Jayne Roach and
Kathy Williams, work well together
and perhaps this ability could be
better put to use—allowing them to
play more off each other as well as
'the man'.
The evening is a successful
exercise in creating effects. It is a
pleasant enough way to spend
ninety minutes.

The evening is a successful
exercise in creating effects. It is a
pleasant enough way to spend
ninety minutes.
