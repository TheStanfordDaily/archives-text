Each show—with its original New
York cast—will be making its West Coast
premiere at the festival. The six shows
are:
Jacques Brel is Alive and Well and
Living in Paris: a new style musical based
on the adaptions of 27 songs by the
Belgion poet and songwriter, and starring
Elly Stone.
Bil Baird Marionette Theater
alternating two adult programs with two
children's matinees. Featured
productions include the topical, satirical
revue, "People Is the Thing That the
World is Fullest Of," and a James
Thurber anthology, "Thurber's
Wonderful O."

about drug addiction devised and
performed by eight former drug addicts
from New York's Daytop Village
rehabilitation center.
An Evening For Merlin Finch, an
experimental production of The
Repertory Theater of Lincoln Center of
two satirical one-act comedies by new
playwright Charles Dizenzo. The
production will star Jules Irving, General

Director of the Company, and former
director of San Francisco's Actor's
Workshop.
To Be Young, Gifted And Black —The
World of Lorraine Hansberry, in Her Own
Words: A theater piece which is both a
memorial to the late black playwright
and a gentle, hopeful view of mankind.
Adapted from Miss Hansberry's writings
by her husband, Robert Nemiroff, and
featuring Barbara Baxley and Cecely
Tyson.
In Circles: A 1 Carmines has set the
cryptic prose of Gertrude Stein to a new
style of theater music for 10 sensitive
souls who frequent a French garden.

musical.

Each play will be presented in an eight
performance week long run. Playing

"We are very pleased by this
opportunity to focus on the
experimental styles and themes, the
emerging young talents and the
inventiveness which makes the

Off-Broadway Theater so exciting,"
noted graduate dean Virgil Whitaker, the
Festival director.
"Our Festival certainly has had a
noteworthy tradition in drama,"
Whitaker continued, "and we believe that
this season's ideas will make another
significant contribution to Bay Area
theater-goers."
Past Stanford Festivals have
introduced the A.C.T., APA, Oregon
Shakespearean Festival, and National
Shakespeare Festival companies to the
Bay Area.
Music —serious and popular-dance,
film and exhibits will also be included in
the more than 100 events reflected in the
broad spectrum of Festival programming,
according to Whitaker and Festival
Producer Stephen Baffrey.

included in the 1969 season will be made
as pending contract negotiations are
completed, said Baffrey.

performance week long run. Playing
dates are now being established and will
be announced shortly.
The first show, however, will be Bil
Baird. Each play will be shown for one
week during the Festival season, which
lasts from June 24 through August 17.
"We are very pleased by this
opportunity to focus on the
experimental styles and themes, the
emerging young talents and the
inventiveness which makes the

Off-Broadway Theater so exciting,"
noted graduate dean Virgil Whitaker, the
Festival director.
"Our Festival certainly has had a
noteworthy tradition in drama,"
Whitaker continued, "and we believe that
this season's ideas will make another
significant contribution to Bay Area
theater-goers."
Past Stanford Festivals have
introduced the A.C.T., APA, Oregon
Shakespearean Festival, and National
Shakespeare Festival companies to the
Bay Area.
Music —serious and popular-dance,
film and exhibits will also be included in
the more than 100 events reflected in the
broad spectrum of Festival programming,
according to Whitaker and Festival
Producer Stephen Baffrey.
Announcement of other artists
included in the 1969 season will be made
as pending contract negotiations are
completed, said Baffrey.
A $15,000 donation from the San
Francisco Foundation—first installment
of an overall $f>o,ooo, five-year
figt~provided the backbone for 1969
financing. It was the impetus for
additional grants totaling $35,000 to
make up the underwriting fund required
to support the program.
Six major off-Broadway productions
will highlight the drama portion of the
Stanford Summer Festival of the Arts
sixth season this year.
Each show—with its original New
York cast—will be making its West Coast
premiere at the festival. The six shows
are:
Jacques Brel is Alive and Well and
Living in Paris: a new style musical based
on the adaptions of 27 songs by the
Belgion poet and songwriter, and starring
Elly Stone.
Bil Baird Marionette Theater
alternating two adult programs with two
children's matinees. Featured
productions include the topical, satirical
revue, "People Is the Thing That the
World is Fullest Of," and a James
Thurber anthology, "Thurber's
Wonderful O."
The Concept, a gripping theater piece
about drug addiction devised and
performed by eight former drug addicts
from New York's Daytop Village
rehabilitation center.
An Evening For Merlin Finch, an
experimental production of The
Repertory Theater of Lincoln Center of
two satirical one-act comedies by new
playwright Charles Dizenzo. The
production will star Jules Irving, General

Director of the Company, and former
director of San Francisco's Actor's
Workshop.
To Be Young, Gifted And Black —The
World of Lorraine Hansberry, in Her Own
Words: A theater piece which is both a
memorial to the late black playwright
and a gentle, hopeful view of mankind.
Adapted from Miss Hansberry's writings
by her husband, Robert Nemiroff, and
featuring Barbara Baxley and Cecely
Tyson.
In Circles: A 1 Carmines has set the
cryptic prose of Gertrude Stein to a new
style of theater music for 10 sensitive
souls who frequent a French garden.
Carmines will star in the zany, nonsense
musical.
