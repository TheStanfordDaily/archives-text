# Students Won't Pay Fines, Invite Trustees To Meet
## 
### MARSHALL KILDUFF CRAIG WILSON 
The 29 students convicted of
disrupting a January 14 Board of
Trustees meeting announced yesterday
that they will not pay fines totaling
$1900 levied by the Student Judicial
Council (SJC). They also announced that
a letter has been sent to the Board of
Trustees asking for an open meeting next
Tuesday.
Commenting on the group's decision,
Dean of Students Joel P. Smith said, "If
they do not (pay), they will be denied
registration."
The Council's unanimous decision,
put into effect by President Kenneth
Pitzer, stipulates that the defendents
must pay one-half their fine before they
register for spring quarter.
Smith declared, "The Judicial Council
recommendations accepted by the
president seemed to make it clear that
prior to registration the fines must be
paid." Asked if Pitzer would not allow
the 29 students to register if they failed
to pay the fines, he said, "Absolutely
yes."
Defendants Statement
During the noon rally sponsored by
Students for a Democratic Society
(SDS), Art Busse read a statement
explaining the decision of the 29 not to
pay.
"Placed within a context of the
systematic violence practiced by the US
and the Stanford defense complex in the
Third World, placed within a context of
our noisy presence at a trustee meeting
devoted to business-as-usual, the recent
trial of 29 students emerges as a travesty
of justice . . . Stanford's judicial process
is not the central issue . . .
"In light of the SJC's failure to

examine acts of corporate violence by the
trustees, we have decided not to pay to
the University the punitive $1900 fine
levied by the SJC on the defendents."
"Grossly Hypocritical"
The group declared at the same time
that it would try to raise as much money
as it could for the Black Panther party.
"We feel that it is grossly hypocritical for
the University to direct this money into
the Martin Luther King fund . . .
"Our $1900 will simply release an
equivalent amount of the University's
money to go elsewhere."
During the course of the rally a
collection box was passed among the
crowd. A total of $94 was collected. In
addition, the defendants, it was
announced, have raised $460 among
themselves. The money will be donated
to the Black Panthers.
Trustee Letter
The students also announced that a
letter had been sent to the Trustees
inviting them to attend an open meeting
of the Stanford community in
Dinkelspiel Auditorium next Tuesday
afternoon. The trustees are scheduled to
meet on campus next Tuesday morning.
The letter which was signed by most
of the 29 defendents and SDS members,
said that "there has been a great deal of
community sentiment concerning the
demands made by the Students for a
Democratic Society about the University
and Southeast Asia.
Earlier efforts to arrange a meeting
have failed . . . We feel that you are now
sufficiently aware of this and can adjust
your schedules accordingly.
"Appropriate Means"
"An open meeting is in fact the most
appropriate means we have of informing
the whole community of the issues at

stake. The power of the Board of
Trustees to determine University and
corporate policy necessitates your
participation in this meeting."
The letter was also signed by LASSU
Speaker Yale Braunstein as well as ASSU
Vice-President Vic von Schlegell.
Referring to the sentences given the
defendants, Associate Prof. H. Bruce
Franklin of the English Department
spoke at the rally and told students,
"your whole damn life has been a
suspended suspension. From the time
you went to grade school, your whole life
has been a series of obedience tests, a
fundamental conditioning to slave
consciousness."
Control Resources
He said the fines were "an assertion of
the trustees power to control the use of
university resources and deny them to
the overwhelming majority of people in
this country."
Franklin told students they should
attack "the essence of elitism" in
admission policy even if it means larger
classes with students doing some of the
teaching.
He said students are "parasites, living
off others . . . You've had to finagle to
get things from your family. This is why
students identify with the culture of the
most oppressed."
Choose Sides
He said that "you are going to have to
choose between the side of the oppressed
and the oppressor."
At one point during his speech
Franklin said the University was not a
school of labor.
William Boyd, President of the
Stanford Young Republicans, shot back
from the audience "you're a stool of
labor."

labor."
The 29 students convicted of
disrupting a January 14 Board of
Trustees meeting announced yesterday
that they will not pay fines totaling
$1900 levied by the Student Judicial
Council (SJC). They also announced that
a letter has been sent to the Board of
Trustees asking for an open meeting next
Tuesday.
Commenting on the group's decision,
Dean of Students Joel P. Smith said, "If
they do not (pay), they will be denied
registration."
The Council's unanimous decision,
put into effect by President Kenneth
Pitzer, stipulates that the defendents
must pay one-half their fine before they
register for spring quarter.
Smith declared, "The Judicial Council
recommendations accepted by the
president seemed to make it clear that
prior to registration the fines must be
paid." Asked if Pitzer would not allow
the 29 students to register if they failed
to pay the fines, he said, "Absolutely
yes."
Defendants Statement
During the noon rally sponsored by
Students for a Democratic Society
(SDS), Art Busse read a statement
explaining the decision of the 29 not to
pay.
"Placed within a context of the
systematic violence practiced by the US
and the Stanford defense complex in the
Third World, placed within a context of
our noisy presence at a trustee meeting
devoted to business-as-usual, the recent
trial of 29 students emerges as a travesty
of justice . . . Stanford's judicial process
is not the central issue . . .
"In light of the SJC's failure to

examine acts of corporate violence by the
trustees, we have decided not to pay to
the University the punitive $1900 fine
levied by the SJC on the defendents."
"Grossly Hypocritical"
The group declared at the same time
that it would try to raise as much money
as it could for the Black Panther party.
"We feel that it is grossly hypocritical for
the University to direct this money into
the Martin Luther King fund . . .
"Our $1900 will simply release an
equivalent amount of the University's
money to go elsewhere."
During the course of the rally a
collection box was passed among the
crowd. A total of $94 was collected. In
addition, the defendants, it was
announced, have raised $460 among
themselves. The money will be donated
to the Black Panthers.
Trustee Letter
The students also announced that a
letter had been sent to the Trustees
inviting them to attend an open meeting
of the Stanford community in
Dinkelspiel Auditorium next Tuesday
afternoon. The trustees are scheduled to
meet on campus next Tuesday morning.
The letter which was signed by most
of the 29 defendents and SDS members,
said that "there has been a great deal of
community sentiment concerning the
demands made by the Students for a
Democratic Society about the University
and Southeast Asia.
Earlier efforts to arrange a meeting
have failed . . . We feel that you are now
sufficiently aware of this and can adjust
your schedules accordingly.
"Appropriate Means"
"An open meeting is in fact the most
appropriate means we have of informing
the whole community of the issues at

stake. The power of the Board of
Trustees to determine University and
corporate policy necessitates your
participation in this meeting."
The letter was also signed by LASSU
Speaker Yale Braunstein as well as ASSU
Vice-President Vic von Schlegell.
Referring to the sentences given the
defendants, Associate Prof. H. Bruce
Franklin of the English Department
spoke at the rally and told students,
"your whole damn life has been a
suspended suspension. From the time
you went to grade school, your whole life
has been a series of obedience tests, a
fundamental conditioning to slave
consciousness."
Control Resources
He said the fines were "an assertion of
the trustees power to control the use of
university resources and deny them to
the overwhelming majority of people in
this country."
Franklin told students they should
attack "the essence of elitism" in
admission policy even if it means larger
classes with students doing some of the
teaching.
He said students are "parasites, living
off others . . . You've had to finagle to
get things from your family. This is why
students identify with the culture of the
most oppressed."
Choose Sides
He said that "you are going to have to
choose between the side of the oppressed
and the oppressor."
At one point during his speech
Franklin said the University was not a
school of labor.
