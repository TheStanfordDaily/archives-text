# Second Night Of Open Houses
## Impressions From Relevant Rush' 
### AQUARIUS 
Last night prospective rushees tested
out the second open house of this year's
new, improved "relevant rush." Many oi
the old drawbacks seemed to have
disappeared, but some of the old
generalizations about "frat life" came to
mind.
No one, even the most loyal fraternity
brother, will maintain that a 20-minute
guided tour of the house and a short chat

with the members will reveal much. Yet
the visitor can come away from these
brief visits with distinct impressions from
remarks heard or people met.
In nearly every house, the tour guide
proudly shows the rushee the one and
only special room, usually decorated in
late Victorian brothel. The rushee is
expected to redbloodedly leer and
congratulate the occupant. The tour
inevitably ends up in the bar or pool
room lined with books that no one will
ever bother to throw out.
Few people on either side of the bid
card take this part of rush for real, but the
whole visit seems to be continually
conducted in a sort of nervous
incommunication. "I'd be glad to answer
any questions you might have" asks the
guide, but he's not really sure what to say
other than the average number of parties
per month or how many guys live in the
house.
Fraternity Life
But certainly once these informal
formalities of the tour and the eternal
jokes about the food service are over, it's
possible to discover what people think
about living in a fraternity.
"I find that the other sophomores and
I feel much differently about life here.
The older guys are much more

conservative, but I think next year we'll
be able to do away with what's left of
hell-week."
Nearly all fraternities have undergone
a mild form of "ding" euthenasia. In its
place is the "modified selectivity" in
which the most desirable rushees are
bidded and the rest are excluded but

rarely rejected with the old-fashioned,
blunt ding.
One sophomore speaking on the
changes he'd seen in his house said,
"There aren't any radical changes;
they've been moderate."
But if some houses have departed
from traditions, there are a few who
stiffly uphold their accustomed image. In
addition to the usual tour-and-chat, the
rushee was shown a big tub of croaking
frogs, all set for a midnight raid on Flo
Mo.
"Well the ding system has changed a
little here. A senior can't reject anyone
because he won't be in the house next
year, and he won't have to live with the
guy. We still have a hell-week that the
pledges go through."

But these things are hardly the major
criticism of fraternities. The whole
evening despite its understandable
awkwardness never seems to touch on
what kind of academic life a rushee can
expect.
No one asks the rushee if he likes
photography or if he thinks Unruh would
be a good governor. The whole tone of
the evening is very social and disarmingly
cheery. There is the assumption that all a
rushee wants is a roof over his head and
back-slapping conviviality. The best a
rushee can do is take the advice of a
member and "Come back and see us on
Saturday."
