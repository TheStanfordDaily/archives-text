# Freshmen Defend Sponsors
## 
### BARBARA HYLAND (Final Part Of A Series) 
In order to evaluate the sponsor pro
gram, it is insufficient to base one's
judgment on praise or criticism coming
from those not directly involved with
the program. The freshmen are the ones
who benefit from it and they are prob
ably in the best position to judge it.
Only one out of 40 students inter
viewed found any faults with the pro
gram. Most freshmen agreed that if
there was something objectionable in
their relationship with the sponsors it
involved an individual sponsor and a
personality conflict. They stressed that it
did not reflect the sponsors as an entity.
The sponsor program has recently
come under attack for allegedly being a
self-perpetuating body which is
composed primarily of radicals.
This year's sponsors were chosen by a
selection committee of three faculty
residents and six sponsors from the year
before. Their decision was based on a
written application and an interview.
A newly formed committee to study
residences will be investigating the
sponsor program and sponsor selection as
one of its duties.
Sponsors Deny Radicalism
Most of the sponsors interviewed
supported the present selection process
as being fair. They were surprised at the
criticism of their being such a radical
group since they feel they represent a
political spectrum, from fraternity
members to SDS sympathizers. In
comparison with previous years, as when
Dave Harris was a sponsor, they felt they
could not be termed a radical body.
Most freshmen too believed that the
sponsors were politically diversified. The
others felt that the program is
radically-oriented, but that this is
advantageous to the freshmen. They
considered the radicals as the students

most concerned about World and
University affairs.
Chuck DeSieyes commented on the
sponsors and said, "I wouldn't say any of
them has been too radical in any way."
He has not seen any efforts to mold
freshmen or to force ideas on anyone.
Nancy Pierce in Branner also felt that
there was no political imbalance. "We're
around both elements," she stated. David
Ortmeyer in Trancos agreed and said that
his sponsor was not "impressing his ideas
on other people."
Charges of Recruiting
However, Jack Stevens in Donner was
critical of the sponsors not so much in his
own dorm as in others. He felt that some
students use sponsoring as a "convenient
way to recruit freshmen, to get them
interested in movements."
Stevens stressed the necessity of
having diversity in personality,
philosophy, and politics among the
sponsors. Different types of people must
be represented in each dorm for "proper
balance tends to establish dialogue."
Establishing A Balance
Other students felt that balance was
not necessarily meritable. Janet Sagio in
Arroyo said, "We need io be exposed to
the radical side." She thought that she
had heard the conservative viewpoints
before coming to college.
She described her own sponsor as
"great." "She's willing to talk about
anything. If you're going to have a talk
about politics, she lets you know what
she thinks." Sagio emphasized that she
does not try to recruit anyone.
John McNeece in Branner considered
his sponsor "very definitely a radical."
He explained that this had expanded his
political awareness. "He makes you
think." On the same corridor Carl Ingram
praised the sponsor and said, "If we
didn't have people like him around, I
wouldn't be here."
Although most freshmen recognize

the influence that their sponsors have on
them, several felt that this influence had
been exaggerated. Don Harris said that
too many people "assume that the
freshmen are lost, little gaping pieces of
dough" and consequently easily molded.
Janet Sagio commented that if a
freshman were influenced politically it
would probably be because he had
tendencies in that direction even before
his contact with the sponsors.
Although policies have been the
crucial issue in criticism of the program,
the freshmen considered the sponsors'
political influence secondary to their
roles as friends, advisors, and as unifying
forces in the dorm.
Friend Relationships
As friends, they turn to their sponsors
not only for advise but just to talk. There
is no feeling of the sponsor as an
authority. Many freshmen do not even
notice the age difference. They would
have probably concurred with Mark
Clark in Branner who felt that a good
sponsor is "friendly, likes people, and is
concerned with other people."
Sponsors also make the corridor and
often the dorm more cohesive. Chuck
DeSieyes said that in the fall a sponsor is
needed "to get the house together." He
remarked that sponsors are not essential
after the beginning of the year.
Several sponsors have been influential
in starting seminars and speaker
programs. The freshmen felt projects like
these helped to unify the dorm. They
commented that the sponsors usually just
suggest ideas and leave the actual
implementation to the students.
Admiration was the common reaction
to the sponsor program and the
individual sponsors. A few freshmen have
already started thinking about possibly
being sponsors in the future. Allan
Johnson in Branner said, "I guess we just
got a good crop"â€”and most freshmen
would agree, emphatically.
