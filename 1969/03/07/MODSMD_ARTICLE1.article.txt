# Trustee-Student 'Forum' Asked For Board's Tuesday Meeting
## 
### CRAIG WILSON 
Efforts to arrange an open meeting
between the Stanford Board of Trustees
and students appeared to be well
underway yesterday after student
members of the New University Advisory
Committee intervened in proceedings
yesterday.
The intervention by the student
committee members came at the request
of President Kenneth Pitzer after the
Students for a Democratic Society (SDS)
formally asked for an open meeting in a
letter addressed to the Trustees last
Tuesday.
The student members of the Advisory
Committee met for nearly four hours

Thursday afternoon working our details
for a substitute proposal for some kind of
forum on the day of the Trustees next
regular meeting on campus Tuesday,
March 11.
This proposal is for a public forum
involving "concerned students" and
Trustees in Dinkelspiel Auditorium, open
to the University community.
Original Initiative
One of the students involved, Michael
Sweeney, acknowledged that "the
original initiative came from SDS. They
sent the letter to the Trustees proposing
an open meeting."
Sweeney said that "the student
members of the University Advisory

Committee think that an open meeting
between the Trustees and their critics
would be a good thing for everyone
concerned."
"But it won't happen by itself.
Everybody is uptight about the
arrangements, which isn't surprising
when you remember what happened the
last time the Trustees were on campus.
Fublic Forum
"We're trying to arrive at a set-up that
will be acceptable to all parties, so that a
public forum can take place between
Trustees and concerned students in
Dinkelspiel Auditorium at 4 p.m.
Tuesday.
"We are hopeful that it will work out.
We'll probably know late Friday."
Besides Sweeney, student members of
the Advisory Committee are Patrick
Shea, Roulette Smith, and Al Spector.
The fifth student member is Denis Hayes,
who is out of town. The uUniversity
Advisory Committee also has five faculty
and five Trustee members.
The proposal by the committee differs
from the SDS letter with reference to
time. SDS originally asked for a 1 p.m.
meeting time. However, the Trustees
normally meet both in the morning and
the early afternoon thus accounting for
the 4 p.m. proposal.
No Response
Bill Black, one of those who signed the
initial SDS letter asking for an open
meeting, said that the administration had
not talked to SDS.
The letter said in part that "there has
been a great deal of community
sentiment concerning the demands made
by the Students for a Democratic Society
about the University and Southeast Asia.
"Earlier efforts to arrange a meeting
have failed . . .We feel that you are now
sufficiently aware of this and can adjust
your schedules accordingly.
"An open meeting is in fact the most
appropriate means we have of informing
the whole community of the issues at
stake. The power of the Board of
Trustees to determine University and
corporate policy necessitates your
participation in this meeting."

CONGRESSMAN SPEAKS-"There is no better way to make a man a pacifist than to give him
combat training and put him under machine gun fire," replied Congressman and Korean War
veteran Pete McCloskey to a question about the value of officer training programs at universities.
Answering a wide range of questions from students in Tresidder yesterday, liberal Republican
McCloskey advocated Universal National Service including a massive program of "kids teaching
other kids" as the only way to remedy the iniquities of our education system. McCloskey also
expressed grave doubts about any anti-ballistic missile system, the harsh Presidio trial sentences,
and any U.S. prospects for victory in Vietnam. Today McCloskey will be meeting with a number of
faculty groups who will advise him on various issues before the Congress.
"We wrote directly to the
Trustees asking them to contact us
about arrangement for the
meeting," said Black. "As of late
Thursday night, neither of the
Trustees nor President Pitzer have
contacted us. We have received
word that Pitzer wants to meet
with us Friday afternoon."
"The meeting Tuesday should
be an open community meeting.
SDS does notwant to dominate it.
We feel, however, that the agenda
must include discussion of the
University's involvement in
Southeast Asia.
When asked about the
committee's deliberations,
Leonard Siegel of SDS said it was
apparent that the Trustees "are
refusing to recognize us, much as
the US refuses to recognize Red
China."
"They are smoothing over
differences and not bringing out
actual political differences.
They're ignoring us."
Focus of Meeting
Siegel went on to say that "we
want a meeting with the Trustees
to focus on Southeast Asia.
"We want the people to be able
to make statements from the floor
as well as questions and we want
the Trustees to come as Trustees,
and not merely as individuals.
Siegel said further that, "if we
don't get our way we will try and
go along; we will try to be flexible.
"Our attitude will probably be
that, regardless of the format we
will attend the meeting. We don't
intend to commit ourselves to any
action unless the meeting is
unacceptable."
