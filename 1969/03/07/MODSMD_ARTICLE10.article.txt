# From The Ivory Tower
## Wildlife Important To Man 
### Joshua Lederberg 
(C) 1969, The Washington Post Co.
The importance of wildlife as an
esthetic resource that enhances the
quality of our own lives is
universally understood. It is also an
indispensable reminder of our own
place in the natural world.
We are, however, as careless
with the protection of endangered
animal species as we are with our
own. Wild species are disappearing
under our very eyes as we complete
the exploitation of the planet,
destroy specialized habitats, dump
our wastes into air ancf sea and
recklessly harvest the whales, the
big cats, the seals, the alligators and
what have you for the most
frivolous or replaceable human
purposes.
Most wild species are probably
doomed, in the long run, in the face
of the growth of human
population. And we may not be far
behind them But this is hardly
good reason to rush that doom.
In fact, if we can postpone it for
a century or so, we might even find
ways to avert it.
The best advertised arguments
for wildlife protection are the
esthetic and moral ones. These
reach the passions more easily than
the votes and dollars of the
electorate. In fact, however, a
diversified wildlife is a perishable
resource of vast but unpredictable
economic value.
The variety of species is a great
library of information, literally
encoded in the specific DNA
molecules that characterize each
type. It is paradoxical that, in this
era of most rapid elimination of
natural variety, we have begun to
learn the keys to that code and to
appreciate the subtleties of the
evolutionary mechanism that it
drives. Each different species is a
unique adaptation to its own way
of life, a lesson in "how to live"
that we can never properly
understand after we extinguish it.
At a more practical level, we

have only begun to domesticate the
range of plant and animal species,
that we might exploit for highly
specialized uses. The very wide use
of Rhesus monkey tissues for
growing virus vaccines is an
example that would have been
beyond imagination fifty years
ago, the Rhesus may not last
another twenty years.
The orangutan is disappearing in
the forests of Borneo. This one
among man's closest relatives
might be the key to understanding
how the brain works, or to the
farming of hearts for transplant or,
most likely of all, to answering
questions we do not yet know how
to ask. A few isolated specimens in
the zoos are all we have to count on
for breeding stock, and these are
already so few that much of the
potential variety within that
species is irretrievably lost, even if
close-bred orangutans will survive
at all.
What we need most of all is a
clear policy to respond to the
accelerating loss of all wildlife
where we do not make careful
plans.
We cannot save every species,
and we sould not be shifting our
attention from one to another with
every shrill outcry about the
Hawaiian Nukupuu or the
Mongolian Wild Ass. We ought to
frame a policy that we know how
to pursue and enforce for the
effective preservation of the
species that can be saved.
When we see clearly which ones
we might abandon, we can also
reckon the balance of merits and
costs in adopting them too. If we
muddle along as we have been
doing, they will all go.
During this process, our
museums of natural history must
be transformed into more effective
depositories of what can be saved
from the dying remains. Here,
modern biology may offer
unexpected contributions to a

museum's responsibility: The
preservation in cold storage of
tissue samples of representative
animals. A technique already
widely used in laboratory studies.
At the very least, our descendants
will be able to reconstruct some
important detail from the study of
DNA molecules retrieved from
such a library.
Furthermore, a whooping crane
might be hatched in the future
from another bird's egg that has
been renucleated from frozen,
dormant tissue. This backstop
ought not be accepted as a
substitute for nurturing the wild
birds, however, any more than
freezing some human cells would
take the place of saving mankind.

the zoos are all we have to count on
for breeding stock, and these are
already so few that much of the
potential variety within that
species is irretrievably lost, even if
close-bred orangutans will survive
at all.
What we need most of all is a
clear policy to respond to the
accelerating loss of all wildlife
where we do not make careful
plans.
We cannot save every species,
and we sould not be shifting our
attention from one to another with
every shrill outcry about the
Hawaiian Nukupuu or the
Mongolian Wild Ass. We ought to
frame a policy that we know how
to pursue and enforce for the
effective preservation of the
species that can be saved.
When we see clearly which ones
we might abandon, we can also
reckon the balance of merits and
costs in adopting them too. If we
muddle along as we have been
doing, they will all go.
During this process, our
museums of natural history must
be transformed into more effective
depositories of what can be saved
from the dying remains. Here,
modern biology may offer
unexpected contributions to a

museum's responsibility: The
preservation in cold storage of
tissue samples of representative
animals. A technique already
widely used in laboratory studies.
At the very least, our descendants
will be able to reconstruct some
important detail from the study of
DNA molecules retrieved from
such a library.
Furthermore, a whooping crane
might be hatched in the future
from another bird's egg that has
been renucleated from frozen,
dormant tissue. This backstop
ought not be accepted as a
substitute for nurturing the wild
birds, however, any more than
freezing some human cells would
take the place of saving mankind.

The importance of wildlife as an
esthetic resource that enhances the
quality of our own lives is
universally understood. It is also an
indispensable reminder of our own
place in the natural world.
We are, however, as careless
with the protection of endangered
animal species as we are with our
own. Wild species are disappearing
under our very eyes as we complete
the exploitation of the planet,
destroy specialized habitats, dump
our wastes into air ancf sea and
recklessly harvest the whales, the
big cats, the seals, the alligators and
what have you for the most
frivolous or replaceable human
purposes.
Most wild species are probably
doomed, in the long run, in the face
of the growth of human
population. And we may not be far
behind them But this is hardly
good reason to rush that doom.
In fact, if we can postpone it for
a century or so, we might even find
ways to avert it.
The best advertised arguments
for wildlife protection are the
esthetic and moral ones. These
reach the passions more easily than
the votes and dollars of the
electorate. In fact, however, a
diversified wildlife is a perishable
resource of vast but unpredictable
economic value.
The variety of species is a great
library of information, literally
encoded in the specific DNA
molecules that characterize each
type. It is paradoxical that, in this
era of most rapid elimination of
natural variety, we have begun to
learn the keys to that code and to
appreciate the subtleties of the
evolutionary mechanism that it
drives. Each different species is a
unique adaptation to its own way
of life, a lesson in "how to live"
that we can never properly
understand after we extinguish it.
At a more practical level, we

have only begun to domesticate the
range of plant and animal species,
that we might exploit for highly
specialized uses. The very wide use
of Rhesus monkey tissues for
growing virus vaccines is an
example that would have been
beyond imagination fifty years
ago, the Rhesus may not last
another twenty years.
The orangutan is disappearing in
the forests of Borneo. This one
among man's closest relatives
might be the key to understanding
how the brain works, or to the
farming of hearts for transplant or,
most likely of all, to answering
questions we do not yet know how
to ask. A few isolated specimens in
the zoos are all we have to count on
for breeding stock, and these are
already so few that much of the
