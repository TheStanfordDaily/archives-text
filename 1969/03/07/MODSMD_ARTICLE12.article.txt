# The
						Merry-Go-Round
## Pentagon Power 
### Jack Anderson 
Bald, brainy Mel Laird may be
Secretary of Defense, but
white-maned Mendel Rivers, the
House Armed Services chairman,
pulls the real strings inside the
Pentagon.
Another power inside the
Pentagon is Sen. Strom Thurmond,
who doubles as a major general in
the Army reserves and leads the
Capitol Hill reserve unit on annual
"inspection" trips to the vacation
spots of Europe and Asia.
Since both Rivers and
Thurmond are staunch sons of
South Carolina, the defense
contractors in their home state are
among the best blessed in the entire
military-industrial complex.

This was illustrated by the
award last month of $9.4 million in
contracts to J.P. Stevens,
Burlington Industries and Dan
River Mills, despite charges from
Minnesota Sen. Walter Mondale
that they were "the worst
segregated firms in the nation."
Packard's Action
Under the law, government
contracts aren't supposed to be
given to firms that don't offer fair
employment to workers of all
races. But Under Secretary David
Packard went ahead with the
contracts without even bothering
to notify the Labor Department,
which is in charge of administering
this law.
Not until the contracts were
already awarded did he inform
Secretary of Labor George Shultz
that he had accepted the vague
verbal assurance of company
officials that they would stop
discrimination. Specific written
agreements have been required in
the past.
The inside story is that Packard
had felt the heat from Rivers and
Thurmond. The new Under
Secretary's response was familiar;
he genuflected toward Capitol Hill
and gave the South Carolina mills
what they wanted.
Mondale Objected
When Mondale loudly objected,
he received a bristling private
telegram from Rivers.
"I continue to receive reports,"
wired Rivers, "That you are
making vicious and slanderous
attacks against the textile
industries of my state . . .1 will no
longer sit idly by and permit
attacks to be made upon the textile
industries and the people of the
state of South Carolina."
Clearly, Rivers is not
accustomed to insubordination
from a mere U.S. Senator.
