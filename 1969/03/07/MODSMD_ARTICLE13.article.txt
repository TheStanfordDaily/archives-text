## Won't You Open The Doors? 
### Marc Weiss 
One hundred students gathered
at Bowman Alumni House at 12:30
p.m. on January 14 to talk to the
Stanford Trustees at their
afternoon meeting. This effort at
communication was rejected.
With that channel closed, about
half the students attempted the
"face-to-face" approach at the
Faculty Club, and 29 of those
students who walked through that
forbidden open door are now on
suspended suspensions and
probation from the University. The
probationary sentence is not an act
of clemency by Jack Friedenthal or
Kenneth Pitzer. Rather, the
sentences are statements by these
men that the defendant's political
beliefs as stated in the motivational
hearings are inimicable to the
interests of the Trustees and the
present centers of financial power
at Stanford. Furthermore, political
opposition on this campus will
only be tolerated by the
powers-that-be (in the hollow
interests of "academic freedom")
so long as these beliefs are not
translated into action.
The attempt to protect the
status quo University from radical
change is illustrated in the
Council's official statement: "The
Council's imposition of periods of
probation takes into consideration
the threat by defendants, made at
the Council's recommendation
seems to make things nice and
legitimate, except for a few simple
facts: 1) The policy enforced was
one specifically designed to
severely limit the legitimate
channels for change open to groups
politically opposing the status quo
University; 2) The policy derives its
authority from the Trustees as
passed on through their appointed
spokesman, the President. 3) The
Council will enforce only policies
deriving authority from the above
source. 4) The Council has no
jurisdictional powers whatever
over the Trustees, but effectively
only over students and Bruce
Franklin constitutes prima facie
abandonment of neutrality on the
part of theCouncil. 5) The Council
only has the power to recommend.
The Trustees' appointed
spokesman has the power to
suspend or expel us at any time,
even over the Council's protests.
These facts illustrate the position
on the Judicial Council SDS has
taken all along: the Council's
hearings were neither neutral nor
legitimate. For example, these
students who simply stated in the
first hearing that they were at the
Faculty Club and no more, were
listed in the official report as

having admitted to being guilty as
charged.
The hearings held in the Moot
Courtroom were indeed moot
court; the Council had previously
decided that anyone who was there
was guilty so all it had to do was to
decide upon an "appropriate"
punishment. Our decision
regarding the sentence was an
equally moot question—we knew
that it was illegitimate. All that
remained was deciding how to
attack it.
The Council considered "the
offense to be a very serious one
that must not be repeated." The
community should pay close
attention to this matter of
"seriousness," which strikes the
very heart of each student's
perilous existence here at Stanford.
What made this offense so serious?
There was no physical violence,
no property damage. The whole
thing was an attempt to speak to
the Trustees, even after we entered
the room we asked them to stay
and talk. Dean Watkins admitted
this at the hearing. Our crime was
so serious because it was
psychological and political.
We transcended the boundaries
of behavior as prescribed to us by
the Trustees, and thereby
challenged their hierarchical
position within the society. The
trial was a re-assertion of the power
of the Trustees to determine the
relationships between themselves
and those whom they rule; to be
the sole definers of the roles to be
fulfilled by all subservient to them
in this University and all
subservient to their class in this
society.
In a sense, every student was on

trial last month —and we were
sentenced together to be either
obedient recipients of their
education or non-recipients of
their education.
At the trial Trustee Dean
Watkins (of Watkins-Johnson, an
electronics firm that does 2/3 of its
business with the Defense
Department) testified that for
students to jfeke initiative on their
own and attend the meeting
uninvited was intolerable and
inappropriate. So much so that the
Trustees Hocked the doors and
ignored us. He suggested that
writing letters is a more
appropriate form of
communication,with the Board.
Yale Braunst«in reported having
written a few letters and not
receiving any replfes. Dean Watkins
smiled and said, "I didn't say we'd
answer the letters. just said you
should write them."
Later he said that while the
Trustees made fundamental
decisions for the Stanford
community, he didn't feel
particularly responsible to that
community.
These men and their system
subscribe to a basic assumption.
They made the decisions and their
subordinates (students) are the
docile recipients of those decisions.
They control the resources, and
those who wish to use tbem may be
creative, should be productive, but
must be obedient.
SDS and the defendants reject
their assumption. So we have
arranged an open meeting of the
Stanford community (including
the Trustees, if you consider them
members) for Tuesday, March 11,
at 1:00 p.m. in Dinkelspiel

Auditorium. Since Dean Watkins
thinks it's inappropriate to come to
a meeting uninvited, we sent the
Trustees written invitations. This
article is SDS's written invitation
to you.
Every student who rejects the
Trustees' assumptions, who sees
the Trustees' position in Southeast
Asia, in the Black community, and
in the University as being of
questionable legitimacy and
rationality, who feels that in our
present society, Dead Week is 52
weeks a year, should be at that
meeting next Tuesday. The
Trustees are wondering just how
successful their school is at
manufacturing submissive,
apologetic, and disinterested
scholars. The turnout at
Dinkelspiel can give them the
answer.
One more thing. The Council
stated that our "actions are
counter-productive in that they
tend to eliminate opportunity for
legitimate discussion and
resolution of vital issues (italics
mine)." Make no mistake about it.
The nine demands on Southeast
Asia can't be resolved at the
meeting next week.
The Trustees are not going to be
convinced by talking to us or to the
Vietnamese that our demands are
"just". The only thing that will
convince them to meet those
demands is enough community
support to force them to meet the
demands. The community meeting
next Tuesday could be a key step
toward developing that kind of
community power.

at 1:00 p.m. in Dinkelspiel

Auditorium. Since Dean Watkins
thinks it's inappropriate to come to
a meeting uninvited, we sent the
Trustees written invitations. This
article is SDS's written invitation
to you.
Every student who rejects the
Trustees' assumptions, who sees
the Trustees' position in Southeast
Asia, in the Black community, and
in the University as being of
questionable legitimacy and
rationality, who feels that in our
present society, Dead Week is 52
weeks a year, should be at that
meeting next Tuesday. The
Trustees are wondering just how
successful their school is at
manufacturing submissive,
apologetic, and disinterested
scholars. The turnout at
Dinkelspiel can give them the
answer.
One more thing. The Council
stated that our "actions are
counter-productive in that they
tend to eliminate opportunity for
legitimate discussion and
resolution of vital issues (italics
mine)." Make no mistake about it.
The nine demands on Southeast
Asia can't be resolved at the
meeting next week.
The Trustees are not going to be
convinced by talking to us or to the
Vietnamese that our demands are
"just". The only thing that will
convince them to meet those
demands is enough community
support to force them to meet the
demands. The community meeting
next Tuesday could be a key step
toward developing that kind of
community power.

One hundred students gathered
at Bowman Alumni House at 12:30
p.m. on January 14 to talk to the
Stanford Trustees at their
afternoon meeting. This effort at
communication was rejected.
With that channel closed, about
half the students attempted the
"face-to-face" approach at the
Faculty Club, and 29 of those
students who walked through that
forbidden open door are now on
suspended suspensions and
probation from the University. The
probationary sentence is not an act
of clemency by Jack Friedenthal or
Kenneth Pitzer. Rather, the
sentences are statements by these
men that the defendant's political
beliefs as stated in the motivational
hearings are inimicable to the
interests of the Trustees and the
present centers of financial power
at Stanford. Furthermore, political
opposition on this campus will
only be tolerated by the
powers-that-be (in the hollow
interests of "academic freedom")
so long as these beliefs are not
translated into action.
The attempt to protect the
status quo University from radical
change is illustrated in the
Council's official statement: "The
Council's imposition of periods of
probation takes into consideration
the threat by defendants, made at
the Council's recommendation
seems to make things nice and
legitimate, except for a few simple
facts: 1) The policy enforced was
one specifically designed to
severely limit the legitimate
channels for change open to groups
politically opposing the status quo
University; 2) The policy derives its
authority from the Trustees as
passed on through their appointed
spokesman, the President. 3) The
Council will enforce only policies
deriving authority from the above
source. 4) The Council has no
jurisdictional powers whatever
over the Trustees, but effectively
only over students and Bruce
Franklin constitutes prima facie
abandonment of neutrality on the
part of theCouncil. 5) The Council
only has the power to recommend.
The Trustees' appointed
spokesman has the power to
suspend or expel us at any time,
even over the Council's protests.
These facts illustrate the position
on the Judicial Council SDS has
taken all along: the Council's
hearings were neither neutral nor
legitimate. For example, these
students who simply stated in the
first hearing that they were at the
Faculty Club and no more, were
listed in the official report as

having admitted to being guilty as
charged.
The hearings held in the Moot
Courtroom were indeed moot
court; the Council had previously
decided that anyone who was there
was guilty so all it had to do was to
decide upon an "appropriate"
punishment. Our decision
regarding the sentence was an
equally moot question—we knew
that it was illegitimate. All that
remained was deciding how to
attack it.
The Council considered "the
offense to be a very serious one
that must not be repeated." The
community should pay close
attention to this matter of
"seriousness," which strikes the
very heart of each student's
perilous existence here at Stanford.
What made this offense so serious?
There was no physical violence,
no property damage. The whole
thing was an attempt to speak to
the Trustees, even after we entered
the room we asked them to stay
and talk. Dean Watkins admitted
this at the hearing. Our crime was
so serious because it was
psychological and political.
We transcended the boundaries
of behavior as prescribed to us by
the Trustees, and thereby
challenged their hierarchical
position within the society. The
trial was a re-assertion of the power
of the Trustees to determine the
relationships between themselves
and those whom they rule; to be
the sole definers of the roles to be
fulfilled by all subservient to them
in this University and all
subservient to their class in this
society.
In a sense, every student was on

trial last month —and we were
sentenced together to be either
obedient recipients of their
education or non-recipients of
their education.
At the trial Trustee Dean
Watkins (of Watkins-Johnson, an
electronics firm that does 2/3 of its
business with the Defense
Department) testified that for
students to jfeke initiative on their
own and attend the meeting
uninvited was intolerable and
inappropriate. So much so that the
Trustees Hocked the doors and
ignored us. He suggested that
writing letters is a more
appropriate form of
communication,with the Board.
Yale Braunst«in reported having
written a few letters and not
receiving any replfes. Dean Watkins
smiled and said, "I didn't say we'd
answer the letters. just said you
should write them."
Later he said that while the
Trustees made fundamental
decisions for the Stanford
community, he didn't feel
particularly responsible to that
community.
These men and their system
subscribe to a basic assumption.
They made the decisions and their
subordinates (students) are the
docile recipients of those decisions.
They control the resources, and
those who wish to use tbem may be
creative, should be productive, but
must be obedient.
SDS and the defendants reject
their assumption. So we have
arranged an open meeting of the
Stanford community (including
the Trustees, if you consider them
members) for Tuesday, March 11,
at 1:00 p.m. in Dinkelspiel

In a sense, every student was on

trial last month —and we were
sentenced together to be either
obedient recipients of their
education or non-recipients of
their education.
At the trial Trustee Dean
Watkins (of Watkins-Johnson, an
electronics firm that does 2/3 of its
business with the Defense
Department) testified that for
students to jfeke initiative on their
own and attend the meeting
uninvited was intolerable and
inappropriate. So much so that the
Trustees Hocked the doors and
ignored us. He suggested that
writing letters is a more
appropriate form of
communication,with the Board.
Yale Braunst«in reported having
written a few letters and not
receiving any replfes. Dean Watkins
smiled and said, "I didn't say we'd
answer the letters. just said you
should write them."
Later he said that while the
Trustees made fundamental
decisions for the Stanford
community, he didn't feel
particularly responsible to that
community.
These men and their system
subscribe to a basic assumption.
They made the decisions and their
subordinates (students) are the
docile recipients of those decisions.
They control the resources, and
those who wish to use tbem may be
creative, should be productive, but
must be obedient.
SDS and the defendants reject
their assumption. So we have
arranged an open meeting of the
Stanford community (including
the Trustees, if you consider them
members) for Tuesday, March 11,
at 1:00 p.m. in Dinkelspiel

Auditorium. Since Dean Watkins
thinks it's inappropriate to come to
a meeting uninvited, we sent the
Trustees written invitations. This
article is SDS's written invitation
to you.
Every student who rejects the
Trustees' assumptions, who sees
the Trustees' position in Southeast
Asia, in the Black community, and
in the University as being of
questionable legitimacy and
rationality, who feels that in our
present society, Dead Week is 52
weeks a year, should be at that
meeting next Tuesday. The
Trustees are wondering just how
successful their school is at
manufacturing submissive,
apologetic, and disinterested
scholars. The turnout at
Dinkelspiel can give them the
answer.
One more thing. The Council
stated that our "actions are
counter-productive in that they
tend to eliminate opportunity for
legitimate discussion and
resolution of vital issues (italics
mine)." Make no mistake about it.
The nine demands on Southeast
Asia can't be resolved at the
meeting next week.
The Trustees are not going to be
convinced by talking to us or to the
Vietnamese that our demands are
"just". The only thing that will
convince them to meet those
demands is enough community
support to force them to meet the
demands. The community meeting
next Tuesday could be a key step
toward developing that kind of
community power.

One hundred students gathered
at Bowman Alumni House at 12:30
p.m. on January 14 to talk to the
Stanford Trustees at their
afternoon meeting. This effort at
communication was rejected.
With that channel closed, about
half the students attempted the
"face-to-face" approach at the
Faculty Club, and 29 of those
students who walked through that
forbidden open door are now on
suspended suspensions and
probation from the University. The
probationary sentence is not an act
of clemency by Jack Friedenthal or
Kenneth Pitzer. Rather, the
sentences are statements by these
men that the defendant's political
beliefs as stated in the motivational
hearings are inimicable to the
interests of the Trustees and the
present centers of financial power
at Stanford. Furthermore, political
opposition on this campus will
only be tolerated by the
powers-that-be (in the hollow
interests of "academic freedom")
so long as these beliefs are not
translated into action.
The attempt to protect the
status quo University from radical
change is illustrated in the
Council's official statement: "The
Council's imposition of periods of
probation takes into consideration
the threat by defendants, made at
the Council's recommendation
seems to make things nice and
legitimate, except for a few simple
facts: 1) The policy enforced was
one specifically designed to
severely limit the legitimate
channels for change open to groups
politically opposing the status quo
University; 2) The policy derives its
authority from the Trustees as
passed on through their appointed
spokesman, the President. 3) The
Council will enforce only policies
deriving authority from the above
source. 4) The Council has no
jurisdictional powers whatever
over the Trustees, but effectively
only over students and Bruce
Franklin constitutes prima facie
abandonment of neutrality on the
part of theCouncil. 5) The Council
only has the power to recommend.
The Trustees' appointed
spokesman has the power to
suspend or expel us at any time,
even over the Council's protests.
These facts illustrate the position
on the Judicial Council SDS has
taken all along: the Council's
hearings were neither neutral nor
legitimate. For example, these
students who simply stated in the
first hearing that they were at the
Faculty Club and no more, were
listed in the official report as

having admitted to being guilty as
charged.
The hearings held in the Moot
Courtroom were indeed moot
court; the Council had previously
decided that anyone who was there
was guilty so all it had to do was to
decide upon an "appropriate"
punishment. Our decision
regarding the sentence was an
equally moot question—we knew
that it was illegitimate. All that
remained was deciding how to
attack it.
The Council considered "the
offense to be a very serious one
that must not be repeated." The
community should pay close
attention to this matter of
"seriousness," which strikes the
very heart of each student's
perilous existence here at Stanford.
What made this offense so serious?
There was no physical violence,
no property damage. The whole
thing was an attempt to speak to
the Trustees, even after we entered
the room we asked them to stay
and talk. Dean Watkins admitted
this at the hearing. Our crime was
so serious because it was
psychological and political.
We transcended the boundaries
of behavior as prescribed to us by
the Trustees, and thereby
challenged their hierarchical
position within the society. The
trial was a re-assertion of the power
of the Trustees to determine the
relationships between themselves
and those whom they rule; to be
the sole definers of the roles to be
fulfilled by all subservient to them
in this University and all
subservient to their class in this
society.
