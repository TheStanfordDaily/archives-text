## Subtle Convocation Impact 
### Martin L. Perl 
As a member of the committee
which organized the Stanford
Science and Society Convocation
on March 4th, I feel that the
Stanford Daily and some other
local newspapers, almost
completely failed to report the
spirit, the purpose, and in some
respects even the substance of that
Convocation.
I feel these omissions need to be
corrected because the nature and
atmosphere of the meeting were
new and unique, and yet the very
newness and uniqueness were
ignored by the Daily's news staff in
favor of some very ordinary
coverage of some parts of the
Convocation.
The March Fourth Convocation
was part of a serious attempt to
begin a nationwide discussion of
the technological and scientific
problems faced by society, and
along with that discussion a start
was made on solving these
problems. These problems range
from the destruction of the natural
environment through the
uncontrolled growth of civilian
technologies, to the continuous
threat to human life through
advances in military technology.
That idea is that the graduate
students and young scientists are
not only asking each other, but
they are asking the senior scientists
and the senior faculty "Where is
science and technology going?"
"How is it that some actual and so
much potential harm is being done
to human society by science and
technology, given that science and
technology are in general beneficial
to human society?" "What can be
done, what should we do, and what
are our responsibilities as scientists
and engineers?"
It is further the spirit of the

March Fourth Convocation that
these questions be discussed with
the widest possible range of
academic and technical people, and
that the discussions be held in a
quiet, rational atmosphere.
All but two of the organizers of
the Stanford Convocation were
graduate students, and these
students moderated the panels and
chaired the general meetings. This
was done not only because they
were the organizers of the
Convocation, but because they
represent the students and young
scientists and engineers who are
asking these questions.
Another principle of the March
Fourth Convocation was that the
discussions should not only be
open to the public, but that the
public be urged to come, because in
the end it is the public to which we
all are responsible.
The format of the Convocation
was that there be some major
speeches by some members of the
senior faculty, people who were
also deeply concerned with these
issues. However, it was clearly
understood that these speeches
would be listened to with
profoundly questioning care, and
that in the panel discussions and in
the evening meeting the students,
the public, and the faculty would
start to examine the ideas put forth
in these speeches and many other
ideas. These speeches were in no
way to represent the consensus or
the substance of the Convocation.
It was also the hope of the
committee that the participants
and the audience would leave the
Convocation, not just feeling good
about having spent a few hours
listening to worthy discussion, but
perhaps worried, perhaps troubled,
perhaps eager to do something

concrete about these problems.
This purpose was accomplished
with unexpected success, and I am
sad that while almost everyone I
have spoken to who was at the
Convocation has expressed these
feelings, the Daily was not able to
see these things or did not feel
them important enough to report
upon.
Certainly, the substance of the
first afternoon speeches deserved
reporting and that was done, but
that was not enough. And, so while
most of the 800 or 900 people at
the Convocation, particularly
those at the panels and at the
evening session, have begun a new
and profound examination of the
problems of science and society,
through the failure of the reporting
we have not been able to
communicate these ideas to those
who did not attend.
I am most afraid that the very
calmness and politeness and
seriousness of the discussions led
the reporters to think that there
was no controversy, that there was
no questioning, that there were no
profound feelings involved. We
certainly hope that as the
discussion continues and as it turns
into individual and group work on
these problems, the press will be
more sensitive to the spirit and
purposes of these individuals and
groups.
The calmness, the politeness,
the seriousness will continue,
because we know that the support
and active participation of much of
the scientific and technical
community is needed, if these
problems are to be solved.

was part of a serious attempt to
begin a nationwide discussion of
the technological and scientific
problems faced by society, and
along with that discussion a start
was made on solving these
problems. These problems range
from the destruction of the natural
environment through the
uncontrolled growth of civilian
technologies, to the continuous
threat to human life through
advances in military technology.
That idea is that the graduate
students and young scientists are
not only asking each other, but
they are asking the senior scientists
and the senior faculty "Where is
science and technology going?"
"How is it that some actual and so
much potential harm is being done
to human society by science and
technology, given that science and
technology are in general beneficial
to human society?" "What can be
done, what should we do, and what
are our responsibilities as scientists
and engineers?"
It is further the spirit of the

March Fourth Convocation that
these questions be discussed with
the widest possible range of
academic and technical people, and
that the discussions be held in a
quiet, rational atmosphere.
All but two of the organizers of
the Stanford Convocation were
graduate students, and these
students moderated the panels and
chaired the general meetings. This
was done not only because they
were the organizers of the
Convocation, but because they
represent the students and young
scientists and engineers who are
asking these questions.
Another principle of the March
Fourth Convocation was that the
discussions should not only be
open to the public, but that the
public be urged to come, because in
the end it is the public to which we
all are responsible.
The format of the Convocation
was that there be some major
speeches by some members of the
senior faculty, people who were
also deeply concerned with these
issues. However, it was clearly
understood that these speeches
would be listened to with
profoundly questioning care, and
that in the panel discussions and in
the evening meeting the students,
the public, and the faculty would
start to examine the ideas put forth
in these speeches and many other
ideas. These speeches were in no
way to represent the consensus or
the substance of the Convocation.
It was also the hope of the
committee that the participants
and the audience would leave the
Convocation, not just feeling good
about having spent a few hours
listening to worthy discussion, but
perhaps worried, perhaps troubled,
perhaps eager to do something

concrete about these problems.
This purpose was accomplished
with unexpected success, and I am
sad that while almost everyone I
have spoken to who was at the
Convocation has expressed these
feelings, the Daily was not able to
see these things or did not feel
them important enough to report
upon.
Certainly, the substance of the
first afternoon speeches deserved
reporting and that was done, but
that was not enough. And, so while
most of the 800 or 900 people at
the Convocation, particularly
those at the panels and at the
evening session, have begun a new
and profound examination of the
problems of science and society,
through the failure of the reporting
we have not been able to
communicate these ideas to those
who did not attend.
I am most afraid that the very
calmness and politeness and
seriousness of the discussions led
the reporters to think that there
was no controversy, that there was
no questioning, that there were no
profound feelings involved. We
certainly hope that as the
discussion continues and as it turns
into individual and group work on
these problems, the press will be
more sensitive to the spirit and
purposes of these individuals and
groups.
The calmness, the politeness,
the seriousness will continue,
because we know that the support
and active participation of much of
the scientific and technical
community is needed, if these
problems are to be solved.

As a member of the committee
which organized the Stanford
Science and Society Convocation
on March 4th, I feel that the
Stanford Daily and some other
local newspapers, almost
completely failed to report the
spirit, the purpose, and in some
respects even the substance of that
Convocation.
I feel these omissions need to be
corrected because the nature and
atmosphere of the meeting were
new and unique, and yet the very
newness and uniqueness were
ignored by the Daily's news staff in
favor of some very ordinary
coverage of some parts of the
Convocation.
