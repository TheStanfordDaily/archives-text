## World Student Revolt 
### Vishist K. Vaid-Raizada 
Seldom has the world
experienced social unrest
comparable to the student revolt of
the nineteen sixties. What is
astonishing is its global character.
All those names of big cities that
one finds on the map of an
internationally established airline
have suddenly emerged the centres
of student protests—San Francisco,
Chicago, New York, London, Paris,
Rome, Berlin, Cairo, New Delhi,
Karachi, Djakarta, Tokyo, Mexico
City etc. It is an international
movement without an
international organization.
The free-speech movement at
Berkeley set the model for campus
revolts. Then came "The Battle of
Columbia", followed by anti-war
demonstrations at Stanford
(burning of naval reserve building)
and other campuses reaching
almost an epidemic scale.
It was not long before the
protests spread to European
university campuses; "Paris
Burns", "Bulldozers Move Into
Lyons", "Was Wollen Die
Studenten", "The Riddle Of The
Berlin Riots", "Student Power in
Italy", and "Siege Of London
School Of Economics" were some
of the popular headlines.
Back in the United States the
turmoil arose again, this time over
demands by the minority groups
such as Black Students Union and
Third World Liberation Front. San
Francisco State College witnessed
bloody riots and the latest in the

v
series is the recent Bookstore
incident at Stanford.
In Asia, a couple of decades ago
it was generally believed that the
student participation in the
national liberation movements, to
fight against the colonial rule, was a
temporary phenomenon. After
freedom comes, the students
would go back to classrooms. So
they did, but not for long. Perhaps,
what the students fought against
was misrule as much as foreign rule.
When conditions deteriorated in
Indonesia and it was on the verge of
bankruptcy, the students led the
revolt against Dr. Sukarno and
deposed him.
In India, at any time, half a
dozen of the universities and
colleges are on strike, very often
fighting against the imposition of a
language, unemployment, high
prices or general bad conditions. In
Pakistan, the students spearheaded
the recent dump President Ayub
movement when they realized that
his rule was becoming oppressive
and corrupt.
There is no one reason that
explains this world-wide outburst.
In the continental Europe, it is a
reaction against the wornout
education system. "There are now
some 600,000 students in French
universities, more than twice as
many as at the beginning of the
19605.
In Germany, it is a protest
against the hierarchical framework
of the university. Shortage of

teachers, overcrowded classrooms,
ill-equipped laboratories and
libraries are the major factors
responsible in Italy.
In the United States and United
Kingdom it is a middle class
anti-war and anti establishment
revolt. Multitude of factors
account for this unrest in the
underdeveloped countries, badly
equipped and managed colleges
and universities, depressing
economic and social conditions
etc.
There appear to be three
distinct streams of actions:
Outright revolutionaries; they
want nothing short of a total
change in the society. Destruction
is their chief weapon. They are
politically inspired. Many of the
protestors in the underdeveloped
countries belong to this class.
Radicals; their aim is a limited
change. They do not mind using
violence, if necessary.
Liberals; they avoid violence
and seek reforms in the university
establishment (and society, if,
possible). Their primary aim is to
gain more participation in the
decision making process.
Most of the protestors in the
advanced countries fall in the last
two categories.
Student revolt is not a negative
force. It has the potential to reform
the outdated institutions of the
academic world and the society.

In Asia, a couple of decades ago
it was generally believed that the
student participation in the
national liberation movements, to
fight against the colonial rule, was a
temporary phenomenon. After
freedom comes, the students
would go back to classrooms. So
they did, but not for long. Perhaps,
what the students fought against
was misrule as much as foreign rule.
When conditions deteriorated in
Indonesia and it was on the verge of
bankruptcy, the students led the
revolt against Dr. Sukarno and
deposed him.
In India, at any time, half a
dozen of the universities and
colleges are on strike, very often
fighting against the imposition of a
language, unemployment, high
prices or general bad conditions. In
Pakistan, the students spearheaded
the recent dump President Ayub
movement when they realized that
his rule was becoming oppressive
and corrupt.
There is no one reason that
explains this world-wide outburst.
In the continental Europe, it is a
reaction against the wornout
education system. "There are now
some 600,000 students in French
universities, more than twice as
many as at the beginning of the
19605.
In Germany, it is a protest
against the hierarchical framework
of the university. Shortage of

teachers, overcrowded classrooms,
ill-equipped laboratories and
libraries are the major factors
responsible in Italy.
In the United States and United
Kingdom it is a middle class
anti-war and anti establishment
revolt. Multitude of factors
account for this unrest in the
underdeveloped countries, badly
equipped and managed colleges
and universities, depressing
economic and social conditions
etc.
There appear to be three
distinct streams of actions:
Outright revolutionaries; they
want nothing short of a total
change in the society. Destruction
is their chief weapon. They are
politically inspired. Many of the
protestors in the underdeveloped
countries belong to this class.
Radicals; their aim is a limited
change. They do not mind using
violence, if necessary.
Liberals; they avoid violence
and seek reforms in the university
establishment (and society, if,
possible). Their primary aim is to
gain more participation in the
decision making process.
Most of the protestors in the
advanced countries fall in the last
two categories.
Student revolt is not a negative
force. It has the potential to reform
the outdated institutions of the
academic world and the society.
(Mr. Vaid-Raizada is a graduate
student from India.—Ed.)
Seldom has the world
experienced social unrest
comparable to the student revolt of
the nineteen sixties. What is
astonishing is its global character.
All those names of big cities that
one finds on the map of an
internationally established airline
have suddenly emerged the centres
of student protests—San Francisco,
Chicago, New York, London, Paris,
Rome, Berlin, Cairo, New Delhi,
Karachi, Djakarta, Tokyo, Mexico
City etc. It is an international
movement without an
international organization.
The free-speech movement at
Berkeley set the model for campus
revolts. Then came "The Battle of
Columbia", followed by anti-war
demonstrations at Stanford
(burning of naval reserve building)
and other campuses reaching
almost an epidemic scale.
It was not long before the
protests spread to European
university campuses; "Paris
Burns", "Bulldozers Move Into
Lyons", "Was Wollen Die
Studenten", "The Riddle Of The
Berlin Riots", "Student Power in
Italy", and "Siege Of London
School Of Economics" were some
of the popular headlines.
Back in the United States the
turmoil arose again, this time over
demands by the minority groups
such as Black Students Union and
Third World Liberation Front. San
Francisco State College witnessed
bloody riots and the latest in the

v
series is the recent Bookstore
incident at Stanford.
