# Letters To The Editor
## Yellow Journalism Attacked 
### 
Editor,THE DAILY:
If I may, I'd like to begin by
simply accusing The Daily of
"yellow journalism." The article
entitled Impressions From
'Relevant Rush' was blatantly and
falsely accusing each and every
fraternity of never relenting
shallowness and total lack of real
concern for the environment needs
of every Stanford student.
The anonymous author who
signed himself Aquarius (I'd be
ashamed to have an article like that
attributed to me too.) mentioned
"some of the old generalizations
about 'frat life' "without ever
specifying what they were. I
assume he was speaking to that
myth which labels fraternities as
''a nt i-intellectua I'' or
"a-intellectual." The separate
fraternities and jointly through
IFC have all been involved in
programs, to a greater or lesser
extent depending on the individual
fraternity, to have professors to
meals, seminars in the houses (and
available to the entire university),
guest-in-residence programs, etc.
All the houses are working on
some sort of self-improvement
program to make them more
relevant, but we are hindered by
two main factors.
One has to do with the mood on
campus, led by The Daily, which
sees fraternities in a particularly
bad light. This feeling, it seems to
me, comes from the fraternity
image borrowed from other
campuses as much as from the
realities of the past here at
Stanford—both poor standards to
use when judging today's situation.
By seeing that this image is passed
on, The Daily and others guarantee
that many perspective rushees
make the same kind of judgement
against fraternities (a superficial
one) which these same people
constantly accuse fraternities of
doing during Rush.
The second factor hindering our
attempts to gain greater relevance
has to do with money. Fraternities
are run as separate ard individual
businesses. We do not have
university funds to back up our
attempts to bring in guests and
speakers and more varied programs
which would see that fraternities
know a greater involvement within
the Stanford community. It is not
that we would not like to be more
involved in most cases, rather it is
that we cannot afford it, as
university owned dormitories can.
Even though one-third of the male
undergraduate student-body
resides in fraternities, we get no
assistance financially from the
university.
As Aquarius mentioned,
changes are being made, perhaps
too slowly, but we are thinking and
trying. The important thing is not
to judge us before you know what
we are all about now and where we
pointed for the future. If there are
questions which are important to
you, as a Rushee, ask them. We
can't possibly know all the things
which you are interested in, but we
would be interested in discussing
them with you. Try us; and please
don't judge before you have!
As to The Daily, I would think
that your reporters would do
better to stick to facts and figures
and not write about their own
subjective judgements based upon
hearsay or one or two houses
visited for a few moments.

• Moral Responsibility
Editor,THE DAILY:
The March 4th sessions I
attended paid scant attention to
some important points. Both in
supplying supposedly pure
technical information used in
setting government priorities and
in choosing research projects
within the ill-considered but still
surprisingly broad areas which are
well funded, scientists are making
weighty moral decisions and value
judgements.
Prof. Drell and the men from
RAND furnish more than
probabilities of possible
technological developments. The
assessment of such probabilities
cannot be made without a set of
psychological and historical
assumptions concerning the
"opponent" and the political
future. These men show a strong
predilection for assumptions which

preclude dispassionate and
complete consideration of all
possible sets of events.
Furthermore, they usually present
recommendations with their
forecasts. Even in game theory the
probabilities of events must be
multiplied by their values to find
the best course of action.
The impossibility of separating
technological from moral
judgement is matched by its
irresponsibility. I urge Prof. Drell
and his colleagues to include in
their next technological forecast to
the government the high
probability event that they will
refuse to develop any more
weapons.
Thus while a prevailing theme in
the opening speeches of Professors
Lederberg, Schiff and Drell and in
the whole March 4th movement is
the culpability of the government
in its use of scientific knowledge,
no one expressed astonishment
that the men needed to develop
and justify the more destructive
technological applications are
never in short supply.
A minority of the scientific
community is now demonstrating
that finding the thought modes of
generals and Southern politicians
attractive is not an inherent part of
a scientist's intellectual makeup.
The rest of this community needs
an education in making moral and
philosophical judgements. In the
meantime it would be wise for
science to humbly accept the aid of
men in the humanities who are
professionally accustomed to
examining their moral assumptions
and the internal consistency of
arguments not stated in equations.
It would be wise for Prof. Drell and
his colleagues to insist that they
will not advise the government
unless poets and philosophers are
equally represented.
We should not accept a set of
changes in the undergraduate
curriculum which does not increase
the young scientist's exposure to
the humanities. This university and
its departments must refuse
demands for ever more "efficient"
division of labor, must refuse to
produce any more half-men so
aptly described by Lawrence
Durrell as "thinking weeds."

• iVo Freedom In China
Editor, THE DAILY:
When Bruce Franklin was
speaking at the SDS rally
Wednesday noon, March 5, he
condemned the operating mode in
this country which is based on
rewards to those who do well (i.e.,
as a student if you do well you will
be able to enroll in the university of
your choice). According to his
argument this system must be
changed.
It seems rather odd that
Franklin, an avowed Maoist, would
condemn the reward system which
so strongly pervades Maoist party
operations. Direct and indirect
promotions and other rewards
within the party are certainly not
given for misbehavior. In Red
China there is no freedom of
expression granted to resistants of
the party, and to speak out against
those in power is to invite
banishment or execution.

• Misunderstood
Editor, THE DAILY:
In his letter to The Daily of
March 5, 1969, criticizing my
previous letter (of Feb. 27, 1969),
Charles Bergquist has apparently
misunderstood my remarks
concerning the panel discussion of
graduate education. The only point
I tried to make is that the panel
arrived at some very broad
generalizations concerning
graduate education based upon an
inadequate, unrepresentative
sample of opinions. I attempted to
illustrate this by presenting a few
obviously conflicting examples.
Any further interpretation of my
examples or remarks, especially
with respect to my "narrow
technocratic world view", is to
repeat the errors of the panel on
graduate education—to extrapolate
from an inadequate sample of data
to vast, nonsensical
generalizations.

Campus Immorality
Editor, THE DAILY:
Just as the citizens of this
country are under the jurisdiction
of the laws of this land, while the
U.S. government is under the
jurisdiction of no such laws, so the
students and faculty members of
this university are under the
jurisdiction of the laws of this
university, while the trustees are
under the jurisdiction of no such
laws.
And just as it is not legal for any
citizen of this country to kill
anyone else in this country, except
in self-defense (unless you are
black), while the government may
murder millions of people without
punishment, so it is not legal for
any student or faculty member of
this university to aid any killer,
while the trustees may aid the
government in murdering millions
without punishment.
The fact that certain individuals
are held responsible to laws which
other certain individuals are not is
immoral.
The fact that students and
faculty members at this university
allow such a system to be
perpetrated on them is an insult to
their humanity.

• ROTC Changes Needed
Editor, THE DAILY:
I was one of 2106 students to
vote for the ROTC proposal on
last week's ballot. I want to make
it clear, however, that my idea as
to what is of "genuine academic
interest" is likely to differ greatly
from that of Harvey Hukari or
Colonel Thomas. If my vote
means that I accept the ROTC
program as it is now, then I would
surely like the chance to change
that vote. As it is, it will take
major changes in the ROTC pro
gram before I find it even nearly
acceptable.

• BSU And The Books
Editor,THE DAILY:
News from Stanford reaches
London with some delay, and if
this point has already been made in
your columns ignore my letter and
forgive the redundancy. I have
before me The Daily of February
28, specifically the two
communications by Gavin
Langmuir and Hubert Marshall
about the bookstore incident, and
private letters about the incident
itself and Professor Berlinski's
reaction to it. No doubt this is
inadequate information, yet I feel
strongly impelled to communicate
with you on the basis of it, from
the perspective of a member of the
Stanford community now abroad.
I strongly support Professor
Langmuir's view, that the use of
terms like "violence-enchanted
primitives" indicates a racism
which is perhaps all the more
deplorable for being unconscious.
No academic or intellectual has a
right any longer to use such terms
with innocence of their
centuries—old meaning in our
culture. Nor can I support the call
for equality-before-disciplinary
action which Professor Marshall,
and persumably Professor
Berlinski, put forth, precisely
because it ignores the facts of
inequality of provocation, for
example, or such fact as that Black
individuals can be lumped under
the term "primitives" when this
stereotype would not be extended
even toSDS members.
At the same time I feel that
Professor Langmuir's letter
sidesteps what from London seems
a very saddening aspect of the
whole issue, while the other two
professors perpetuate this aspect
precisely in the same way that the
BSU participants raised it. That is,
neither side seems to have made a
distinction between attacks on
properly as such and on the
bookstore as purveyor of books. I
can't say I necessarily condone
attacks on property, but I can
sympathize with feeling the need
to prick the university's
institutional self-esteem and
provoke confrontation, and
university property is closely
connected with the university's
institutional self and the concerns

of administrators. But books are in
quite a different category. When
these cats attack books, it seems to
me, they are betraying the very
means of attaining what they say
they are fighting for: individual
and cultural identity and pride.
What Black student has not found
in books by Black authors, African
and American, as he has in the
works of Black musicians, his own
voice as a Black? A way out at last
from the "showing your color" of a
self-deprecating minority or the
equally horrible denial of self by
assimilation, which, until the
writings of Blacks became widely
available, were the alternatives
presented to an articulate Black?
When the professors lump
damage to books under damage to
property and the breaking of
institutional rules, they are
showing the extent to which the
materialism and Philistinism of
American culture are entrenched in
the university. When students
attack books in the same spirit in
which they break rules and damage
property, they are showing the
extent to which, in spite of their
own protestations, they still view
the university as merely an
instrument of material and social
advancement, the extent, in other
words, to which they are infected
with the same blight as the
professors. Both seem to have lost
view of the non-institutional goals
of the university. However exactly
one wishes to define these goals,
whether as a quest for knowledge,
human dignity, the expression of
spiritual values, or the building of
human communities on better
bases than we have been able to
erect heretofore, books, more than
rules and the material paraphenalia
of buildings, are essential
instruments in the struggle.

• Punishment Needed
Editor,THE DAILY:
Recent nation-wide student
disturbances, including those on
our own campus, have brought to
the fore the prevalence of the idea
that violence will achieve all goals
and will for the most part remain in
effect unpunished. Distressingly
this assumption appears to be valid.
We cannot allow this situation
to continue. If we do not mete out
punishments to violators of civil
law because we fear the future
actions of revolutionary groups,
then we open ourselves to either
anarchy or totalitarianism. Yet, if
we refuse to institute needed
reform, perhaps in reaction to the
means employed by protesting
groups, then we will suffer more
turbulence. We must have the
courage to resist violence and the
wisdom to welcome reform.
Revolutionaries must be willing
to accept the consequences of their
actions. These consequences must
be specific and firmly established.
Yet .the reforms suffered for must
be incorporated into society. Only
in this way will our society be able
to grow, to improve, to exist.

in its use of scientific knowledge,
no one expressed astonishment
that the men needed to develop
and justify the more destructive
technological applications are
never in short supply.
A minority of the scientific
community is now demonstrating
that finding the thought modes of
generals and Southern politicians
attractive is not an inherent part of
a scientist's intellectual makeup.
The rest of this community needs
an education in making moral and
philosophical judgements. In the
meantime it would be wise for
science to humbly accept the aid of
men in the humanities who are
professionally accustomed to
examining their moral assumptions
and the internal consistency of
arguments not stated in equations.
It would be wise for Prof. Drell and
his colleagues to insist that they
will not advise the government
unless poets and philosophers are
equally represented.
We should not accept a set of
changes in the undergraduate
curriculum which does not increase
the young scientist's exposure to
the humanities. This university and
its departments must refuse
demands for ever more "efficient"
division of labor, must refuse to
produce any more half-men so
aptly described by Lawrence
Durrell as "thinking weeds."

• iVo Freedom In China
Editor, THE DAILY:
When Bruce Franklin was
speaking at the SDS rally
Wednesday noon, March 5, he
condemned the operating mode in
this country which is based on
rewards to those who do well (i.e.,
as a student if you do well you will
be able to enroll in the university of
your choice). According to his
argument this system must be
changed.
It seems rather odd that
Franklin, an avowed Maoist, would
condemn the reward system which
so strongly pervades Maoist party
operations. Direct and indirect
promotions and other rewards
within the party are certainly not
given for misbehavior. In Red
China there is no freedom of
expression granted to resistants of
the party, and to speak out against
those in power is to invite
banishment or execution.

Editor, THE DAILY:
In his letter to The Daily of
March 5, 1969, criticizing my
previous letter (of Feb. 27, 1969),
Charles Bergquist has apparently
misunderstood my remarks
concerning the panel discussion of
graduate education. The only point
I tried to make is that the panel
arrived at some very broad

graduate education based upon an
inadequate, unrepresentative
sample of opinions. I attempted to
illustrate this by presenting a few
obviously conflicting examples.
Any further interpretation of my

Campus Immorality
Editor, THE DAILY:
Just as the citizens of this
country are under the jurisdiction
of the laws of this land, while the
U.S. government is under the
jurisdiction of no such laws, so the
students and faculty members of
this university are under the
jurisdiction of the laws of this
university, while the trustees are
under the jurisdiction of no such
laws.
And just as it is not legal for any
citizen of this country to kill
anyone else in this country, except
in self-defense (unless you are
black), while the government may
murder millions of people without
punishment, so it is not legal for
any student or faculty member of
this university to aid any killer,
while the trustees may aid the
government in murdering millions
without punishment.
The fact that certain individuals
are held responsible to laws which
other certain individuals are not is
immoral.
The fact that students and
faculty members at this university
allow such a system to be
perpetrated on them is an insult to
their humanity.

Editor, THE DAILY:
I was one of 2106 students to
vote for the ROTC proposal on
last week's ballot. I want to make
it clear, however, that my idea as
to what is of "genuine academic
interest" is likely to differ greatly
from that of Harvey Hukari or

means that I accept the ROTC

major changes in the ROTC pro

• BSU And The Books
Editor,THE DAILY:
News from Stanford reaches
London with some delay, and if
this point has already been made in
your columns ignore my letter and
forgive the redundancy. I have
before me The Daily of February
28, specifically the two
communications by Gavin
Langmuir and Hubert Marshall
about the bookstore incident, and
private letters about the incident
itself and Professor Berlinski's
reaction to it. No doubt this is
inadequate information, yet I feel
strongly impelled to communicate
with you on the basis of it, from
the perspective of a member of the
Stanford community now abroad.
I strongly support Professor
Langmuir's view, that the use of
terms like "violence-enchanted
primitives" indicates a racism
which is perhaps all the more
deplorable for being unconscious.
No academic or intellectual has a
right any longer to use such terms
with innocence of their
centuries—old meaning in our
culture. Nor can I support the call
for equality-before-disciplinary
action which Professor Marshall,
and persumably Professor
Berlinski, put forth, precisely
because it ignores the facts of
inequality of provocation, for
example, or such fact as that Black
individuals can be lumped under
the term "primitives" when this
stereotype would not be extended
even toSDS members.
At the same time I feel that
Professor Langmuir's letter
sidesteps what from London seems
a very saddening aspect of the
whole issue, while the other two
professors perpetuate this aspect
precisely in the same way that the
BSU participants raised it. That is,
neither side seems to have made a
distinction between attacks on
properly as such and on the
bookstore as purveyor of books. I
can't say I necessarily condone
attacks on property, but I can
sympathize with feeling the need
to prick the university's
institutional self-esteem and
provoke confrontation, and
university property is closely
connected with the university's
institutional self and the concerns

of administrators. But books are in
quite a different category. When
these cats attack books, it seems to
me, they are betraying the very
means of attaining what they say
they are fighting for: individual
and cultural identity and pride.
What Black student has not found
in books by Black authors, African
and American, as he has in the
works of Black musicians, his own
voice as a Black? A way out at last
from the "showing your color" of a
self-deprecating minority or the
equally horrible denial of self by
assimilation, which, until the
writings of Blacks became widely
available, were the alternatives
presented to an articulate Black?
When the professors lump
damage to books under damage to
property and the breaking of
institutional rules, they are
showing the extent to which the
materialism and Philistinism of
American culture are entrenched in
the university. When students
attack books in the same spirit in
which they break rules and damage
property, they are showing the
extent to which, in spite of their
own protestations, they still view
the university as merely an
instrument of material and social
advancement, the extent, in other
words, to which they are infected
with the same blight as the
professors. Both seem to have lost
view of the non-institutional goals
of the university. However exactly
one wishes to define these goals,
whether as a quest for knowledge,
human dignity, the expression of
spiritual values, or the building of
human communities on better
bases than we have been able to
erect heretofore, books, more than
rules and the material paraphenalia
of buildings, are essential
instruments in the struggle.

• Punishment Needed
Editor,THE DAILY:
Recent nation-wide student
disturbances, including those on
our own campus, have brought to
the fore the prevalence of the idea
that violence will achieve all goals
and will for the most part remain in
effect unpunished. Distressingly
this assumption appears to be valid.
We cannot allow this situation
to continue. If we do not mete out
punishments to violators of civil
law because we fear the future
actions of revolutionary groups,
then we open ourselves to either
anarchy or totalitarianism. Yet, if
we refuse to institute needed
reform, perhaps in reaction to the
means employed by protesting
groups, then we will suffer more
turbulence. We must have the
courage to resist violence and the
wisdom to welcome reform.
Revolutionaries must be willing
to accept the consequences of their
actions. These consequences must
be specific and firmly established.
Yet .the reforms suffered for must
be incorporated into society. Only
in this way will our society be able
to grow, to improve, to exist.
JUDITH A.HANKS
Editor,THE DAILY:
If I may, I'd like to begin by
simply accusing The Daily of
"yellow journalism." The article
entitled Impressions From
'Relevant Rush' was blatantly and
falsely accusing each and every
fraternity of never relenting
shallowness and total lack of real
concern for the environment needs
of every Stanford student.
The anonymous author who
signed himself Aquarius (I'd be
ashamed to have an article like that
attributed to me too.) mentioned
"some of the old generalizations
about 'frat life' "without ever
specifying what they were. I
assume he was speaking to that
myth which labels fraternities as
''a nt i-intellectua I'' or
"a-intellectual." The separate
fraternities and jointly through
IFC have all been involved in
programs, to a greater or lesser
extent depending on the individual
fraternity, to have professors to
meals, seminars in the houses (and
available to the entire university),
guest-in-residence programs, etc.
All the houses are working on
some sort of self-improvement
program to make them more
relevant, but we are hindered by
two main factors.
One has to do with the mood on
campus, led by The Daily, which
sees fraternities in a particularly
bad light. This feeling, it seems to
me, comes from the fraternity
image borrowed from other
campuses as much as from the
realities of the past here at
Stanford—both poor standards to
use when judging today's situation.
By seeing that this image is passed
on, The Daily and others guarantee
that many perspective rushees
make the same kind of judgement
against fraternities (a superficial
one) which these same people
constantly accuse fraternities of
doing during Rush.
The second factor hindering our
attempts to gain greater relevance
has to do with money. Fraternities
are run as separate ard individual
businesses. We do not have
university funds to back up our
attempts to bring in guests and
speakers and more varied programs
which would see that fraternities
know a greater involvement within
the Stanford community. It is not
that we would not like to be more
involved in most cases, rather it is
that we cannot afford it, as
university owned dormitories can.
Even though one-third of the male
undergraduate student-body
resides in fraternities, we get no
assistance financially from the
university.
As Aquarius mentioned,
changes are being made, perhaps
too slowly, but we are thinking and
trying. The important thing is not
to judge us before you know what
we are all about now and where we
pointed for the future. If there are
questions which are important to
you, as a Rushee, ask them. We
can't possibly know all the things
which you are interested in, but we
would be interested in discussing
them with you. Try us; and please
don't judge before you have!
As to The Daily, I would think
that your reporters would do
better to stick to facts and figures
and not write about their own
subjective judgements based upon
hearsay or one or two houses
visited for a few moments.

• Moral Responsibility
Editor,THE DAILY:
The March 4th sessions I
attended paid scant attention to
some important points. Both in
supplying supposedly pure
technical information used in
setting government priorities and
in choosing research projects
within the ill-considered but still
surprisingly broad areas which are
well funded, scientists are making
weighty moral decisions and value
judgements.
Prof. Drell and the men from
RAND furnish more than
probabilities of possible
technological developments. The
assessment of such probabilities
cannot be made without a set of
psychological and historical
assumptions concerning the
"opponent" and the political
future. These men show a strong
predilection for assumptions which

preclude dispassionate and
complete consideration of all
possible sets of events.
Furthermore, they usually present
recommendations with their
forecasts. Even in game theory the
probabilities of events must be
multiplied by their values to find
the best course of action.
The impossibility of separating
technological from moral
judgement is matched by its
irresponsibility. I urge Prof. Drell
and his colleagues to include in
their next technological forecast to
the government the high
probability event that they will
refuse to develop any more
weapons.
Thus while a prevailing theme in
the opening speeches of Professors
Lederberg, Schiff and Drell and in
the whole March 4th movement is
the culpability of the government
in its use of scientific knowledge,
no one expressed astonishment
that the men needed to develop
and justify the more destructive
technological applications are
never in short supply.
A minority of the scientific
community is now demonstrating
that finding the thought modes of

• BSU And The Books
Editor,THE DAILY:
News from Stanford reaches
London with some delay, and if
this point has already been made in
your columns ignore my letter and
forgive the redundancy. I have
before me The Daily of February
28, specifically the two
communications by Gavin
Langmuir and Hubert Marshall
about the bookstore incident, and
private letters about the incident
itself and Professor Berlinski's
reaction to it. No doubt this is
inadequate information, yet I feel
strongly impelled to communicate
with you on the basis of it, from
the perspective of a member of the
Stanford community now abroad.
I strongly support Professor
Langmuir's view, that the use of
terms like "violence-enchanted
primitives" indicates a racism
which is perhaps all the more
deplorable for being unconscious.
No academic or intellectual has a
right any longer to use such terms
with innocence of their
centuries—old meaning in our
culture. Nor can I support the call
for equality-before-disciplinary
action which Professor Marshall,
and persumably Professor
Berlinski, put forth, precisely
because it ignores the facts of
inequality of provocation, for
example, or such fact as that Black
individuals can be lumped under
the term "primitives" when this
stereotype would not be extended
even toSDS members.
At the same time I feel that
Professor Langmuir's letter
sidesteps what from London seems
a very saddening aspect of the
whole issue, while the other two
professors perpetuate this aspect
precisely in the same way that the
BSU participants raised it. That is,
neither side seems to have made a
distinction between attacks on
properly as such and on the
bookstore as purveyor of books. I
can't say I necessarily condone
attacks on property, but I can
sympathize with feeling the need
to prick the university's
institutional self-esteem and
provoke confrontation, and
university property is closely
connected with the university's
institutional self and the concerns

of administrators. But books are in
quite a different category. When
these cats attack books, it seems to
me, they are betraying the very
means of attaining what they say
they are fighting for: individual
and cultural identity and pride.
What Black student has not found
in books by Black authors, African
and American, as he has in the
works of Black musicians, his own
voice as a Black? A way out at last
from the "showing your color" of a
self-deprecating minority or the
equally horrible denial of self by
assimilation, which, until the
writings of Blacks became widely
available, were the alternatives
presented to an articulate Black?
When the professors lump
damage to books under damage to
property and the breaking of
institutional rules, they are
showing the extent to which the
materialism and Philistinism of
American culture are entrenched in
the university. When students
attack books in the same spirit in
which they break rules and damage
property, they are showing the
extent to which, in spite of their
own protestations, they still view
the university as merely an
instrument of material and social
advancement, the extent, in other
words, to which they are infected
with the same blight as the
professors. Both seem to have lost
view of the non-institutional goals
of the university. However exactly
one wishes to define these goals,
whether as a quest for knowledge,
human dignity, the expression of
spiritual values, or the building of
human communities on better
bases than we have been able to
erect heretofore, books, more than
rules and the material paraphenalia
of buildings, are essential
instruments in the struggle.

• Punishment Needed
Editor,THE DAILY:
Recent nation-wide student
disturbances, including those on
our own campus, have brought to
the fore the prevalence of the idea
that violence will achieve all goals
and will for the most part remain in
effect unpunished. Distressingly
this assumption appears to be valid.
We cannot allow this situation
to continue. If we do not mete out
punishments to violators of civil
law because we fear the future
actions of revolutionary groups,
then we open ourselves to either
anarchy or totalitarianism. Yet, if
we refuse to institute needed
reform, perhaps in reaction to the
means employed by protesting
groups, then we will suffer more
turbulence. We must have the
courage to resist violence and the
wisdom to welcome reform.
Revolutionaries must be willing
to accept the consequences of their
actions. These consequences must
be specific and firmly established.
Yet .the reforms suffered for must
be incorporated into society. Only
in this way will our society be able
to grow, to improve, to exist.
JUDITH A.HANKS
Editor,THE DAILY:
If I may, I'd like to begin by
simply accusing The Daily of
"yellow journalism." The article
entitled Impressions From
'Relevant Rush' was blatantly and
falsely accusing each and every
fraternity of never relenting
shallowness and total lack of real
concern for the environment needs
of every Stanford student.
The anonymous author who
signed himself Aquarius (I'd be
ashamed to have an article like that
attributed to me too.) mentioned
"some of the old generalizations
about 'frat life' "without ever
specifying what they were. I
assume he was speaking to that
myth which labels fraternities as
''a nt i-intellectua I'' or
"a-intellectual." The separate
fraternities and jointly through
IFC have all been involved in
programs, to a greater or lesser
extent depending on the individual
fraternity, to have professors to
meals, seminars in the houses (and
available to the entire university),
guest-in-residence programs, etc.
All the houses are working on
some sort of self-improvement
program to make them more
relevant, but we are hindered by
two main factors.
One has to do with the mood on
campus, led by The Daily, which
sees fraternities in a particularly
bad light. This feeling, it seems to
me, comes from the fraternity
image borrowed from other
campuses as much as from the
realities of the past here at
Stanford—both poor standards to
use when judging today's situation.
By seeing that this image is passed
on, The Daily and others guarantee
that many perspective rushees
make the same kind of judgement
against fraternities (a superficial
one) which these same people
constantly accuse fraternities of
doing during Rush.
The second factor hindering our
attempts to gain greater relevance
has to do with money. Fraternities
are run as separate ard individual
businesses. We do not have
university funds to back up our
attempts to bring in guests and
speakers and more varied programs
which would see that fraternities
know a greater involvement within
the Stanford community. It is not
that we would not like to be more
involved in most cases, rather it is
that we cannot afford it, as
university owned dormitories can.
Even though one-third of the male
undergraduate student-body
resides in fraternities, we get no
assistance financially from the
university.
As Aquarius mentioned,
changes are being made, perhaps
too slowly, but we are thinking and
trying. The important thing is not
to judge us before you know what
we are all about now and where we
pointed for the future. If there are
questions which are important to
you, as a Rushee, ask them. We
can't possibly know all the things
which you are interested in, but we
would be interested in discussing
them with you. Try us; and please
don't judge before you have!
As to The Daily, I would think
that your reporters would do
better to stick to facts and figures
and not write about their own
subjective judgements based upon
hearsay or one or two houses
visited for a few moments.

• Moral Responsibility
Editor,THE DAILY:
The March 4th sessions I
attended paid scant attention to
some important points. Both in
supplying supposedly pure
technical information used in
setting government priorities and
in choosing research projects
within the ill-considered but still
surprisingly broad areas which are
well funded, scientists are making
weighty moral decisions and value
judgements.
Prof. Drell and the men from
RAND furnish more than
probabilities of possible
technological developments. The
assessment of such probabilities
cannot be made without a set of
psychological and historical
assumptions concerning the
"opponent" and the political
future. These men show a strong
predilection for assumptions which

preclude dispassionate and
complete consideration of all
possible sets of events.
Furthermore, they usually present
recommendations with their
forecasts. Even in game theory the
probabilities of events must be
multiplied by their values to find
the best course of action.
The impossibility of separating
technological from moral
judgement is matched by its
irresponsibility. I urge Prof. Drell
and his colleagues to include in
their next technological forecast to
the government the high
probability event that they will
refuse to develop any more
weapons.
Thus while a prevailing theme in
the opening speeches of Professors
Lederberg, Schiff and Drell and in
the whole March 4th movement is
the culpability of the government
in its use of scientific knowledge,
no one expressed astonishment
that the men needed to develop
and justify the more destructive
technological applications are
never in short supply.
A minority of the scientific
community is now demonstrating
that finding the thought modes of
generals and Southern politicians
attractive is not an inherent part of
a scientist's intellectual makeup.
The rest of this community needs
an education in making moral and
philosophical judgements. In the
meantime it would be wise for
science to humbly accept the aid of
men in the humanities who are
professionally accustomed to
examining their moral assumptions
and the internal consistency of
arguments not stated in equations.
It would be wise for Prof. Drell and
his colleagues to insist that they
will not advise the government
unless poets and philosophers are
equally represented.
We should not accept a set of
changes in the undergraduate
curriculum which does not increase
the young scientist's exposure to
the humanities. This university and
its departments must refuse
demands for ever more "efficient"
division of labor, must refuse to
produce any more half-men so
aptly described by Lawrence
Durrell as "thinking weeds."

• iVo Freedom In China
Editor, THE DAILY:
When Bruce Franklin was
speaking at the SDS rally
Wednesday noon, March 5, he
condemned the operating mode in
this country which is based on
rewards to those who do well (i.e.,
as a student if you do well you will
be able to enroll in the university of
your choice). According to his
argument this system must be
changed.
It seems rather odd that
Franklin, an avowed Maoist, would
condemn the reward system which
so strongly pervades Maoist party
operations. Direct and indirect
promotions and other rewards
within the party are certainly not
given for misbehavior. In Red
China there is no freedom of
expression granted to resistants of
the party, and to speak out against
those in power is to invite
banishment or execution.

• Misunderstood
Editor, THE DAILY:
In his letter to The Daily of
March 5, 1969, criticizing my
previous letter (of Feb. 27, 1969),
Charles Bergquist has apparently
misunderstood my remarks
concerning the panel discussion of
graduate education. The only point
I tried to make is that the panel
arrived at some very broad
generalizations concerning
graduate education based upon an
inadequate, unrepresentative
sample of opinions. I attempted to
illustrate this by presenting a few
obviously conflicting examples.
Any further interpretation of my
examples or remarks, especially
with respect to my "narrow
technocratic world view", is to
repeat the errors of the panel on
graduate education—to extrapolate
from an inadequate sample of data
to vast, nonsensical
generalizations.

Campus Immorality
Editor, THE DAILY:
Just as the citizens of this
country are under the jurisdiction
of the laws of this land, while the
U.S. government is under the
jurisdiction of no such laws, so the
students and faculty members of
this university are under the
jurisdiction of the laws of this
university, while the trustees are
under the jurisdiction of no such
laws.
And just as it is not legal for any
citizen of this country to kill
anyone else in this country, except
in self-defense (unless you are
black), while the government may
murder millions of people without
punishment, so it is not legal for
any student or faculty member of
this university to aid any killer,
while the trustees may aid the
government in murdering millions
without punishment.
The fact that certain individuals
are held responsible to laws which
other certain individuals are not is
immoral.
The fact that students and
faculty members at this university
allow such a system to be
perpetrated on them is an insult to
their humanity.

I was one of 2106 students to

to accept the consequences of their
actions. These consequences must
be specific and firmly established.
Yet .the reforms suffered for must
be incorporated into society. Only
in this way will our society be able
to grow, to improve, to exist.
JUDITH A.HANKS
Editor,THE DAILY:
If I may, I'd like to begin by
simply accusing The Daily of
"yellow journalism." The article
entitled Impressions From
'Relevant Rush' was blatantly and
falsely accusing each and every
fraternity of never relenting
shallowness and total lack of real
concern for the environment needs
of every Stanford student.
The anonymous author who
signed himself Aquarius (I'd be
ashamed to have an article like that
attributed to me too.) mentioned
"some of the old generalizations
about 'frat life' "without ever
specifying what they were. I
assume he was speaking to that
myth which labels fraternities as
''a nt i-intellectua I'' or
"a-intellectual." The separate
fraternities and jointly through
IFC have all been involved in
programs, to a greater or lesser
extent depending on the individual
fraternity, to have professors to
meals, seminars in the houses (and
available to the entire university),
guest-in-residence programs, etc.
All the houses are working on
some sort of self-improvement
program to make them more
relevant, but we are hindered by
two main factors.
One has to do with the mood on
campus, led by The Daily, which
sees fraternities in a particularly
bad light. This feeling, it seems to
me, comes from the fraternity
image borrowed from other
campuses as much as from the
realities of the past here at
Stanford—both poor standards to
use when judging today's situation.
By seeing that this image is passed
on, The Daily and others guarantee
that many perspective rushees
make the same kind of judgement
against fraternities (a superficial
one) which these same people
constantly accuse fraternities of
doing during Rush.
The second factor hindering our
attempts to gain greater relevance
has to do with money. Fraternities
are run as separate ard individual
businesses. We do not have
university funds to back up our
attempts to bring in guests and
speakers and more varied programs
which would see that fraternities
know a greater involvement within
the Stanford community. It is not
that we would not like to be more
involved in most cases, rather it is
that we cannot afford it, as
university owned dormitories can.
Even though one-third of the male
undergraduate student-body
resides in fraternities, we get no
assistance financially from the
university.
As Aquarius mentioned,
changes are being made, perhaps
too slowly, but we are thinking and
trying. The important thing is not
to judge us before you know what
we are all about now and where we
pointed for the future. If there are
questions which are important to
you, as a Rushee, ask them. We
can't possibly know all the things
which you are interested in, but we
would be interested in discussing
them with you. Try us; and please
don't judge before you have!
As to The Daily, I would think
that your reporters would do
better to stick to facts and figures
and not write about their own
subjective judgements based upon
hearsay or one or two houses
visited for a few moments.

• Moral Responsibility
Editor,THE DAILY:
The March 4th sessions I
attended paid scant attention to
some important points. Both in
supplying supposedly pure
technical information used in
setting government priorities and
in choosing research projects
within the ill-considered but still
surprisingly broad areas which are
well funded, scientists are making
weighty moral decisions and value
judgements.
Prof. Drell and the men from
RAND furnish more than
probabilities of possible
technological developments. The
assessment of such probabilities
cannot be made without a set of
psychological and historical
assumptions concerning the
"opponent" and the political
future. These men show a strong
predilection for assumptions which

preclude dispassionate and
complete consideration of all
possible sets of events.
Furthermore, they usually present
recommendations with their
forecasts. Even in game theory the
probabilities of events must be
multiplied by their values to find
the best course of action.
The impossibility of separating
technological from moral
judgement is matched by its
irresponsibility. I urge Prof. Drell
and his colleagues to include in
their next technological forecast to
the government the high
probability event that they will
refuse to develop any more
weapons.
Thus while a prevailing theme in
the opening speeches of Professors
Lederberg, Schiff and Drell and in
the whole March 4th movement is
the culpability of the government
in its use of scientific knowledge,
no one expressed astonishment
that the men needed to develop
and justify the more destructive
technological applications are
never in short supply.
A minority of the scientific
community is now demonstrating
that finding the thought modes of
generals and Southern politicians
attractive is not an inherent part of
a scientist's intellectual makeup.
The rest of this community needs
an education in making moral and
philosophical judgements. In the
meantime it would be wise for
science to humbly accept the aid of
men in the humanities who are
professionally accustomed to
examining their moral assumptions
and the internal consistency of
arguments not stated in equations.
It would be wise for Prof. Drell and
his colleagues to insist that they
will not advise the government
unless poets and philosophers are
equally represented.
We should not accept a set of
changes in the undergraduate
curriculum which does not increase
the young scientist's exposure to
the humanities. This university and
its departments must refuse
demands for ever more "efficient"
division of labor, must refuse to
produce any more half-men so
aptly described by Lawrence
Durrell as "thinking weeds."

• iVo Freedom In China
Editor, THE DAILY:
When Bruce Franklin was
speaking at the SDS rally
Wednesday noon, March 5, he
condemned the operating mode in
this country which is based on
rewards to those who do well (i.e.,
as a student if you do well you will
be able to enroll in the university of
your choice). According to his
argument this system must be
changed.
It seems rather odd that
Franklin, an avowed Maoist, would
condemn the reward system which
so strongly pervades Maoist party
operations. Direct and indirect
promotions and other rewards
within the party are certainly not
given for misbehavior. In Red
China there is no freedom of
expression granted to resistants of
the party, and to speak out against
those in power is to invite
banishment or execution.

• Misunderstood
Editor, THE DAILY:
In his letter to The Daily of
March 5, 1969, criticizing my
previous letter (of Feb. 27, 1969),
Charles Bergquist has apparently
misunderstood my remarks
concerning the panel discussion of
graduate education. The only point
I tried to make is that the panel
arrived at some very broad
generalizations concerning
graduate education based upon an
inadequate, unrepresentative
sample of opinions. I attempted to
illustrate this by presenting a few
obviously conflicting examples.
Any further interpretation of my
examples or remarks, especially
with respect to my "narrow
technocratic world view", is to
repeat the errors of the panel on
graduate education—to extrapolate
from an inadequate sample of data
to vast, nonsensical
generalizations.

Campus Immorality
Editor, THE DAILY:
Just as the citizens of this
country are under the jurisdiction
of the laws of this land, while the
U.S. government is under the
jurisdiction of no such laws, so the
students and faculty members of
this university are under the
jurisdiction of the laws of this
university, while the trustees are
under the jurisdiction of no such
laws.
And just as it is not legal for any
citizen of this country to kill
anyone else in this country, except
in self-defense (unless you are
black), while the government may
murder millions of people without
punishment, so it is not legal for
any student or faculty member of
this university to aid any killer,
while the trustees may aid the
government in murdering millions
without punishment.
The fact that certain individuals
are held responsible to laws which
other certain individuals are not is
immoral.
The fact that students and
faculty members at this university
allow such a system to be
perpetrated on them is an insult to
their humanity.

• ROTC Changes Needed
Editor, THE DAILY:
I was one of 2106 students to
vote for the ROTC proposal on
last week's ballot. I want to make
it clear, however, that my idea as
to what is of "genuine academic
interest" is likely to differ greatly
from that of Harvey Hukari or
Colonel Thomas. If my vote
means that I accept the ROTC
program as it is now, then I would
surely like the chance to change
that vote. As it is, it will take
major changes in the ROTC pro
gram before I find it even nearly
acceptable.
FLETCHER CATRON

• BSU And The Books
Editor,THE DAILY:
News from Stanford reaches
London with some delay, and if
this point has already been made in
your columns ignore my letter and
forgive the redundancy. I have
before me The Daily of February
28, specifically the two
communications by Gavin
Langmuir and Hubert Marshall
about the bookstore incident, and
private letters about the incident
itself and Professor Berlinski's
reaction to it. No doubt this is
inadequate information, yet I feel
strongly impelled to communicate
with you on the basis of it, from
the perspective of a member of the
Stanford community now abroad.
I strongly support Professor
Langmuir's view, that the use of
terms like "violence-enchanted
primitives" indicates a racism
which is perhaps all the more
deplorable for being unconscious.
No academic or intellectual has a
right any longer to use such terms
with innocence of their
centuries—old meaning in our
culture. Nor can I support the call
for equality-before-disciplinary
action which Professor Marshall,
and persumably Professor
Berlinski, put forth, precisely
because it ignores the facts of
inequality of provocation, for
example, or such fact as that Black
individuals can be lumped under
the term "primitives" when this
stereotype would not be extended
even toSDS members.
At the same time I feel that
Professor Langmuir's letter
sidesteps what from London seems
a very saddening aspect of the
whole issue, while the other two
professors perpetuate this aspect
precisely in the same way that the
BSU participants raised it. That is,
neither side seems to have made a
distinction between attacks on
properly as such and on the
bookstore as purveyor of books. I
can't say I necessarily condone
attacks on property, but I can
sympathize with feeling the need
to prick the university's
institutional self-esteem and
provoke confrontation, and
university property is closely
connected with the university's
institutional self and the concerns

of administrators. But books are in
quite a different category. When
these cats attack books, it seems to
me, they are betraying the very
means of attaining what they say
they are fighting for: individual
and cultural identity and pride.
What Black student has not found
in books by Black authors, African
and American, as he has in the
works of Black musicians, his own
voice as a Black? A way out at last
from the "showing your color" of a
self-deprecating minority or the
equally horrible denial of self by
assimilation, which, until the
writings of Blacks became widely
available, were the alternatives
presented to an articulate Black?
When the professors lump
damage to books under damage to
property and the breaking of
institutional rules, they are
showing the extent to which the
materialism and Philistinism of
American culture are entrenched in
the university. When students
attack books in the same spirit in
which they break rules and damage
property, they are showing the
extent to which, in spite of their
own protestations, they still view
the university as merely an
instrument of material and social
advancement, the extent, in other
words, to which they are infected
with the same blight as the
professors. Both seem to have lost
view of the non-institutional goals
of the university. However exactly
one wishes to define these goals,
whether as a quest for knowledge,
human dignity, the expression of
spiritual values, or the building of
human communities on better
bases than we have been able to
erect heretofore, books, more than
rules and the material paraphenalia
of buildings, are essential
instruments in the struggle.

• Punishment Needed
Editor,THE DAILY:
Recent nation-wide student
disturbances, including those on
our own campus, have brought to
the fore the prevalence of the idea
that violence will achieve all goals
and will for the most part remain in
effect unpunished. Distressingly
this assumption appears to be valid.
We cannot allow this situation
to continue. If we do not mete out
punishments to violators of civil
law because we fear the future
actions of revolutionary groups,
then we open ourselves to either
anarchy or totalitarianism. Yet, if
we refuse to institute needed
reform, perhaps in reaction to the
means employed by protesting
groups, then we will suffer more
turbulence. We must have the
courage to resist violence and the
wisdom to welcome reform.
Revolutionaries must be willing
to accept the consequences of their
actions. These consequences must
be specific and firmly established.
Yet .the reforms suffered for must
be incorporated into society. Only
in this way will our society be able
to grow, to improve, to exist.

probability event that they will
refuse to develop any more
weapons.
Thus while a prevailing theme in
the opening speeches of Professors
Lederberg, Schiff and Drell and in
the whole March 4th movement is
the culpability of the government
in its use of scientific knowledge,
no one expressed astonishment
that the men needed to develop
and justify the more destructive
technological applications are
never in short supply.
A minority of the scientific
community is now demonstrating
that finding the thought modes of
generals and Southern politicians
attractive is not an inherent part of
a scientist's intellectual makeup.
The rest of this community needs
an education in making moral and
philosophical judgements. In the
meantime it would be wise for
science to humbly accept the aid of
men in the humanities who are
professionally accustomed to
examining their moral assumptions
and the internal consistency of
arguments not stated in equations.
It would be wise for Prof. Drell and
his colleagues to insist that they
will not advise the government
unless poets and philosophers are
equally represented.
We should not accept a set of
changes in the undergraduate
curriculum which does not increase
the young scientist's exposure to
the humanities. This university and
its departments must refuse
demands for ever more "efficient"
division of labor, must refuse to
produce any more half-men so
aptly described by Lawrence
Durrell as "thinking weeds."

• iVo Freedom In China
Editor, THE DAILY:
When Bruce Franklin was
speaking at the SDS rally
Wednesday noon, March 5, he
condemned the operating mode in
this country which is based on
rewards to those who do well (i.e.,
as a student if you do well you will
be able to enroll in the university of
your choice). According to his
argument this system must be
changed.
It seems rather odd that
Franklin, an avowed Maoist, would
condemn the reward system which
so strongly pervades Maoist party
operations. Direct and indirect
promotions and other rewards
within the party are certainly not
given for misbehavior. In Red
China there is no freedom of
expression granted to resistants of
the party, and to speak out against
those in power is to invite
banishment or execution.

Editor, THE DAILY:
In his letter to The Daily of
March 5, 1969, criticizing my
previous letter (of Feb. 27, 1969),
Charles Bergquist has apparently
misunderstood my remarks
concerning the panel discussion of

I tried to make is that the panel
arrived at some very broad

inadequate, unrepresentative

illustrate this by presenting a few
obviously conflicting examples.
Any further interpretation of my

Campus Immorality
Editor, THE DAILY:
Just as the citizens of this
country are under the jurisdiction
of the laws of this land, while the
U.S. government is under the
jurisdiction of no such laws, so the
students and faculty members of
this university are under the
jurisdiction of the laws of this
university, while the trustees are
under the jurisdiction of no such
laws.
And just as it is not legal for any
citizen of this country to kill
anyone else in this country, except
in self-defense (unless you are
black), while the government may
murder millions of people without
punishment, so it is not legal for
any student or faculty member of
this university to aid any killer,
while the trustees may aid the
government in murdering millions
without punishment.
The fact that certain individuals
are held responsible to laws which
other certain individuals are not is
immoral.
The fact that students and

allow such a system to be
perpetrated on them is an insult to

I was one of 2106 students to

it clear, however, that my idea as

from that of Harvey Hukari or

means that I accept the ROTC

• BSU And The Books
Editor,THE DAILY:
News from Stanford reaches
London with some delay, and if
this point has already been made in
your columns ignore my letter and
forgive the redundancy. I have
before me The Daily of February
28, specifically the two
communications by Gavin
Langmuir and Hubert Marshall
about the bookstore incident, and
private letters about the incident
itself and Professor Berlinski's
reaction to it. No doubt this is
inadequate information, yet I feel
strongly impelled to communicate
with you on the basis of it, from
the perspective of a member of the
Stanford community now abroad.
I strongly support Professor
Langmuir's view, that the use of
terms like "violence-enchanted
primitives" indicates a racism
which is perhaps all the more
deplorable for being unconscious.
No academic or intellectual has a
right any longer to use such terms
with innocence of their
centuries—old meaning in our
culture. Nor can I support the call
for equality-before-disciplinary
action which Professor Marshall,
and persumably Professor
Berlinski, put forth, precisely
because it ignores the facts of
inequality of provocation, for
example, or such fact as that Black
individuals can be lumped under
the term "primitives" when this
stereotype would not be extended
even toSDS members.
At the same time I feel that
Professor Langmuir's letter
sidesteps what from London seems
a very saddening aspect of the
whole issue, while the other two
professors perpetuate this aspect
precisely in the same way that the
BSU participants raised it. That is,
neither side seems to have made a
distinction between attacks on
properly as such and on the
bookstore as purveyor of books. I
can't say I necessarily condone
attacks on property, but I can
sympathize with feeling the need
to prick the university's
institutional self-esteem and
provoke confrontation, and
university property is closely
connected with the university's
institutional self and the concerns

of administrators. But books are in
quite a different category. When
these cats attack books, it seems to
me, they are betraying the very
means of attaining what they say
they are fighting for: individual
and cultural identity and pride.
What Black student has not found
in books by Black authors, African
and American, as he has in the
works of Black musicians, his own
voice as a Black? A way out at last
from the "showing your color" of a
self-deprecating minority or the
equally horrible denial of self by
assimilation, which, until the
writings of Blacks became widely
available, were the alternatives
presented to an articulate Black?
When the professors lump
damage to books under damage to
property and the breaking of
institutional rules, they are
showing the extent to which the
materialism and Philistinism of
American culture are entrenched in
the university. When students
attack books in the same spirit in
which they break rules and damage
property, they are showing the
extent to which, in spite of their
own protestations, they still view
the university as merely an
instrument of material and social
advancement, the extent, in other
words, to which they are infected
with the same blight as the
professors. Both seem to have lost
view of the non-institutional goals
of the university. However exactly
one wishes to define these goals,
whether as a quest for knowledge,
human dignity, the expression of
spiritual values, or the building of
human communities on better
bases than we have been able to
erect heretofore, books, more than
rules and the material paraphenalia
of buildings, are essential
instruments in the struggle.

• Punishment Needed
Editor,THE DAILY:
Recent nation-wide student
disturbances, including those on
our own campus, have brought to
the fore the prevalence of the idea
that violence will achieve all goals
and will for the most part remain in
effect unpunished. Distressingly
this assumption appears to be valid.
We cannot allow this situation
to continue. If we do not mete out
punishments to violators of civil
law because we fear the future
actions of revolutionary groups,
then we open ourselves to either
anarchy or totalitarianism. Yet, if
we refuse to institute needed
reform, perhaps in reaction to the
means employed by protesting
groups, then we will suffer more
turbulence. We must have the
courage to resist violence and the
wisdom to welcome reform.
Revolutionaries must be willing
to accept the consequences of their
actions. These consequences must
be specific and firmly established.
Yet .the reforms suffered for must
be incorporated into society. Only
in this way will our society be able
to grow, to improve, to exist.
JUDITH A.HANKS
Editor,THE DAILY:
If I may, I'd like to begin by
simply accusing The Daily of
"yellow journalism." The article
entitled Impressions From
'Relevant Rush' was blatantly and
falsely accusing each and every
fraternity of never relenting
shallowness and total lack of real
concern for the environment needs
of every Stanford student.
The anonymous author who
signed himself Aquarius (I'd be
ashamed to have an article like that
attributed to me too.) mentioned
"some of the old generalizations
about 'frat life' "without ever
specifying what they were. I
assume he was speaking to that
myth which labels fraternities as
''a nt i-intellectua I'' or
"a-intellectual." The separate
fraternities and jointly through
IFC have all been involved in
programs, to a greater or lesser
extent depending on the individual
fraternity, to have professors to
meals, seminars in the houses (and
available to the entire university),
guest-in-residence programs, etc.
All the houses are working on
some sort of self-improvement
program to make them more
relevant, but we are hindered by
two main factors.
One has to do with the mood on
campus, led by The Daily, which
sees fraternities in a particularly
bad light. This feeling, it seems to
me, comes from the fraternity
image borrowed from other
campuses as much as from the
realities of the past here at
Stanford—both poor standards to
use when judging today's situation.
By seeing that this image is passed
on, The Daily and others guarantee
that many perspective rushees
make the same kind of judgement
against fraternities (a superficial
one) which these same people
constantly accuse fraternities of
doing during Rush.
The second factor hindering our
attempts to gain greater relevance
has to do with money. Fraternities
are run as separate ard individual
businesses. We do not have
university funds to back up our
attempts to bring in guests and
speakers and more varied programs
which would see that fraternities
know a greater involvement within
the Stanford community. It is not
that we would not like to be more
involved in most cases, rather it is
that we cannot afford it, as
university owned dormitories can.
Even though one-third of the male
undergraduate student-body
resides in fraternities, we get no
assistance financially from the
university.
As Aquarius mentioned,
changes are being made, perhaps
too slowly, but we are thinking and
trying. The important thing is not
to judge us before you know what
we are all about now and where we
pointed for the future. If there are
questions which are important to
you, as a Rushee, ask them. We
can't possibly know all the things
which you are interested in, but we
would be interested in discussing
them with you. Try us; and please
don't judge before you have!
As to The Daily, I would think
that your reporters would do
better to stick to facts and figures
and not write about their own
subjective judgements based upon
hearsay or one or two houses
visited for a few moments.

• Moral Responsibility
Editor,THE DAILY:
The March 4th sessions I
attended paid scant attention to
some important points. Both in
supplying supposedly pure
technical information used in
setting government priorities and
in choosing research projects
within the ill-considered but still
surprisingly broad areas which are
well funded, scientists are making
weighty moral decisions and value
judgements.
Prof. Drell and the men from
RAND furnish more than
probabilities of possible
technological developments. The
assessment of such probabilities
cannot be made without a set of
psychological and historical
assumptions concerning the
"opponent" and the political
future. These men show a strong
predilection for assumptions which

preclude dispassionate and
complete consideration of all
possible sets of events.
Furthermore, they usually present
recommendations with their
forecasts. Even in game theory the
probabilities of events must be
multiplied by their values to find
the best course of action.
The impossibility of separating
technological from moral
judgement is matched by its
irresponsibility. I urge Prof. Drell
and his colleagues to include in
their next technological forecast to
the government the high
probability event that they will
refuse to develop any more
weapons.
Thus while a prevailing theme in
the opening speeches of Professors
Lederberg, Schiff and Drell and in

• BSU And The Books
Editor,THE DAILY:
News from Stanford reaches
London with some delay, and if
this point has already been made in
your columns ignore my letter and
forgive the redundancy. I have
before me The Daily of February
28, specifically the two
communications by Gavin
Langmuir and Hubert Marshall
about the bookstore incident, and
private letters about the incident
itself and Professor Berlinski's
reaction to it. No doubt this is
inadequate information, yet I feel
strongly impelled to communicate
with you on the basis of it, from
the perspective of a member of the
Stanford community now abroad.
I strongly support Professor
Langmuir's view, that the use of
terms like "violence-enchanted
primitives" indicates a racism
which is perhaps all the more
deplorable for being unconscious.
No academic or intellectual has a
right any longer to use such terms
with innocence of their
centuries—old meaning in our
culture. Nor can I support the call
for equality-before-disciplinary
action which Professor Marshall,
and persumably Professor
Berlinski, put forth, precisely
because it ignores the facts of
inequality of provocation, for
example, or such fact as that Black
individuals can be lumped under
the term "primitives" when this
stereotype would not be extended
even toSDS members.
At the same time I feel that
Professor Langmuir's letter
sidesteps what from London seems
a very saddening aspect of the
whole issue, while the other two
professors perpetuate this aspect
precisely in the same way that the
BSU participants raised it. That is,
neither side seems to have made a
distinction between attacks on
properly as such and on the
bookstore as purveyor of books. I
can't say I necessarily condone
attacks on property, but I can
sympathize with feeling the need
to prick the university's
institutional self-esteem and
provoke confrontation, and
university property is closely
connected with the university's
institutional self and the concerns

of administrators. But books are in
quite a different category. When
these cats attack books, it seems to
me, they are betraying the very
means of attaining what they say
they are fighting for: individual
and cultural identity and pride.
What Black student has not found
in books by Black authors, African
and American, as he has in the
works of Black musicians, his own
voice as a Black? A way out at last
from the "showing your color" of a
self-deprecating minority or the
equally horrible denial of self by
assimilation, which, until the
writings of Blacks became widely
available, were the alternatives
presented to an articulate Black?
When the professors lump
damage to books under damage to
property and the breaking of
institutional rules, they are
showing the extent to which the
materialism and Philistinism of
American culture are entrenched in
the university. When students
attack books in the same spirit in
which they break rules and damage
property, they are showing the
extent to which, in spite of their
own protestations, they still view
the university as merely an
instrument of material and social
advancement, the extent, in other
words, to which they are infected
with the same blight as the
professors. Both seem to have lost
view of the non-institutional goals
of the university. However exactly
one wishes to define these goals,
whether as a quest for knowledge,
human dignity, the expression of
spiritual values, or the building of
human communities on better
bases than we have been able to
erect heretofore, books, more than
rules and the material paraphenalia
of buildings, are essential
instruments in the struggle.

• Punishment Needed
Editor,THE DAILY:
Recent nation-wide student
disturbances, including those on
our own campus, have brought to
the fore the prevalence of the idea
that violence will achieve all goals
and will for the most part remain in
effect unpunished. Distressingly
this assumption appears to be valid.
We cannot allow this situation
to continue. If we do not mete out
punishments to violators of civil
law because we fear the future
actions of revolutionary groups,
then we open ourselves to either
anarchy or totalitarianism. Yet, if
we refuse to institute needed
reform, perhaps in reaction to the
means employed by protesting
groups, then we will suffer more
turbulence. We must have the
courage to resist violence and the
wisdom to welcome reform.
Revolutionaries must be willing
to accept the consequences of their
actions. These consequences must
be specific and firmly established.
Yet .the reforms suffered for must
be incorporated into society. Only
in this way will our society be able
to grow, to improve, to exist.
JUDITH A.HANKS
Editor,THE DAILY:
If I may, I'd like to begin by
simply accusing The Daily of
"yellow journalism." The article
entitled Impressions From
'Relevant Rush' was blatantly and
falsely accusing each and every
fraternity of never relenting
shallowness and total lack of real
concern for the environment needs
of every Stanford student.
The anonymous author who
signed himself Aquarius (I'd be
ashamed to have an article like that
attributed to me too.) mentioned
"some of the old generalizations
about 'frat life' "without ever
specifying what they were. I
assume he was speaking to that
myth which labels fraternities as
''a nt i-intellectua I'' or
"a-intellectual." The separate
fraternities and jointly through
IFC have all been involved in
programs, to a greater or lesser
extent depending on the individual
fraternity, to have professors to
meals, seminars in the houses (and
available to the entire university),
guest-in-residence programs, etc.
All the houses are working on
some sort of self-improvement
program to make them more
relevant, but we are hindered by
two main factors.
One has to do with the mood on
campus, led by The Daily, which
sees fraternities in a particularly
bad light. This feeling, it seems to
me, comes from the fraternity
image borrowed from other
campuses as much as from the
realities of the past here at
Stanford—both poor standards to
use when judging today's situation.
By seeing that this image is passed
on, The Daily and others guarantee
that many perspective rushees
make the same kind of judgement
against fraternities (a superficial
one) which these same people
constantly accuse fraternities of
doing during Rush.
The second factor hindering our
attempts to gain greater relevance
has to do with money. Fraternities
are run as separate ard individual
businesses. We do not have
university funds to back up our
attempts to bring in guests and
speakers and more varied programs
which would see that fraternities
know a greater involvement within
the Stanford community. It is not
that we would not like to be more
involved in most cases, rather it is
that we cannot afford it, as
university owned dormitories can.
Even though one-third of the male
undergraduate student-body
resides in fraternities, we get no
assistance financially from the
university.
As Aquarius mentioned,
changes are being made, perhaps
too slowly, but we are thinking and
trying. The important thing is not
to judge us before you know what
we are all about now and where we
pointed for the future. If there are
questions which are important to
you, as a Rushee, ask them. We
can't possibly know all the things
which you are interested in, but we
would be interested in discussing
them with you. Try us; and please
don't judge before you have!
As to The Daily, I would think
that your reporters would do
better to stick to facts and figures
and not write about their own
subjective judgements based upon
hearsay or one or two houses
visited for a few moments.

• Moral Responsibility
Editor,THE DAILY:
The March 4th sessions I
attended paid scant attention to
some important points. Both in
supplying supposedly pure
technical information used in
setting government priorities and
in choosing research projects
within the ill-considered but still
surprisingly broad areas which are
well funded, scientists are making
weighty moral decisions and value
judgements.
Prof. Drell and the men from
RAND furnish more than
probabilities of possible
technological developments. The
assessment of such probabilities
cannot be made without a set of
psychological and historical
assumptions concerning the
"opponent" and the political
future. These men show a strong
predilection for assumptions which

preclude dispassionate and
complete consideration of all
possible sets of events.
Furthermore, they usually present
recommendations with their
forecasts. Even in game theory the
probabilities of events must be
multiplied by their values to find
the best course of action.
The impossibility of separating
technological from moral
judgement is matched by its
irresponsibility. I urge Prof. Drell
and his colleagues to include in
their next technological forecast to
the government the high
probability event that they will
refuse to develop any more
weapons.
Thus while a prevailing theme in
the opening speeches of Professors
Lederberg, Schiff and Drell and in
the whole March 4th movement is
the culpability of the government
in its use of scientific knowledge,
no one expressed astonishment
that the men needed to develop
and justify the more destructive
technological applications are
never in short supply.
A minority of the scientific
community is now demonstrating
that finding the thought modes of
generals and Southern politicians
attractive is not an inherent part of
a scientist's intellectual makeup.
The rest of this community needs
an education in making moral and
philosophical judgements. In the
meantime it would be wise for
science to humbly accept the aid of
men in the humanities who are
professionally accustomed to
examining their moral assumptions
and the internal consistency of
arguments not stated in equations.
It would be wise for Prof. Drell and
his colleagues to insist that they
will not advise the government
unless poets and philosophers are
equally represented.
We should not accept a set of
changes in the undergraduate
curriculum which does not increase
the young scientist's exposure to
the humanities. This university and
its departments must refuse
demands for ever more "efficient"
division of labor, must refuse to
produce any more half-men so
aptly described by Lawrence
Durrell as "thinking weeds."

• iVo Freedom In China
Editor, THE DAILY:
When Bruce Franklin was
speaking at the SDS rally
Wednesday noon, March 5, he
condemned the operating mode in
this country which is based on
rewards to those who do well (i.e.,
as a student if you do well you will
be able to enroll in the university of
your choice). According to his
argument this system must be
changed.
It seems rather odd that
Franklin, an avowed Maoist, would
condemn the reward system which
so strongly pervades Maoist party
operations. Direct and indirect
promotions and other rewards
within the party are certainly not
given for misbehavior. In Red
China there is no freedom of
expression granted to resistants of
the party, and to speak out against
those in power is to invite
banishment or execution.

• Misunderstood
Editor, THE DAILY:
In his letter to The Daily of
March 5, 1969, criticizing my
previous letter (of Feb. 27, 1969),
Charles Bergquist has apparently
misunderstood my remarks
concerning the panel discussion of
graduate education. The only point
I tried to make is that the panel
arrived at some very broad
generalizations concerning
graduate education based upon an
inadequate, unrepresentative
sample of opinions. I attempted to
illustrate this by presenting a few
obviously conflicting examples.
Any further interpretation of my
examples or remarks, especially
with respect to my "narrow
technocratic world view", is to
repeat the errors of the panel on
graduate education—to extrapolate
from an inadequate sample of data
to vast, nonsensical
generalizations.

Campus Immorality
Editor, THE DAILY:
Just as the citizens of this
country are under the jurisdiction
of the laws of this land, while the
U.S. government is under the
jurisdiction of no such laws, so the
students and faculty members of
this university are under the
jurisdiction of the laws of this
university, while the trustees are
under the jurisdiction of no such
laws.
And just as it is not legal for any
citizen of this country to kill
anyone else in this country, except
in self-defense (unless you are
black), while the government may
murder millions of people without
punishment, so it is not legal for
any student or faculty member of
this university to aid any killer,
while the trustees may aid the
government in murdering millions
without punishment.
The fact that certain individuals
are held responsible to laws which
other certain individuals are not is
immoral.
The fact that students and
faculty members at this university
allow such a system to be
perpetrated on them is an insult to
their humanity.

reform, perhaps in reaction to the
means employed by protesting
groups, then we will suffer more
turbulence. We must have the
courage to resist violence and the
wisdom to welcome reform.
Revolutionaries must be willing
to accept the consequences of their
actions. These consequences must
be specific and firmly established.
Yet .the reforms suffered for must
be incorporated into society. Only
in this way will our society be able
to grow, to improve, to exist.
