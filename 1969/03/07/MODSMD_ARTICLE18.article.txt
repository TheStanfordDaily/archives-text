## Protests 'Racist Classic' 
### 
I am a father, an Afro American
and a Stanford student. As any
father worth his salt I feel an
obligation to protect the minds of
my son and other innocent black
children from the racist poison that
awaits them at every turn in white
America. As an Afro American I
believe that the dignity of black
people is worth fighting for and by
any means necessary. As a student
on this campus I expect that the
facilities and services for which I
pay should not be employed to
defame or oppress me. It is on these
counts that I strongly object to the
kind of trash you have chosen to
display for sale in the section on
children's literature in your store.
Of all the well done children's
books on the market today you
have chosen some illustrated in the
most grotesque fashion. Moreover
of all the hundred odd volumes
displayed only three seemed to
contain any reference to black
people at all. But more than
anything else I take the displaying
for sale The Story of Little Black
Sam bo as a callous and vicious
attack on the dignity of the Afro
American family and black people
as a whole. I object to this attack as
much as I would object to anyone
peddling the view that black people
are basically colorful, happy go
lucky animals whose eyes bulge
when frightened, who have names
like Black Sambo, Black Mumbo
and Black Jumbo and easily gobble
down 241 pancakes at a time. The
damage and violence done to a
people who have been the objects
of racist oppression for over four
hundred years is often comedy to
their oppressors but to the
oppressed it is the very seed from
which violent relatiation is born.
This is a fact not a threat.
I will not take the time to
protest your apparent willingness
to go to any extent to make a buck
apparently wherever and however
it can be made—even at the expense
of our human dignity. But I do
believe that possibly today's young
children might remain healthy save
for the desire of older but more
deformed minds to mold them in
their racist images.
Of course it is possible that the
decisions which have resulted in
the kind of material I found in your
children's section was the work of
just one or a few individuals. In
that case the appearance of the
book, Little Black Sambo would
not necessarily reflect the
sentiments of the management. In
this case I strongly suggest and

hope that you will take immediate
steps to:
—Withdraw the racist classic
from sale.
—Take steps to insure that
personnel who would peddle such
poison not remain in your employ.
—Issue an apology and notice of
the bools removal to the Stanford
community and black students
specifically.

—Improve and widen your
selection of children's literature
containing integrated material and
other books about Afro American
and African people.
I believe that these suggestions
are not unreasonable but in fact
fair and just. A copy of this letter is
in the hands of the Executive
Committee of the Stanford BSU.
