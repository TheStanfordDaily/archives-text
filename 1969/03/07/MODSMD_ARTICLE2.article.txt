# Writing Requirement: Senate Yes, SEC No
## 
### SUSAN SWARD 
In their first formal decision making
on the Study of Education at Stanford,
the Student Education Council (SEC)
and the Faculty Senate have already had
a parting of the ways.
The Faculty Senate voted without
dissent yesterday to endorse the SES
proposal on the writing experience at
Stanford. The proposal would require a 2
quarter or 1 semester writing course.
Leonard Schiff, chairman of the
Academic Senate, spoke about the
motivation behind the Senate's vote.
"The basic motivation was the
consideration that it is important that
everyone have a competence in writing
and expred expression," Schiff said.
"There was no disagreement in the
Senate as to the underlying objectives."
The Senate Chairman pointed out that
disagreement did occur over the best
method by which to attain this
proficiency in writing. The fact that the
SES committee had considered this

question for a long time did influence the
Senate's thinking on the matter,
according to Schiff.
"After all," he said, "the committee
met for almost two years and put a
considerable amount of faculty-student
in-put into that report."
The Education Council, an elected
group of 40 students, yesterday voted
against any writing requirement. The
Council adopted a proposal by a
substantial margin which states that there
be no required writing experience as a
prerequisite for for graduation from
Stanford.
According to Michael Kuhl, a junior in
economics and a member of the
Education Council Steering Committee,
the proposal "futher suggested that an
institute for interpersonal relations be
established similar to the proposition
outlined by Mr. Hastings of Speech &
Drama.
"This particular institute would assist
those students who wanted to improve
their writing and speaking or who
were directed to the institute by a
faculty member to improve a piece
of writing.
"And finally, the institute
would offer no required courses
nor adminster a test of writing
proficiency. It is expected the
students would play a significant
part in the formation of this
institute," Kuhl said.
The differences of opinion
between the two groups will be
worked in a conference committee
composed of four students from
the Education Council and four
faculty from the Senate.
The Education Council and the
Senate will meet jointly in Bishop
Auditorium next Thursday at
3:15. The meeting will be for the
purpose of considering the last
block of proposals 1-5 on
undergraduate education in the
SES report.
