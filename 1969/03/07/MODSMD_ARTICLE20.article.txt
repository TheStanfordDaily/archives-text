# Honor Code Clarified

### 
In an attempt to clear up
confusion regarding the
applicability of the Honor Code to
"take-home" examinations, the
Student Judicial Council yesterday
released several recommendations
to explain the situation.
The Council suggested that
instructors giving the exams print
on the cover section A.(2) of the
Honor Code: "That (students) will
not give nor receive aid in
examination; that they will not
give or receive unpermitted aid in
class work, in the preparation of
reports, or in any other work that is
to be used by the instructor as the
basis of grading."
It should also be made clear to
the student "specifically what
resource materials may be used
while taking the examination."
Where no collaboration is
permitted, the instructor should
explain that "after the
examination has begun no student
taking the exam may consult with
another person ... to obtain from
his answers . . ."
