Smoke Signals is run as a service to the university community. If
you have an irritating, upsetting, nagging or generally unpleasant
problem, let us know and we'll try to help you out. If you have an
interesting and provocative question, let us know and we'll try to
answer it. All questions should be written out and addressed to Smoke
Signals, c/o The Daily. No questions will be accepted over the phone.
Names must be included with all questions, but publication of names
will be withheld upon request.

READER: Why isn't there an elementary photograph course at
Stanford?
Jeff Fuller, Roble
SS: Professor Lorenz Eitner, art department chairman, told Smoke
Signals "There is nothing we would like more than to teach a course in
both practice and theory of photography." However, he said there is
no budget for such a course and there is no one to teach it.

READER: I have heard that you don't have to pay parking tickets. Is
this true?
Lang Atwood, Larkin, Stern
SS: ASSU Vice President Victor von Schlegell told Smoke Signals that
the correct method for dealing with parking tickets is to pay them first,
then appeal the ticket by sending the receipt for the ticket to the
Stanford Judicial Council. Daniel De Young, assistant to the business
manager, said that all ticket appeals are being granted, pending a study
of parking problems by a special committee, which will publish their
findings shortly. "Everyone is supposed to pay, but in many cases the
faculty and staff don't," De Young said. The disparity was the reason
that Judicial Council decided last year to grant all appeals until equal
enforcement of fines was possible.

READER: Is there a grocery store which stays open all night anywhere
around Stanford?
Don Hudson, Professional Journalism Fellow
SS: The nearest all-night grocery store is at the Hillsdale Shopping
Center, on El Camino. The shopping center is about twenty minutes
going north on the Bayshore, or on El Camino (if you're driving fast
and it's three o'clock a.m.).
