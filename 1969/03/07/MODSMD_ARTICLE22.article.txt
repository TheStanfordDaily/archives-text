# Concert To Feature 'Graphic Music'
## 
### LETA ZUCKERMAN 
A new musical notation? That's
what the musicians of Alea II
thought when they were faced with
"scores" consisting of an irregular
series of horizontal and vertical
lines.
The work, composed by Earl
Brown, is the first piece of graphic
music written. Players and
conductor improvise from this
score.
Alea 11, Stanford's newly
organized group for the
performance of modern music, will
present this work on its first
concert on March 9. The program
will take place in the Tresidder

Large Lounge at 8:30 p.m.
Admission is free.
The group is under the direction
of Theodore Antoniou, Stanford's
composer-in-residence. Mr.
Antoniou's works have been
performed extensively both here
and in Europe and several of them
are scheduled for Stanford
programs next quarter.
Other works that will be
featured on Sunday's concert are
Krzysztof Penderecki's
"Miniatures" for violin and piano,
to be performed by Anthony
Doheny and Kenneth Ziegenfuss
John Cage's "In a Landscape"
with Enid Feld, solo harpist
Edgard Varese's "Density
21.5," featuring Leta Zuckerman,
flutist
Allen Johnson's "Septet"
Martin Bresnick's "Introit
1969" for 16 wind instruments
Varese's "Octandre"
Johnson and Bresnick are both
graduate students in composition
at Stanford. Their works were
especially commissioned for this
group.
Varese is one of thyoutstanding
figures in modern composition. His
"Density 21.5" was written at the
request of the famous flutist,
Georges Barrere in honor of his
new platinum flute. 21.5 is the
density of platinum.
John Cage is widely known for
his avant-garde techniques and his
use of noise-making devices in his
music. His work for solo harp
appears to be just a clever joke.
Penderecki is a young Polish
composer. He is here represented
by one of his earlier works (1962).
