## Dogs Enjoy Union Food 
### JENNY MATTHEWS 
Tresidder Union is going to the
dogs.
At least, that's what one
professor remarked as a nimble
canine jumped up on his tray and
devoured two doughnuts last week.
According to Union supervisor
Duane Munk, the increasing
number of dogs who find their way
into Tresidder constitute "a serious
health hazard" as well as a terrible
food-swiping nuisance.
Animals are not allowed by law
to be in the Union or any
food-serving establishment, but
although the regular group of dogs
surrounding the area have mastered
opening the automatic doors,
they've obviously never bothered
to read the signs.
Most of these free-loading dogs
are not strays, but simply pets who
are let loose while their owners
attend classes. While some owners
are unaware of all the trouble their
pets are causing, others refuse to
take any action.
An Umbrella-Wielding Lady
Attempts to remove animals
from the food area are often met

with violent reactions. According
to one story, the last time the
county dog catcher tried to
apprehend a dog in the Union, a
lady attacked him with an
umbrella.
The woman was even supposed
to have threatened a law suit based
on "cruelty to animals" although it
was never established that she was
the owner. Needless to say, the dog
catcher hasn't been back since.
The only existing way that
animals can be removed from the
Union is by the issuing of a
complaint by Tresidder officials
against a specific dog. The Stanford
police are then requested to
apprehend the animal and hold it
"in custody" until the proper city
authorities can come on campus
and pick it up.
Keeping an animal in custody,
however, is quite a difficult feat,
explained one police officer. Dogs
have been known to escape
confinement and quickly make
themselves scarce.
In addition to the health hazard,
however, Tresidder employees find
it almost impossible to keep
animals away from dirty trays and
from literally attacking customers.

Recently a group of dogs swarmed
into the Union chasing a hysterical
mouse. The mouse was captured by
several students but the
disappointed dogs remained.
One pooch uses the technique
of resting his nose next to a
customer's tray and simply staring
pitifully at the food until the
guilt-ridden person relents and
shares some. This dog has his more
unselfish aspects, however, for he
often spends time sitting by the
electric door, holding it open so his
friends can pass through freely.
Tresidder officials are hesitant
to enforce any strict removal
system, despite emphatic
complaints from many employees,
because of the recent
"anti-Tresidder" sentiment that
has been circulating around the
campus. It is hoped that pet owners
will take it upon themselves to
alleviate the situation.
One suggestion was made to
lengthen a popular campus slogan
to "Pigs off the campus . . . and
dogs out of the Union." At any
rate, a lot of "anti-animal" feelings
among Tresidder customers may
force some kind of corrective
measure.


THE DOGGIE DINER-T residder .Memorial Union has in recent weeks accomodated more customers than it was originally
intended. These dining above have devised a plan in which one dog sits on the electric door and all the others spontaneously
rush in. Thus I'ar it has worked and from all indications the dogs will he allowed to continue to "liberate" the cafeteria each
day.

The only existing way that
animals can be removed from the
Union is by the issuing of a
complaint by Tresidder officials
against a specific dog. The Stanford
police are then requested to
apprehend the animal and hold it
"in custody" until the proper city
authorities can come on campus
and pick it up.
Keeping an animal in custody,
however, is quite a difficult feat,
explained one police officer. Dogs
have been known to escape
confinement and quickly make
themselves scarce.
In addition to the health hazard,
however, Tresidder employees find
it almost impossible to keep
animals away from dirty trays and
from literally attacking customers.

Recently a group of dogs swarmed
into the Union chasing a hysterical
mouse. The mouse was captured by
several students but the
disappointed dogs remained.
One pooch uses the technique
of resting his nose next to a
customer's tray and simply staring
pitifully at the food until the
guilt-ridden person relents and
shares some. This dog has his more
unselfish aspects, however, for he
often spends time sitting by the
electric door, holding it open so his
friends can pass through freely.
Tresidder officials are hesitant
to enforce any strict removal
system, despite emphatic
complaints from many employees,
because of the recent
"anti-Tresidder" sentiment that
has been circulating around the
campus. It is hoped that pet owners
will take it upon themselves to
alleviate the situation.
One suggestion was made to
lengthen a popular campus slogan
to "Pigs off the campus . . . and
dogs out of the Union." At any
rate, a lot of "anti-animal" feelings
among Tresidder customers may
force some kind of corrective
measure.


THE DOGGIE DINER-T residder .Memorial Union has in recent weeks accomodated more customers than it was originally
intended. These dining above have devised a plan in which one dog sits on the electric door and all the others spontaneously
rush in. Thus I'ar it has worked and from all indications the dogs will he allowed to continue to "liberate" the cafeteria each
day.
Tresidder Union is going to the
dogs.
At least, that's what one
professor remarked as a nimble
canine jumped up on his tray and
devoured two doughnuts last week.
According to Union supervisor
Duane Munk, the increasing
number of dogs who find their way
into Tresidder constitute "a serious
health hazard" as well as a terrible
food-swiping nuisance.
Animals are not allowed by law
to be in the Union or any
food-serving establishment, but
although the regular group of dogs
surrounding the area have mastered
opening the automatic doors,
they've obviously never bothered
to read the signs.
Most of these free-loading dogs
are not strays, but simply pets who
are let loose while their owners
attend classes. While some owners
are unaware of all the trouble their
pets are causing, others refuse to
take any action.
An Umbrella-Wielding Lady
Attempts to remove animals
from the food area are often met

with violent reactions. According
to one story, the last time the
county dog catcher tried to
apprehend a dog in the Union, a
lady attacked him with an
umbrella.
The woman was even supposed
to have threatened a law suit based
on "cruelty to animals" although it
was never established that she was
the owner. Needless to say, the dog
catcher hasn't been back since.
