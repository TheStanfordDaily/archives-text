# Well-Rounded RA's Needed
## 
### KIM THORBURN 
Applicants are now being
sought for graduate residents for
next year. Graduate residents
include tutors in all-freshmen
houses and resident assistants
(RA's) in integrated houses.
The selection system has been
altered this year. In the past
applications have been reviewed by
the Dean of Students Office and
dormitory directors.
Applicants for next year will be
interviewed by a committee
including Sally Mahoney and Bob
Rosch of the Dean of Students
Office, the directors of the seven
dormitories, three faculty
residents, three current RA's and
three undergraduates.
According to Sally Mahoney the
committee will be seeking certain
"general qualities" in the
applicants. "It is hoped that we will
be able to provide the applicant
with information of what is
expected of him during the
screening process," she said.
Transition Period
"This is a transition period in
the definition of the role of the

graduate resident," she continued.
"The new selection process should
further the change."
The chairman of the committee
is Margie Golden, director of
Florence Moore. "The graduate
resident must be able to serve as a
creative and intellectual stimulus,"
she emphasized.
"Some of the qualities of a good
graduate resident are availability,
the ability to relate to students and
be sensitive to their needs, the
ability to serve as "catalyst" in
creating programs and developing
student ideas, the ability to help
out with immediate problems, and
leadership."
Respond to Needs
Miss Mahoney said that the
graduate resident must "work at
responding to the needs of the
house. This requires time,
emotional energy and willingness."
Sh irley Pepper, an
undergraduate RA at Lagunitaand
a member of the selection
committee, noted that "the RA
must be able to step out of his own
problems and forget about himself.
He must be prepared to help other

people find answers," she
emphasized.
An RA in an all-male dorm said
that the graduate resident must
serve "subtle guidance functions."
"We often do things that are similar
in form to the activities of the
undergraduates but the purpose
and understanding behind them are
different. We must project this
understanding," he continued.
Important Characteristics
He listed several important
characteristics: "The RA must be a
friend for those who have no
friends in the University. He must
provide an intellectual challenge to
those who have set ideas. He has to
be able to listen and to initiate and
guide house activities. In order to
catch problems before they arise,
he must know the people in his
house."
One RA in an all-women's dorm
said that she liked her job as an RA
better than her graduate work.
"The most satisfying part of the
job is the responsibility for people.
The RA must be more than a
friend. It demands a lot of
oneself," she said.
Several undergraduates were
asked what they expected from the
graduate resident. One freshman in
Florence Moore said that she must
be a "jack-of-all-trades." She
continued "The RA must be a
friend for the kids who don't have
friends and a confidante for all the
students in the house."
Applications are due March 15.
Current graduate residents may
reapply and students who have
been at Stanford before are given
preference. There are currently
many openings for women.
