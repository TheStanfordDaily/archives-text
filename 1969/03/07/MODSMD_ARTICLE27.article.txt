# Yeats' 'Cuchulain' To Recreate Legend From Irish Folklore
## 
### 
A mythical sofciety calling itself
the Cuchulain Community has
emerged at Stanford University. Its
creation was inspired by the Irish
dramatist and poet, W.B. Yeats,
and its development has been
guided by Director Paul Rebillot.
Under the auspices of the
Department of Speech and Drama,
the Community invites the public
to witness the birth, life, and
destruction of its world as
portrayed in four poetic dramas,
jointly titled "Cuchulain," and to
participate in a medieval feast.
"Cuchulain" will be presented
at 6 p.m., Mar. 12, 13, 14 and 15 in
the Little Theater. The Gaelic feast
which will permit guests to
participate in the creation of the
ritual and legend that is Cuchulain
will be celebrated at the close of
the second play.
The Cuchulain legend haunted
W. B. Yeats for over half a century.
Obsessed with the mythical hero of
Irish folklore, Yeats wrote a cycle
of poetic dramas. The four that will
be presented by the Cuchulain
Community are "At the Hawk's
Well," "On Baile's Strand," "The
Only Jealousy of Emer," and"The
Death of Cuchulain."
According to Rebillot,
"Cuchulain" tells the history of
Western man in ritualistic,
symbolic images. The dance,
music, and masks which have been
created by the actors themselves
are an integral part of this history.
Rebillot believes that the
audience should actively
contribute to the evolution of the
Cuchulain Community. To achieve
this sense of involvement, a feast
consisting of a variety of meats,
cheese, fruit, bread, and cider will
be served the audience between the
presentation of the second and
third plays.
Feast Planned
The feast will be held in the
foyer of Memorial Hall at a
tremendous banquet table, and the
area will be decorated with colorful
medieval banners and tapestries. A
procession of servants will carry in
the huge platters of food. The
banquet will be as authentic as
possible, even to the lack of forks
and spoons. Those wishing to carve
their meat themselves are urged to
bring paring knives.
Douglas Russell has designed
over fifty costumes for
"Cuchulain," the largest number to
be created for any Stanford
production in the past four years.
The costumes reflect the different
levels of human society that are
represented in each of the plays.

From the crude, formless
costumes that reflect a primitive,
almost inhuman, civilization in "At
Hawk's Well," Russell begins to use
geometric shapes and heavy, rough
materials that suggest an age of war
in "On Baile's Strand."
In "The Only Jealousy of
Emer," the costumes become
elegant, the jewelry polished to
represent the heights to which
society can rise. But in the final
play, "The Death of Cuchulain,"
the costumes return to barbaric
primitivism and anihilation.
Destruction
Director Rebillot sees "The
Death of Cuchulain" as the

destruction of civilization and he
equates the resulting holocaust
with the state of present day
society.
"We live today in a society that
is near its end, and unless we learn
to listen to and encourage what is
happening in the young, spiritual
minds of this country, our society
will destroy itself."
