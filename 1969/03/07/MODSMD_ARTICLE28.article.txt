# MASC Names 5 To Search Group
## 
### 
Five students chosen by the
M ex ican-American Student
Confederation (MASC) are serving
on a 10-man search committee to
find a high-ranking University
officer to work with the
Mexican-American community at
Stanford.
President Kenneth S. Pitzer has
accounced that Prof. John J.
Johnson, history, will assume the
chairmanship of the group, since
Assistant Provost James E.
Simmons requested to be relieved
of this responsibility because of the
great pressure of other duties.
Student members of the
committee, which has been
meeting about a month, include
MASC Chairman Rodolfo Cancino,
a law student residing on campus;
Luis Nogales, former MASC
chairman and law student from
Calexico; Jose Martinez, a
freshman from Caruthers; Jesse
Aguirre, sophomore history major
from Timnath, Col., and Mrs.
Annie Gutierrez Marlow, law
student from Westmorland.
Other members, besides
Johnson and Simmons, are Prof.
Jose Aguilar of the Medical School,
MASC faculty adviser; Joseph C.
Scroggs, personnel director; and
Robert E. Freelen, program
director of the Alumni
Association.
Pitzer recently announced plans
to appoint two individuals, one
black and one Mexicanâ€”American,
as assistants to the president. In
informing the search committee of
their charge, he said: "In view of
the pending change in Mr.
Simmons' title, it will probably be
best to use the title, 'assistant to
the president' for his position.
"Because of the many needs in
this area, however, the man best
able to contribute should be sought
and his title adjusted to his
interests and his experience. More
than one person will be needed
eventually."
Enrollment of minority
students at Stanford increased
from an estimated 175 last year to
291 this year. The freshman class
included about 75 black students
and 15 Mexican-Americans. Total
enrollment of Mexican-Americans
now is 57, including 39
undergraduates. The University has

committed itself to try and enroll
about 350 students from minority
groups by this fall.
In November, MASC "strongly
requested" the University to admit
100 new Mexican-American
students next year and called for
employment of individual
Mexican-Americans on a full-time
basis in the provost's staff,
admissions, and counseling office.
Discussion of these requests led to
the present search.
