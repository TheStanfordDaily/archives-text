# Lecture To Explain Scientology Theory
## 
### 
"In and Out of the Physical
Universe" is the provocative title of
a lecture to be given by Bruce
Bishop, one of the world's most
highly trained Scientologists, in
TMU 270, on Thursday, March 13,
at 7:30 p.m. Mr. Bishop will discuss
communication, awareness, and
the full viewpoint of Scientology,
the rapidly expanding
religious-philosophical movement
founded by American author L.
Ron Hubbard in 1950.
Mr. Bishop has attained the
state of "Clear," which in
Scientology designates a person
who has followed certain mental
and spiritual exercises to become
fully self-determined and have free
choice over his own mind,
emotions, and actions. Since the
first stable achievement of the state
of Clear in 1966, nearly 2000
persons have attained it, including
William Burroughs, author of
Naked Lunch and film actor
Stephen Boyd. Other notable
adherents of Scientology are writer
Ray Bradbury, Canadian poet and

folk singer Leonard Cohen, artist
Salvador Dali, and pop singer
Momma Cass.
A series of awareness states
above the level of Clear will also be
described. These states involve the
recovering of abilities hitherto
available only to a few mystics or
saints, but which, it is asserted, are
latent in all human beings and can
now be quickly and precisely
regained by applying the
techniques of Scientology.
In addition to having himself
attained these levels of awareness,
Mr. Bishop is an Auditor (or
listener), one who is skilled in
applying the methods of
Scientology to others to increase
their self knowledge. He has
achieved Class VIII as an Auditor,
which is the highest level of
training in Scientology.
After the lecture, Mr. Bishop
will answer questions from the
audience. This event is sponsored
by the Stanford University
Scientology group and is open to
all. Admission is free.
