# SES Governance Report Urges More Stu-Fac Participation
## 
### MICHAEL KUHL 
Members of the university community
should be able to participate in its
governance "to the extent that they
perceive decisions as meaningful to
them" states the latest Study of
Education at Stanford (SES) report .
"Government of the University," the
seventh of ten reports to be made public,
is not scheduled to be released until
Wednesday. The Daily, which will not
publish during dead week, is reporting
the main sections of that report today
from an advance text.
Proposals by the Study committee
deal with the structure of the Board of
Trustees, the administrative officers of
the University, departmental
organization, University committees, and
the administration of undergraduate
education.
In careful delineation of the faculty's
role in the proposed structure, the report
also notes the advantages of retaining the
student perspective in most cases.

However, the possibility of student
membership on tenure committees is
strongly rejected.
"Direct student voice and vote in the
faculty selection process would be
inappropriate because only members of
the faculty are fully qualified to judge the
scholarly credentials of prospective
appointees," the report says.
The group of senior and junior faculty
members, students, and administrators
further notes, "We find no basis at the
present time for opining about the
concept of 'community government,' a
vague phrase, quite without operational
content, whose very vagueness makes it a
rallying cry for some and a source of
disquiet for others."
The previously proposed Committee
on Undergraduate Studies and the Dean
of Undergraduate Studies are strongly
endorsed to provide the "administrative
leadership and coordination . . . (which)
differ fairly substantially from the
present."
Steady Focus Needed
"Stanford needs what it has never
had: a steady focus on its education of
undergraduates, supporting and
maintaining what is good, aiding in the
renovation of what is inadequate,
stimulating and assisting educational
innovation," the report says.
Substantial revisions are urged in the
concerns and structure of the Board of
Trustees, "one of the University's great
strengths."
The Trustees are urged to "select with
considerable care the policy issues on
which they exercise real oversight."
Aside from avoiding time-consuming
routine business, members would have
the "prestige and the knowledge to serve
as bridge and buffer between the
University and the outside world."
"The primary responsibility of the

Board of Trustees should be to ensure the
long-run welfare of teh University and to
support the University in its relationships
with other social institutions and with its
external constituencies," the report
insists.
While the group suggests broader
geographical representation and
appointment of members from higher
education, public offices, and leadership
of labor, religious, and minority groups,
appointment of students and faculty
members is specifically discounted.
The group believes that "informed
participation in Board committee
activities can be substantially enhanced
by extending voting membership in all
Board committees to representatives of
the faculty and the student body. As
such, these groups would be in "close and
continuing contact with the work of the
Board."
Further suggestions propose that the
Trustees hold all meetings on campus,
possibly with four or five intensive
meetings per year. This move would

"entail no greater aggregate time
commitment than the present nine
meetings, but would probably result in
greater interaction between the Board
and the University's major problems,"
the report adds.
The "self-perpetuating election
process" is not questioned, but the report
proposes including members of the
faculty, student body, and alumni on the
Nominating Committee.
This body would be somewhat more
active than in the past if the proposal on
terms of office, now ten years, is
accepted. Trustees would serve for a
raximum of three five year terms.
The Trustees are left with a number of
other topics for "continuing review."
Included in the list are "enlarging the
Board to perhaps double its present size;
direct election of one or more trustees by
each of the following groups —the
faculty, the student body, the alumni;
creating an Executive Committee to
maintain continuity between meetings."
Administration of the
university is given the task of
something between imposing "a
deadening bureaucratic uniformity
on all segments of the University"
and not allowing "each segment to
go its own way."
The President of the University
and the Provost, as his chief
administrative officer, would work
together as a team sharing the
leadership function of the
University. "The trend toward
complexity" in the University
requires that they delegate
"day-to-day operating
responsibilities".
The two principal

adminsitrative officers would have
the following nondelegatable
leadership functions: "drawing
from the enterprise as a whole
realistic goals for maintaining and
improving the quality of the
University; planning how to
achieve those goals; and
representing and communicating
about the University to its
members and its external
constituencies."
A group of officers with the title
of vice-president or vice-provost
would handle the day-to-day
decision-making responsibility in
the areas of academic affairs,
research facilities and programs,
business and finance, and medical
affairs.
The Vice-President for
Academic Affairs would take on
many of the problems now handled
by the president and provost.
Day-to-Day Responsibility
"Students, faculty members,
curricular programs, and the
educational process of the
university should be (his)
day-to-day responsibility," the
reports suggests.
Consistant with the "principle
of academic federalism," the

academic deans require, according
to the report, "the maximum
degree of autonomy" and "direct
access to the president and the
provost."
The group further suggests that
faculty members take on part-time
service for the president's staff and
that Stanford adopt an appropriate
career training program to this end.
Career Administrative Group
The Career Administrative
Group would "prevent
management decisions from
interfering with academic
functions and prevent academic
functions from faltering because
financial, administrative, or other
kinds of support are not as
quantitatively and qualitatively
great as they might be."
The group suggests limiting
departmental officers to two
terms, with deans serving five year
terms and department chairmen
for three years.
The Academic Senate would be
given the power "to control the
appointment of faculty members
to all University-wide committees"
in the report's main suggestion on
the Stanford committee structure.

the main sections of that report today
from an advance text.
Proposals by the Study committee
deal with the structure of the Board of
Trustees, the administrative officers of
the University, departmental
organization, University committees, and
the administration of undergraduate
education.
In careful delineation of the faculty's
role in the proposed structure, the report
also notes the advantages of retaining the
student perspective in most cases.

However, the possibility of student
membership on tenure committees is
strongly rejected.
"Direct student voice and vote in the
faculty selection process would be
inappropriate because only members of
the faculty are fully qualified to judge the
scholarly credentials of prospective
appointees," the report says.
The group of senior and junior faculty
members, students, and administrators
further notes, "We find no basis at the
present time for opining about the
concept of 'community government,' a
vague phrase, quite without operational
content, whose very vagueness makes it a
rallying cry for some and a source of
disquiet for others."
The previously proposed Committee
on Undergraduate Studies and the Dean
of Undergraduate Studies are strongly
endorsed to provide the "administrative
leadership and coordination . . . (which)
differ fairly substantially from the
present."
Steady Focus Needed
"Stanford needs what it has never
had: a steady focus on its education of
undergraduates, supporting and
maintaining what is good, aiding in the
renovation of what is inadequate,
stimulating and assisting educational
innovation," the report says.
Substantial revisions are urged in the
concerns and structure of the Board of
Trustees, "one of the University's great
strengths."
The Trustees are urged to "select with
considerable care the policy issues on
which they exercise real oversight."
Aside from avoiding time-consuming
routine business, members would have
the "prestige and the knowledge to serve
as bridge and buffer between the
University and the outside world."
"The primary responsibility of the

Board of Trustees should be to ensure the
long-run welfare of teh University and to
support the University in its relationships
with other social institutions and with its
external constituencies," the report
insists.
While the group suggests broader
geographical representation and
appointment of members from higher
education, public offices, and leadership
of labor, religious, and minority groups,
appointment of students and faculty
members is specifically discounted.
The group believes that "informed
participation in Board committee
activities can be substantially enhanced
by extending voting membership in all
Board committees to representatives of
the faculty and the student body. As
such, these groups would be in "close and
continuing contact with the work of the
Board."
Further suggestions propose that the
Trustees hold all meetings on campus,
possibly with four or five intensive
meetings per year. This move would

"entail no greater aggregate time
commitment than the present nine
meetings, but would probably result in
greater interaction between the Board
and the University's major problems,"
the report adds.
The "self-perpetuating election
process" is not questioned, but the report
proposes including members of the
faculty, student body, and alumni on the
Nominating Committee.
This body would be somewhat more
active than in the past if the proposal on
terms of office, now ten years, is
accepted. Trustees would serve for a
raximum of three five year terms.
The Trustees are left with a number of
other topics for "continuing review."
Included in the list are "enlarging the
Board to perhaps double its present size;
direct election of one or more trustees by
each of the following groups —the
faculty, the student body, the alumni;
creating an Executive Committee to
maintain continuity between meetings."
Administration of the
university is given the task of
something between imposing "a
deadening bureaucratic uniformity
on all segments of the University"
and not allowing "each segment to
go its own way."
The President of the University
and the Provost, as his chief
administrative officer, would work
together as a team sharing the
leadership function of the
University. "The trend toward
complexity" in the University
requires that they delegate
"day-to-day operating
responsibilities".
The two principal

adminsitrative officers would have
the following nondelegatable
leadership functions: "drawing
from the enterprise as a whole
realistic goals for maintaining and
improving the quality of the
University; planning how to
achieve those goals; and
representing and communicating
about the University to its
members and its external
constituencies."
A group of officers with the title
of vice-president or vice-provost
would handle the day-to-day
decision-making responsibility in
the areas of academic affairs,
research facilities and programs,
business and finance, and medical
affairs.
The Vice-President for
Academic Affairs would take on
many of the problems now handled
by the president and provost.
Day-to-Day Responsibility
"Students, faculty members,
curricular programs, and the
educational process of the
university should be (his)
day-to-day responsibility," the
reports suggests.
Consistant with the "principle
of academic federalism," the

academic deans require, according
to the report, "the maximum
degree of autonomy" and "direct
access to the president and the
provost."
The group further suggests that
faculty members take on part-time
service for the president's staff and
that Stanford adopt an appropriate
career training program to this end.
Career Administrative Group
The Career Administrative
Group would "prevent
management decisions from
interfering with academic
functions and prevent academic
functions from faltering because
financial, administrative, or other
kinds of support are not as
quantitatively and qualitatively
great as they might be."
The group suggests limiting
departmental officers to two
terms, with deans serving five year
terms and department chairmen
for three years.
The Academic Senate would be
given the power "to control the
appointment of faculty members
to all University-wide committees"
in the report's main suggestion on
the Stanford committee structure.
Members of the university community
should be able to participate in its
governance "to the extent that they
perceive decisions as meaningful to
them" states the latest Study of
Education at Stanford (SES) report .

membership on tenure committees is
strongly rejected.
"Direct student voice and vote in the
faculty selection process would be
inappropriate because only members of
the faculty are fully qualified to judge the
scholarly credentials of prospective
appointees," the report says.
The group of senior and junior faculty
members, students, and administrators
further notes, "We find no basis at the
present time for opining about the
concept of 'community government,' a
vague phrase, quite without operational
content, whose very vagueness makes it a
rallying cry for some and a source of
disquiet for others."
The previously proposed Committee
on Undergraduate Studies and the Dean
of Undergraduate Studies are strongly
endorsed to provide the "administrative
leadership and coordination . . . (which)
differ fairly substantially from the
present."
Steady Focus Needed
"Stanford needs what it has never
had: a steady focus on its education of
undergraduates, supporting and
maintaining what is good, aiding in the
renovation of what is inadequate,
stimulating and assisting educational
innovation," the report says.
Substantial revisions are urged in the
concerns and structure of the Board of
Trustees, "one of the University's great
strengths."
The Trustees are urged to "select with
considerable care the policy issues on
which they exercise real oversight."
Aside from avoiding time-consuming
routine business, members would have
the "prestige and the knowledge to serve
as bridge and buffer between the
University and the outside world."
"The primary responsibility of the

Board of Trustees should be to ensure the
long-run welfare of teh University and to
support the University in its relationships
with other social institutions and with its
external constituencies," the report
insists.
While the group suggests broader
geographical representation and
appointment of members from higher
education, public offices, and leadership
of labor, religious, and minority groups,
appointment of students and faculty
members is specifically discounted.
The group believes that "informed
participation in Board committee
activities can be substantially enhanced
by extending voting membership in all
Board committees to representatives of
the faculty and the student body. As
such, these groups would be in "close and
continuing contact with the work of the
Board."
Further suggestions propose that the
Trustees hold all meetings on campus,
possibly with four or five intensive
meetings per year. This move would

"entail no greater aggregate time
commitment than the present nine
meetings, but would probably result in
greater interaction between the Board
and the University's major problems,"
the report adds.
The "self-perpetuating election
process" is not questioned, but the report
proposes including members of the
faculty, student body, and alumni on the
Nominating Committee.
This body would be somewhat more
active than in the past if the proposal on
terms of office, now ten years, is
accepted. Trustees would serve for a
raximum of three five year terms.
The Trustees are left with a number of
other topics for "continuing review."
Included in the list are "enlarging the
Board to perhaps double its present size;
direct election of one or more trustees by
each of the following groups —the
faculty, the student body, the alumni;
creating an Executive Committee to
maintain continuity between meetings."
Administration of the
university is given the task of
something between imposing "a
deadening bureaucratic uniformity
on all segments of the University"
and not allowing "each segment to
go its own way."
The President of the University
and the Provost, as his chief
administrative officer, would work
together as a team sharing the
leadership function of the
University. "The trend toward
complexity" in the University
requires that they delegate
"day-to-day operating
responsibilities".
The two principal

adminsitrative officers would have
the following nondelegatable
leadership functions: "drawing
from the enterprise as a whole
realistic goals for maintaining and
improving the quality of the
University; planning how to
achieve those goals; and
representing and communicating
about the University to its
members and its external
constituencies."
A group of officers with the title
of vice-president or vice-provost
would handle the day-to-day
decision-making responsibility in
the areas of academic affairs,
research facilities and programs,
business and finance, and medical
affairs.
The Vice-President for
Academic Affairs would take on
many of the problems now handled
by the president and provost.
Day-to-Day Responsibility
"Students, faculty members,
curricular programs, and the
educational process of the
university should be (his)
day-to-day responsibility," the
reports suggests.
Consistant with the "principle
of academic federalism," the

academic deans require, according
to the report, "the maximum
degree of autonomy" and "direct
access to the president and the
provost."
The group further suggests that
faculty members take on part-time
service for the president's staff and
that Stanford adopt an appropriate
career training program to this end.
Career Administrative Group
The Career Administrative
Group would "prevent
management decisions from
interfering with academic
functions and prevent academic
functions from faltering because
financial, administrative, or other
kinds of support are not as
quantitatively and qualitatively
great as they might be."
The group suggests limiting
departmental officers to two
terms, with deans serving five year
terms and department chairmen
for three years.
The Academic Senate would be
given the power "to control the
appointment of faculty members
to all University-wide committees"
in the report's main suggestion on
the Stanford committee structure.
Members of the university community
should be able to participate in its
governance "to the extent that they
perceive decisions as meaningful to
them" states the latest Study of
Education at Stanford (SES) report .

also notes the advantages of retaining the
