## Marvin, Mifune 
### TODD McCARTHY 
Hell in the Pacific, through its
title makes it sould like a grade B
action film, is unlike any film I
have seen before. Lee Marvin and
the great Japanese actor, Toshiro
Mifune, play the only two roles in
the picture and around them is
built one of the most enjoyable
adventure films I have seen in a
long while.
Let me clear up one
misconception that some critics are
having about Hell in the Pacific. A
few writers seem to have taken it
dead seriously and are therefore
annoyed by the film's playfulness
and the inconclusive ending. But
the picture is so joyously acted,
directed and photographed that I
can't conceive of the filmakers'
intent being strictly to present a
somber, "Meaningfully" symbolic
allegory of Man.
Briefly, the picture presents two
soldiers, Japanese and American,
who are washed ashore on a small,
deserted island in the South
Pacific. A strategic battle of wits
and a struggle for communication
is ensuing (strong emphasis on the
former), but finally the two
manage to build a raft and escape
to a larger island which, while
similarly deserted, holds the
remnants of a blown out army
base. There, the two are able to
shave, smoke, examine old Life
magazines, and generally enjoy a
more "civilized" existence, but the
communication barrier remains,
despite their admiration for each
other.
Marvin and Mifune have a field
day. Beyond their capabilities as
actors, we can always sense that as
people, they highly enjoy tying
each other up, knocking the other
around and scampering up and
down trees. Despite the
freewheeling and frivolous attitude
this suggests, the production is held
under tight control by director

John Boorman (Point Blank), who
has a sharp eye for composition as
well as a good sense of dramatic
rhythm and pacing.
The film is unusual, of course, in
that no dialogue is spoken. Both
actors mumble utterances of
disgust now and then and many of
Mifune's Japanese lines garner
good laughs just from his
expressions and tone of voice; I
wouldn't mind having a Japanese
interpreter with me the next time I
see the film.
The limiting of the cast to two
is, especially today, a very bold
step. Several two, three or
four-character Broadway dramas
have been brought to the screen
recently, but they ate invariably
"opened up," with incidental
characters not seen on stage being
included for the transfer to
celluloid. Hell in the Pacific was
conceived for the screen with just
two characters and the result is a
tour de force for all concerned.

annoyed by the film's playfulness
and the inconclusive ending. But
the picture is so joyously acted,
directed and photographed that I
can't conceive of the filmakers'
intent being strictly to present a
somber, "Meaningfully" symbolic
allegory of Man.
Briefly, the picture presents two
soldiers, Japanese and American,
who are washed ashore on a small,
deserted island in the South
Pacific. A strategic battle of wits
and a struggle for communication
is ensuing (strong emphasis on the
former), but finally the two
manage to build a raft and escape
to a larger island which, while
similarly deserted, holds the
remnants of a blown out army
base. There, the two are able to
shave, smoke, examine old Life
magazines, and generally enjoy a
more "civilized" existence, but the
communication barrier remains,
despite their admiration for each
other.
Marvin and Mifune have a field
day. Beyond their capabilities as
actors, we can always sense that as
people, they highly enjoy tying
each other up, knocking the other
around and scampering up and
down trees. Despite the
freewheeling and frivolous attitude
this suggests, the production is held
under tight control by director

John Boorman (Point Blank), who
has a sharp eye for composition as
well as a good sense of dramatic
rhythm and pacing.
The film is unusual, of course, in
that no dialogue is spoken. Both
actors mumble utterances of
disgust now and then and many of
Mifune's Japanese lines garner
good laughs just from his
expressions and tone of voice; I
wouldn't mind having a Japanese
interpreter with me the next time I
see the film.
The limiting of the cast to two
is, especially today, a very bold
step. Several two, three or
four-character Broadway dramas
have been brought to the screen
recently, but they ate invariably
"opened up," with incidental
characters not seen on stage being
included for the transfer to
celluloid. Hell in the Pacific was
conceived for the screen with just
two characters and the result is a
tour de force for all concerned.
Hell in the Pacific, through its
title makes it sould like a grade B
action film, is unlike any film I
have seen before. Lee Marvin and
the great Japanese actor, Toshiro
Mifune, play the only two roles in
the picture and around them is
built one of the most enjoyable
adventure films I have seen in a
long while.
Let me clear up one
misconception that some critics are
having about Hell in the Pacific. A
few writers seem to have taken it
dead seriously and are therefore
annoyed by the film's playfulness
and the inconclusive ending. But
the picture is so joyously acted,
directed and photographed that I
