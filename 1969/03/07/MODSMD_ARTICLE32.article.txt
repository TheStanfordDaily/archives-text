# Spring Sport Takeover
## Many Teams Active During Vacation 
### 
By the time the spring quarter
rolls around, several Stanford
sports will have hung them up for
another year. Others will just be
getting started. As some coaches
will begin hibernation planning for
next season, others will be
implementing their ideas and
attempting to come up winners.
Coach Howie Dallmar's varisty
basketball team finishes out the
year tonight against the University
of California Bears at 8:00 p.m. in
the new pavilion. The freshman
club also ends play this evening
facing the Cal Cubs in a preliminary
game at 5:30 p.m. In a previous
meeting, the Stanford Frosh
clobbered the Berkeley freshmen,
102-72, behind a balanced scoring
attack.
The Cal Frosh however are
much improved, and knocked off
the previously undefeated Santa
Clara freshmen just last week.
The rugby team has only one
contest remaining before the
important Monterey National

Tournament, signaling the end of
the season. Coach Pete Kmetovic's
squad faces the Olympic Club at
home tomorrow at 1:30 p.m.
The ruggers opened the season
as the number-one college team in
the nation, but were upended by
UCLA in the middle of February,
11-3. They went on to retain the
Scrum Axe in the Cal-Stanford
rugby series, but dropped the
second game of the series by one
point.
In their most recent outing,
they were dumped by the powerful
Sydney University rugby team,
15-3, but no U.S. team has come
close to the Aussiesanyway.
The Monterey Tournament is
set for March 22 and 23 in Carmel.
Indian triumphs there last year
helped them to the top ranking
among colleges.
The gymnastics team under the
leadership of Dan Millman faces
the Pac-8 Championship meet at
USC on March 27-29. Winners go
on to the NCAA Championships in
Seattle April 3-5.
Last week, the squad waltzed to
a win over a two-man SF State
team, 119.09 to 81.75. It was a low
score for the Tribe, who's only
main hope in the championships is
Craig Dickson in the all-around.
The boxing year is over, but it
ended in glory for Tom Jenks. The
172 pound fighter was named
Outstanding Boxer in the
California Collegiate Boxing
Conference Championships where

the Indian squad finished fourth.
Jenks captured his weight
classification for an unprecedented
third straight year.
Swimmers face a busy weekend,
and an even busier spring vacation.
The Pacific-8 Championships are
currently underway in Long Beach,
where Coach Jim Gaughran's men
face a deep Trojan squad for the
league title.
March 27-29, members of the
squad (freshmen included) enter
the NCAA title fight in Indiana.
The host school is the heavy
favorite, but USC and Stanford
should battle it out for second.
Yale is expected to finish no better
than fourth.
Len Borchers in the 160 lb. class
is Stanford's only hope in the Pac-8
wrestling finals in Oregon today
and tomorrow. Brigham Young
University will host the NCAA's in
wrestling March 27-29.
Other sports are just beginning.
Baseball will be in full swing during
the break. The varsity flexes their
bats today at home against Cal
Poly.
They continue with two games
against the same team tomorrow,
and then break for finals. The team
of Coach Ray Young swings south
for a week playing in the Los
Angeles area for five games. The
schedule remains heavy through
the end of May, and if the hitting
and pitching hold up, the year will
be bright.

Payton Jordan's track team
opens competition tomorrow
against Fresno State and
Occidental, and has meets in Santa
Barbara and San Jose during the
break.
The varsity golf team faces
Hayward today and Santa Clara
tomorrow on the Stanford course.
Number one man, Tom Watson,
lost out in the quarter finals of the
San Francisco City Championships
last weekend to former Stanford
player Kent Winton, 2-1.
Watson, a two time Missouri
State Amateur Champion and one
of the brightest young players to
represent the Indians in many
years, gained the respect of golfers
all over Northern California by
imposing a one stroke penalty on
himself on the 10th hole of his
match with Winton. Tom declared
that his ball had moved an inch or
so at address prior to hitting his
second shot out of the woods lining
the right side of the fairway.
Dick Gould's tennis team
tangles racquets with mighty Utah
today at 2:30 p.m. Tomorrow the
Utah varsity faces potentially their
toughest match of the
weekâ€”against the Stanford Frosh.
The varsity goes against Oregon on
March 28, and then takes on
powerful UCLA and USC down
south at the beginning of April.
As the winter sports call it quits,
the action will continue during the
spring with the high hopes of
baseball and track leading the way.
