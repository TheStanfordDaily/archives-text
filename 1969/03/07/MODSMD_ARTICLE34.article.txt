# Mr. De Young:
## Can you justify foreign exploitation? 
### 
Dear Mr. DeYoung:
"It is an extraordinary fact, that
at a time when affluence is
beginning to be the condition, or
at least the potential condition
of whole countries and regions,
rather than of a few favorite
individuals, and when scientific
feats are becoming possible,
which stagger mankind's wildest
dreams of the past, more people
in the world are suffering from
hunger and want than ever
before. Such a situation is so
intolerable and so contrary to
the best interest of all nations
that it should use the determina
tion on the part of the advanced
and developing countries alike
to bring it to an end."
This eloquent statement by the
Secretary General of the United
Nations points up a problem of
which any informed citizen must
certainly be aware. Corporations,
also doubtless sense the
magnitude of the disparity
between the rich and the poor,
between the thriving and the
hungry. As the chief executive
officer of a giant multi-national
corporation, and as an individual
who has had considerable
working experience around the
world, you have seen first-hand
the wretched state of mankind
referred to by Mr. Thant.
At the same time, as Chairman of
Goodyear, you are the one most
responsible for the long-run
maximization of stockholders'
interests in the company. To
that end, you have led
Goodyear through a period of
significant growth in sales and
capital investment, most
dramatically in areas outside
the United States.
In response to a rapidly growing
market for rubber goods abroad,
more than 50% of Goodyear's
capital expenditures during
1963-1967 were for expansion of
international operations.
Consider the earnings on total
assets at home and abroad
for the same period.
Earnings on
Total Assets Foreign Domestic
1963-1967 Operations Operations
Range 8.5% 11.5% 5.3% 6.0%
Average 9.8% 5.6%
Had Goodyear International's
return for 1967 been at the same
percentage level as the home
company's, foreign earnings
would have been $12.5 million
lower.
Whether the countries where
these operations are located have

gained as much as Goodyear has
gained is questionable,
especially so in the developing
countries. Exploitation is, after
all, nothing more than taking
advantage of the favorable
circumstances of another
country which may lack capital
and/or know-how while
justifying to ourselves that it is
in their best interest. Admittedly
such undertakings do provide
jobs, educational facilities,
medical care, better clothing and
shelter to employees and their
families. But this gives rise
to other questions.
Are these direct benefits for a
few people really enough?
Where are the "above normal"
foreign earnings going?
What right do we as Americans
and you as Goodyear have to
take resources from another
country for our own profit?
What is Goodyear doing to help
developing countries become
economically viable and
independent members of the
world community? Is Goodyear
doing anything to help build up
indigenously owned businesses?
Isn't it possible that several U.S.
and other foreign firms operating
in a small, developing country
could become so centrally linked
to the economic health of the
country and hence to its
financial base as to be able to
strongly influence the composi
tion and style of its government?
Mr. DeYoung, perhaps the
fundamental issue in all these
questions relates to the ever
growing gap between the
prospering and starving nations.
Can American firms really
justify their position in the
developing countries when even
the most conservative population
biologists tell us that the world
will be experiencing severe food
shortages by 1980? Certainly
firms investing abroad may
expect a normal return on their
investment, but when so many
of the emerging nations are so
desperately in need of resources
for development in the broadest
sense, are we really justified in
taking so much out from those
countries for our own
material aggrandizement?

Dear Mr. Clark:
Whether measured by economic
or social yardsticks, the direct
results of most modern multi
national corporate activities in
the emerging nations is the
fostering of progressive
development— not exploitation
under the outdated concepts of
19th Century mercantilism.
Any casting of accounts reveals
that corporate policies, and their
implementing operations, are
focused toward growth within a
country. There is also a realistic
understanding that those
operations can be the essential
motivating force for any viable
progress of the region.
Essentially, the "in-put" is far
greater than the outflow,
all factors considered.
This is clearly revealed from an
economic perspective by the
fiscal policy planning and profit
position of many major
companies abroad. As demon
strated by Goodyear's own
position, we have repatriated
considerably less than half of our
foreign earnings over the past
ten years. Conversely, more than
half of our earnings have been
re-invested abroad. This has
been buttressed further by
additional capital investment—
both equity capital and long-term
loans—in the emerging nations.
Even with thi's continuing
infusion of additional capital,
coupled with re-investment, for
the past three years, returns on
capital investment in these areas
still does not equal —let alone
exceed —returns on domestic
operations.
This disparity is broadened
further by the tax factor. Taking
into account an overall tax rate
abroad of some 40 per cent, as
compared to the U.S. corporate
tax rate of 52.8 per cent, foreign
investment returns still are
markedly less than in our
domestic operations, notwith
standing the more favorable rate.
Implicit to this picture is the
posture of the major corporation
abroad both in terms of its
relationship to the hosting
foreign government, and the
effects of its operations on
economic and social growth.
Essentially operations are
designed to establish a base
for growth while meeting
immediate local needs,
disciplined by the realities of
the profit-motivated free
enterprise system.

In direct consequence the
host-country's GNP is increased,
tax revenues swelled, local
manufacturing stimulated, local
employment is expanded
broadly with a wide range of
new jobs, and local consumer
needs satisfied—which is of
crucial importance in conserving
"hard-money"reserves or foreign
exchange credits.
Equally, the impact of these
operations upon local living
standards cannot be dismissed
casually. For many it has meant
the incredible step forward from
"bare-survival"existence to a
viable way of life. To an
inordinate number this can be as
basic as obtaining an adequate
supply of potable water,
treatment of diseases we've
forgotten about in this country,
sufficient food, and at least
literacy level education.
The dimensions of this picture
are broadened further by the fact
that an investment climate is
generated that begins to attract
other major enterprises to the
area resulting in broader
diversification.
The simple truth is, Mr. Clark,
that the modern multi-national
corporation, disciplined by the
profit and loss risk, is the only
mechanism capable of creating,
implementing and managing
change. Accordingly it is through
its operations that rapid social
and economic development will
occur in the emerging nations.
Don't you agree that its position
is justified?

Russell DeYoung, Chairman

international operations.
Consider the earnings on total
assets at home and abroad
for the same period.
Earnings on
Total Assets Foreign Domestic
1963-1967 Operations Operations
Range 8.5% 11.5% 5.3% 6.0%
Average 9.8% 5.6%
Had Goodyear International's
return for 1967 been at the same
percentage level as the home
company's, foreign earnings
would have been $12.5 million
lower.
Whether the countries where
these operations are located have

gained as much as Goodyear has
gained is questionable,
especially so in the developing
countries. Exploitation is, after
all, nothing more than taking
advantage of the favorable
circumstances of another
country which may lack capital
and/or know-how while
justifying to ourselves that it is
in their best interest. Admittedly
such undertakings do provide
jobs, educational facilities,
medical care, better clothing and
shelter to employees and their
families. But this gives rise
to other questions.
Are these direct benefits for a
few people really enough?
Where are the "above normal"
foreign earnings going?
What right do we as Americans
and you as Goodyear have to
take resources from another
country for our own profit?
What is Goodyear doing to help
developing countries become
economically viable and
independent members of the
world community? Is Goodyear
doing anything to help build up
indigenously owned businesses?
Isn't it possible that several U.S.
and other foreign firms operating
in a small, developing country
could become so centrally linked
to the economic health of the
country and hence to its
financial base as to be able to
strongly influence the composi
tion and style of its government?
Mr. DeYoung, perhaps the
fundamental issue in all these
questions relates to the ever
growing gap between the
prospering and starving nations.
Can American firms really
justify their position in the
developing countries when even
the most conservative population
biologists tell us that the world
will be experiencing severe food
shortages by 1980? Certainly
firms investing abroad may
expect a normal return on their
investment, but when so many
of the emerging nations are so
desperately in need of resources
for development in the broadest
sense, are we really justified in
taking so much out from those
countries for our own
material aggrandizement?

Dear Mr. Clark:
Whether measured by economic
or social yardsticks, the direct
results of most modern multi
national corporate activities in
the emerging nations is the
fostering of progressive
development— not exploitation
under the outdated concepts of
19th Century mercantilism.
Any casting of accounts reveals
that corporate policies, and their
implementing operations, are
focused toward growth within a
country. There is also a realistic
understanding that those
operations can be the essential
motivating force for any viable
progress of the region.
Essentially, the "in-put" is far
greater than the outflow,
all factors considered.
This is clearly revealed from an
economic perspective by the
fiscal policy planning and profit
position of many major
companies abroad. As demon
strated by Goodyear's own
position, we have repatriated
considerably less than half of our
foreign earnings over the past
ten years. Conversely, more than
half of our earnings have been
re-invested abroad. This has
been buttressed further by
additional capital investment—
both equity capital and long-term
loans—in the emerging nations.
Even with thi's continuing
infusion of additional capital,
coupled with re-investment, for
the past three years, returns on
capital investment in these areas
still does not equal —let alone
exceed —returns on domestic
operations.
This disparity is broadened
further by the tax factor. Taking
into account an overall tax rate
abroad of some 40 per cent, as
compared to the U.S. corporate
tax rate of 52.8 per cent, foreign
investment returns still are
markedly less than in our
domestic operations, notwith
standing the more favorable rate.
Implicit to this picture is the
posture of the major corporation
abroad both in terms of its
relationship to the hosting
foreign government, and the
effects of its operations on
economic and social growth.
Essentially operations are
designed to establish a base
for growth while meeting
immediate local needs,
disciplined by the realities of
the profit-motivated free
enterprise system.

In direct consequence the
host-country's GNP is increased,
tax revenues swelled, local
manufacturing stimulated, local
employment is expanded
broadly with a wide range of
new jobs, and local consumer
needs satisfied—which is of
crucial importance in conserving
"hard-money"reserves or foreign
exchange credits.
Equally, the impact of these
operations upon local living
standards cannot be dismissed
casually. For many it has meant
the incredible step forward from
"bare-survival"existence to a
viable way of life. To an
inordinate number this can be as
basic as obtaining an adequate
supply of potable water,
treatment of diseases we've
forgotten about in this country,
sufficient food, and at least
literacy level education.
The dimensions of this picture
are broadened further by the fact
that an investment climate is
generated that begins to attract
other major enterprises to the
area resulting in broader
diversification.
The simple truth is, Mr. Clark,
that the modern multi-national
corporation, disciplined by the
profit and loss risk, is the only
mechanism capable of creating,
implementing and managing
change. Accordingly it is through
its operations that rapid social
and economic development will
occur in the emerging nations.
Don't you agree that its position
is justified?
Sincerely,
Russell DeYoung, Chairman
The Goodyear Tire &
Rubber Company

Dear Mr. DeYoung:
"It is an extraordinary fact, that
at a time when affluence is
beginning to be the condition, or
at least the potential condition
of whole countries and regions,
rather than of a few favorite
individuals, and when scientific
feats are becoming possible,
which stagger mankind's wildest
dreams of the past, more people
in the world are suffering from
hunger and want than ever
before. Such a situation is so
intolerable and so contrary to
the best interest of all nations
that it should use the determina
tion on the part of the advanced
and developing countries alike
to bring it to an end."
This eloquent statement by the
Secretary General of the United
Nations points up a problem of
which any informed citizen must
certainly be aware. Corporations,
also doubtless sense the
magnitude of the disparity
between the rich and the poor,
between the thriving and the
hungry. As the chief executive
officer of a giant multi-national
corporation, and as an individual
who has had considerable
working experience around the
world, you have seen first-hand
the wretched state of mankind
referred to by Mr. Thant.
At the same time, as Chairman of
Goodyear, you are the one most
responsible for the long-run
maximization of stockholders'
interests in the company. To
that end, you have led
Goodyear through a period of
significant growth in sales and
capital investment, most
dramatically in areas outside
the United States.
In response to a rapidly growing
market for rubber goods abroad,
more than 50% of Goodyear's

country and hence to its
financial base as to be able to
strongly influence the composi

Mr. DeYoung, perhaps the
fundamental issue in all these
questions relates to the ever
growing gap between the
prospering and starving nations.
Can American firms really
justify their position in the
developing countries when even
the most conservative population
biologists tell us that the world
will be experiencing severe food
shortages by 1980? Certainly
firms investing abroad may
expect a normal return on their
investment, but when so many
of the emerging nations are so
desperately in need of resources
for development in the broadest
sense, are we really justified in
taking so much out from those
countries for our own
material aggrandizement?

Dear Mr. Clark:
Whether measured by economic
or social yardsticks, the direct
results of most modern multi
national corporate activities in
the emerging nations is the
fostering of progressive
development— not exploitation
under the outdated concepts of
19th Century mercantilism.
Any casting of accounts reveals
that corporate policies, and their
implementing operations, are
focused toward growth within a
country. There is also a realistic
understanding that those
operations can be the essential
motivating force for any viable
progress of the region.
Essentially, the "in-put" is far
greater than the outflow,
all factors considered.
This is clearly revealed from an
economic perspective by the
fiscal policy planning and profit
position of many major
companies abroad. As demon
strated by Goodyear's own
position, we have repatriated
considerably less than half of our
foreign earnings over the past
ten years. Conversely, more than
half of our earnings have been
re-invested abroad. This has
been buttressed further by
additional capital investment—
both equity capital and long-term
loans—in the emerging nations.
Even with thi's continuing
infusion of additional capital,
coupled with re-investment, for
the past three years, returns on
capital investment in these areas
still does not equal —let alone
exceed —returns on domestic
operations.
This disparity is broadened
further by the tax factor. Taking
into account an overall tax rate
abroad of some 40 per cent, as
compared to the U.S. corporate
tax rate of 52.8 per cent, foreign
investment returns still are
markedly less than in our
domestic operations, notwith
standing the more favorable rate.
Implicit to this picture is the
posture of the major corporation
abroad both in terms of its
relationship to the hosting
foreign government, and the
effects of its operations on
economic and social growth.
Essentially operations are
designed to establish a base
for growth while meeting
immediate local needs,
disciplined by the realities of
the profit-motivated free
enterprise system.

In direct consequence the
host-country's GNP is increased,
tax revenues swelled, local
manufacturing stimulated, local
employment is expanded
broadly with a wide range of
new jobs, and local consumer
needs satisfied—which is of
crucial importance in conserving
"hard-money"reserves or foreign
exchange credits.
Equally, the impact of these
operations upon local living
standards cannot be dismissed
casually. For many it has meant
the incredible step forward from
"bare-survival"existence to a
viable way of life. To an
inordinate number this can be as
basic as obtaining an adequate
supply of potable water,
treatment of diseases we've
forgotten about in this country,
sufficient food, and at least
literacy level education.
The dimensions of this picture
are broadened further by the fact
that an investment climate is
generated that begins to attract
other major enterprises to the
area resulting in broader
diversification.
The simple truth is, Mr. Clark,
that the modern multi-national
corporation, disciplined by the
profit and loss risk, is the only
mechanism capable of creating,
implementing and managing
change. Accordingly it is through
its operations that rapid social
and economic development will
occur in the emerging nations.
Don't you agree that its position
is justified?
Sincerely,
Russell DeYoung, Chairman
The Goodyear Tire &
Rubber Company

Dear Mr. DeYoung:
"It is an extraordinary fact, that
at a time when affluence is
beginning to be the condition, or
at least the potential condition
of whole countries and regions,
rather than of a few favorite
individuals, and when scientific
feats are becoming possible,
which stagger mankind's wildest
dreams of the past, more people
in the world are suffering from
hunger and want than ever
before. Such a situation is so
intolerable and so contrary to
the best interest of all nations
that it should use the determina
tion on the part of the advanced
and developing countries alike
to bring it to an end."
This eloquent statement by the
Secretary General of the United
Nations points up a problem of
which any informed citizen must
certainly be aware. Corporations,
also doubtless sense the
magnitude of the disparity
between the rich and the poor,
between the thriving and the
hungry. As the chief executive
officer of a giant multi-national
corporation, and as an individual
who has had considerable
working experience around the
world, you have seen first-hand
the wretched state of mankind
referred to by Mr. Thant.
At the same time, as Chairman of
Goodyear, you are the one most
responsible for the long-run
maximization of stockholders'
interests in the company. To
that end, you have led
Goodyear through a period of
significant growth in sales and
capital investment, most
dramatically in areas outside
the United States.
In response to a rapidly growing
market for rubber goods abroad,
more than 50% of Goodyear's
capital expenditures during
1963-1967 were for expansion of
international operations.
Consider the earnings on total
assets at home and abroad
for the same period.
Earnings on
Total Assets Foreign Domestic
1963-1967 Operations Operations
Range 8.5% 11.5% 5.3% 6.0%
Average 9.8% 5.6%
Had Goodyear International's
return for 1967 been at the same
percentage level as the home
company's, foreign earnings
would have been $12.5 million
lower.
Whether the countries where
these operations are located have

gained as much as Goodyear has
gained is questionable,
especially so in the developing
countries. Exploitation is, after
all, nothing more than taking
advantage of the favorable
circumstances of another
country which may lack capital
and/or know-how while
justifying to ourselves that it is
in their best interest. Admittedly
such undertakings do provide
jobs, educational facilities,
medical care, better clothing and
shelter to employees and their
families. But this gives rise
to other questions.
Are these direct benefits for a
few people really enough?
Where are the "above normal"
foreign earnings going?
What right do we as Americans
and you as Goodyear have to
take resources from another
country for our own profit?
What is Goodyear doing to help
developing countries become
economically viable and
independent members of the
world community? Is Goodyear
doing anything to help build up
indigenously owned businesses?
Isn't it possible that several U.S.
and other foreign firms operating
in a small, developing country
could become so centrally linked
to the economic health of the
country and hence to its
financial base as to be able to
strongly influence the composi
tion and style of its government?

strated by Goodyear's own
position, we have repatriated
considerably less than half of our
foreign earnings over the past
ten years. Conversely, more than
half of our earnings have been
re-invested abroad. This has
been buttressed further by
additional capital investment—
both equity capital and long-term
loans—in the emerging nations.
Even with thi's continuing
infusion of additional capital,
coupled with re-investment, for
the past three years, returns on
capital investment in these areas
still does not equal —let alone
exceed —returns on domestic
operations.
This disparity is broadened
further by the tax factor. Taking
into account an overall tax rate
abroad of some 40 per cent, as
compared to the U.S. corporate
tax rate of 52.8 per cent, foreign
investment returns still are
markedly less than in our
domestic operations, notwith
standing the more favorable rate.
Implicit to this picture is the
posture of the major corporation
abroad both in terms of its
relationship to the hosting
foreign government, and the
effects of its operations on
economic and social growth.
Essentially operations are
designed to establish a base
for growth while meeting
immediate local needs,
disciplined by the realities of
the profit-motivated free
enterprise system.

In direct consequence the
host-country's GNP is increased,
tax revenues swelled, local
manufacturing stimulated, local
employment is expanded
broadly with a wide range of
new jobs, and local consumer
needs satisfied—which is of
crucial importance in conserving
"hard-money"reserves or foreign
exchange credits.
Equally, the impact of these
operations upon local living
standards cannot be dismissed
casually. For many it has meant
the incredible step forward from
"bare-survival"existence to a
viable way of life. To an
inordinate number this can be as
basic as obtaining an adequate
supply of potable water,
treatment of diseases we've
forgotten about in this country,
sufficient food, and at least
literacy level education.
The dimensions of this picture
are broadened further by the fact
that an investment climate is
generated that begins to attract
other major enterprises to the
area resulting in broader
diversification.
The simple truth is, Mr. Clark,
that the modern multi-national
corporation, disciplined by the
profit and loss risk, is the only
mechanism capable of creating,
implementing and managing
change. Accordingly it is through
its operations that rapid social
and economic development will
occur in the emerging nations.
Don't you agree that its position
is justified?
Sincerely,
Russell DeYoung, Chairman
The Goodyear Tire &
Rubber Company

Dear Mr. DeYoung:
"It is an extraordinary fact, that
at a time when affluence is
beginning to be the condition, or
at least the potential condition
of whole countries and regions,
rather than of a few favorite
individuals, and when scientific
feats are becoming possible,
which stagger mankind's wildest
dreams of the past, more people
in the world are suffering from
hunger and want than ever
before. Such a situation is so
intolerable and so contrary to
the best interest of all nations
that it should use the determina
tion on the part of the advanced
and developing countries alike
to bring it to an end."
This eloquent statement by the
Secretary General of the United
Nations points up a problem of
which any informed citizen must
certainly be aware. Corporations,
also doubtless sense the
magnitude of the disparity
between the rich and the poor,
between the thriving and the
hungry. As the chief executive
officer of a giant multi-national
corporation, and as an individual
who has had considerable
working experience around the
world, you have seen first-hand
the wretched state of mankind
referred to by Mr. Thant.
At the same time, as Chairman of
Goodyear, you are the one most
responsible for the long-run
maximization of stockholders'
interests in the company. To
that end, you have led
Goodyear through a period of
significant growth in sales and
capital investment, most
dramatically in areas outside
the United States.
In response to a rapidly growing
market for rubber goods abroad,
more than 50% of Goodyear's
capital expenditures during
1963-1967 were for expansion of
international operations.
Consider the earnings on total
assets at home and abroad
for the same period.
Earnings on
Total Assets Foreign Domestic
1963-1967 Operations Operations
Range 8.5% 11.5% 5.3% 6.0%
Average 9.8% 5.6%
Had Goodyear International's
return for 1967 been at the same
percentage level as the home
company's, foreign earnings
would have been $12.5 million
lower.
Whether the countries where
these operations are located have

gained as much as Goodyear has
gained is questionable,
especially so in the developing
countries. Exploitation is, after
all, nothing more than taking
advantage of the favorable
circumstances of another
country which may lack capital
and/or know-how while
justifying to ourselves that it is
in their best interest. Admittedly
such undertakings do provide
jobs, educational facilities,
medical care, better clothing and
shelter to employees and their
families. But this gives rise
to other questions.
Are these direct benefits for a
few people really enough?
Where are the "above normal"
foreign earnings going?
What right do we as Americans
and you as Goodyear have to
take resources from another
country for our own profit?
What is Goodyear doing to help
developing countries become
economically viable and
independent members of the
world community? Is Goodyear
doing anything to help build up
indigenously owned businesses?
Isn't it possible that several U.S.
and other foreign firms operating
in a small, developing country
could become so centrally linked
to the economic health of the
country and hence to its
financial base as to be able to
strongly influence the composi
tion and style of its government?
Mr. DeYoung, perhaps the
fundamental issue in all these
questions relates to the ever
growing gap between the
prospering and starving nations.
Can American firms really
justify their position in the
developing countries when even
the most conservative population
biologists tell us that the world
will be experiencing severe food
shortages by 1980? Certainly
firms investing abroad may
expect a normal return on their
investment, but when so many
of the emerging nations are so
desperately in need of resources
for development in the broadest
sense, are we really justified in
taking so much out from those
countries for our own
material aggrandizement?
Sincerely,

Dear Mr. Clark:
Whether measured by economic
or social yardsticks, the direct
results of most modern multi
national corporate activities in
the emerging nations is the
fostering of progressive
development— not exploitation
under the outdated concepts of
19th Century mercantilism.
Any casting of accounts reveals
that corporate policies, and their
implementing operations, are
focused toward growth within a
country. There is also a realistic
understanding that those
operations can be the essential
motivating force for any viable
progress of the region.
Essentially, the "in-put" is far
greater than the outflow,
all factors considered.
This is clearly revealed from an
economic perspective by the
fiscal policy planning and profit
position of many major
companies abroad. As demon
strated by Goodyear's own
position, we have repatriated
considerably less than half of our
foreign earnings over the past
ten years. Conversely, more than
half of our earnings have been
re-invested abroad. This has
been buttressed further by
additional capital investment—
both equity capital and long-term
