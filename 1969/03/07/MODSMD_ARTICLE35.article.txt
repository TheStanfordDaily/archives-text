# Seniors Bow Out Tonight As Cal Invades In Finale
## 
### FRED MANN 
25 down and one to go. The
Stanford varsity basketball team
ends their long campaign tonight
against California, and both squads
will be happy to see the year end.
For the Indians, the season has
been disappointing to say the least.
They have amassed only eight wins,
and are in the Pac-8 cellar with a
3-10 record.
California has had the most up
and down year of anybody. At
times, like last weekend against
UCLA, the Bears look like
world-beaters. They have the
potential to be in the top ten in the
nation. But usually, the individuals
fail to act as a team. They often
need five basketballs at a time. Cal
is currently 4-9 in league, and a loss
to Stanford would put them in a
last place tie with the Indians.
Coach Howie Dallmar has had
little to smile about this year. The
breaks a team usually needs to win
have simply not come the way of
the Tribe. Games have been lost in
the last minute so many times it
seems like habit.
For a while free throwing was
Stanford's weak suit, but now they
rank third in the conference with a
.659 average However, when the
charity shooting improved,
everything else fell off. In team
offense and team defense, the
Cards are sixth of the eight. They

score 64.7 a game while giving up
72.4. Only Cal is behind Stanford
in field goal percentage (41.5 to
38.4). The Bears average 10 more
rebounds per game than does
Stanford. They also average 71.5 a
contest.
In looking at the stats, it would
seem that the Bears, although poor
in shooting and defense, should
destroy a team of Stanford's
caliber. Yet, in the first meeting of
these two teams, Cal was lucky to
escape with a 73-65 win. Again the
reason was Berkeley's
inconsistency.
For the Indians, tonight's game
is more than just a finale, and more
than a Cal game. It is the end of five
careers. Dave Druliner, Bill Closs,
and Dave Kuchenbecker will be
seeing their last action tonight as
will two other players.
Co-captain Mai McElwain,
currently hitting 16.4 a game and
fifth in the Pac-8 free throwing, is
ending his outstanding playing
days. Mai came back from serious
ankle trouble at the start of the
season to be the team's most
consistant performer. He is second
on the squad in scoring and
rebounding.
The other co-captain is Don
Griffin. Enough can not be said
about him. In his three varsity
years, the 6-4 guard has hit for
1,232 points, placing him fifth on
the all-time Stanford list. This year

alone Griff has nailed 508 points,
and is only 33 shy of breaking the
single season scoring record.
Two weeks ago, the record
seemed sure to fall, but Griffin hit a
cold spell for the first time all year.
His shooting was off, and his point
totals fell. He has been
double-teamed and pressured all
year long by every opponent, and
has still maintained a 20.3 scoring
average.
The scoring role that Griffin
plays often overshadows his great
playmaking ability. He is the team
director, always bringing the ball
up court, always making the
impossible pass, and still finding
time to grab five rebounds a game.
Unlike most super-scorers,
Griffin is not a gunner. (The way
the Stanford team has shot at
times, it is unfortunate that he is
not.) 20-foot jumpers from straight
away are automatic for him. He is
not afraid to drive on the big men
inside, a quality necessary for the
pros.
From all over the court Don is
dangerous, and his value to the
team in all aspects of the game can
not be underestimated.
Cal will attempt to keep Griffin
under control tonight. Jackie
Ridgle, the Bear's star sophomore
forward may match up with Griff.
Ridgle is averaging 19.1 in
conference play.
Bob Presley played his finest
game against UCLA last week, and
will be ending his career as well.
Guard Charlie Johnson was
described by John Wooden as the
best guard the Bruins have faced all
year. His improvement plus the
awakening of Presley will make Cal
tough to handle.
But perhaps the Indians will get
a bounce or two, just to break the
monotony. A win tonight would
give Coach Dallmar at least some
degree of consolation at the end of
what has been an unfortunate
season.
