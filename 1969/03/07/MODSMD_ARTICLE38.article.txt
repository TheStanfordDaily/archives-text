# A
						Long But Colorful Season In New Pavilion
## 
### 
The basketball season draws to a
close tonight at 8:00 p.m. as the
University of California Bears
come to Maples Pavilion to face the
Indians in a battle for the Pac-8
cellar.
The basketball played in the
new pavilion may not have been
particularly inspiring, but the

action surrounding the court has
been top quality.
Stanford's amazing band has
put all others to shame with their
musical selections and half-time
antics. After the UCLA game, the
band matched songs with the Bruin
music makers and made them
sound like Lawrence VVelk.

The Tribe cheerleaders provided
a spirit usually lacking at Stanford
sporting events. The Dollies and
their routines made going to the
games worthwhile even for those
that dislike basketball.
Prince Lightfoot is shown below
watching the action as he has for
years. His birthday was celebrated

with a 81-60 loss to UCLA.
Coach Dallmar felt the pressures
of losing so many close games, but
never lost faith in his team.
"They just never give up," he
said. "Sometimes I think they try
too hard."
The Roscoe Maples Pavilion
opened with Stanford dropping a

95-89 contest to Brigham Young
University. In the official „
dedication game just last week, the
Indians were again on the short ,
side, this time to USC, 75-66. The
8,000 seat structure saw its first ,
and only capacity crowd whert,
UCLA came to town. Again, the
home team fell, 81 -60.
