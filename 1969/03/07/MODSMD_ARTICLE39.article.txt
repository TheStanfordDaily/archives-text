# Stanford Hockey: A Success
## 
### BRUCE HOWARD 
The Stanford ice hockey team
lost a hard fought 7-3 game to
Menlo College Tuesday night in
what was the first intercollegiate
hockey game on the West Coast
since before World War 11.
Stanford played creditably and
fought Menlo evenly in all
departments —except goals scored.
The Indians spent much of the
night camped on the Menlo goalie's
doorstep, and shot the puck
everywhere except into the net.
Goalie Dick Jones and the Stanford
defense were much improved over
previous efforts.
The Stanford-Menlo game and
others like it that have been played
in the last few months mark a
significant development in West
Coast hockey—the emergence of
the game at sub-pro level.
Stanford and Menlo are part of a
six team league that includes the
Peninsula Hockey Club in
Belmont, the Berkeley junior team
(20 and under), and the San
Francisco junior and senior teams.
These clubs will be organized into a
formal league at the end of this

month and will play a regular
schedule in an October-to-March
season.
The Stanford Ice Hockey Club
was founded by Dr. Fuller Torrey,
a resident in psychiatry at the Med
Center who acts as "President,
Playing Coach, and Team Shrink."
Dr. Torrey, who played at
Princeton as an undergraduate,
learned last fall that informal
hockey was being played at the
Belmont Iceland, and he began to
form the club. The first practice
session was after Christmas and the

first game was played January 10, a
wild 14-11 win over Belmont.
After this game and a notice in
the Daily, the club grew to about
thirty members, mostly graduates
who had played college hockey.
The club, however, is open to
anyone who wants to join. The
only criterion is skill. The team
practices at Belmont every
Tuesday.
Dr. Torrey is currently
negotiating with the Oakland Seals
to play an exhibition game before a
regular Seals game.
