THE BATTERY re-volts in TRESIDDER'S cafeteria tonight from 10-12:30. The
Battery is an eleven piece soul band. Shocking! The current rage of the campus, they
electrify any crowd. Groove to the soul sounds including some original songs by Sam
McGowan. Don't miss it. Liberate Tresidder. Liberate yourself! FREE, tonight in
the cafeteria.
