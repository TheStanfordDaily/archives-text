# Hayes Will Not Quit Despite Semi-Threat
## 
### DAVID DAVENPORT 
Under present circumstances, ASSU
President Denis Hayes has no plans to
resign his post.
In a phone conversation from New
York, Hayes attempted to clarify some of
the confusion created by a resignation
threat which he issued at last week's
LASSU meeting.
Some legislators had feared that Hayes
would resign if LASSU had not removed
his new constitution from the table, and
placed it on a ballot for the Spring
Quarter registration packet, before he
returned from his trip.
Others thought that Hayes had not
been specific in outlining the conditions
under which he would vacate his office.
Hayes Satisfied
Hayes, in his conversation with the
Daily, stated, "I am satisfied with the fact
that a new constitution will be
considered at the first legislature meeting
of the Spring Quarter.
"By that time, all interested students
will have had an opportunity to submit
their comments, and we will have made
any appropriate revisions based on their
views."
Should LASSU refuse to place his new
constitution on the Spring Ballot, Hayes
claimed that he would take petitions to

the dorms in an effort to get the issue
before the student body. However, he
anticipated that LASSU would be willing
to place the proposal on the ballot.
Hayes Can't Clarify
Because there had been widespread
confusion in interpreting Hayes' threat,
he was asked to explain it himself.
"I really can't clarify what I said at the
meeting," he admitted. "The legislators
were advancing what I considered to be
very stupid objections. 1 was quite upset
about it and don't really know what I
said.
"I was hoping to persuade the
waverers to place it on the ballot: it was a
tactical move. But there weren't that
many waverers, and the tactic obviously
failed."
He emphasized that it was satisfactory
to have the issue appear on the Spring
Ballot, rather than in registration packets
as he had originally requested.
More Power
The fundamental change in the new
document would eliminate LASSU and
substitute a new 41 member Senate.
Membership of the body would be
determined by an election based on the
Hare system of proportional
representation. Senators would be
elected from the various schools
and academic disciplines.
Hayes expressed a desire to
"replace LASSU with a more
effective body." He complained
that LASSU has been "an albatross
around the neck" of this year's
ASSU officers, particularly trying
for Vice-President Vic von
Schlegell and for Hayes himself.
He hoped "to give the new
administration a broader base of
power than Vic and I have had to
work with."
Hayes To Persuade
The emphasis of the remainder
of Hayes' administration will be to
"use whatever resources available
to convince the student body that
the revised document is in their
best interests."
