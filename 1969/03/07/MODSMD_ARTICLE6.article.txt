## Boyd: Belief In The Individual 
### KIM THORBURN 
"I believe in the individual and I
believe that the individual should have
control over his own life. That's why the
Republican Party, or more specifically, a
conservative philosophy, is in tune with
my ideology."
Bill Boyd, author of the statement, is
president of the Young Republicans and
business managerof the Arena.
A senior in history, Boyd traced his
interest in politics "back to 1956 when I
marched in a parade for Eisenhower.
Since then it has snowballed," he
continued.
"I do lots of reading and this has led
me to think about the role of the
individual in society. My political
ideology stems from this," he continued.
Parental Impact
Boyd's parents had no influence in his
jecision to become a Republican. "My
.ther is a middle-of-the-roader." he said.

"Ho jokes, 'I have two sons: one is a
liberal and the other is a reactionary."
Boyd feels that this country has seen a
great progress in the last thirty years but
he is distressed by the loss of importance
of the individual. "I abhor a centralized
government where all the
decision-making is done by a central
power. The individual has no say," he
explained.
"You can't call our government a
government of the people, for the prople,
and by the people anymore," he
continued. "It's a government by a small,
elitist group."
Vif I nam! Yes
Boyd believes that the United States
should be in Vietnam because it is in the
interest of the country. "But the war has
been grossly mismanaged," he said.
"Now it may be hard to achieve the free
elections which the people should have

according to the 1954 Geneva
agreement."
"As a social issue, I think that
war is a horrible thing but if there
must be war, it shouldn't be
gradual," he continued.
Turning to another social issue,
Boyd feels that the blacks are the
maligned race of the country.
"Injustices have been and are still
being committed," he said.
"Efforts must be made to right
them."
"Financial aid is worthless if the
people don't believe in the
purpose," he continued.
"Education is one answer."
M ust Improve Schools
"I'm opposed to bussing. We
must improve the schools in the
Black community. This means
better teachers and if it requires
monetary incentives, I'm in favor
of it."
"The blacks must be accepted as
separate, but equal. They have
their own traditions which can't be
lost in bringing them social
justice."
Boyd is in favor of black
capitalism because it puts the fruits
of black labor back into the black
community.
YR's Should Act
Speaking of the recent increases
of activity by campus
conservatives, Boyd said, "I am
interested in getting more people
from my side of the spectrum to
act. It is one thing to complain and
another thing to act.
"Campus YR's are often a very
negative organization but we have
something very positive to
contribute," he continued.
"Complaining doesn't accomplish
anything. Changes must be made at
the universities and there is lots
that all types can contribute to
make the changes meaningful."
"People are fed up with campus
disorder and disruption. I think the
raising of the Viet Cong flag is the
reason for the conservative
demonstration against SDS. One
hundred new members havejoined
our club in the last month."
Proud of Stanford
"Stanford is a private university
and it has the prerogative to set its
own rules and accept and expel

students almost at its own will. No
definite stand has yet been taken
by the administration."
"I'm proud of this University. It
has given me a lot and I hope to be
able to give back something in
return someday," he added.
