## Boyd: Belief In The Individual 
### KIM THORBURN 
"I believe in the individual and I
believe that the individual should have
control over his own life. That's why the
Republican Party, or more specifically, a
conservative philosophy, is in tune with
my ideology."
Bill Boyd, author of the statement, is
president of the Young Republicans and
business managerof the Arena.
A senior in history, Boyd traced his
interest in politics "back to 1956 when I
marched in a parade for Eisenhower.
Since then it has snowballed," he
continued.
"I do lots of reading and this has led
me to think about the role of the
individual in society. My political
ideology stems from this," he continued.
Parental Impact
Boyd's parents had no influence in his
jecision to become a Republican. "My
.ther is a middle-of-the-roader." he said.

"Ho jokes, 'I have two sons: one is a
liberal and the other is a reactionary."
Boyd feels that this country has seen a
great progress in the last thirty years but
he is distressed by the loss of importance
of the individual. "I abhor a centralized
government where all the
decision-making is done by a central
power. The individual has no say," he
explained.
"You can't call our government a
government of the people, for the prople,
and by the people anymore," he
continued. "It's a government by a small,
elitist group."
Vif I nam! Yes
Boyd believes that the United States
should be in Vietnam because it is in the
interest of the country. "But the war has
been grossly mismanaged," he said.
"Now it may be hard to achieve the free
elections which the people should have
