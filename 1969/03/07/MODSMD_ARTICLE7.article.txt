(Editor's Note: Bill Banks, a
freshman, on the Daily staff, participated
in the march to the Civic Center and
Presidio to protest the courts-martial of
27 Gls on charges of mutiny. These arc
his observations.)
SAN FRANC ISCO—At 1:00
Wednesday morning the Civic Center in
downtown San Francisco was dark. The
cold blue light of the streetlights that
surrounded the center did little to
illuminate the fountain area where one
hundred people stood, squatted sat and
occasionally, slept.
The people were participants in an all
night vigil in support of the twenty-five
men on trial at the Presidio. They
huddled in small groups around candles
and under blankets and sleeping bags to
talk, laugh, but most of all to keep warm.
A group of about twenty sang songs
which the fountain quickly muffled.
The people talked in tired voices of
politics, war, mankind's future and of all
those things people talk of when they are
more concerned than cold.
By five o'clock many were asleep
beneath blankets and inside sleeping
bags. Those who only had their jackets
sat, silently around small fires.
Fuel cardboard, paper and wax- was in
limited supply,

Then the police arrived. At first there
were only three. They wore no helmets
and carried the shorter night sticks.
The sergeant, not one given to diets,
informed us that a window had been
broken nearby and that we must produce
the culprit. We declined and the three
left.
Before long a fire truck arrived. As it
pulled up to the curb the three policemen
reappeared. Two squad cars came with
them and this time the police had not
forgotten their helmets. Our fires, having
attained the dangerous height of perhaps
one foot, were apparently a threat to the
city. They were extinguished.

Commentary

Most people awoke before six. By
eight most of the people had left, by car,
bus and perhaps on foot for the traisl
across the city.
Presidio Building 222 a white frame
structure—was swarming with sparkling
MP's. All those not dressed in coat and tie
or equipped with press credentials were
very quickly and efficiently herded

behind a barricade. We started to sing
songs but a lieutenant with a bull horn
informed us that we would be removed if
we continued.
The authority on an Army base is not
difficult to see or feel. We stopped
singing.
The trial began with a request by the
defense to move the procedings. The
defense contended that the proceedings
would be influenced by local publicity
and other factors—like the seventy odd
demonstrators that had arrived on base.
The law officer multi-chinned, balding
Colonel John G. Lee, listened to the
argument and then said, "Very well, the
motion is overruled. Let's proceed."
The defense then pointed out that all
the officers on the court were senior
infantry officers, war veterans and all
were from Fort Lewis, Washington. The
defense then contended that there had
been a "deliberate and systematic"
attempt to exclude from the court
lieutenants and warrant officers.
To support this claim, Lt. David
Granger was called to the stand. Granger,
in charge of selecting the candidates for
the board, said that he was "not at
liberty" to select low ranking officers and
warrant officers.
When Granger had finished testifying
the law officer said. "Oh. I don't think

we'll pursue this any longer" and
denied the defense's contention. After
some further argument the court was
adjourned until the afternoon.
When the defendants returned to the
courtroom, Private Yost, who had been
wearing decorations on his uniform that
morning, was stripped of insignia. He had
been subjected to a search and then the
decorations had been removed. The
search also uncovered a picture of Yost's
motorcycle which he had been carrying
for six months.
For this Yost was sentenced to
fourteen days in "the box."
Lawrence Zaino's civilian lawyer,
Joseph Manzello arose. Manzello, a small
man with a large busy mustache, stated
that his cleint was suicidal. He said that
Zaino had tried to commit suicide by
cutting his wrist and that he should
undergo psychiatric examination.
The lawyer asked further that, Zaino
be given a physical examination so that
the court might bear witness to bruises he
received in the Navy brig on Treasure
Island. He stated that the marines had
beaten Zaino and that they had refused
to let him see his client.
Manzello said that Zaino was unable
to discuss the trial at all due to emotional
stress.

courts-martial of 27 C>ls on charges of mutiny sit in the candle-lit plaza during an all-night
vigil.
Law Officer Lee listened to
Manzello with poorly concealed
annoyance. When the attorney
finished Lee snapped out that
Manzello could present his
evidence to the proper authority.
"It is not my responsibility," he
said, "I don't care to hear
anymore."
Howard DeNike, attorney for
William Hayes, spoke next. He
contended that Hayes too had been
mis-treated and "harrassed."
Hayes, he said, had been put in
solitary confinement because of his
actions on October 14, 1968 (the
"mutiny"). When he had, on one
occasion, refused to come to
attention, his prescription glasses
were smashed by a guard.
A defense motion for mis-trial.
It was denied.
The court then recessed for
thirty minutes. I won't dwell on
the scenes between the accused and
their relatives. Tears seem to have

little effect when related second
hand on paper.
When the trial re-convened, the
defense presented a letter sent to
them from Col. James Garnet, the
Army Judge Staff advocate. The
letter directed the defense counsels
not to talk to the press about the
trial.
The defense said that the letter
was a form of intimidation and that
Garnet was trying to influence the
conduct of the case. The defense
then asked that Colonel Garnet be
censored for interference and not
be allowed to review the
proceedings. Since this letter
showed obvious bias, the defense
asked again for a change of venue.
Captain Emmitt Yeary, counsel
for Pvt. Yost, submitted news
articles from the San Francisco
Chronicle and other papers to show
that the publicity has been
considerable. Yeary said that such

publicity as well as the nature of
the trial itself was having an effect
on him, personally.
He said that he had recently
been classified AWOL by his
immediate superior one morning
because he was one hour late to his
office. This incredible incident
reflected the extent of bias among
the military in the San Francisco
area he said.
Resounding to this testimony
Lee said, "It has nothing to do with
it (the trial)."
Still hoping to prove that the
trial was influenced by the press
and other factors, the defense
presented slides of the
demonstrators who had marched
and had spent the night at the Civic
Center.
The defense said the protests
would continue and that the court
board would see the motley
demonstrators every day outside
the courthouse.
Stanford student David Jones
was called to the stand. A
participant in various
demonstrations, Jones confirmed
that the protests would continue.
Chris Bradley, a freshman at
Stanford, also assured the court
that the demonstrations would go
on.
When the court recessed for the
day, no ruling on this evidence had
been given.
