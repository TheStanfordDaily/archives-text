# Winter Of Our Discontent
## 
### 
Winter Quarter is over. Almost.
It will be remembered as the quarter
when the rains came and the administrators
left. Twenty two inches of rain has fallen as
Joel Smith and Robert Hind decided to leave
Stanford, Herbert Packer choose to return to
teaching and research, and Bill Wyman
flirted with notions of moving to Santa Cruz.
As administrators departed for other
locales or other pursuits at Stanford, the
trustees arrived. They came to campus to
meet and lunch. Simultaneously, SDS
arrived to dine and Jack Friedenthal was left
to wash the dishes.
Black became more than a color for those
working in the bookstore. It became a
driving force for change, as President Pitzer
learned small mistakes and
misunderstanding can spark major
explosions.
The quarter ends with much in motion
and little resolved. As the final issue of The
Daily is printed, the ink/will be left open

should there be major news next week that
merits a special issue.
At present, the trustees and SDS appear
to be near some agreement on an open
dialogue next Tuesday afternoon. An
agreement would be most encouraging and
would remove the potential for another
disrupted meeting next week.
In past years, fall and winter quarter have
served as staging times for upheaval in the
spring. The rain has a dulling effect on the
University. It washes out rallies and students
feel more inclined to talk than to act.
Spring is the period when long simmering
decisions are finalized, when building
tensions explode, and when weary people
lunge toward the summr rather than
constructively and comprehensively dealing
with a problem.
We know how it feels. The quarter is
almost complete. Only dead week and exams
remain.
Who worries about exams?
