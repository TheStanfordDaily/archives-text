Politicians, professors, and even police. . . . It's all in a dr /'s work at The Stanford Daily. One day you could
be dodging a riot club and tear gas, the next interview.ng a leading national figure. We're not always that
busy, but crisis conditions usually prevail. Besides providing excitement, we even pay some staffers—when
we can afford it. So why not break away from your old routine and join the Daily staff? There will be an
orientation meeting for new staffers Friday, April 4, at 4 p.m. in the Daily office. (In case you don't know
where we are, the Daily is located in the Storke Studenat Publications Building, on Lomita Drive between
Panama and Santa Teresa.) In case you can't make it then, call us during the week at x 4632, and we'll
contact you. But join us. Make the Daily more interesting—and you will be, too.
