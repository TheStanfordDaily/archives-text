# Four University Fellows Selected
## 
### 
Four faculty members have been
appointed to serve as Stanford's first
Fellows of the University. The four will
play a central role in future university
innovations.
The selection of Merrill Carlsmith,
assistant professor of psychology;
Bradley Efron, associate professor of
statistics; Robert Madix, assistant pro
fessor of chemistry; and Mark Mancall,
associate professor of history was an
nounced by President Kenneth Pitzer.
The Fellows of the University will be
relieved of normal departmental assign
ments for the next three years.
The program is being financed by a
one million dollar Ford Foundation
grant, to be supplemented by 200,000
dollars in additional private gifts.
Experimental Programs
About half the project funds will be
used to meet salary and related expenses
of the Fellows, while the rest will
provide "venture capital" for highly
experimental programs.
President Pitzer announced the first
grant from this innovation fund to
support a comparative study of the
impact of teaching Racism and Preju
dice.
The four Fellows will serve on an
advisory group concerned with the use
of the innovation fund for the develop
ment and evaluation of new educational
programs at Stanford.
Vice Provost Herbert Packer, who
developed the new program, says that
giving faculty members "a sense of
educational power" through developing
and evaluating new programs which cut
across normal departmental lines can be
"the key factor in cultivating loyalty to

the institution as a whole."

relieved of normal departmental assign
ments for the next three years.
The program is being financed by a
one million dollar Ford Foundation
grant, to be supplemented by 200,000
dollars in additional private gifts.
Experimental Programs
About half the project funds will be
used to meet salary and related expenses
of the Fellows, while the rest will
provide "venture capital" for highly
experimental programs.
President Pitzer announced the first
grant from this innovation fund to
support a comparative study of the
impact of teaching Racism and Preju
dice.
The four Fellows will serve on an
advisory group concerned with the use
of the innovation fund for the develop
ment and evaluation of new educational
programs at Stanford.
Vice Provost Herbert Packer, who
developed the new program, says that
giving faculty members "a sense of
educational power" through developing
and evaluating new programs which cut
across normal departmental lines can be
"the key factor in cultivating loyalty to

the institution as a whole."
Teachers and Scholars
Recent winner of a 10,000 dollar
award from the Danforth Foundation
for his excellence in teaching, Mancall
specializes in Asian History and is an

Best known to undergraduates for
the introductory psychology course
which he has taught for the past five
years with Prof. Thomas Landauer, Carl
smith's main research interests lie in the
field of social psycholocy. His recent
work has concentrated in attitude
change and non-verbal communication.
Madix's primary research area in
volves the reactivity of gases and solids
at high temperatures. He is interested in
developing a program in whicJ ider
graduates could participate in research
activities at the university.
Madix, one of the people intimately
involved in developing the Stanford
Community Coffee House, would also
like to use his new position "to try to
communicate both the spirit and the
importance of science to the non
scientist."
