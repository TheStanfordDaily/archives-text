# Trustees I

The Stanford Board of Trustees is in
trouble and it has no one to blame but
itself.
The crisis is simple. Progress has caught
up witli the trustees. The Board is about to
experience the most thoughtful, serious,
and powerful threat to its existence since
the University was founded.
Spring 1969 is going to be a time of trial
for the trustees. Their jury will be the
concerned faculty, students, and adminis
trators at Stanford. Ironically, however, the
ultimate fate of the trustees can be decided
only by the trustees. In most pragmatic
terms: just as the trustees have refused to
change with the times, as they have stag
nated in antiquity of age, blandness of
background, and mediocrity of decision,
they can turn around and diversify
membership, open meetings, and become a
force for creative leadership at Stanford.
Should they fail, the trustees may find
impatience building and threats increasing,
for people here are justifiably weary of
waiting. Next year or next decade are not
acceptable responses.
Trustees, in harmony with our most
astute politicians, are the first to claim that
disruption must be squashed, rarely con
sidering there might be a cause for unrest.
They would never imagine themselves as a
cause.
It is time they began imagining. For at
least two years, strong pleas for change
have been presented to the Board by
students and faculty, the latest by SDS and
SES. It is unthinkable that a single trustee
is not cognizant of criticisms leveled against
the Board. Yet what is the response? To be
kind, it is best described as lethargic and
undynamic.
The case against the present organi
zation, membership, and function of the
Board is comprehensive, solid, and per
suasive. If any reinforcement is needed for
wavering critics, the Memorial Auditorium
panel in early March should suffice.
In clearest fundamentals, Stanford is an
educational institution owned and run by a
group of businessmen with minimal
knowledge or background in educational
concerns. True, Stanford is a big business
and educators are not known for brilliant
management of business.
It is impracticable to suggest business be
managed by one board and education by
another. The overlap is tremendous and the
best business decisions for the best edu
cation come only when financiers make
informed choices. The Stanford trustees are
not informed and, with few exceptions,
they lack the perspective or background to
fully understand or appreciate important
educational information.
Perhaps this is the crucial flaw in the
Board. Its cause is lack of diversity. The
trustees mindlessly have retained a system
of self-perpetuating membership selection.
One businessman follows another, all
white, and all around or above 50. Most are
friends directing successful businesses and
sitting on each other's board of directors.
Their expertise, if any. is business manage
ment. Their chief interest is making money,
and their set of values places a profit above
questions of morality or human life.
The panel earlier this month graphically
illustrated the last point. Though many of
the exchanges between students and
trustees were simplistic, some basic facts
were uncovered.
Trustee Charles Ducommun, a director
of Lockheed, appeared as a perfect com
panion for Spiro Agnew in quickness of
tongue and success of humor. More serious
ly, his comments indicated no understand
ing of student questions and interests about
the use of some Lockheed products in

Vietnam and the relation of the Lockheed
presidency to a Stanford trusteeship.
Trustee William Hewlett, president of
Hewlett-Packard Co., was pedantic and
questionably candid, particularity when he
said FMC does not produce nerve gas. A
moment later, pressed by some hard facts
and figures, he admitted they had ceased
producing nerve gas six months ago.
Hewlett's initial use of the present tense
was less than honest.
Trustee Benjamin Duniway, a judge and
supposedly enlightened Board member,
noted with great satisfaction that the
trustees have no power. One can only
wonder about his definition of power. If
the Board has no power, why does it meet
in secrecy? More to the point, why does its
agenda include curricular and residential
matters and all building decisions, etc.? In
some cases trustee power is circumscribed
by faculty prerogative, but to argue they
have no power is nonsense.
The trustee panelists were tense and out
of their natural habitat. That is small
excuse for their performance. The trustees
were themselves minus some superficial
aplomb they normally show in smaller
gatherings. In sum, they dramatically
proved their inability to serve as owners
and managers of Stanford University.
The Board now faces two alternatives:
(1) it can retrench and try to outlast the
critics, or (2) it can take immediate steps to
deal with legitimate problems.
Retrenchment means disaster. Surely
the trustees have enough sense to realize
the seriousness of critics and the desire for
change. Realistically, the trustees must
understand that the criticisms are just and
the failures of the Board are great. It is
unimaginable that change will not occur.
As a start, the Board needs to diversify
to include students, faculty, non-whites
and more non-businessmen. A replacement
for David Packard will be chosen very soon.
The opportunity must not be missed.
Furthermore, one addition is not enough.
Stanford cannot wait until five trustees
retire or die before it gets five new mem
bers. The Board must be enlarged immedi
ately. This necessitates legal action which
should be taken, rather than used as a
delaying device.
Board meetings must be opened for
regular sessions. As one student panelist
commented on March 11, if attacks on the
board are unjust because of ignorance
about board functions, the trustees have
created the problem. One or two students
at a meeting means next to nothing when
everyone is sworn to secrecy. We are
encouraged to note Board minutes are now
made public. The United States Congress
and the British Parliament meet before
public galleries. Some business cannot be
constructively decided in public, but most
trustee affairs are not in this category and
this category is often a device to keep
people in ignorance.
Finally, if properly constituted and
diversified, the Board should begin making
some creative and far reaching plans for
Stanford that do not stand or fall on
tradition. The University needs imaginative
and progressive planners. The Board of
Trustees could fill that role.
The Board must cease to exist if it
refuses to change. The philosophy behind
that argument is not militant, irresponsible,
or blindly radical. The philosophy stresses
common sense management of Stanford,
creative planning, and values that place a
human life above a dollar.
(A second editorial on trustees will
appear later this week. It will discuss more
specific changes in Board structures.)
