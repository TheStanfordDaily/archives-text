## 'Today Anguilla – Tomorrow...'

WASHINGTON —The only
bright spot in the news these days
is what has happened in Anguilla.
In one of the most amazing re
versals in modern military history,
tiny, helpless and, up to now,
ineffectual Great Britain defeated
the powerful forces of Anguilla
and conquered this impregnable
island fortress.
Little Britain, playing the role
of David, smote the Anguillan
Goliath, to the surprise of the
experts and the delight of those

who are constantly rooting for the
underdog.
"No one thought the British
could do it," said a London corre
spondent at the national press
club bar where everyone was buy
ing drinks. "But I believe this
proves once and for all Her
Majesty's government can no
longer be considered a paper
tiger."
The bar rang with cheers. "The
Anguillans bit off more than they
could chew," someone shouted.

What everyone wanted to
know was how the lightly armed
British paratroopers and marines
managed to break through the
heavy Anguillan defenses which
consisted of one Napoleonic can
non, 12 shotguns, three Ford
trucks and 2,000 sheep.
"The Anguillans were overcon
fident," the British correspondent
told us. "They thought our troops
were afraid of their sheep. But we
used their overconfidence to our
advantage. We pulled our frigates

up, and when the sheep saw them,
they scattered. The sheepherders
tried to rally the herds, but by
this time the sheep were so dis
organized they couldn't possibly
put up any defense.
"It proves again that a small,
tight-knit, well-trained force of
paratroopers and marines can
overwhelm a much larger force of
sheep if they are determined to do
the job."
This was the first military de
feat for Anguilla in its history and
there is great soul-searching going
on now amongst the Anguillan
armed forces, which consist of
three constables, six deputies and
three Red Cross nurses. There will
probably be a shakeup in the
Anguillan military within the next
month.
Anguilla-watchers in Washing
ton felt that the consequences of
the British invasion would be felt
throughout the world.
"Anguilla can no longer be
considered a major power," a
State Department man at the bar
said.
"We have to readjust our think
ing vis-a-vis their military poten
tial. If a little country like Great
Britain can defeat them, with all
the hardware the Anguillans had
at their disposal, then we'll have
to figure out some other way of
defending the Caribbean."
The London correspondent
said, "We have always insisted
that we could take Anguilla any
time we wanted to, but everyone
laughed at us. I don't imagine
they're laughing any more. The
world must know by now that we
just won't allow anyone to trifle
with the empire."
"Now that you've brought
Anguilla to her knees," an Ameri
can correspondent said, "what do
you plan to do next?"
"We are a peace-loving
people," the London corres
pondent replied. "We intervened
in Anguilla only when our inter
ests were threatened. But I think
this will serve as a warning that
aggression will not go unpunished
in any part of the globe."
A member of the English
speaking union raised his glass.
"Today Anguilla—tomorrow the
world."
