## Colossal Value Gap 
### Michael Sweeney 
Question: If you strip the Es
tablishment of its public relations
men and put it under a spot light
and fire questions at it, what do
you see?
Answer: Red, white, and blue
value systems.
I'm talking about the March 11

forum of trustees and students.
Trustee Charles Ducommon told
it like it was: "This is a conflict
perhaps," he said benignly, "in
what your value system may be,
and ours." That was one of two
trustee statements which the
large, vocal audience agreed with.

The other was: Trustee Ben Duni
way's comment:
"I say that if the university
gets into taking political positions
it will be destroyed." The audi
ence cheered loudly, but I suspect
it attached a different meaning to
those words than Judge Duniway.
Again and again, the trustees
found that the audience roared
with laughter or groans at their
earnest, honest words. Their
simple patriotism and materialism,
which has served them so well in
business, sounded to the audience
like a deliberate, arrogant flouting
of the cherished humanism of the
university.
Legal owners
Yet these men on the stage
were the legal owners of the uni
versity, who exercise a pervasive
control of its future. Repeatedly
students would ask, "why should
you men make policy for an
educational institution?" And the
trustees could not give an answer
that made sense to the audience.
The trustees were not happy to
be on the grill. W. Palmer Fuller
complained that the forum had
become "more or less of an inqui
sition." Inquisition or not, the
forum did give the trustees an
excellent opportunity to speak
their mind which they did.
Significantly, SDS and other
radicals have recognized that the
trustees' own words, as recorded
on tape, provide a priceless propa
ganda weapon. A 45-minute re
cording of parts of the forum was
broadcast on KPFA radio three
days after the forum, and a
written transcript was published a
week later in the Midpeninsula
Observer. SDS has even con
sidered making the tape into an
inexpensive phonograph record.
Fundamentals
But the forum cannot be dis
missed as a propaganda victory for
SDS. It was amazingly useful in
bringing out the fundamental atti
tudes and assumptions which
guide the trustees in their manage
ment of the university's future.
One of the most dramatic, and
troubling, statements was made
by Trustee William Hewlett. He
was questioned on the contri
butions of Stanford and SRI to
the U.S. military effort. Hewlett
pointed out that Stanford is "an
organization of the United States,
and these services are performed
for the United States of America.
I hardly call that a political de
cision."
A student then asked, "So, the
policy that you would take for
the university, if it's an institution
of the United States, is the policy
which is chosen by the United
States government? Am I
correct?"
Hewlett replied, "As far as I'm
concerned, it is."
Hewlett tried earnestly to ex

plain how he viewed his role as a
member of the Board. He chose
an unfortunate analogyâ€”the role
of a director of a corporation.
Just as trustees rarely see stu
dents, said Hewlett, so does a
director of "Lockheed, or FMC,
probably not have much occasion
to be talking to the worker on the
production line."
Hewlett also defended his aca
demic qualifications to make
policy for an educational insti
tution. He said he had served on
visiting committees to engineering
schools of several universities, and
was one of two industrialists on
the President's Science Advisory
committee. The audience groaned.
Hewlett added, "You may not
like engineering, but fundamental
ly, this is an academic pursuit."
Later Trustee Charles
Ducommun cried out, "Honestly,
we feel we're in a terrible mess in
Vietnam, and we would like to get
out . . . Peace is what we're after.
For any businessman who under
stands economics, peace is
bullish . . ." In a heated exchange
with a student, however,
Ducommun asked rhetorically,
"Do you think that SRI does
anything to help protect the lives
of American soldiers in
Vietnam?" The student shouted
back, "Why should American
soldiers be in Vietnam?"
Feeling misunderstood,
Ducommun later pointed out
some of the good things the
trustees were doing for, Stanford,
and read a long list of campus
building projects. Like the
trustees' every word, it rebounded
against him. The list was domin
ated by science and engineering
facilities. Thus Ducommun gave
credence to radical charges that
Stanford gives undue emphasis to
technological training.
Suggestions that Stanford
should have a moral concern for
its involvement, however tenuous,
with the Vietnam war received
short shrift from the trustees.
Duniway said flatly, "I don't
think it's fair to say that the
university is participating in the
war."
On the whole, the trustees
seemed frank. And students gave
their honest reactions. One re
action in particular shows the
future importance of the collosal
gap in values:
"I think it has become ap
parent that the people on the
Board of Trustees have no real
concept of an education as under
stood by students," said one stu
dent. "And therefore, unless they
undergo an amazing personality
transformation, they are unquali
fied in setting the broadest policy
decisions for this university."
