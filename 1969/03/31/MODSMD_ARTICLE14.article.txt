# Oh Christ!
## Responsibility To Act 
### Paul Rupert 
On April 3 I will appear before
the Federal Court in San Fran
cisco as criminal no. 41892 in the
case of Paul Eugene Rupert vs the
United States of America—an ap
parent mis-match. The subsequent
court battle will be another stage
in a confrontation with the mili
tary which began over 18 months
ago when I stood in front of the
Pentagon's massive facade with
several hundred of my brothers
burning draft cards.
Later that same day, an anala
gous struggle against the military
will begin at Stanford. In the
wake of an earlier confrontation
between two unequal partners—
the Trustees and SDS—in January
and a subsequent "trial", a meet
ing developed which explained a
good deal about the legitimacy of
power and the nature of decision
making on a campus which fre
quently praises reason above
force. The Thursday afternoon
meeting will try to formulate
some demands which reflect the
sense of the March 11 encounter
with the Trustees in which the
Trustees showed little concern for
our desire to be involved in the
upcoming decision about SRI.
The fact of the matter is that
we are in the midst of one of the
nation's foremost defense uni
versities, a leading supplier of
arms technology, counter
insurgency schemes, and
chemical-biological weaponry. It

is precisely those facts and those
issues that we must raise this
spring. In the context of the
student-faculty study committee
report on SRI and its relationship
to the university we have a re
sponsibility to act. It is quite
natural that I feel we should act
to contain the military; we must
do more than return draft cards,
or simply protest the ABM or be
angry about the Presidio 27.
No Easy Task
But I can't help but feel that it
will be no easy task to effect
serious changes in Stanford's
present institutional relationships
with military work. We are really
getting at the heart of the prob
lem, and as we close on the center
there will be more serious at
tempts to try to suspend and fine
and repress and expel and dodge.
In the course of "democratizing"
the university we will discover
how quickly lovely rhetoric gives
way to harsh realities.
It would almost seem that
taking on the draft or Stanford is
a bit much—that as soon as you
stick your neck out it gets lopped
off. But the fact is that we really
can't do anything else. We can be
blind for a long time, but once
we've seen what is really going on,
there is no choice but action.
There was a time when I and most
of the people I know thought our
wars noble, our country just, our
university honest. Vietnam,

racism, talking with the Trustees
and their friends who run the
country—all those things change
you.
Seeing a different world, you
charge off and do something
crazy~you turn in your draft card
or you break into a closed meet
ing or refuse to go to the back of
the bus. Not because you are a
masochist or idealist or commu
nist, but because you prefer to
live which means at some point
risking death. You act because
you really believe that it is possi
ble to stand up and make some
kind of statement about human
dignity in the face of immeasura
ble savagery on the assumption
that people will join you. There
aren't any guarantees, there's not
much certainty —only the
possibility.
Debt To SDS
This campus owes a great deal
to those SDS people who cared
enough to bust up an illegitimate
meeting. The March 11 meeting
revealed at least that. But more
importantly it gives us all a chance
to act in suooort of their action.
The spring is going to be a very
active quarter. Very serious de
cisions are going to be made
which will affect women, child
ren, peasants we will never see,
perhaps never understand, all
around the world.
I suspect that it will be very
difficult to get the Trustees to

make an open, on-campus deci
sion about SRI; that we will be
told about the "impossibility of
handling so delicate and sensitive
a question without appropriate
time"—a period which should ex
tend just into the summer break. I
am sure we will hear off-handed
arguments about the absolute
priority of academic freedom, the
freedom to do death-dealing re
search for a price. There will be
side-issues, diversions, evasions,
and force if necessary.
But the important thing to
remember is that we have the
power to change this university.
We are in a position to end at least
the CBW and counter-insurgency
research at SRI, to begin the
transfer of power from a secretive
Board of wealthy businessmen to
a responsible community, to re
arrange the priorities of this uni
versity.
I've never really known exactly
who reads this column, but I hope
you understand that I am asking
you to support me, to join us.
Those of us in the Resistance, in
SDS act on the assumption that
we can work together, that Spring
can be a time of life if we col
lectively strike a blow at the
machinery of death. Join us April
3.

Those of us in the Resistance, in
SDS act on the assumption that
we can work together, that Spring
can be a time of life if we col
lectively strike a blow at the
machinery of death. Join us April

On April 3 I will appear before
the Federal Court in San Fran
cisco as criminal no. 41892 in the
case of Paul Eugene Rupert vs the
United States of America—an ap
parent mis-match. The subsequent
court battle will be another stage
in a confrontation with the mili
tary which began over 18 months
ago when I stood in front of the
Pentagon's massive facade with
several hundred of my brothers
burning draft cards.
Later that same day, an anala
gous struggle against the military
will begin at Stanford. In the
wake of an earlier confrontation
between two unequal partners—
the Trustees and SDS—in January
and a subsequent "trial", a meet
ing developed which explained a
good deal about the legitimacy of
power and the nature of decision
making on a campus which fre
quently praises reason above
force. The Thursday afternoon
meeting will try to formulate
some demands which reflect the
sense of the March 11 encounter
with the Trustees in which the
Trustees showed little concern for
our desire to be involved in the
upcoming decision about SRI.
The fact of the matter is that
we are in the midst of one of the
nation's foremost defense uni
versities, a leading supplier of
arms technology, counter
insurgency schemes, and
chemical-biological weaponry. It

is precisely those facts and those
issues that we must raise this
spring. In the context of the
student-faculty study committee
report on SRI and its relationship
to the university we have a re
sponsibility to act. It is quite
natural that I feel we should act
to contain the military; we must
do more than return draft cards,
or simply protest the ABM or be
angry about the Presidio 27.
No Easy Task
But I can't help but feel that it
will be no easy task to effect
serious changes in Stanford's
present institutional relationships
with military work. We are really
getting at the heart of the prob
lem, and as we close on the center
there will be more serious at
tempts to try to suspend and fine
and repress and expel and dodge.
In the course of "democratizing"
the university we will discover
how quickly lovely rhetoric gives
way to harsh realities.
It would almost seem that
taking on the draft or Stanford is
a bit much—that as soon as you
stick your neck out it gets lopped
off. But the fact is that we really
can't do anything else. We can be
blind for a long time, but once
we've seen what is really going on,
there is no choice but action.
There was a time when I and most
of the people I know thought our
wars noble, our country just, our
university honest. Vietnam,

racism, talking with the Trustees
and their friends who run the
country—all those things change
you.
Seeing a different world, you
charge off and do something
crazy~you turn in your draft card
or you break into a closed meet
ing or refuse to go to the back of
the bus. Not because you are a
masochist or idealist or commu
nist, but because you prefer to
live which means at some point
risking death. You act because
you really believe that it is possi
ble to stand up and make some
kind of statement about human
dignity in the face of immeasura
ble savagery on the assumption
that people will join you. There
aren't any guarantees, there's not
much certainty —only the
possibility.
Debt To SDS
This campus owes a great deal
to those SDS people who cared
enough to bust up an illegitimate
meeting. The March 11 meeting
revealed at least that. But more
importantly it gives us all a chance
to act in suooort of their action.
The spring is going to be a very
active quarter. Very serious de
cisions are going to be made
which will affect women, child
ren, peasants we will never see,
perhaps never understand, all
around the world.
I suspect that it will be very
difficult to get the Trustees to

make an open, on-campus deci
sion about SRI; that we will be
told about the "impossibility of
handling so delicate and sensitive
a question without appropriate
time"—a period which should ex
tend just into the summer break. I
am sure we will hear off-handed
arguments about the absolute
priority of academic freedom, the
freedom to do death-dealing re
search for a price. There will be
side-issues, diversions, evasions,
and force if necessary.
But the important thing to
remember is that we have the
power to change this university.
We are in a position to end at least
the CBW and counter-insurgency
research at SRI, to begin the
transfer of power from a secretive
Board of wealthy businessmen to
a responsible community, to re
arrange the priorities of this uni
versity.
I've never really known exactly
who reads this column, but I hope
you understand that I am asking
you to support me, to join us.

the CBW and counter-insurgency
research at SRI, to begin the
transfer of power from a secretive
Board of wealthy businessmen to
a responsible community, to re
arrange the priorities of this uni
versity.
I've never really known exactly
who reads this column, but I hope
you understand that I am asking
you to support me, to join us.
Those of us in the Resistance, in
SDS act on the assumption that
we can work together, that Spring
can be a time of life if we col
lectively strike a blow at the
machinery of death. Join us April
3.

On April 3 I will appear before
the Federal Court in San Fran
cisco as criminal no. 41892 in the
case of Paul Eugene Rupert vs the
United States of America—an ap
parent mis-match. The subsequent
court battle will be another stage
in a confrontation with the mili
tary which began over 18 months
ago when I stood in front of the
Pentagon's massive facade with
several hundred of my brothers
burning draft cards.
Later that same day, an anala
gous struggle against the military
will begin at Stanford. In the
wake of an earlier confrontation
between two unequal partners—
the Trustees and SDS—in January
and a subsequent "trial", a meet
ing developed which explained a
good deal about the legitimacy of
power and the nature of decision
making on a campus which fre
quently praises reason above
force. The Thursday afternoon
meeting will try to formulate
some demands which reflect the
sense of the March 11 encounter
with the Trustees in which the
Trustees showed little concern for
our desire to be involved in the
upcoming decision about SRI.
The fact of the matter is that
we are in the midst of one of the
nation's foremost defense uni
versities, a leading supplier of
arms technology, counter
insurgency schemes, and
chemical-biological weaponry. It

is precisely those facts and those
issues that we must raise this
spring. In the context of the
student-faculty study committee
report on SRI and its relationship
to the university we have a re
sponsibility to act. It is quite
natural that I feel we should act
to contain the military; we must
do more than return draft cards,
or simply protest the ABM or be
angry about the Presidio 27.
No Easy Task
But I can't help but feel that it
will be no easy task to effect
serious changes in Stanford's
present institutional relationships
with military work. We are really
getting at the heart of the prob
lem, and as we close on the center
there will be more serious at
tempts to try to suspend and fine
and repress and expel and dodge.
In the course of "democratizing"
the university we will discover
how quickly lovely rhetoric gives
way to harsh realities.
It would almost seem that
taking on the draft or Stanford is
a bit much—that as soon as you
stick your neck out it gets lopped
off. But the fact is that we really
can't do anything else. We can be
blind for a long time, but once
we've seen what is really going on,
there is no choice but action.
There was a time when I and most
of the people I know thought our
wars noble, our country just, our
university honest. Vietnam,

racism, talking with the Trustees
and their friends who run the
country—all those things change
you.
Seeing a different world, you
charge off and do something
crazy~you turn in your draft card
or you break into a closed meet
ing or refuse to go to the back of
the bus. Not because you are a
masochist or idealist or commu
nist, but because you prefer to
live which means at some point
risking death. You act because
you really believe that it is possi
ble to stand up and make some
kind of statement about human
dignity in the face of immeasura
ble savagery on the assumption
that people will join you. There
aren't any guarantees, there's not
much certainty —only the
possibility.
Debt To SDS
This campus owes a great deal
to those SDS people who cared
enough to bust up an illegitimate
meeting. The March 11 meeting
revealed at least that. But more
importantly it gives us all a chance
to act in suooort of their action.
The spring is going to be a very
active quarter. Very serious de
cisions are going to be made
which will affect women, child
ren, peasants we will never see,
perhaps never understand, all
around the world.
I suspect that it will be very
difficult to get the Trustees to

make an open, on-campus deci
sion about SRI; that we will be
told about the "impossibility of
handling so delicate and sensitive
a question without appropriate
time"—a period which should ex
tend just into the summer break. I
am sure we will hear off-handed
arguments about the absolute
priority of academic freedom, the
freedom to do death-dealing re
search for a price. There will be
side-issues, diversions, evasions,
and force if necessary.
But the important thing to
remember is that we have the
power to change this university.
