An open letter to the Stanford
Hoard of Trustees
Gentlemen:
As I sat in the Auditorium last
Tuesday, I was painfully aware
that you did not look too good.
You lost the sympathy of many
who came there as your friends.
Of course I don't blame you for
feeling defensive. You knew you
were there to be attacked. But the
solution is not to evade things!
You cannot bring a collection of
America's most brilliant minds to
gether and expect to fool them.
Surely you must know that the
issue is not your motives for being
Trustees, nor your efficiency in
running the University. To these
young people the University can
not be tz' en out of the world,
and dealt with as an enclave of
learning. They feel that it—and
therefore you—must be com
mitted to making a humane
world: without war, without
slums, without pollution, without
prejudice and frustration and in
equality.
Perhaps they are naive and
impatient about how to achieve
these goals. But to show them
better means, you must first
accept the goals in a convincing
manner. And that means re
nouncing ALL complicity in
American exploitation of small
nations, or in the manufacture of
such horrors as (to use their ex
ample) nerve-gas.
Accepting the goals in a realis
tic manner means openly con
fronting their anger, their serious
ness, their idealism, their in
sistence, their despair—not once,
but perhaps many times. They do
not hate you; but they hate things
which they feel YOU can do
something about, and they are
crying out to be convinced that
you really WANT to do something
about them.
Hoping, therefore, that you
will be willing to continue an
open dialog until mutual confi
dence is achieved, I am
Sincerely yours,
(Father) John S. Duryea
Chaplain for the Catholic
Community at Stanford

• Prediction
Editor, THE DAILY:
We should like to predict the
following on the question of the
Trustees' handling University re
lationship to SRI.
1) The Trustees have already
decided what their posture is (will
be) on SRI and Stanford.
2) The report of the SRI com
mittee, since it is not due to be
published until April 15, will not
be considered by the Trustees
until their May meeting (in Los
Angeles, no doubt).
3) At their May meeting, they
will form a select committee
whose main functions will be to
extend deliberations until June or
later, and put what they've al
ready decided upon in
"Trustee-ese."
4) The June meeting will be
scheduled either after the bulk of
the Stanford population has left
the campus, or away from campus
(in Los Angeles again?), or both.
Should the Trustees decide to
take the community's interests
seriously, we suggest a viable alter
native to their obfuscatory plans:
1) Since the report is due only
one week after their April meet
ing, we suggest that their com
mittee be formed at the April
meeting, and begin open deliber
ations as soon as the report is

published. These deliberations
should preferably be on campus.
2) Further, we suggest that
they consider their committee's
report with the Stanford Com
munity, in a location suitable for
the purpose of discussion, at their
May meeting.
Sincerely,
Victor von Schlegell

• Welcome Back
Editor, THE DAILY:
In the most recent course re
view, there is a comment that the
history secretaries "snap at you"
when you walk in the office. This
may have been true when the
review came out. However . . . we,
the present group of secretaries,
would like to point out that this is
no longer true. The new secre
taries are (exuberantly) friendly.
We invite history students (and all
other interested passers-by) to
stop in for a piece of candy and
any (friendly) advice you may
need.
Welcome back to school,
— IMindy and Nancy-Gail
History Secretaries
