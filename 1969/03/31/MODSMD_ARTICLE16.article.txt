Princeton University faculty
voted to drop credit for ROTC
classes Monday ignoring a letter to
the faculty from Defense Secretary
Melvin Laird asking that they
postpone their action.
The letter from Laird said "My
primary concern is that such
actions will tend to degrade a
military service as an honorable
profession and the resultant serious
implications with respect to the
future of our officers corps—and
indeed the nation's security."
