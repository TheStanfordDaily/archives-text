# Senate Supports Judicial Decision
## 
### 
In a series of votes, the Aca
demic Senate has responded on
several campus issues, including
fines levied against 29 trustees
meeting disrupters and an SES
recommendation on a writing re
quirement.
In a 26-1 vote, Stanford fac
ulty representatives March 6 com
mended President Kenneth S.
Pitzer for his "prompt and effec
tive" implementation of the Stan
ford Judicial Council's decision on
29 students who disrupted a trus
tee meeting.
The resolution "the entire aca
demic community to support the
President on this matter."
The Judicial Council unani
mously recommended suspended
suspensions and fines totaling
$1900 for the students, who have
said they will not pay. In accord
with the Judicial Council's recom
mendation, students who fail to
pay at least half the fine by March
31 will not be permitted to enroll
for spring quarter.
Taking its first official action

on recommendations from the
Study of Education at Stanford
(SES), the Senate without dissent
voted to require a one-semester or
two-quarter writing course for
graduation with a bachelor's de
gree.
Meeting concurrently at a sep
arate location, the newly organ
ized Education Council, a repre
sentative group of 40 students,
voted against any writing require
ment. Instead, they endorsed or
ganization of an institute for com
position, with student involve
ment, to provide help for students
in this field.
Differences between the stu
dent and faculty positions will
now go to a conference commit
tee.
The Senate voted to postpone
consideration of a second SES
recommendation calling for a one
semester or two-quarter require
ment in historical studies. As
drafted, this would permit stu
dents to fulfill the requirement by
taking an approved course in any

one of several departments.
In a separate development,
President Pitzer announced he had
sent invitations to 11 individuals
to serve on a new Presidential
Advisory Committee on Selective
Service, which will be headed by
Prof. Alan Coleman of the Gradu
ate School of Business.
Pitzer expressed hope the com
mittee would prepare a position
paper evaluating the present Selec
tive Service law and recommend
desirable amendments.
"The new Congress will be
asked to modify the existing stat
ute and principal officers of the
University who will be in touch
with members of Congress both
directly and through various edu
cational associations need a back
ground paper of this nature," Pit
zer said.
Advise Officers
More generally, the committee
will advise various university offi
cers on policy questions concern
ign the impact of Selective Service
| on individual faculty, students,
and staff members.
He also invited eight persons to
serve on a Presidential Advisory
Committee on 1969-70 Housing
Problems, headed by Prof. Scott

Pearson, of the Food Researcn
Institute.
This group will review priori
ties for undergraduate housing as
signments and staffing arrange
ments for the residence system.
Those invited to serve on this
committee include Dean Robert
Funk, Mrs. A. Nancy Palmer,
Dean Daniel Williams, Eric Larsen,
Margaret R. Dougherty, Mrs.
Abbie von Schlegell, and Richard
M. McDowell.
Selective Service Committee
Those invited to serve on the
selective service committee in
clude Daniel T. Cook, Prof.
William Fairbank, William L. Le
land, Prof. Kenneth Mosier, Assis
tant Dean Thomas Robinson,
Charles M. Rosen, John W. Spie
gel, Dean Virgil K. Whitaker, As
sociate Dean Lauress Wise, and
Robert S. Wolf.
In a letter to President Pitzer,
Prof. Kenneth Scott, chairman of
the Stanford-SRI Study Commit
tee, requested a two-week delay in
submission of its report, from
April 1 to 15. The delay is de
signed to permit full participation
of undergraduate members in the
final stages of the committee's

work, which extends through an
exam period.
On March 20, the faculty rep
resentatives urged their colleagues
to "actively support" rules for
community conduct developed by
students and faculty.
In a statement adopted '28-5,
the Senate of the Academic
Council noted that Stanford now
has "a system to establish and
support rules of community con
duct that has the overwhelming
approval" of both students and
faculty.
Acceptance of Rules
Support of this system, which
places primary responsibility for
campus rule-making and enforce
ment in student-faculty commit
tees, "begins with the acceptance
of rules for oneself," the Senate
said.
"It surely extends to the coun
seling of others not to violate
these rules and to full cooperation
with investigative efforts conduc
ted by the Stanford Judicial
Council. It requires that faculty
members, each using his best
judgement under the circum
stances, be willing to step forward
when the rules are violated by
others, to identify the violation
and name the violators."

Prof. Alan Coleman of the Gradu
ate School of Business.
Pitzer expressed hope the com
mittee would prepare a position
paper evaluating the present Selec
tive Service law and recommend
desirable amendments.
"The new Congress will be
asked to modify the existing stat
ute and principal officers of the
University who will be in touch
with members of Congress both
directly and through various edu
cational associations need a back
ground paper of this nature," Pit
zer said.
Advise Officers
More generally, the committee
will advise various university offi
cers on policy questions concern
ign the impact of Selective Service
| on individual faculty, students,
and staff members.
He also invited eight persons to
serve on a Presidential Advisory
Committee on 1969-70 Housing
Problems, headed by Prof. Scott

Pearson, of the Food Researcn
Institute.
This group will review priori
ties for undergraduate housing as
signments and staffing arrange
ments for the residence system.
Those invited to serve on this
committee include Dean Robert
Funk, Mrs. A. Nancy Palmer,
Dean Daniel Williams, Eric Larsen,
Margaret R. Dougherty, Mrs.
Abbie von Schlegell, and Richard
M. McDowell.
Selective Service Committee
Those invited to serve on the
selective service committee in
clude Daniel T. Cook, Prof.
William Fairbank, William L. Le

Robert S. Wolf.
In a letter to President Pitzer,
Prof. Kenneth Scott, chairman of
the Stanford-SRI Study Commit
tee, requested a two-week delay in
submission of its report, from
April 1 to 15. The delay is de
signed to permit full participation
of undergraduate members in the
final stages of the committee's

work, which extends through an
exam period.
On March 20, the faculty rep
resentatives urged their colleagues
to "actively support" rules for
community conduct developed by
students and faculty.
In a statement adopted '28-5,
the Senate of the Academic
Council noted that Stanford now
has "a system to establish and
support rules of community con
duct that has the overwhelming
approval" of both students and
faculty.
Acceptance of Rules
Support of this system, which
places primary responsibility for
campus rule-making and enforce
ment in student-faculty commit
tees, "begins with the acceptance
of rules for oneself," the Senate
said.
"It surely extends to the coun
seling of others not to violate
these rules and to full cooperation
with investigative efforts conduc
ted by the Stanford Judicial
Council. It requires that faculty
members, each using his best
judgement under the circum
stances, be willing to step forward
when the rules are violated by
others, to identify the violation
and name the violators."
In a series of votes, the Aca
demic Senate has responded on
several campus issues, including
fines levied against 29 trustees
meeting disrupters and an SES
recommendation on a writing re
quirement.
In a 26-1 vote, Stanford fac
ulty representatives March 6 com
mended President Kenneth S.
Pitzer for his "prompt and effec
tive" implementation of the Stan
ford Judicial Council's decision on
29 students who disrupted a trus
tee meeting.
The resolution "the entire aca
demic community to support the
President on this matter."
The Judicial Council unani
mously recommended suspended
suspensions and fines totaling
$1900 for the students, who have
said they will not pay. In accord
with the Judicial Council's recom
mendation, students who fail to
pay at least half the fine by March
31 will not be permitted to enroll
for spring quarter.
Taking its first official action

on recommendations from the
Study of Education at Stanford
(SES), the Senate without dissent
voted to require a one-semester or
two-quarter writing course for
graduation with a bachelor's de
gree.
Meeting concurrently at a sep
arate location, the newly organ
ized Education Council, a repre
sentative group of 40 students,
voted against any writing require
ment. Instead, they endorsed or
ganization of an institute for com
position, with student involve
ment, to provide help for students
in this field.
Differences between the stu
dent and faculty positions will
now go to a conference commit
tee.
The Senate voted to postpone
consideration of a second SES
recommendation calling for a one
semester or two-quarter require
ment in historical studies. As
drafted, this would permit stu
dents to fulfill the requirement by
taking an approved course in any

one of several departments.
In a separate development,
President Pitzer announced he had
sent invitations to 11 individuals
to serve on a new Presidential
Advisory Committee on Selective
Service, which will be headed by
Prof. Alan Coleman of the Gradu
ate School of Business.

resentatives urged their colleagues
to "actively support" rules for
community conduct developed by
students and faculty.
In a statement adopted '28-5,
the Senate of the Academic
Council noted that Stanford now
has "a system to establish and
support rules of community con
duct that has the overwhelming
approval" of both students and
faculty.
Acceptance of Rules
Support of this system, which
places primary responsibility for
campus rule-making and enforce
ment in student-faculty commit
tees, "begins with the acceptance
of rules for oneself," the Senate
said.
"It surely extends to the coun
seling of others not to violate
these rules and to full cooperation
with investigative efforts conduc
ted by the Stanford Judicial
Council. It requires that faculty
members, each using his best
judgement under the circum
stances, be willing to step forward
when the rules are violated by
others, to identify the violation
and name the violators."
In a series of votes, the Aca
demic Senate has responded on
several campus issues, including
fines levied against 29 trustees
meeting disrupters and an SES
recommendation on a writing re
quirement.
In a 26-1 vote, Stanford fac
ulty representatives March 6 com
mended President Kenneth S.
Pitzer for his "prompt and effec
tive" implementation of the Stan
ford Judicial Council's decision on
29 students who disrupted a trus
tee meeting.
The resolution "the entire aca
demic community to support the
President on this matter."
The Judicial Council unani
mously recommended suspended
suspensions and fines totaling
$1900 for the students, who have
said they will not pay. In accord
with the Judicial Council's recom
mendation, students who fail to
pay at least half the fine by March
31 will not be permitted to enroll
for spring quarter.
Taking its first official action

on recommendations from the
Study of Education at Stanford
(SES), the Senate without dissent
voted to require a one-semester or
two-quarter writing course for
graduation with a bachelor's de
gree.
Meeting concurrently at a sep
arate location, the newly organ
ized Education Council, a repre
sentative group of 40 students,
voted against any writing require
ment. Instead, they endorsed or
ganization of an institute for com
position, with student involve
ment, to provide help for students
in this field.
Differences between the stu
dent and faculty positions will
now go to a conference commit
tee.
The Senate voted to postpone
consideration of a second SES
recommendation calling for a one
semester or two-quarter require
ment in historical studies. As
drafted, this would permit stu
dents to fulfill the requirement by
taking an approved course in any

one of several departments.
In a separate development,
President Pitzer announced he had
sent invitations to 11 individuals
to serve on a new Presidential
Advisory Committee on Selective
Service, which will be headed by
Prof. Alan Coleman of the Gradu
ate School of Business.
Pitzer expressed hope the com
mittee would prepare a position
paper evaluating the present Selec
tive Service law and recommend
desirable amendments.
"The new Congress will be
asked to modify the existing stat
ute and principal officers of the
University who will be in touch
with members of Congress both
directly and through various edu
cational associations need a back
ground paper of this nature," Pit
zer said.
Advise Officers
More generally, the committee
will advise various university offi
cers on policy questions concern
ign the impact of Selective Service
| on individual faculty, students,
and staff members.
He also invited eight persons to
serve on a Presidential Advisory
Committee on 1969-70 Housing
Problems, headed by Prof. Scott

Pearson, of the Food Researcn
Institute.
This group will review priori
ties for undergraduate housing as
signments and staffing arrange
ments for the residence system.
Those invited to serve on this
committee include Dean Robert
Funk, Mrs. A. Nancy Palmer,
Dean Daniel Williams, Eric Larsen,
Margaret R. Dougherty, Mrs.
Abbie von Schlegell, and Richard
M. McDowell.
Selective Service Committee
Those invited to serve on the
selective service committee in
clude Daniel T. Cook, Prof.
William Fairbank, William L. Le
land, Prof. Kenneth Mosier, Assis
tant Dean Thomas Robinson,
Charles M. Rosen, John W. Spie
gel, Dean Virgil K. Whitaker, As
sociate Dean Lauress Wise, and
Robert S. Wolf.
In a letter to President Pitzer,
Prof. Kenneth Scott, chairman of
the Stanford-SRI Study Commit
tee, requested a two-week delay in
submission of its report, from
April 1 to 15. The delay is de
signed to permit full participation
of undergraduate members in the
final stages of the committee's

work, which extends through an
exam period.
