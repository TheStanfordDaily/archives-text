# Trustees Call ROTC 'Vital', Urge More Talks With DOD
## 
### 
The Board of Trustees called
ROTC "vital to the continued
supply of civilian leadership for
the military service" and urged
President Kenneth S. Pitzer to
continue negotiations with De
fense Department officials "lead
ing to appropriate actions which
will improve and vitalize this im
portant program" in a statement
issued March 11.
The Board's action made no
mention of academic credit for
ROTC courses, a subject which
will be considered by the Stanford
Academic Council at its next regu
lar meeting April 4.
The Board urged that "any
action taken with respect to
ROTC give full weight to the
following:
"A. That this nation has a
strong and valued tradition of
civilian participation in military
leadership;
B. That deterioration of that
tradition would move us very
quickly toward the emergence of
a military caste;
C. That ROTC is vital to the
continued supply of civilian lead
ership for the military services,
and it is of crucial importance
that first-ranking institutions,
such as Stanford, lend their
strength to that task; and
D. Further that this board of
trustees urges the president of the
university to continue his consul
tation with the Department of
Defense, leading to appropriate
actions which will improve and
vitalize this important program."
Action Follows Referendum
The trustee action follows a
Feb. 24 student referendum,
where a 3-2 majority said "ROTC
has a legitimate place on campus
and deserves support and credit
from the University for all those
parts of the program that are of
genuine academic interest." The
vote was 2,106 to 1,397 among
the University's 11,400 students.
On Feb. 23, faculty represent

tives on the Senate of the Aca
demic Council voted 25-8 to end
academic credit for military train
ing and education at Stanford,
starting in 1970.
More than 50 professors have
requested that the entire Council
reconsider this action—the first
such review in the seven-month
history of the Senate. The Council
includes more than 900 members
of professorial rank.
Faculty groups at Harvard,
Princeton, Yale, Cornell, Pennsyl
vania, and Pomona have voted to
deny ROTC academic credit.
Majority Recommendation
The Senate action at Stanford
followed a 6-3 majority recom
mendation from a student-faculty
committee which spent five
months studying relations be
tween the University and ROTC
departments.
Neither the majority nor the
minority advocated the removal
of ROTC from campus. The ma
jority report suggested that ROTC
could continue to offer a scholar
ship or contract program, compri
sing normal academic education
outside ROTC, supplemented by
voluntary activities on campus
and off-campus training. Military
personnel on campus to admin
ister such an armed forces officer
program also could offer volun
tary undergraduate special courses
on the same basis as other mem
bers of the campus community,
following present policy guide
lines.
The minority report recom
mended consolidation of the three
services into a single department,
with a joint student-faculty com
mittee in charge of credit courses
in the military science curriculum.
This group would include four
professors from the University at
large, one from each service, and
four students.
Assuming that studies in mili
tary history and national security
affairs will be available in other

academic departments in the
future, degree credit for courses
offered by the reorganized depart
ment of military studies would
not exceed 18 of the 160 units
required for graduation, the min
ority noted.
If adopted by the Stanford
faculty, any decision to deny aca
demic credit for military training
and education would not become
fully effective until 1973, when
students now enrolled in the pro
gram graduate.
The Army ROTC program was
established at Stanford in 1919,
with Air Force and Navy pro
grams starting in 1946. All three
are voluntary.
In 1958-59, the three depart
ments had a combined enrollment
of 732 students and commis
sioned 186 officers. By 1963-64,
there were 586 enrolled and 86
commissioned, while last year
there were 383 enrolled and 98
commissioned. Among those en
rolled, 125 had full tuition ROTC
scholarships, worth a combined
total of about $250,000.

President Kenneth S. Pitzer to
continue negotiations with De
fense Department officials "lead
ing to appropriate actions which
will improve and vitalize this im
portant program" in a statement
issued March 11.
The Board's action made no
mention of academic credit for
ROTC courses, a subject which
will be considered by the Stanford
Academic Council at its next regu
lar meeting April 4.
The Board urged that "any
action taken with respect to
ROTC give full weight to the
following:
"A. That this nation has a
strong and valued tradition of
civilian participation in military
leadership;
B. That deterioration of that
tradition would move us very
quickly toward the emergence of
a military caste;
C. That ROTC is vital to the
continued supply of civilian lead
ership for the military services,
and it is of crucial importance
that first-ranking institutions,
such as Stanford, lend their
strength to that task; and
D. Further that this board of
trustees urges the president of the
university to continue his consul
tation with the Department of
Defense, leading to appropriate
actions which will improve and
vitalize this important program."
Action Follows Referendum
The trustee action follows a
Feb. 24 student referendum,
where a 3-2 majority said "ROTC
has a legitimate place on campus
and deserves support and credit
from the University for all those
parts of the program that are of
genuine academic interest." The
vote was 2,106 to 1,397 among
the University's 11,400 students.
On Feb. 23, faculty represent

tives on the Senate of the Aca
demic Council voted 25-8 to end
academic credit for military train
ing and education at Stanford,
starting in 1970.
More than 50 professors have
requested that the entire Council
reconsider this action—the first
such review in the seven-month
history of the Senate. The Council
includes more than 900 members
of professorial rank.
Faculty groups at Harvard,
Princeton, Yale, Cornell, Pennsyl
vania, and Pomona have voted to
deny ROTC academic credit.
Majority Recommendation
The Senate action at Stanford
followed a 6-3 majority recom
mendation from a student-faculty
committee which spent five
months studying relations be
tween the University and ROTC
departments.
Neither the majority nor the
minority advocated the removal
of ROTC from campus. The ma
jority report suggested that ROTC
could continue to offer a scholar
ship or contract program, compri
sing normal academic education
outside ROTC, supplemented by
voluntary activities on campus
and off-campus training. Military
personnel on campus to admin
ister such an armed forces officer
program also could offer volun
tary undergraduate special courses
on the same basis as other mem
bers of the campus community,
following present policy guide
lines.
The minority report recom
mended consolidation of the three
services into a single department,
with a joint student-faculty com
mittee in charge of credit courses
in the military science curriculum.
This group would include four
professors from the University at
large, one from each service, and
four students.
Assuming that studies in mili
tary history and national security
affairs will be available in other

academic departments in the
future, degree credit for courses
offered by the reorganized depart
ment of military studies would
not exceed 18 of the 160 units
required for graduation, the min
ority noted.
If adopted by the Stanford
faculty, any decision to deny aca
demic credit for military training
and education would not become
fully effective until 1973, when
students now enrolled in the pro
gram graduate.
The Army ROTC program was
established at Stanford in 1919,
with Air Force and Navy pro
grams starting in 1946. All three
are voluntary.
In 1958-59, the three depart
ments had a combined enrollment
of 732 students and commis
sioned 186 officers. By 1963-64,
there were 586 enrolled and 86
commissioned, while last year
there were 383 enrolled and 98
commissioned. Among those en
rolled, 125 had full tuition ROTC
scholarships, worth a combined
total of about $250,000.
The Board of Trustees called
ROTC "vital to the continued
