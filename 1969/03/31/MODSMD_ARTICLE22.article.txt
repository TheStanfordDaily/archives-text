# Black Business Gets On Its Feet

In a far corner, spurts of steam
issue from a pants presser. En
veloped in plastic, or piled on
adjoining tables are button-down
shirts, ruffled blouses, "hi-style"
trousers, mini dresses, a few
dasheekis and boubas (Native
African Dress).
Nairobi Cleaners in Littleman's
Shopping Center, East Palo Alto,
is jammed with business, after
four months under new manage
ment.
The two proud Black owners
are discussing their good fortune
with their business consultant, in
the only available, laundry-free
corner.
"Sure, you had a reputation in
the community. I don't knock
it . . .but you know what I mean.
That kind of reputation won't get
you a bank loan. Now you've
started to build a good business
reputation. That's what you need.
Be careful; don't jeopardize it."
The tall chino-clad business con
sultant weighs the impact of his
words; sees they've been taken
under consideration. He grins.
Business Students Group
Roger Coates is a student at
Stanford Graduate School of Busi
ness. He is a member of the
Business Development Association
(BDA), a volunteer association of
Stanford business students seeking
to use their management training
to help struggling, small minority
business get started.
Pat Brock, 20, and Steve
Smothers, 22, co-owners of
Nairobi Cleaners, were among
BDA's first clients. It has been a
successful meeting of technically

schooled crew-cut brainpower and
hustler-styled ghetto
entrepreneurship.
Since last fall, Roger, Steve and
Pat have worried the new business
through a loan application, set up
a special bookkeeping system for
laundries, devised a broad adver
tising campaign including TV,
radio, information flyers and the
Black community grapevine, and
watched the money come in.
In July, Nairobi Cleaners, then
called Village Cleaners, faced im
pending bankruptcy. Its former
owner was forced to plow back all
receipts into outstanding debts
totaling over $4,000.
Proposal Drafted
In August, Pat and Steve
drafted a proposal for an $8,000
loan, and began negotiations to
purchase Village Cleaners.
October, they received the loan
from Areata National's Small
Business Investment Corp. and
signed the business transfer
papers. All creditors were paid
within three weeks, the new
owners started off with no debts
and a single $8,000 five-year note.
By November, they were making
money.
"The success of Nairobi Clean
ers will mean a great deal to the
East Palo Alto community,"
Roger says. "Steve and Pat are
among the most visible members
of the community. Both of them
are committed to developing a
Black power, green power base for
East Palo Alto, and they're in a
leadership position to do it. It's
exciting to be a part of it. I'm
convinced the Black businessman

is going to show us new ways of
running businesses, based on their
community-conscious ways of
doing things. Attempting to trans
late Business School terminology
and technology into the language
and concepts of their environment
has been a tremendous challenge,
and the most stimulating aspect of
the whole project to date."
First conversations exploring
the possibility of a volunteer stu
dent association to help small
ghetto businesses began casually
in the Business School halls last
spring.
BDA Objectives Mapped
First-year master of business
administration candidates Hoff
Stauffer, 23, and John Osterweis,
26, mapped out objectives, types
of clients BDA might assist, areas
of business development in which
Business School students might be
most helpful through their train
ing; and approached the San Jose
office of the Economic Oppor
tunity Commission (EOC) to test
their idea.
They worked with the San Jose
EOC office through he early
summer, assisting small businesses
in the area. During this period,
Hoff and John became acquainted
with the work of former student
colleague, Pete Hansen, MBA '68.
Under his direction, Arcate
National Corp. had just formed a
small business investment corpo
ration to loan funds or assume an
equity in Peninsula-area Black
businesses.
"From the beginning, it was
obvious that the new ghetto entre
preneurs seeking loans from
Arcate needed more than just
money," says John. "They needed
general management assistance, in
cluding initial business planning
and preparation of loan appli
cations. Since BDA members had
already developed consulting ex
perience in working with San Jose
small businessmen, it seemed
natural to form an alliance with
Areata."
First EPA Clients
Hansen put John and Hoff in
contact with their first East Palo
Alto clients. (In the half-year
since August, BDA advisers, who
represent some 20 percent of the
studerft body, have helped more
than 100 small businesses.)
"Six months of working in the
ghetto has taught us a lot," says
Hoff. "Education on both sides is
critical to the continued success
of BDA. At the beginning, we
found it necessary to state several
racial encounter groups at Stan
ford, to reveal some of the mores,
the hidden motives, the racially
based bias that can lead to mis
understanding at the outset. Stu
dents and clients met face to face
and talked. We need more of this
type of learning.
"Also, the ghetto businessman
needs to learn basic business pro
cedures. One of the greatest prob
lems they face, we've found, is an
uncertainty about how the 'White'

business community operates.
There is a great lack of under
standing of such 'normal' pro
cedures as filing a loan appli
cation. This is where we as busi
ness students can be most help
ful."
The experience of consultant
Tom Bailard with his client Mrs.
Cassie Domangeaux, owner of
Soul Food Kitchen, is a telling
example of the bewilderment,
frustration and desperation that
can result from Black contact
with the White business communi
ty.
Soul Food Restaurant
Tom met Mrs. Domangeaux
"at a critical point in her efforts
to open a soul food take-out
restaurant in East Palo Alto. Her
loan application to Areata
National's Small Business Invest
ment Corp. had been side-tracked.
Loan officers told her 1) that the
business was too risky and 2) that
her application, a one-page, one
column listing of business
location, potential food pur
chasers, costs of supplies, equip
ment, salaries, and monthly oper
ations, gave an unclear picture of
the financial features of the pro
posed business.
Cassie gave the application to
Tom. After spending three weeks
studying the take-out food busi
ness, and consulting with officials
at the Stanford Commissary, the
Stanford Student Union and a
wholesale food distributor, he
drew up a 10-page detailed
analysis of the business. "It was
the kind of logical breakdown
that banks insist upon," says
Tom. It included a full listing of
installation costs (paid and to be
paid), equipment costs and oper
ating costs. Business potential was
indicated by three cash flow pro
jections, a "best guess," an opti
mistic and a pessimistic one.
He and Cassie approached
Areata again. Areata told them

they should attempt to obtain a
conventional loan. (It is Arcata's
policy to encourage prospective
borrowers to seek alternative
sources of financing if their pro
posals indicate they can qualify
for such financing.)
"This approach seemed sound
to me," recalls Tom. "But Cassie
interpreted it as another denial.
She was very disillusioned with
the stated intentions of Areata
National. I found it very difficult
to convince her that Areata had a
valid point and that all was not
lost."
. . .Or was it? The Bank of
America also turned them down,
because 1) the take-out business
has a tremendous failure rate,
which makes the risk factor un
tenable from a bank's point of
view, 2) the Domangeauxs would
have only a 15 percent equity
position in the business should the
loan be granted in the requested
amount ($6,000), and 3) a six
year payback period was too long
by the bank's standards.
The Bank of America suggested
Cassie and Tom contact the Small
Business Administration as an
alternative source of funds. Cassie,
with creditor commitments due in
a few days, sought out a finance
company instead. "She was ready
to hock all her possessions. 1 had
to do something," recalls Tom. "I
appealed to the president of
Microwave Electronics. He is head
of a group of businessman who
are forming an investment corpo
ration to back minority business
ventures with capital or guarantee
loans. He recommended I draw up
two more cash flow projections
and see Areata again."
Areata granted the loan. That
was the end of November. Since
then, Cassie's Soul Food Kitchen
has sold spare ribs, pigs feet, neck
bones, chitlins, greens and chicken
at three times Tom's most opti
mistic projections.

small business investment corpo
ration to loan funds or assume an
equity in Peninsula-area Black
businesses.
"From the beginning, it was
obvious that the new ghetto entre
preneurs seeking loans from
Arcate needed more than just
money," says John. "They needed
general management assistance, in
cluding initial business planning
and preparation of loan appli
cations. Since BDA members had
already developed consulting ex
perience in working with San Jose
small businessmen, it seemed
natural to form an alliance with
Areata."
First EPA Clients
Hansen put John and Hoff in
contact with their first East Palo
Alto clients. (In the half-year
since August, BDA advisers, who
represent some 20 percent of the
studerft body, have helped more
than 100 small businesses.)
"Six months of working in the
ghetto has taught us a lot," says
Hoff. "Education on both sides is
critical to the continued success
of BDA. At the beginning, we
found it necessary to state several
racial encounter groups at Stan
ford, to reveal some of the mores,
the hidden motives, the racially
based bias that can lead to mis
understanding at the outset. Stu
dents and clients met face to face
and talked. We need more of this
type of learning.
"Also, the ghetto businessman
needs to learn basic business pro
cedures. One of the greatest prob
lems they face, we've found, is an
uncertainty about how the 'White'

business community operates.
There is a great lack of under
standing of such 'normal' pro
cedures as filing a loan appli
cation. This is where we as busi
ness students can be most help
ful."
The experience of consultant
Tom Bailard with his client Mrs.
Cassie Domangeaux, owner of
Soul Food Kitchen, is a telling
example of the bewilderment,
frustration and desperation that
can result from Black contact
with the White business communi
ty.
Soul Food Restaurant
Tom met Mrs. Domangeaux
"at a critical point in her efforts
to open a soul food take-out
restaurant in East Palo Alto. Her
loan application to Areata
National's Small Business Invest
ment Corp. had been side-tracked.
Loan officers told her 1) that the
business was too risky and 2) that
her application, a one-page, one
column listing of business
location, potential food pur
chasers, costs of supplies, equip
ment, salaries, and monthly oper
ations, gave an unclear picture of
the financial features of the pro
posed business.
Cassie gave the application to
Tom. After spending three weeks
studying the take-out food busi
ness, and consulting with officials
at the Stanford Commissary, the
Stanford Student Union and a
wholesale food distributor, he
drew up a 10-page detailed
analysis of the business. "It was
the kind of logical breakdown
that banks insist upon," says
Tom. It included a full listing of
installation costs (paid and to be
paid), equipment costs and oper
ating costs. Business potential was
indicated by three cash flow pro
jections, a "best guess," an opti
mistic and a pessimistic one.
He and Cassie approached
Areata again. Areata told them

they should attempt to obtain a
conventional loan. (It is Arcata's
policy to encourage prospective
borrowers to seek alternative
sources of financing if their pro
posals indicate they can qualify
for such financing.)
"This approach seemed sound
to me," recalls Tom. "But Cassie
interpreted it as another denial.
She was very disillusioned with
the stated intentions of Areata
National. I found it very difficult
to convince her that Areata had a
valid point and that all was not
lost."
. . .Or was it? The Bank of
America also turned them down,
because 1) the take-out business
has a tremendous failure rate,
which makes the risk factor un
tenable from a bank's point of
view, 2) the Domangeauxs would
have only a 15 percent equity
position in the business should the
loan be granted in the requested
amount ($6,000), and 3) a six
year payback period was too long
by the bank's standards.
The Bank of America suggested
Cassie and Tom contact the Small
Business Administration as an
alternative source of funds. Cassie,
with creditor commitments due in
a few days, sought out a finance
company instead. "She was ready
to hock all her possessions. 1 had
to do something," recalls Tom. "I
appealed to the president of
Microwave Electronics. He is head
of a group of businessman who
are forming an investment corpo
ration to back minority business
ventures with capital or guarantee
loans. He recommended I draw up
two more cash flow projections
and see Areata again."
Areata granted the loan. That
was the end of November. Since
then, Cassie's Soul Food Kitchen
has sold spare ribs, pigs feet, neck
bones, chitlins, greens and chicken
at three times Tom's most opti
mistic projections.

corner.
"Sure, you had a reputation in
the community. I don't knock
it . . .but you know what I mean.
That kind of reputation won't get
you a bank loan. Now you've
started to build a good business
reputation. That's what you need.
Be careful; don't jeopardize it."
The tall chino-clad business con
sultant weighs the impact of his
words; sees they've been taken
under consideration. He grins.
Business Students Group
Roger Coates is a student at
Stanford Graduate School of Busi
ness. He is a member of the
Business Development Association
(BDA), a volunteer association of
Stanford business students seeking
to use their management training
to help struggling, small minority
business get started.
Pat Brock, 20, and Steve
Smothers, 22, co-owners of
Nairobi Cleaners, were among
BDA's first clients. It has been a
successful meeting of technically

schooled crew-cut brainpower and
hustler-styled ghetto
entrepreneurship.
Since last fall, Roger, Steve and
Pat have worried the new business
through a loan application, set up
a special bookkeeping system for
laundries, devised a broad adver
tising campaign including TV,
radio, information flyers and the
Black community grapevine, and
watched the money come in.
In July, Nairobi Cleaners, then
called Village Cleaners, faced im
pending bankruptcy. Its former
owner was forced to plow back all
receipts into outstanding debts
totaling over $4,000.
Proposal Drafted
In August, Pat and Steve
drafted a proposal for an $8,000
loan, and began negotiations to
purchase Village Cleaners.
October, they received the loan
from Areata National's Small
Business Investment Corp. and
signed the business transfer
papers. All creditors were paid
within three weeks, the new
owners started off with no debts
and a single $8,000 five-year note.
By November, they were making
money.
"The success of Nairobi Clean
ers will mean a great deal to the
East Palo Alto community,"
Roger says. "Steve and Pat are
among the most visible members
of the community. Both of them
are committed to developing a
Black power, green power base for
East Palo Alto, and they're in a
leadership position to do it. It's
exciting to be a part of it. I'm
convinced the Black businessman

is going to show us new ways of
running businesses, based on their
community-conscious ways of
doing things. Attempting to trans
late Business School terminology
and technology into the language
and concepts of their environment
has been a tremendous challenge,
and the most stimulating aspect of
the whole project to date."
First conversations exploring
the possibility of a volunteer stu
dent association to help small
ghetto businesses began casually
in the Business School halls last
spring.
BDA Objectives Mapped
First-year master of business
administration candidates Hoff
Stauffer, 23, and John Osterweis,
26, mapped out objectives, types
of clients BDA might assist, areas
of business development in which
Business School students might be
most helpful through their train
ing; and approached the San Jose
office of the Economic Oppor
tunity Commission (EOC) to test
their idea.
They worked with the San Jose
EOC office through he early
summer, assisting small businesses
in the area. During this period,
Hoff and John became acquainted
with the work of former student
colleague, Pete Hansen, MBA '68.
Under his direction, Arcate
National Corp. had just formed a
small business investment corpo
ration to loan funds or assume an

year payback period was too long
by the bank's standards.
The Bank of America suggested
Cassie and Tom contact the Small
Business Administration as an
alternative source of funds. Cassie,
with creditor commitments due in
a few days, sought out a finance
company instead. "She was ready
to hock all her possessions. 1 had
to do something," recalls Tom. "I
appealed to the president of
Microwave Electronics. He is head
of a group of businessman who
are forming an investment corpo
ration to back minority business
ventures with capital or guarantee
loans. He recommended I draw up
two more cash flow projections
and see Areata again."
Areata granted the loan. That
was the end of November. Since
then, Cassie's Soul Food Kitchen
has sold spare ribs, pigs feet, neck
bones, chitlins, greens and chicken
at three times Tom's most opti
mistic projections.

Business Students Group
Roger Coates is a student at
Stanford Graduate School of Busi
ness. He is a member of the
Business Development Association
(BDA), a volunteer association of
Stanford business students seeking
to use their management training
to help struggling, small minority
business get started.
Pat Brock, 20, and Steve
Smothers, 22, co-owners of
Nairobi Cleaners, were among
BDA's first clients. It has been a
successful meeting of technically

schooled crew-cut brainpower and
hustler-styled ghetto
entrepreneurship.
Since last fall, Roger, Steve and
Pat have worried the new business
through a loan application, set up
a special bookkeeping system for
laundries, devised a broad adver
tising campaign including TV,
radio, information flyers and the
Black community grapevine, and
watched the money come in.
In July, Nairobi Cleaners, then
called Village Cleaners, faced im
pending bankruptcy. Its former
owner was forced to plow back all
receipts into outstanding debts
totaling over $4,000.
Proposal Drafted
In August, Pat and Steve
drafted a proposal for an $8,000
loan, and began negotiations to
purchase Village Cleaners.
October, they received the loan
from Areata National's Small
Business Investment Corp. and
signed the business transfer
papers. All creditors were paid
within three weeks, the new
owners started off with no debts
and a single $8,000 five-year note.
By November, they were making
money.
"The success of Nairobi Clean
ers will mean a great deal to the
East Palo Alto community,"
Roger says. "Steve and Pat are
among the most visible members
of the community. Both of them
are committed to developing a
Black power, green power base for
East Palo Alto, and they're in a
leadership position to do it. It's
exciting to be a part of it. I'm
convinced the Black businessman

is going to show us new ways of
running businesses, based on their
community-conscious ways of
doing things. Attempting to trans
late Business School terminology
and technology into the language
and concepts of their environment
has been a tremendous challenge,
and the most stimulating aspect of
the whole project to date."
First conversations exploring
the possibility of a volunteer stu
dent association to help small
ghetto businesses began casually
in the Business School halls last
spring.
BDA Objectives Mapped
First-year master of business
administration candidates Hoff
Stauffer, 23, and John Osterweis,
26, mapped out objectives, types
of clients BDA might assist, areas
of business development in which
Business School students might be
most helpful through their train
ing; and approached the San Jose
office of the Economic Oppor
tunity Commission (EOC) to test
their idea.
They worked with the San Jose
EOC office through he early
summer, assisting small businesses
in the area. During this period,
Hoff and John became acquainted
with the work of former student
colleague, Pete Hansen, MBA '68.
Under his direction, Arcate
National Corp. had just formed a
small business investment corpo
ration to loan funds or assume an
equity in Peninsula-area Black
businesses.
"From the beginning, it was
obvious that the new ghetto entre
preneurs seeking loans from
Arcate needed more than just
money," says John. "They needed
general management assistance, in
cluding initial business planning
and preparation of loan appli
cations. Since BDA members had
already developed consulting ex
perience in working with San Jose
small businessmen, it seemed
natural to form an alliance with
Areata."
First EPA Clients
Hansen put John and Hoff in
contact with their first East Palo
Alto clients. (In the half-year
since August, BDA advisers, who
represent some 20 percent of the
studerft body, have helped more
than 100 small businesses.)
"Six months of working in the
ghetto has taught us a lot," says
Hoff. "Education on both sides is
critical to the continued success
of BDA. At the beginning, we
found it necessary to state several
racial encounter groups at Stan
ford, to reveal some of the mores,
the hidden motives, the racially
based bias that can lead to mis
understanding at the outset. Stu
dents and clients met face to face
and talked. We need more of this
type of learning.
"Also, the ghetto businessman
needs to learn basic business pro
cedures. One of the greatest prob
lems they face, we've found, is an
uncertainty about how the 'White'

business community operates.
There is a great lack of under
standing of such 'normal' pro
cedures as filing a loan appli
cation. This is where we as busi
ness students can be most help
ful."
The experience of consultant
Tom Bailard with his client Mrs.
Cassie Domangeaux, owner of
Soul Food Kitchen, is a telling
example of the bewilderment,
frustration and desperation that
can result from Black contact
with the White business communi
ty.
Soul Food Restaurant
Tom met Mrs. Domangeaux
"at a critical point in her efforts
to open a soul food take-out
restaurant in East Palo Alto. Her
loan application to Areata
National's Small Business Invest
ment Corp. had been side-tracked.
Loan officers told her 1) that the
business was too risky and 2) that
her application, a one-page, one
column listing of business
location, potential food pur
chasers, costs of supplies, equip
ment, salaries, and monthly oper
ations, gave an unclear picture of
the financial features of the pro
posed business.
Cassie gave the application to
Tom. After spending three weeks
studying the take-out food busi
ness, and consulting with officials
at the Stanford Commissary, the
Stanford Student Union and a
wholesale food distributor, he
drew up a 10-page detailed
analysis of the business. "It was
the kind of logical breakdown
that banks insist upon," says
Tom. It included a full listing of
installation costs (paid and to be
paid), equipment costs and oper
ating costs. Business potential was
indicated by three cash flow pro
jections, a "best guess," an opti
mistic and a pessimistic one.
He and Cassie approached
Areata again. Areata told them

they should attempt to obtain a
conventional loan. (It is Arcata's
policy to encourage prospective
borrowers to seek alternative
sources of financing if their pro
posals indicate they can qualify
for such financing.)
"This approach seemed sound
to me," recalls Tom. "But Cassie
interpreted it as another denial.
She was very disillusioned with
the stated intentions of Areata
National. I found it very difficult
to convince her that Areata had a
valid point and that all was not
lost."
. . .Or was it? The Bank of
America also turned them down,
because 1) the take-out business
has a tremendous failure rate,
which makes the risk factor un
tenable from a bank's point of
view, 2) the Domangeauxs would
have only a 15 percent equity
position in the business should the
loan be granted in the requested
amount ($6,000), and 3) a six
year payback period was too long
by the bank's standards.
The Bank of America suggested
Cassie and Tom contact the Small
Business Administration as an
alternative source of funds. Cassie,
with creditor commitments due in
a few days, sought out a finance
company instead. "She was ready

and the most stimulating aspect of
the whole project to date."
First conversations exploring
the possibility of a volunteer stu
dent association to help small
ghetto businesses began casually
in the Business School halls last
spring.
BDA Objectives Mapped
First-year master of business
administration candidates Hoff
Stauffer, 23, and John Osterweis,
26, mapped out objectives, types
of clients BDA might assist, areas
of business development in which
Business School students might be
most helpful through their train
ing; and approached the San Jose
office of the Economic Oppor
tunity Commission (EOC) to test
their idea.
They worked with the San Jose
EOC office through he early
summer, assisting small businesses
in the area. During this period,
Hoff and John became acquainted
with the work of former student
colleague, Pete Hansen, MBA '68.
Under his direction, Arcate
National Corp. had just formed a
small business investment corpo
ration to loan funds or assume an
equity in Peninsula-area Black
businesses.
"From the beginning, it was
obvious that the new ghetto entre
preneurs seeking loans from
Arcate needed more than just
money," says John. "They needed
general management assistance, in
cluding initial business planning
and preparation of loan appli
cations. Since BDA members had
already developed consulting ex
perience in working with San Jose
small businessmen, it seemed
natural to form an alliance with
Areata."
First EPA Clients
Hansen put John and Hoff in
contact with their first East Palo
Alto clients. (In the half-year
since August, BDA advisers, who
represent some 20 percent of the
studerft body, have helped more
than 100 small businesses.)
"Six months of working in the
ghetto has taught us a lot," says
Hoff. "Education on both sides is
critical to the continued success
of BDA. At the beginning, we
found it necessary to state several
racial encounter groups at Stan
ford, to reveal some of the mores,
the hidden motives, the racially
based bias that can lead to mis
understanding at the outset. Stu
dents and clients met face to face
and talked. We need more of this
type of learning.
"Also, the ghetto businessman
needs to learn basic business pro
cedures. One of the greatest prob
lems they face, we've found, is an
uncertainty about how the 'White'

business community operates.
There is a great lack of under
standing of such 'normal' pro
cedures as filing a loan appli
cation. This is where we as busi
ness students can be most help
ful."
The experience of consultant
Tom Bailard with his client Mrs.
Cassie Domangeaux, owner of
Soul Food Kitchen, is a telling
example of the bewilderment,
frustration and desperation that
can result from Black contact
with the White business communi
ty.
Soul Food Restaurant
Tom met Mrs. Domangeaux
"at a critical point in her efforts
to open a soul food take-out
restaurant in East Palo Alto. Her
loan application to Areata
National's Small Business Invest
ment Corp. had been side-tracked.
Loan officers told her 1) that the
business was too risky and 2) that
her application, a one-page, one
column listing of business
location, potential food pur
chasers, costs of supplies, equip
ment, salaries, and monthly oper
ations, gave an unclear picture of
the financial features of the pro
posed business.
Cassie gave the application to
Tom. After spending three weeks
studying the take-out food busi
ness, and consulting with officials
at the Stanford Commissary, the
Stanford Student Union and a
wholesale food distributor, he
drew up a 10-page detailed
analysis of the business. "It was
the kind of logical breakdown
that banks insist upon," says
Tom. It included a full listing of
installation costs (paid and to be
paid), equipment costs and oper
ating costs. Business potential was
indicated by three cash flow pro
jections, a "best guess," an opti
mistic and a pessimistic one.
He and Cassie approached
Areata again. Areata told them

they should attempt to obtain a
conventional loan. (It is Arcata's
policy to encourage prospective
borrowers to seek alternative
sources of financing if their pro
posals indicate they can qualify
for such financing.)
"This approach seemed sound
to me," recalls Tom. "But Cassie
interpreted it as another denial.
She was very disillusioned with
the stated intentions of Areata
National. I found it very difficult
to convince her that Areata had a
valid point and that all was not
lost."
. . .Or was it? The Bank of
America also turned them down,
because 1) the take-out business
has a tremendous failure rate,
which makes the risk factor un
tenable from a bank's point of
view, 2) the Domangeauxs would
have only a 15 percent equity
position in the business should the
loan be granted in the requested
amount ($6,000), and 3) a six
year payback period was too long
by the bank's standards.
The Bank of America suggested
Cassie and Tom contact the Small
Business Administration as an
alternative source of funds. Cassie,
with creditor commitments due in
a few days, sought out a finance
company instead. "She was ready
to hock all her possessions. 1 had
to do something," recalls Tom. "I
appealed to the president of
Microwave Electronics. He is head
of a group of businessman who
are forming an investment corpo
ration to back minority business
ventures with capital or guarantee
loans. He recommended I draw up
two more cash flow projections
and see Areata again."
Areata granted the loan. That
was the end of November. Since
then, Cassie's Soul Food Kitchen
has sold spare ribs, pigs feet, neck
bones, chitlins, greens and chicken
at three times Tom's most opti
mistic projections.
In a far corner, spurts of steam

Nairobi Cleaners in Littleman's
Shopping Center, East Palo Alto,
is jammed with business, after
four months under new manage
ment.
The two proud Black owners
are discussing their good fortune
with their business consultant, in
the only available, laundry-free
corner.
"Sure, you had a reputation in
the community. I don't knock
it . . .but you know what I mean.
That kind of reputation won't get
you a bank loan. Now you've
started to build a good business
reputation. That's what you need.
Be careful; don't jeopardize it."
The tall chino-clad business con
sultant weighs the impact of his
words; sees they've been taken
under consideration. He grins.
Business Students Group
Roger Coates is a student at
Stanford Graduate School of Busi
ness. He is a member of the
Business Development Association
(BDA), a volunteer association of
Stanford business students seeking
to use their management training
to help struggling, small minority
business get started.
Pat Brock, 20, and Steve
Smothers, 22, co-owners of
Nairobi Cleaners, were among
BDA's first clients. It has been a
successful meeting of technically

schooled crew-cut brainpower and
hustler-styled ghetto
entrepreneurship.
Since last fall, Roger, Steve and
Pat have worried the new business
through a loan application, set up
a special bookkeeping system for
laundries, devised a broad adver
tising campaign including TV,
radio, information flyers and the
Black community grapevine, and
watched the money come in.
In July, Nairobi Cleaners, then
called Village Cleaners, faced im
pending bankruptcy. Its former
owner was forced to plow back all
receipts into outstanding debts
totaling over $4,000.
Proposal Drafted
In August, Pat and Steve
drafted a proposal for an $8,000
loan, and began negotiations to
purchase Village Cleaners.
October, they received the loan
from Areata National's Small
Business Investment Corp. and
signed the business transfer
papers. All creditors were paid
within three weeks, the new
owners started off with no debts
and a single $8,000 five-year note.
By November, they were making
money.
"The success of Nairobi Clean
ers will mean a great deal to the
East Palo Alto community,"
Roger says. "Steve and Pat are
among the most visible members
of the community. Both of them
are committed to developing a
Black power, green power base for
East Palo Alto, and they're in a
leadership position to do it. It's
exciting to be a part of it. I'm
convinced the Black businessman

is going to show us new ways of
running businesses, based on their
community-conscious ways of
doing things. Attempting to trans
late Business School terminology
and technology into the language
and concepts of their environment
has been a tremendous challenge,
and the most stimulating aspect of
the whole project to date."

they should attempt to obtain a
conventional loan. (It is Arcata's
policy to encourage prospective
borrowers to seek alternative
sources of financing if their pro
posals indicate they can qualify
for such financing.)
"This approach seemed sound
to me," recalls Tom. "But Cassie
interpreted it as another denial.
She was very disillusioned with
the stated intentions of Areata
National. I found it very difficult
to convince her that Areata had a
valid point and that all was not
lost."
. . .Or was it? The Bank of
America also turned them down,
because 1) the take-out business
has a tremendous failure rate,
which makes the risk factor un
tenable from a bank's point of
view, 2) the Domangeauxs would
have only a 15 percent equity
position in the business should the
loan be granted in the requested
amount ($6,000), and 3) a six
year payback period was too long
by the bank's standards.
The Bank of America suggested
Cassie and Tom contact the Small
Business Administration as an
alternative source of funds. Cassie,
with creditor commitments due in
a few days, sought out a finance
company instead. "She was ready
to hock all her possessions. 1 had
to do something," recalls Tom. "I
appealed to the president of
Microwave Electronics. He is head
of a group of businessman who
are forming an investment corpo
ration to back minority business
ventures with capital or guarantee
loans. He recommended I draw up
two more cash flow projections
and see Areata again."
Areata granted the loan. That
was the end of November. Since
then, Cassie's Soul Food Kitchen
has sold spare ribs, pigs feet, neck
bones, chitlins, greens and chicken
at three times Tom's most opti
mistic projections.
