Producer Steven Ungar empha
sized that "previous experience
and great talent have bever been
requirements for working on a
Ram's Head show. We are particu
larly interested in finding new
people this year, people who
haven't had the opportunity, or
perhaps the occasion, to be in a
show at Stanford, but who enjoy
working in the theater.
"In our shows everyone sings—
the actors on stage and on key,
the crews backstage and off key."
The show will be presented
May 21-14 in the Little Theater.
"Lock Up Your Daughters" is
based on Henry Fielding's comedy
"Rape Upon Rape," with music

by Laurie Johnson and lyrics by
Lionel Bart. The adaptation is by
Bernard Miles, C.8.E., who also
directed the original production in
London, which was a sell-out for
two years.
The show was a smash hit at
the Pasadena Play house, the Ore
gon Shakespearean Festival in
Ashland, Oregon, and was even
banned in Boston in 1960.
The director for the Ram's
Head production is Robin Lake, a
Ph.D. student in the Speech and
Drama Department. Mr. Lake's
extensive experience in the pro
fessional theater includes the
position of stage manager for the
successful Vancouver production
of "Lock Up."
When asked to describe the
show, Mr. Lake would only quote
Harold Hobson of the London
Sunday Times: "There cannot be
in the English Language a more
raffish, rich, ribald, or rollicking
rarity than this refreshing
musical."
