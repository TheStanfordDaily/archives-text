# Text Of Pitzer Statement
## 
### 
The following statement has
been issued by President Kenneth
S. Pitzer to members of the Stan
ford Community:
In view of the recent decision
of the Stanford Judicial Council,
together with other recent events,
it is important that I make ex
plicit the various means of com
munication with the Board of
Trustees, as well with adminis
trative officers.
Efforts to facilitate communi
cation in recent months have been
substantial. Student and faculty
representatives had been invited
to many Trustee committee meet
ings. Trustees have accepted invi
tations to join student groups,

usually for dinner and discussion
thereafter.
I have met with students fre
quently in my office as well as in
living groups and elsewhere and
have received and acted upon
many letters and occasional peti
tions. But we can always try to do
better, and I can certainly state
explicitly the channels for com
munication.
1. Communication to either
the Board of Trustees or the Presi
dent may be sent in writing to the
Office of the President. My office
is responsible for preparation of
the agenda of the Trusteee meet
ings and for distribution of the
agenda and other formal com
munications to the Trustees. If
the requested action does not re
quire consideration by the
Trustees, I will point this out and
indicate the committee or officer
having jurisdiction.
2. One of the principal func
tions of the newly established
University Advisory Committee is
communication among students,
faculty, and trustees. This com
mittee, through its own meetings,
is a means of communication, and
matters of interest or concern
may be called to the attention of
any member of the committee.
Furthermore, this committee is
considering as part of its business
additional means of communi
cation with trustees and the need
to correct misinformation about
the role of the trustees.
Members of the University Ad
visory Committee are: Students—
Mr. Denis Hayes, Mr. Patrick

Shea, Mr. Roylette Smith, Mr.
Albert Spector, Mr. Micheal
Sweeney. Faculty—Prof. William
F. Baxter, Prof. Sanford M. Dorn
busch, Prof. David A. Hamburg,
Prof. S. Dale Harris, Prof. Leonard
I. Schiff. Trustees—Mr. Robert M.
Brown, Mrs. Allan E. Charles, Mr.
Ben C. Duniway, Mr. Charles E.
Ducommun, Mr. W. P. Fuller 111.
These students and faculty
have been invited to the March
meeting of the Board of Trustees.
Members of the Committee serve
as individuals representative of a
variety of viewpoints but not as
delegates of other organizations.
The trustees are fully committed
to this committee as a major
means of communication, and it is
important that students and facul
ty make full use of it.
3. I am sure that trustees will
continue to accept invitations to
meet informally for discussion
with student groups. Also special
forums or other meetings may be
arranged from time to time to dis
cuss particular subjects of interest.
4. I will continue to welcome
discussion with students, either in
dividually or in small groups, at
my office. The pressure of various
duties usually requires that this be
by an appointment which my
secretary will be glad to make, but
in many cases it has been possible
to visit at least briefly without ad
vance arrangement. I will continue
to participate in discussions at stu
dent living groups and in forums
and other appropriate meetings.

thereafter.
I have met with students fre
quently in my office as well as in
living groups and elsewhere and
have received and acted upon
many letters and occasional peti
tions. But we can always try to do
better, and I can certainly state
explicitly the channels for com
munication.
1. Communication to either
the Board of Trustees or the Presi
dent may be sent in writing to the
Office of the President. My office
is responsible for preparation of
the agenda of the Trusteee meet
ings and for distribution of the
agenda and other formal com
munications to the Trustees. If
the requested action does not re
quire consideration by the
Trustees, I will point this out and
indicate the committee or officer
having jurisdiction.
2. One of the principal func
tions of the newly established
University Advisory Committee is
communication among students,
faculty, and trustees. This com
mittee, through its own meetings,
is a means of communication, and
matters of interest or concern
may be called to the attention of
any member of the committee.
Furthermore, this committee is
considering as part of its business
additional means of communi
cation with trustees and the need
to correct misinformation about
the role of the trustees.
Members of the University Ad
visory Committee are: Students—
Mr. Denis Hayes, Mr. Patrick

Shea, Mr. Roylette Smith, Mr.
Albert Spector, Mr. Micheal
Sweeney. Faculty—Prof. William
F. Baxter, Prof. Sanford M. Dorn
busch, Prof. David A. Hamburg,
Prof. S. Dale Harris, Prof. Leonard
I. Schiff. Trustees—Mr. Robert M.
Brown, Mrs. Allan E. Charles, Mr.
Ben C. Duniway, Mr. Charles E.
Ducommun, Mr. W. P. Fuller 111.
These students and faculty
have been invited to the March
meeting of the Board of Trustees.
Members of the Committee serve
as individuals representative of a
variety of viewpoints but not as
delegates of other organizations.
The trustees are fully committed
to this committee as a major
means of communication, and it is
important that students and facul
ty make full use of it.
3. I am sure that trustees will
continue to accept invitations to
meet informally for discussion
with student groups. Also special
forums or other meetings may be
arranged from time to time to dis
cuss particular subjects of interest.
4. I will continue to welcome
discussion with students, either in
dividually or in small groups, at
my office. The pressure of various
duties usually requires that this be
by an appointment which my
secretary will be glad to make, but
in many cases it has been possible
to visit at least briefly without ad
vance arrangement. I will continue
to participate in discussions at stu
dent living groups and in forums
and other appropriate meetings.

The following statement has
been issued by President Kenneth
S. Pitzer to members of the Stan
ford Community:
In view of the recent decision
of the Stanford Judicial Council,
together with other recent events,
it is important that I make ex
plicit the various means of com
munication with the Board of
Trustees, as well with adminis
trative officers.
Efforts to facilitate communi
cation in recent months have been
substantial. Student and faculty
representatives had been invited
to many Trustee committee meet
ings. Trustees have accepted invi
tations to join student groups,

usually for dinner and discussion
thereafter.
