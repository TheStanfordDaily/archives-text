# Marks Fall In Track Defeats
## 
### 
The spring break did not prove
particularly fruitful for Stanford's
varsity track team as they came
out on the short end of two very
rough meets.
The Indians nailed down third
place in the Annual Santa Barbara
Relays, and then were massacred
by the mighty San Jose state
Spartans, one of the top teams in
the nation, 91-54.
Coach Payton Jordan's men
did turn in some fine perfor
mances however in both outings.
The meets should serve as fine
tune-ups along with Stanford's
double-dual victories over Occi
dental and Fresno State back on
March 8. The league season gets
started Saturday against Washing
ton State.
The Cards totaled 31 points in
the Relays to 82 for winner USC,
and 38 for second place Cali
fornia. Arizona followed with 24,
and UCLA had 19. The Tribe
turned in four life-time bests al
though the personal records did
not seem particularly impressive
in the meet.
Freshman Bob Coe clocked a
4:09.5 in the mile for a new
Stanford frosh mark, but the time
was only good enough for third
place. Chuck Menz set a lifetime
standard with a 14:05.4 for the
three mile, but finished fourth.
Shot putter George Buehler
threw 52-2'/4 but did not place in
the stiff competition, and the
14:27.6 for Arvid Kretz in the
three mile also did not win him a
place.
Fantastic sophomore hurdler
Rick Tipton finished second in
the highs with a time of 14.4.
Captain Peter Boyce captured
fourth in the high jump for the

Indians with a 6-8 leap. Boyce is
yet to regain his sharp form of last
year due to a mysterious knee
injury.
High flying San Jose State
turned on Speed City in the per
son of Olympians Lee Evans, John
Carlos, Ronnie Ray Smith, and
Neville Myton last Saturday to
slow down Payton Jordan's track
men 91-54 on S.J.S.'s grass-green
tartan track. But far from being
discouraged Jordan feels the
Indians showed enough talent in
defeat, as well as in early season
victories over Occidental and
Fresno State, to challenge last
year's second place NCAA
finishers Washington State next
Saturday at the stadium.
Menz notched Stanford's most
satisfying victory while breaking
the nine minute barrier in the two
mile with an 8:57.4. Spartan
Ralph Gamez battled Menz during
the entire last four laps which
went in 4:22, but a determined
Menz refused to go to pot and
accelerated in the final 150 yards
for his first varsity win. In the
same race freshman Arvid Kretz
missed the frosh record by less
than two seconds with a lifetime
best of 9:08.0 in leading the frosh
to a 79-70 victory over their
Spartan rivals.
Tipton Wins Highs
Speedy sophomore Tipton also
turned in a lifetime best by floa
ting to a windy 13.9 victory in the
high hurdles. Jordan believes that
if Tipton works on the final three
barriers he can cut another .3
seconds by the conference meet in
May. Tipton's running mate Bill
Griffith grabbed a third place in
the race and appears capable of a
low 14 second performance.

Allen Sanford, coming off a
series of winter illnesses, broke
another tape for Stanford. After
following as the milers strolled
through a 2:10.2 first half, "Big
Al" demolished the field with a
1:59.8 final 880. Sanford appears
in fine shape, but his 4:10.0 was
still slower than the 4:08.7 re
corded by Duncan Mac Donald the
week before in anchoring the
Tribe's distance medley team to a
second place finish in the Santa
Barbara Relays. Both are on the
threshold of breaking the NCAA
qualifying time of 4:08.0.
The Indian's fourth winner,
javelin thrower Tom Colby, has
already qualified for the nations
as he aims to improve on last
year's third place finish. Saturday
Colby out-tossed the field by 14
feet with a 238 feet-10 inch ef
fort. In getting off a life time best
hurl of 212 feet-5 inches Lance
Martin demonstrated the Tribe's
depth in this event, which also
lists Jerry Portor with a best of
209 feet-8 inches.
Davis and Massey Impress
Weightman Steve Davis and
jumper Tom Massey came through
with outstanding doubles. Utili
zing speed in the ring, Davis
pushed the shot 52-1 and spun the
discus 176-1 for two second place
finishes. Massey leaped to two
seasonal bests with a 6-8 high
jump and a 48-1 triple jump. His
high jumping takes on added im
portance because of a recurring
knee injury to Captain Peter
Boyce.
Though failing to capture first
in the intermediate hurdles, Stan
ford swept second through fourth
with Tom Kommers, Randy
White, and Greg Ford.


MORAL VICTORY-Fred Haywood who starred in the NCAA finals for
Stanford is shown in victory after the USC meet. The finals were not as
successful for the Tribe although they did capture third place.
