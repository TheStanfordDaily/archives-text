# Mr. Doan:
## WHAT'S RIGHT ABOUT BUSINESS? 
### 
Dear Mr. Doan:
Just once and for all —will business admit
that it does make mistakes? Over and over
again we see the major corporations
stamping out criticism as they cover up
flaws. Somehow the "ethics" always
seem to get lost in the rhetoric.
Several notable cases come to mind, the
most recent being the much-publicized
affair of the General Motors Goliath
versus Ralph IMader. Here Big Business
exposed itself as being oversensitive to
constructive criticism —as well as callous in
its ignominious attack on its critic.
Surely, while we don't expect Big Business
to change its ways overnight, we can
expect a rational consideration —
and not merely a cover-up job.
Yet the Nader episode is not unique.
One recalls a similar overreaction —and
this time by the chemical industry—to
Rachel Carson's expose on indiscriminate
uses of insecticides. The Big Business
response to Jessica Mitford's eye-opening
portrayal of the realities of the funeral
business was equally bitter—not so much
against her arguments in "The,American
Way of Death" but against the author
herself. In none of these instances did
business admit its imperfections on its
own accord. Only public pressure—and the
fear of continued negative publicity—was
able to draw out the truth about auto
hazards, bug sprays and casket costs.
It's instances like these that prove business
is responsible for the myth that it sees
only the facts it wants to see. It's
instances like these that reinforce the
image of business justifying any means
that maximize the ends —the ends being
monetary profit. It's as if Mammon
himself had updated the business
code of ethics.
Twentieth Century Big Business appears
to be nothing more than a reincarnation of
the Nineteenth Century stereotype, the
Robber Barons. Jay Gould's stock-market
rigging has its 1961 counterpart in G.E.
and Westinghouse price-fixing. We have
our Billie Sol Estes and our Bobby Bakers.
Today's business covertly sanctions such
noble practices as bribes, kickbacks,
company callgirls and tacit collusion.
The "ethics" of Big Business have
created a business unto itself—industrial
espionage. Here anything goes —from
duplicated office keys to parabolic
microphones. And even packaging frauds
are becoming more and more blatant
in today's age of the 10-ounce
giant economy size.
Thus, when college youth are asked,
"What's wrong with Big Business?", we
answer most simply, "What's right with
Big Business?" Very little, it seems.

Dear Mr. Chess:
Big Business does not hold itself out as a
sacred cow whose actions or ethics are
not subject to scrutiny or valid criticism.
But in making value judgments of the
"rightness" or "wrongness" of business,
I question whether isolated instances are
definitive criteria.
Critical judgments should be made in
perspective with the phenomenal growth
of our national economy since the end of
World War II; a period during which our
gross national product more than tripled
from $208.5-billion to approximately
$740-billion last year.
This growth has resulted from a continuous
effort on the part of the business com
munity to respond both to society's
demands, and its needs. On the one hand,
the constant demand for product
improvement leads to better design and
greater performance through advances in
technology. Similarly, society's needs
prompt extensive research for the
development of completely new products
— which create the additional profit
making opportunities essential for the
nation's economic growth —while
satisfying a social purpose.
The measles vaccine developed at Dow is
an example. The benefits to society from
planned inoculation programs multiply
in astounding geometric proportions. Not
only can the total incidence of measles
be cut substantially, but also a far lesser
number will suffer the crippling mental
defects which before destined many to a
life of perpetual care in institutions.
Human lives are being saved, their useful
purposefulness unimpaired, while millions
of dollars are freed for reallocation
to other uses.
The focus on profit-making products to
serve definable social needs reflects the
times just as the community's mores
always affect standards of ethics. In this
less-than-perfect society in which we live,
the ranks of business, and government,
and education, and virtually every other
segment of the community, unfortunately
harbor those who cheat and scheme to
gain their personal ends. It's probably
rather remarkable that our times have not
produced more Billie Sol Estes and Bobby
Bakers. But usually they are found out in
short order. Neither I, nor any other
responsible businessman, condone their
actions. Certainly their conduct cannot be
regarded as typifying business any more
than the activities of the S.D.S. on various
campuses speak for the majority segment
of the student body.

Equally, an inquiry into press
sensationalized episodes of bribery,
collusion, kickbacks and callgirls probably
will reveal involvement of the same kinds
of cheaters and schemers looking for a
fast dollar. No company that I know
condones this conduct. It simply does not
represent the ethics of business, any more
than does industrial espionage. Frankly, I
think its significance has been
quite exaggerated.
What it all adds up to is that most
business enterprises, under the strict
discipline of our competitive profit-making
system, constantly are providing
improved products and better service. In
doing so they mirror the community- of
which they are an integral part—both in
the advances made, and in their standards
of performance. In the course of this,
mistakes, as distinguished from unethical
practices, occur. I suppose that those
who make them are no less reluctant to
admit their mistakes, or to sustain public
criticism, than people in other
walks of life.
I am not acquainted with all the facts
surrounding General Motors' issue with
Ralph Nader, but it is a matter of record
that James Roche, then President of GM,
made a public apology on this matter
before the Senate's Investigating Com
mittee.
As regards Rachel Carson and
insecticides, I will say that my own
company had done research on the
toxicology of insecticides long before the
Food & Drug Administration voiced any
concern in this subject. Research was not
forced by Miss Carson's work. The
chemical control of agricultural pests
certainly has a direct bearing on the very
critical question of world food supply.
Such control measures, coupled with
applied research by agronomists improving
crop yields, constantly are increasing
food supplies to meet expanding
population needs.
I feel, therefore, that while your question
as to "What's Right About Big
Business" focuses on its conduct, rather
than its accomplishments, real objectivity
requires that both be weighed in balance.
On this broad scale, then, business is
pace setting the times in accordance with
the community's needs and the ground
rules of its environment.
