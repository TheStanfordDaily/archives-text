# Indiana Romps In Finals; Stanford Third
## 
### FRED MANN 
Stanford swimmers won a personal revenge battle, but were buried
in the war back at the NCAA Finals in Indiana.
Indiana's defending national champions compiled 427 points on
their way to a repeat win. USC finished second with 306, and the
Indians were a distant third with 196.
Yale could do no better than fifth behind Michigan. The Elis had
beaten Stanford in a dual meet earlier in the year.
Records were shattered all over the place and great performances
were turned in by all. Stanford was no exception. John Ferris broke
all sorts of standards with his 1:49.61 win in the 200 butterfly. He
also contributed heavily to Stanford's second in the Medley Relay.
But the real star for the Tribe had to be Fred Haywood. He turned
in the biggest upset of the meet by nipping Indiana's great Charlie
Hickcox in the 100 yard backstroke by .02 of a second. Hickcox had
never before been defeated in championship competition.
Haywood touched in 52.44 in a race so close that the judges had
called it a draw until the electronic judging machine gave the win to
the Stanford swimmer.
In the Medley Relay, Haywood had dueled Hickcox and had
beaten him although Indiana went on to win the race.
Brent Berk turned in outstanding times in the 1650 (16:24.61) and
500 freestyle (4:40n72), but finished sixth and fifth in the two
contests.
Both Indiana and Stanford broke the American record in the
Medley Relay with the Hoosiers winning in 3:25.6. The Tribe clocked
3:26.8.
Hickcox cracked NCAA and American records with his win in the
200 backstroke (1:53.67). Haywood was fourth.
Freshmen played a significant role in the championship meet.
Indiana's Mark Spitz was the only triple winner, taking the 200
freestyle, 500 freestyle, and 100 butterfly.
Hans Fassnacht, a freshman from Long Beach State won the 1650
in a record 15:54.21, and took second in the 500 free. Stanford's
Mark Shilling sped to a 2:08.78 clocking in the 200 breaststroke, good
for second place.
The best the Cards could do in the sprints was a seventh in the 50
freestyle by Rick Eagleston.
Overall the deep Indiana squad was a shoo-in. Coach Jim Gaughran
was pleased with Stanford's performance. The times were great, but
unfortunately for the Indians, so was the competition.
