## Eisenhower Rites 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP)-Dwight D.
Eisenhower was borne in a soldier's
coffin to a simple but historic bier at
the Capitol Sunday as the nation
rendered farewell salute to the man who
served it as general in war and President
in peace.
There, President Nixon and the
leaders of Congress were to pay their
tribute to the man the world called Ike.
A 21-gun salute thundered across the
still, misty Capitol grounds.
Hushed, solemn crowds lined the
sidewalks along the route of the cortege
and the grounds near the Capitol.
Another crowd, this one of members of
Congress and leaders of government,
was inside the circular, soaring room at
the center of the Capitol.
More than 1,000 people gathered
there —among them more than twice the
150 Congressmen who had been antici
pated.
An aerial honor guard of 21 Air
Force jets roared over Constitution
Avenue as the cortege moved toward
the Capitol. The formation lacked a
single plane—the gap, again, symbolizing
a lost leader.
• Oakland 7 Innocent
OAKLAND—An eight-man, four
woman jury found the "Oakland
Seven," a group of bay area antiwar
leaders who had become a cause celebre
among the radical left, innocent of
conspiracy charges.
The seven were charged with foment
ing the massive demonstrations and en
suing riots that took place at the Oak
land armed forces induction center
during the Stop the Draft week protests
of October 1967.
Following three days of deliber
ations, the jury returned its decision at
10:24 p.m.
The more than 40 supporters of the
seven who packed the Oakland court
room broke into cheers and rushed to
congratulate the smiling dissidents,
causing Superior Court Judge George W.

Phillips Jr. to demand order.
Specifically, the defendants were
charged with the felony of conspiring to
have others commit acts of trespassing
and obstructing police, both mis
demeanors. If convicted, each would
have received a maximum sentence of
three years in jail and a fine of $5,000.
The jury began deliberating after a
trial that lasted nearly eight weeks and
ended with closing arguments by both
sides that lasted 16 hours.
• Detroit Disturbance
DETROIT (AP)—One white police
man was killed, another wounded and
five Negroes were injured during a week
end exchange of gunfire at a church
near the scene of the 1967 riots. A
meeting of the black militant New
Republic of Africa had just adjourned.
Four Negroes inside the church were
shot and wounded and another suffered
a possible broken leg when officers
stormed the building Saturday night.

man Michael Ozapski, 22, was shot
seven times in the head and chest when
he and us partner tried to question
about a dozen Negroes carrying rifles
and carbines outside the church.

28, was wounded in the back and right
leg, but rr..,naged to crawl to their scout

car and radio for help.

into the church as police reinforcements
roared up.
