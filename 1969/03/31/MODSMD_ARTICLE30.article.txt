# Golfers Capture Classic With Powerful Team
## 
### 
Stanford's amazing golf team is
well on its way to a great season.
The varsity squad unseated
Arizona State as champions of the
Fresno Golf Classic Saturday with
both great personal and team ef
forts.
In the process, the Tribe set a
new tournament record of 1337,
and beat ASU by 28 strokes.
Tom Watson again proved that
he is one of the top golfers around
by carding a 214 total, first place
in the Classic. Stanford also
placed men in second and third.
Greg Pitzer recorded a 216, and
four of the strokes were penalties
in the last round. He also had 11
birdies in his effort.. Sandy Adel
man (222) was third in the Indian
run-away.
Watson's 214 was only one

shot off the tournament record of
213.
The Fresno Classic is scored
differently from most other col
legiate tournaments. All six team
scores are counted towards the
title instead of the usual top four,
from each school. If only Stan
ford's top four are counted, the
projected score would be close to
an NCAA record.
Coach Bud Finger feels his
squad could possibly go all the
way this year. USC's always great
team is even greater this season,
and could prove to be a formid
able roadblock, but Stanford
downed the Trojans last year and
hope to repeat the trick on April
25.
The next match for the varsity
is April 11 at California.


HEAD TO HEAD BATTLE-Stanford's rugby team bumped heads with the best
over the vacation, and once again came out on top. The squad went to Monterey
last week to defend its National Championship. The two day battle saw the
Tribe of Coach Pete Kmetovic repeat as tournament champ, and up their
national ranking. UCLA, who took over the number one spot in the country
after beating Stanford was not in the tournament this year and will probably
become national champs.
