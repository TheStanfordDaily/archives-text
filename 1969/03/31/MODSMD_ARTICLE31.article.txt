# Lacrosse Victory
## Win Streak Grows 
### 
Displaying precision and power
uncommon for an opening game,
the Stanford Lacrosse team
smashed the University of Utah
on March 22 by a 15-1 count.
Led by attachman Chip Love
land's three goals and an assist and
Larry Beard's amazing four assists
and a goal, the Indians managed
to get eleven players in the scoring
column. Attackmen George Muser
and Art Smiley got two strikes
apiece while seven others got one
goal, including defenseman Doug
Patt.
This marked the seventeenth
straight victory for the Indians,
and their twenty-sixth in the last
twenty-seven games. Defending
Northern California and Western
Region champions, the Tribe's last
loss came at the hands of the Air
Force Academy in Colorado two
seasons ago. That loss was avenged
last year at Stanford by an 8-5
score.
The Indians jumped off to an
early lead with only fifteen sec
onds gone, as Loveland took the
opening face-off and proceeded to
score unassisted. Bill Callison, Ted

Suen, and Brent Lake methodi
cally followed suit, to send the
Indians into the quarter break
with a four goal advantage.
It was in the second quarter
that the Tribe really exploded,
ramming seven goals past Utah's
highly-touted goalie Winston. Mid
fielder Ben Smith opened up with
a long steamer from the restrain
ing line with only twenty-three
seconds gone. Then Patt, Chris
Rafferty, Loveland, Muser, Beard,
Loveland again followed for an
11-0 halftime lead.
The Stanford team used the
second half for experiments, scor
ing twice in each period. Meaty
220 pound attackman Smiley
came alive and scored his two
goals from the crease and severely
shook up the Utah goalie on a
clear. Muser added another tally
and Don Stebbins rounded out
the scoring with a beautiful left
handed shot into the corner of
the cage.
Utah attackman Leiben ruined
Stanford goalie Jay Morse's shut
out with only one minute left to
play, when he sneaked past his
defenseman and found no Stan
ford midfielder in his way and
scored.
Stanford coach George Weaks
ner was pleased with the victory,
noting that although the Indians
had lost some vital defensemen
from last year's squad, this years
edition of Stanford Lacrosse
seems to have proved that it can
score with consistency. "We won't
have to rely on oyr defense like
we did last year," Weaksner, a
former defenseman himself, said,
then he added: "I hope."

twenty-seven games. Defending
Northern California and Western
Region champions, the Tribe's last
loss came at the hands of the Air
Force Academy in Colorado two
seasons ago. That loss was avenged
last year at Stanford by an 8-5
score.
The Indians jumped off to an
early lead with only fifteen sec
onds gone, as Loveland took the
opening face-off and proceeded to
score unassisted. Bill Callison, Ted

Suen, and Brent Lake methodi
cally followed suit, to send the
Indians into the quarter break
with a four goal advantage.
It was in the second quarter
that the Tribe really exploded,
ramming seven goals past Utah's
highly-touted goalie Winston. Mid
fielder Ben Smith opened up with
a long steamer from the restrain
ing line with only twenty-three
seconds gone. Then Patt, Chris
Rafferty, Loveland, Muser, Beard,
Loveland again followed for an
11-0 halftime lead.
The Stanford team used the
second half for experiments, scor
ing twice in each period. Meaty
220 pound attackman Smiley
came alive and scored his two
goals from the crease and severely
shook up the Utah goalie on a
clear. Muser added another tally
and Don Stebbins rounded out
the scoring with a beautiful left
handed shot into the corner of
the cage.
Utah attackman Leiben ruined
Stanford goalie Jay Morse's shut
out with only one minute left to
play, when he sneaked past his
defenseman and found no Stan
ford midfielder in his way and
scored.
Stanford coach George Weaks
ner was pleased with the victory,
noting that although the Indians
had lost some vital defensemen
from last year's squad, this years
edition of Stanford Lacrosse
seems to have proved that it can
score with consistency. "We won't
have to rely on oyr defense like
we did last year," Weaksner, a
former defenseman himself, said,
then he added: "I hope."
Displaying precision and power
uncommon for an opening game,
the Stanford Lacrosse team
smashed the University of Utah
on March 22 by a 15-1 count.
Led by attachman Chip Love
land's three goals and an assist and
Larry Beard's amazing four assists
and a goal, the Indians managed
to get eleven players in the scoring
column. Attackmen George Muser
and Art Smiley got two strikes
apiece while seven others got one
goal, including defenseman Doug
Patt.
This marked the seventeenth
straight victory for the Indians,
and their twenty-sixth in the last
twenty-seven games. Defending
Northern California and Western
Region champions, the Tribe's last
loss came at the hands of the Air
