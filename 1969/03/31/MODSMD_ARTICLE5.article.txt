# Hayes Urges Investment Based On Social Concern
## 
### DENNIS PERLUSS 
Considerations of social
responsibility would play a part in
Stanford investment plans according to
a proposal by ASSU President Denis
Hayes.
A social responsibility index would
be used, according to Hayes' plan, by
the Board of Trustees' committee on
investments as an additional tool in
evaluating companies as investment
possibilities.
Hayes also called for the
appointment of an expert
student-faculty committee to construct
the index.
The proposal was in the form of a
letter to President Kenneth Pitzer
requesting that the matter be placed on
the agenda of the University Advisory
Committee. This committee consists of
five students, five faculty members, and
five trustees, chosen by their respective
groups. Pitzer serves as the committee's
chairman.
Full Agenda
Pitzer, who declined to comment on
the proposal itself, said that it was
doubtful whether it would even be
considered by the committee at its next
scheduled meeting. The agenda
presently includes discussion of the
report on the Stanford Research
Institute (SRI), the trustee statement on

ROTC, and student participation on
Board of Trustees committees.
Hayes' recommendation echoed
sentiments expressed during the
two-hour student-trustee forum held
during dead week last quarter.
At that meeting several of the
student panelists and participants from
the audience questioned the trustees
about the role in Southeast Asia of
corporation in which Stanford invested
funds, as well as the activities of the
trustees own corporations and SRI
projects.
"A Different World"
In the opening statement Paul
Rupert of the United Campus Ministry
told the trustees: . a growing
number of us look upon a different
world, a world in which your
interests—those of the corporations and
the university—are in fact not the
interests of a majority of the world's
people."
Rupert urged the trustees to "lay
down your weapons and your
defensiveness." He predicted, however,
"a steady erosion of the hope of
non-violent change" if the trustees
failed to respond to this call.
The meeting was arranged by the
University Advisory Committee in
response to growing demands on
campus for an increase in
student-trustee communication. The

Students for a Democratic Society
(SDS) invitation to the trustees to
participate in an open forum was turned
down; the trustees preferred the
Advisory Committee's arrangements.
No Commitment
The five trustees who participated in
the open forum, Mrs. Allan Charles,
Charles Ducommun, Ben Duniway, W.
Parmer Fuller 111, and William Hewlett,
however, refused to commit themselves
to lobbying for open board meetings in
the future.
When Rupert asked the five if they
would work specifically for an open
meeting when the board considers the
forthcoming report on SRI, none would
give an affirmative reply. Several of the
trustees, though, indicated that the
matter might be considered by the
Advisory Committee.
Future Communications Considered
Yesterday afternoon, in response to a
question about the possibility of future
forums or open meetings, President
Pitzer declared, "The University
Advisory Committee will be considering
means of communication between
faculty, students, and trustees, and
particularly the best means by which
the SRI report can be considered and
views of faculty and students about its
recommendations can be conveyed to
the trustees."

particularly the best means by which
the SRI report can be considered and
views of faculty and students about its
recommendations can be conveyed to
the trustees."
Considerations of social
responsibility would play a part in
Stanford investment plans according to
a proposal by ASSU President Denis
Hayes.
A social responsibility index would
be used, according to Hayes' plan, by
the Board of Trustees' committee on
investments as an additional tool in
evaluating companies as investment
possibilities.
Hayes also called for the
appointment of an expert
student-faculty committee to construct
the index.
The proposal was in the form of a
letter to President Kenneth Pitzer
requesting that the matter be placed on
the agenda of the University Advisory
Committee. This committee consists of
five students, five faculty members, and
five trustees, chosen by their respective
groups. Pitzer serves as the committee's
chairman.
Full Agenda
Pitzer, who declined to comment on
the proposal itself, said that it was
doubtful whether it would even be
considered by the committee at its next
scheduled meeting. The agenda
presently includes discussion of the
report on the Stanford Research
Institute (SRI), the trustee statement on

ROTC, and student participation on
Board of Trustees committees.
Hayes' recommendation echoed
sentiments expressed during the
two-hour student-trustee forum held
during dead week last quarter.
At that meeting several of the
student panelists and participants from
the audience questioned the trustees
about the role in Southeast Asia of
corporation in which Stanford invested
funds, as well as the activities of the
trustees own corporations and SRI
projects.
"A Different World"
In the opening statement Paul
Rupert of the United Campus Ministry
told the trustees: . a growing
number of us look upon a different
world, a world in which your
interests—those of the corporations and
the university—are in fact not the
interests of a majority of the world's
people."
Rupert urged the trustees to "lay
down your weapons and your
defensiveness." He predicted, however,
"a steady erosion of the hope of
non-violent change" if the trustees
failed to respond to this call.
The meeting was arranged by the
University Advisory Committee in
response to growing demands on
campus for an increase in
student-trustee communication. The

Students for a Democratic Society
(SDS) invitation to the trustees to
participate in an open forum was turned
down; the trustees preferred the
Advisory Committee's arrangements.
No Commitment
The five trustees who participated in
the open forum, Mrs. Allan Charles,
Charles Ducommun, Ben Duniway, W.
Parmer Fuller 111, and William Hewlett,
however, refused to commit themselves
to lobbying for open board meetings in
the future.
When Rupert asked the five if they
would work specifically for an open
meeting when the board considers the
forthcoming report on SRI, none would
give an affirmative reply. Several of the
trustees, though, indicated that the
matter might be considered by the
Advisory Committee.
Future Communications Considered
Yesterday afternoon, in response to a
question about the possibility of future
forums or open meetings, President
Pitzer declared, "The University
Advisory Committee will be considering
means of communication between
faculty, students, and trustees, and
particularly the best means by which
the SRI report can be considered and
views of faculty and students about its
recommendations can be conveyed to
the trustees."
