# Minority Group Assistants, Black Studies Head Named
## 
### 
Three major minority affairs appoint
ments have been made since THE
DAILY stopped publication last
quarter, two Presidential assistants and
the director of the Black Studies pro
gram.
The Black Studies director will be St.
Clair Drake, one of the nation's fore
most black scholars in sociology and
anthropology. A faculty member at
Roosevelt University for 20 years and
professor in its Department of Soci
ology and Anthropology, Drake will
join the Stanford faculty this fall.
James Simmons, previously assistant
provost for inter-group relations, has
been named a special assistant to Presi
dent Pitzer for minority groups.
Simmons, a black, will concern himself
with activities in both academic and
non-academic areas.
Law Grad
Luis Nogales, a 1969 Stanford Law
School graduate, has been named an
assistant to President Pitzer in co
ordinating and strengthening University
admissions, employment, counseling
and academic programs affecting Mexi
can-American and other minority
groups.
Drake graduated in 1931 from
Hampton Istitute with a B.S. in biology.
He then was a member of a peace
caravan team, sponsored by the Amer
ican Friends Service Committee in the
Deep South.
He continued his education and
teaching at Dillard University, Colum
bia, and Chicago, where he received his
Ph.D. in anthropology in 1954. During
1940-41, he was a research associate on
the Carnegie-Myrdal study of the Negro
in America. The resulting book, "An
American Dilemma," is regarded as the
classic in its field.
His books include "Churches and
Voluntary Associations Among Negroes
in Chicago" (1940), "Black Metropolis"
(with Cayton, published in 1945 and
revised, 1962), "Social Work in West
Africa" (1963), and "Race Relations in
a Time of Rapid Social Change" (1966).
Simmon's Work
Simmons has worked extensively on
minority student admissions and finan
cial aid. He has spoken several times at
Bay Area junior colleges and has been

actively engaged in recruiting American
Indian students for the University.
His new position reflects a broader
range of responsibilities, covering all
activities of concern to students and
other members of minority groups in
non-academic areas as well as those in
the academic area which he held as a
member of the provost's staff.
His office has served as a central
source of information on the develop
ment of minority programs at Stanford.
"If I had to draw a graphic representa
tion of what it's all about, the picture
would be simply a long, extended black
hand" offering help to others, he com
ments.
Simmons is highly regarded as a
counselor for students, helping them
develop their own answers to personal
and educational problems.
Nogales' Record
Nogales helped organize spring vaca
tion field trips by 20 Stanford Mexican-
American students, who canvassed high
schools for prospective student appli
cants.
Last year Nogales helped organize
and recruit students for the Law
School's new program, which permits
minority students to complete LL.B.
degree work in four years instead of the
usual three.
A 1966 graduate of San Diego State
College, where he majored in political

science, he has served on the Stanford
Human Relations Commission and on
the task force for special minority ad
missions, an experimental program for
11 freshmen this year.
Soft-Spoken
Regarded as a shoft-spoken, highly
effective leader, Nogales deliberately
avoided deadlines and confrontation
tactics as MASC chairman. In
December, his group "strongly
requested" that Mexican-American
enrollment be expanded by at least 100
next year.
At present, Stanford has 57
self-de scribed Mexican-Americans
among its 11,400 students. On a
state-wide basis, Mexican-Americans
comprise 12 percent of the population
but less than two percent of those
attending four-year colleges.
"The need is not only to produce
more Mexican-Americans with college
degrees but with college education of
the first quality, so they may assume
leadership roles within their own
communities and in society at large,"
Nogales says.
His main objective is "to fully
incorporate Mexican-Americans into the
educational process at Stanford," giving
particular attention to the
undergraduate and graduate criteria for
admission to the University.

Drake graduated in 1931 from
Hampton Istitute with a B.S. in biology.
He then was a member of a peace
caravan team, sponsored by the Amer
ican Friends Service Committee in the
Deep South.
He continued his education and
teaching at Dillard University, Colum
bia, and Chicago, where he received his
Ph.D. in anthropology in 1954. During
1940-41, he was a research associate on
the Carnegie-Myrdal study of the Negro
in America. The resulting book, "An
American Dilemma," is regarded as the
classic in its field.
His books include "Churches and
Voluntary Associations Among Negroes
in Chicago" (1940), "Black Metropolis"
(with Cayton, published in 1945 and
revised, 1962), "Social Work in West
Africa" (1963), and "Race Relations in
a Time of Rapid Social Change" (1966).
Simmon's Work
Simmons has worked extensively on
minority student admissions and finan
cial aid. He has spoken several times at
Bay Area junior colleges and has been

actively engaged in recruiting American
Indian students for the University.
His new position reflects a broader
range of responsibilities, covering all
activities of concern to students and
other members of minority groups in
non-academic areas as well as those in
the academic area which he held as a
member of the provost's staff.
His office has served as a central
source of information on the develop
ment of minority programs at Stanford.
"If I had to draw a graphic representa
tion of what it's all about, the picture
would be simply a long, extended black
hand" offering help to others, he com
ments.
Simmons is highly regarded as a
counselor for students, helping them
develop their own answers to personal
and educational problems.
Nogales' Record
Nogales helped organize spring vaca
tion field trips by 20 Stanford Mexican-
American students, who canvassed high
schools for prospective student appli
cants.
Last year Nogales helped organize
and recruit students for the Law
School's new program, which permits
minority students to complete LL.B.
degree work in four years instead of the
usual three.
A 1966 graduate of San Diego State
College, where he majored in political

science, he has served on the Stanford
Human Relations Commission and on
the task force for special minority ad
missions, an experimental program for
11 freshmen this year.
Soft-Spoken
Regarded as a shoft-spoken, highly
effective leader, Nogales deliberately
avoided deadlines and confrontation
tactics as MASC chairman. In
December, his group "strongly
requested" that Mexican-American
enrollment be expanded by at least 100
next year.
At present, Stanford has 57
self-de scribed Mexican-Americans
among its 11,400 students. On a
state-wide basis, Mexican-Americans
comprise 12 percent of the population
but less than two percent of those
attending four-year colleges.
"The need is not only to produce
more Mexican-Americans with college
degrees but with college education of
the first quality, so they may assume
leadership roles within their own
communities and in society at large,"
Nogales says.
His main objective is "to fully
incorporate Mexican-Americans into the
educational process at Stanford," giving
particular attention to the
undergraduate and graduate criteria for
admission to the University.
Three major minority affairs appoint
