# 29 Defendants Plan Registration Today
## 
### 
The members of the Stanford
Students for a Democratic Society
(SDS) convicted of disrupting a Trustees
meeting last January have announced
they will attempt to register today
despite having failed to pay fines levied
against them earlier this month.
The attempt will be in defiance of
the Stanford Judicial Council decision
which ordered the twenty-nine to pay at
least half the fine money or not be

allowed to register Spring quarter.
According to a statement drafted last
night at an SDS meeting last night the
group will attempt to register at 3:15
today. When asked what would occur if
the group would not be allowed to
register an SDS spokesman said "we
plan to carry on business as usual."
Questioned about tactics, it was
added, "we'll decide that when the time
comes."
The defendents issued the following
statement late last night.
On January 14, 1969, SDS and other
concerned members of the University
community went to the Board of
Trustees to voice objections to
Stanford's participation in U.S. foreign
policy.
For voicing these concerns,
twenty-nine of us have been fined
nearly $2000 and put on probation by
the Stanford Judicial Council. A judicial
system that presumes to find us guilty
of "disrupting" a Trustees meeting but
which cannot try these same Trustees
for their deep involvement in
exploitation and suffering in Southeast
Asia is inherently unjust.
We will not pay.
Paying money to the Martin Luther
King Scholarship fund as we were
instructed would be hypocritical. The
King fund is controlled by an all white
administration to aid black students of
Stanford's choosing. We have instead
raised money for the Black Panther
Party, which will make the best use of
these funds. President Pitzer has
rejected this payment. We will continue
to raise money, however, and will
present our check payable to the
Panthers to President Pitzer on Friday
April 4.
We are guilty of nothing.
The Trustees' unprecedented
exposition of their political beliefs on
March 11 has shown the community
where the guilt really lies—with the
Stanford Trustees and their institutions.
Join us as we register Monday at
3:15 at Mem. Aud.
The statement said it was passed
unanimously by the SDS-Defendents
March 30, 1969.
