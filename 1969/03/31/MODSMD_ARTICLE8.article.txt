# Trustee Ducommun Reflects On War And Revolution
## 
### SUSAN SWARD 
LOS ANGELES—It was a hot, smoggy morning
in downtown Los Angeles, but inside his
air-conditioned office Charles Ducommun didn't
seem a bit wilted or wrinkled by the weather.
A member of the Stanford Board of Trustees
since 1961, the grey-haired Ducommun is an
energetic man who speaks alternately of his work
for Stanford as "a joy" and as "a difficult task."
On March 11 Ducommun served as one of several
Trustees in a panel discussion at Stanford which
touched on the topics of Stanford Research
Institute's war-related research, Trustees'
involvement in the defense industry and the
possibility of an open Board meeting to consider the
question of SRl's ties with the university.
At that meeting Ducommun came under attack
by several members of the audience—including
members of the Students for a Democratic
Society—primarily because of his position on the
Lockheed Board of Directors and because of his
responses to several questions from the audience.
No Bombs Here
The Board of Trustees member is also President
of Ducommun, Inc. —a broadly-based company
working primarily with steel and aluminum
products. Thofigh a section of the company works
within the field of explosive technology,
Ducommun emphasizes this does not mean the

company makes bombs. Explosive technology
develops shaped charges as cutting devices to sever
parts of planes or space crafts from one another.
Ducommun points out that the margin of profit
a man can make on a government contract in
wartime is considerably less than the amount he
makes on civilian, peacetime products. Factors
limiting wartime profits are competition for
contracts, taxes and government edicts limiting
amount of profits.
According to Ducommun, it is advisable to have
the U.S. in a strong defensive position, but he thinks
that the defense budget is much too high presently.
"I intend to support our government,"
Ducommun said, "though I am constantly talking to
members of the government about trying to stop
the Vietnam War. But what is going to happen to
our boys in Vietnam if we stop the production of
guns and planes immediately?"
Disavows Revolution
Ducommun was emphatic in his disavowal of a
revolutionary approach to social problems. He first
became "hardened to revolutionaries" during the
last 18 months of World War II when he served as an
aide to the Chief of Staff the U.S. Fleet.
As an aide, Ducommun encountered the
"problems of power at a national level and
discovered the duplicity of both Americans and
foreigners."

Revolutionaries may be divided into two major
groups, according to Ducommun. There are those
who want power for the sake of power. These are
the nihilists and the anarchists.
The other major group of revolutionaries are the
idealists. "They want to do something about social
ills. In working for violent change, they may be
hurting more people than they actually help."
"Come Forth"
As Ducommun stated when he sat on the March
11 panel at Stanford, he feels that the Board of
Trustees is not part of any military-industrial
conspiracy. If anybody can produce evidence that
the Board has conspired with the Defense
Department or with any military company to
maintain the Vietnam War, Ducommun invites them
to "come forth with specific names and dates."
Concerning the upcoming Board consideration of
the SRI Committee's report on the university's ties
to SRI, Ducommun has considerable reservations
about the advisability of an open meeting.
An open meeting could. be used to hear
testimony on the various points of view on the issue
of the type of research SRI does, he feels, and on
whether or not SRl's connection with the university
should be continued.
Ducommun accepts the fact that students,
faculty and administrators are concerned with the
issue of SRl's ties with the University.

"There are many students who are honestly
concerned with these problems. We are awaiting the
faculty-student report of the SRI Committee to
come through."
Ducommun stood up and smiled, "And tell the
students up at Stanford that on the Board we're
working for the students," he said. "Not against
them."
