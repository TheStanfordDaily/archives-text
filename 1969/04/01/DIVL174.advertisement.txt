"The Daily
is a biased rag!"
— David Pugh, SDS — Harvey Hukari, YAF
We always seem to get it from both sides. The Daily is always in the middle and on the spot. We can't be
right (or left) all the time, but we try our best. Maybe you have some complaints, too. Mcybe they're even
justified. But we can t solve all our problems ourselves—we need your help. Short on staff, short on time,
the solution to most of our problems—and most of you r complaints—is more people. So don't just tell us our
problems (we're already only too aware of them)—be part of the solution. Join the Daily. There will be an
orientation meeting for new staffers in the Daily office Friday, April 4, at 4 p.m. (In case you don't know
where we are, the Daily is located in the Storke Student Publications Building, on Lomita Drive between Pana-
Lma and Santa Teresa.) If you can't make it then, call us at x 4632 and we'll contact you. But join us—be a
problem solver.
