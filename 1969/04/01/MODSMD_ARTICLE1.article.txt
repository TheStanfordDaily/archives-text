# Minuteman System Uncovered In Foothills; Freeway Construction Covers Installation

The United States Government,
without the knowledge or consent of
Stanford University, has constructed a
Minuteman missile base in the rolling
green Stanford foothills.
The missiles, armed with
thermonuclear warheads, were installed
in silos built by men and equipment
supposedly working on construction of
Interstate Freeway 280 which cuts
across the foothills.
The Daily learned yesterday that the
Pentagon is considering installation of
an anti-ballistic missile (ABM) site on
Stanford land to protect the Minuteman
base and guard against nuclear attack on
the extensive military industrial, and
electronic network of the Bay Area.
The proposed "Safeguard" ABM
system, recently outlined by President
Richard Nixon, has reached the
blueprint stage and the government is
delaying the opening of Freeway 280 to
facilitate eventual ABM construction if
necessary.
Pilot Discovered Site
Discovery of the Minuteman site was
made by Jack Collins, a private pilot,
who spotted "an unusual, new bunker
like construction in the foothills."
Collins said, "I never noticed it before
last week, though I frequently saw
construction vehicles moving in the
area."
Collins tipped off The Daily and
investigation produced proof of the
missile site existence. Contacted in
Washington last night, David Packard,
former Stanford trustee and now
Deputy Secretary of Defense, stated,
"Yes, the site does exist."
Packard continued, "We are
considering construction of an ABM
system at Stanford and are about to
enter negotiations with the University
trustees. Installation of the Minuteman
site was secret to avoid undue concern
among local citizens. We wanted
reasonable criticism, not 'warheads in
my backyard' hysteria."
Destruction Capability Great
Defense Department spokesmen
estimate the Minuteman site is armed
with megatonage powerful enough to
destroy Peking or Moscow. The missiles
can be launched only by Presidential
decision and are linked to other sites in
Montana and North Dakota.
According to one workman on the
Freeway project, they were often
bewildered by the "extra trucks and
other equipment, including digging
machines," which passed normal road
construction.
Once the silos were dug, electronic
equipment was placed in operation and
the missiles were brought in by large
construction trucks. The missiles were
hidden under sand. The site contains 12
Minutemen and is manned by remote
control from Moffett Field Naval Base
in Sunnyvale.
'Help Protect Base'
Packard commented last night that
the new ABM system would "help
protect the naval base as well as the
missile site."
The Government action is an

unprecedented venture into use of
academic institutions to protect the
national defense. William Parmer Fuller
111, president of the Board of Trustees,
said last night, "The Pentagon must
have had good intentions. Alter all, the
University must move carefully in this
matter, with due regard for the nation's
defense interests."
The actual site is located atop the
hills directly across from Lake Lagunita,
above Juniperro Serra Road. Cattle
graze on these hills and the huge
Stanford radio telescope sits several
hilltops away.
Sliding Roof On Silos
Surveillence of the innocent looking
bunker area reveals a sliding roof on the
silos, surrounded by tracking radar
which silently scans the sky. The bunker
area is fenched by a high Cyclone,
reinforced steel fence. The electric eye
gate is the only means of entry. The
nearby turf is still marked by tire tracks
and caterpillar tread marks.
Richard Allen, assistant to National
Security Adviser Henry Kissinger, and
formerly of Stanford's Hoover
Institution, was reached at the White
House yesterday. He commented, "We

carefully placed the site far from the
center of campus. We do not anticipate
a repeat ol the Columbia University
gym incident last April."
Allen explained that University
involvement is not relevant here because
the University surrendered its property
rights through the government's right of
eminent domain when the highway was
constructed.
Part Of Deterrent
The Minuteman system is part of the
nation's deterrent against possible
attack by the Soviet Union or
Communist China, as her thermonuclear
delivery system is developed. The
Minuteman is a solid fuel missile poised
in a thick concrete bunker to protect
against anything but direct hit by a
thermonuclear device.
In recent test firings in North
Dakota, two Minutemen have failed to
fire, worrying some military men about
the missile's reliability.
The recent heated debate over plans
for the ABM were highlighted last week
by a dispute between Packard and
Wolfgang Panofsky, director of the
Stanford Linear Accelerator Center. In a

Senate Foreign Relations Committee
hearing last week, Packard stated that
Panofsky had advised the government
on its decision to install a modified
ABM.
Panofsky Denied Consultation
In later testimony, Panofsky denied
he had been consulated except for a
brief chat with Packard at San Francisco
Airport.
Critics of the ABM plan claim that
the government has misjudged Soviet
intentions and thermonuclear capability
while underestimating our own. They
say that the system will only escalate
the arins race.
Proponents of the system feel that
the United States must develop a missile
defensive network to preserve the
ability to retaliate against Soviet attack.
ABM proponents believe the Soviet
Union is rapidly building an
overwhelming first strike capability,
meaning they could destroy any chance
for retaliation.
The Soviet Union has recently
offered to begin serious talks about
reducing the arms race.


MINUTEMAN BUNKER— Located in the foothills above campus, on liniversity land, this
Minuleman missile site is completely devoid of any identifying markings, and is surrounded by
a high chain-link fence topped with l>arhcd wire. Stanford can be seen in the background. The
bunker overlooks the campus, the industrial park, as well as Moffett Field.
