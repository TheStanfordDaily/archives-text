# Stanford Study Shows Grade School Drug Use
## 
### 
Youthful drug use has now
spread to the upper elementary
grades in such metropolitan areas
as San Francisco, Los Angeles,
Boston and New York, a new
Stanford study published this
week reveals.
Marijuana is the most popular
drug. The potent hallucinogenic
drugs and opiates are the least
used, reports Dr. Richard H. Blum
and associates in "Society and
Drugs," Vol. I, and "Students and
Drugs," Vol. II (799 pp.,
Jossey-Bass Inc., San Francisco,
$25).
Dr. Blum, a psychologist and
research associate at Stanford's
Institute for the Study of Human
Problems, spent more than eight
years on the study, supported in
part with funds from the national
Institute of Mental Health.
Since the drug culture was
introduced about 15 years ago by
the professional, intellectual and
artistic communities, Dr. Blum
reports, "what we see now is a
rapidly increasing tempo" which

has spread down from graduate
and undergraduate college
students through high school and
now to the upper elementary
grades.
"As the base number of
marijuana-experienced students
expands, so does the proportion
willing to risk LSD, DMT, STP,
opium, heroin and the like," he
reports.
Nearly 30 scientists assisted in
the study, which covered some
20,000 individuals, 250 cultures, a
variety of other nations, historical
events and special groups.
Control of either student drug
traffic or use is difficult, if not
impossible, the study points out.
"Most adults are not eager for
massive police action to invest
campuses so that hundreds of
thousands of their sons and
daughters would be arrested.
"Most universities must ignore
discrete illicit-drug use on the
campus or be forced into painful
policing of the sort which would
arouse new antagonism between

students and authorities and
which would, if it were to result
in arrests of all students actually
using such drugs, cut the campus
population—at least in some
areas—in half," the report says.
(The Blum study covered five
Western colleges or universities
and six California high schools.)
When older students suffer
"bad trips" from either LSD or
alcohol-induced illness, they
endure their ill-effects and take
care of themselves or one another
without calling a physician—hence
the scarcity of official reports.
But the danger lies in the fact
that the younger students, with
less sophistication and maturity
than college students, "will be less
able* to care for their own bad
reactions and less able as well to
seek competent professional help
on their own," the report says.
Also, younger students will
subject themselves to greater risks
because of lack of drug
information, be less able to handle
the reactions from "strong

psychoactive drugs" and the
strong emotional reactions of guilt
and anxiety from "novel, illicit
and taboo" behavior.
The study predicts that wider
use of drugs by the younger
student population will result in
greater official attention.
The Blum survey covered drug
use in middle- and upper-class
colleges and high schools. But the
lower-class of use of heroin ("H"
or "hard stuff" in the vernacular,
as well as of amphetamine or
"speed") is expected to spread
u so that a certain homogeneity in
use is to be expected in the
coming years," he notes.
Student drug users, as Dr.
Blum found among adults in his
1964 study, "Utopiates," are
"secure by reasons of wealth, are
white, Anglo-Saxon Rrotestants,
are more free of convention and
more attentive to matters of
adjustment, mind, aesthetics, and
social philosophy .. . These are
friends and teachers of drug use to
the other students."

There is also a connection
between drug use and the New
Left, with a higher incidence there
of distant or poor intra-family
relations, the Blum study reveals.
Among the family heritages of
student drug users is a high
incidence of drug use among
parents, including alcohol and
tobacco, and a liberal-permissive
atmosphere, the survey shows.
Generalizations are difficult,
the survey emphasizes, and there
is a veritable "constellation" of
other difficulties involved:
"family mobility, disagreement
with parents on topical issues,
dissatisfaction with school, career
pessimism, drop-out history, early
gratification from illness, and
early eating problems"—to name
only a few.
Yet a major factor is the
youthful search for new pleasures
and experiences, a desire to be
"cool" and "with it,"the survey
makes clear.
It is difficult for the non-user
to be aloof to the drug scene
because of social pressure on
metropolitan campuses where the
majority has used marijuana. Thus
the non-user becomes the unusual
case.
"Over the college years, the
abstainers at least become users of
approved drugs," Dr. Blum writes.

Marijuana thus becomes an
"approved" drug by student
standards "and an unknown but
probably large portion of some
faculties as well, so that one must
expect that even the upright will
succumb to social pressure and
personal titillation . . ."
Ironically, students are
shunning tobacco because they
are heeding the warnings about
lung-cancer and addiction; yet
they smoke marijuana, because it
gives oral gratification, gives
pleasure, is not believed to be
addictive, leaves no hangover, and,
according to the students
interviewed, is also symbolic.
. The climate of civil
disobedience, the availability of a
set of moral justification for
active violation of the law, and
the apparent inequities of present
drug penalties . . . combine to give
a sense of righteousness to the
drug user on campus.
. . Illicit drug use on campus
is not only attractive . . . but is
safe," the Blum survey declares.
Actual arrests are few and fewer
students yet are disciplined by
school authorities, he points out.
But two points of inference
garnered from the exhaustive
survey left Dr. Blum and his
investigators "with a strong sense
of worry or dissatisfaction."

First, student drug innovators
and intensive users, they found,
were "change-oriented, more
removed from family closeness,
more dissatisfied and pessimistic."
Yet the interests of these
"liberal students," ironically, are
closely allied with those of "many
social scientists, psychiatrists and
school administrators."
Their values are the same—"the
importance of adjustment, of
curiosity, of social criticism, and
of 'progressive' socio-political
doctrine, as well as emphasis on
aesthetics, on finding one's
identity, on spontaneity in
relationships, and on being
antagonistic toward national
authority . . ."
"Consequently, when these
scientists and clinicians undertake
to evaluate today's left and/or
drug-using students, they are
often looking at people much like
themselves," and maybe overly
sympathetic.
Second, they found that drug
users are not "people in despair or
undergoing acute psychological
distress." Though an unpleasant
variety of results can be achieved
through drug use, they found that
there was no evidence of anything
damaging over the long run.
"Thus, one can conclude, as we
do, that anything but toxic
ill-effects are unlikely, and that
illicit-exotic drugs when used as
students are now doing, for the
most part, do not seem to pose
serious hazards to school
performance or health."
But, Dr. Blum and his
investigators warn: "We have no
idea how many suffered ill-effects
and have left school; we have no
idea about long-range bad results
of the gradual sort that alter
personality adversely or produce
depende cy, yet are not
recognized by students in their
self-reporting as undesirable."
Previous Blum research has
shown that where the users have
said they were better than ever
and felt just fine, at least 10
percent of their employers,
friends and family said they had
"gone downhill," Dr. Blum points
out.
Drug use is very much a part of
today's student's life; if it doesn't
"fit" him, he will stop using it; if
it does, he will probably continue.
"The more common drug use
becomes, the less significance it
will have to students and the less
it will stand out as an item which
discriminates between classes of
persons . . .
"Student drug use will
continue to expand and as these
students grow older, many forms
of drug use now considered
deviant or dangerous will become
part of what otherwise-respectable
adults do," Dr. Blum predicts.

closely allied with those of "many
social scientists, psychiatrists and
school administrators."
Their values are the same—"the
importance of adjustment, of
curiosity, of social criticism, and
of 'progressive' socio-political
doctrine, as well as emphasis on
aesthetics, on finding one's
identity, on spontaneity in
relationships, and on being
antagonistic toward national
authority . . ."
"Consequently, when these
scientists and clinicians undertake
to evaluate today's left and/or
drug-using students, they are
often looking at people much like
themselves," and maybe overly
sympathetic.
Second, they found that drug
users are not "people in despair or
undergoing acute psychological
distress." Though an unpleasant
variety of results can be achieved
through drug use, they found that
there was no evidence of anything
damaging over the long run.
"Thus, one can conclude, as we
do, that anything but toxic
ill-effects are unlikely, and that
illicit-exotic drugs when used as
students are now doing, for the
most part, do not seem to pose
serious hazards to school
performance or health."
But, Dr. Blum and his
investigators warn: "We have no
idea how many suffered ill-effects
and have left school; we have no
idea about long-range bad results
of the gradual sort that alter
personality adversely or produce
depende cy, yet are not
recognized by students in their
self-reporting as undesirable."
Previous Blum research has
shown that where the users have
said they were better than ever
and felt just fine, at least 10
percent of their employers,
friends and family said they had
"gone downhill," Dr. Blum points
out.
Drug use is very much a part of
today's student's life; if it doesn't
"fit" him, he will stop using it; if
it does, he will probably continue.
"The more common drug use
becomes, the less significance it
will have to students and the less
it will stand out as an item which
discriminates between classes of
persons . . .
"Student drug use will
continue to expand and as these
students grow older, many forms
of drug use now considered
deviant or dangerous will become
part of what otherwise-respectable
adults do," Dr. Blum predicts.
Youthful drug use has now
spread to the upper elementary
grades in such metropolitan areas
as San Francisco, Los Angeles,
Boston and New York, a new
Stanford study published this
week reveals.
Marijuana is the most popular
drug. The potent hallucinogenic
drugs and opiates are the least
used, reports Dr. Richard H. Blum
and associates in "Society and
Drugs," Vol. I, and "Students and
Drugs," Vol. II (799 pp.,
Jossey-Bass Inc., San Francisco,
$25).
Dr. Blum, a psychologist and
research associate at Stanford's
Institute for the Study of Human
Problems, spent more than eight
years on the study, supported in
part with funds from the national
Institute of Mental Health.
Since the drug culture was
introduced about 15 years ago by
the professional, intellectual and
artistic communities, Dr. Blum
reports, "what we see now is a
rapidly increasing tempo" which

has spread down from graduate
and undergraduate college
students through high school and
now to the upper elementary
grades.
"As the base number of
marijuana-experienced students
expands, so does the proportion
willing to risk LSD, DMT, STP,
opium, heroin and the like," he
reports.
Nearly 30 scientists assisted in
the study, which covered some
20,000 individuals, 250 cultures, a
variety of other nations, historical
events and special groups.
Control of either student drug
traffic or use is difficult, if not
impossible, the study points out.
"Most adults are not eager for
massive police action to invest
campuses so that hundreds of
thousands of their sons and
daughters would be arrested.
"Most universities must ignore
discrete illicit-drug use on the
campus or be forced into painful
policing of the sort which would
arouse new antagonism between

students and authorities and
which would, if it were to result
in arrests of all students actually
using such drugs, cut the campus
population—at least in some
areas—in half," the report says.
(The Blum study covered five
Western colleges or universities
and six California high schools.)
When older students suffer
"bad trips" from either LSD or
alcohol-induced illness, they
endure their ill-effects and take
care of themselves or one another
without calling a physician—hence
the scarcity of official reports.
But the danger lies in the fact
that the younger students, with
less sophistication and maturity
than college students, "will be less
able* to care for their own bad
reactions and less able as well to
seek competent professional help
on their own," the report says.
Also, younger students will
subject themselves to greater risks
because of lack of drug
information, be less able to handle
the reactions from "strong

psychoactive drugs" and the
strong emotional reactions of guilt
and anxiety from "novel, illicit
and taboo" behavior.
The study predicts that wider
use of drugs by the younger
student population will result in
greater official attention.
The Blum survey covered drug
use in middle- and upper-class
colleges and high schools. But the
lower-class of use of heroin ("H"
or "hard stuff" in the vernacular,
as well as of amphetamine or
"speed") is expected to spread
u so that a certain homogeneity in
use is to be expected in the
coming years," he notes.
Student drug users, as Dr.
Blum found among adults in his
1964 study, "Utopiates," are
"secure by reasons of wealth, are
white, Anglo-Saxon Rrotestants,
are more free of convention and
more attentive to matters of
adjustment, mind, aesthetics, and
social philosophy .. . These are
friends and teachers of drug use to
the other students."

There is also a connection
between drug use and the New
Left, with a higher incidence there
of distant or poor intra-family
relations, the Blum study reveals.
Among the family heritages of
student drug users is a high
incidence of drug use among
parents, including alcohol and
tobacco, and a liberal-permissive
atmosphere, the survey shows.
Generalizations are difficult,
the survey emphasizes, and there
is a veritable "constellation" of
other difficulties involved:
"family mobility, disagreement
with parents on topical issues,
dissatisfaction with school, career
pessimism, drop-out history, early
gratification from illness, and
early eating problems"—to name
only a few.
Yet a major factor is the
youthful search for new pleasures
and experiences, a desire to be
"cool" and "with it,"the survey
makes clear.
It is difficult for the non-user
to be aloof to the drug scene
because of social pressure on
metropolitan campuses where the
majority has used marijuana. Thus
the non-user becomes the unusual
case.
"Over the college years, the
abstainers at least become users of
approved drugs," Dr. Blum writes.

Marijuana thus becomes an
"approved" drug by student
standards "and an unknown but
probably large portion of some
faculties as well, so that one must
expect that even the upright will
succumb to social pressure and
personal titillation . . ."
Ironically, students are
shunning tobacco because they
are heeding the warnings about
lung-cancer and addiction; yet
they smoke marijuana, because it
gives oral gratification, gives
pleasure, is not believed to be
addictive, leaves no hangover, and,
according to the students
interviewed, is also symbolic.
. The climate of civil
disobedience, the availability of a
set of moral justification for
active violation of the law, and
the apparent inequities of present
drug penalties . . . combine to give
a sense of righteousness to the
drug user on campus.
. . Illicit drug use on campus
is not only attractive . . . but is
safe," the Blum survey declares.
Actual arrests are few and fewer
students yet are disciplined by
school authorities, he points out.
But two points of inference
garnered from the exhaustive
survey left Dr. Blum and his
investigators "with a strong sense
of worry or dissatisfaction."

First, student drug innovators
and intensive users, they found,
were "change-oriented, more
removed from family closeness,
more dissatisfied and pessimistic."
Yet the interests of these
"liberal students," ironically, are
closely allied with those of "many
social scientists, psychiatrists and
school administrators."
Their values are the same—"the
importance of adjustment, of
curiosity, of social criticism, and
of 'progressive' socio-political
doctrine, as well as emphasis on
aesthetics, on finding one's
identity, on spontaneity in
relationships, and on being
antagonistic toward national
authority . . ."
"Consequently, when these
scientists and clinicians undertake
to evaluate today's left and/or
drug-using students, they are

Second, they found that drug

parents, including alcohol and
tobacco, and a liberal-permissive
atmosphere, the survey shows.
Generalizations are difficult,
the survey emphasizes, and there
is a veritable "constellation" of
other difficulties involved:
"family mobility, disagreement
with parents on topical issues,
dissatisfaction with school, career
pessimism, drop-out history, early
gratification from illness, and
early eating problems"—to name
only a few.
Yet a major factor is the
youthful search for new pleasures
and experiences, a desire to be
"cool" and "with it,"the survey
makes clear.
It is difficult for the non-user
to be aloof to the drug scene
because of social pressure on
metropolitan campuses where the
majority has used marijuana. Thus
the non-user becomes the unusual
case.
"Over the college years, the
abstainers at least become users of
approved drugs," Dr. Blum writes.

Marijuana thus becomes an
"approved" drug by student
standards "and an unknown but
probably large portion of some
faculties as well, so that one must
expect that even the upright will
succumb to social pressure and
personal titillation . . ."
Ironically, students are
shunning tobacco because they
are heeding the warnings about
lung-cancer and addiction; yet
they smoke marijuana, because it
gives oral gratification, gives
pleasure, is not believed to be
addictive, leaves no hangover, and,
according to the students
interviewed, is also symbolic.
. The climate of civil
disobedience, the availability of a
set of moral justification for
active violation of the law, and
the apparent inequities of present
drug penalties . . . combine to give
a sense of righteousness to the
drug user on campus.
. . Illicit drug use on campus
is not only attractive . . . but is
safe," the Blum survey declares.
Actual arrests are few and fewer
students yet are disciplined by
school authorities, he points out.
But two points of inference
garnered from the exhaustive
survey left Dr. Blum and his
investigators "with a strong sense
of worry or dissatisfaction."

First, student drug innovators
and intensive users, they found,
were "change-oriented, more
removed from family closeness,
more dissatisfied and pessimistic."
Yet the interests of these
"liberal students," ironically, are
closely allied with those of "many
social scientists, psychiatrists and
school administrators."
Their values are the same—"the
importance of adjustment, of
curiosity, of social criticism, and
of 'progressive' socio-political
doctrine, as well as emphasis on
aesthetics, on finding one's
identity, on spontaneity in
relationships, and on being
antagonistic toward national
authority . . ."
"Consequently, when these
scientists and clinicians undertake
to evaluate today's left and/or
drug-using students, they are
often looking at people much like
themselves," and maybe overly
sympathetic.
Second, they found that drug
users are not "people in despair or
undergoing acute psychological
distress." Though an unpleasant
variety of results can be achieved
through drug use, they found that
there was no evidence of anything
damaging over the long run.
"Thus, one can conclude, as we
do, that anything but toxic
ill-effects are unlikely, and that
illicit-exotic drugs when used as
students are now doing, for the
most part, do not seem to pose
serious hazards to school
performance or health."
But, Dr. Blum and his
investigators warn: "We have no
idea how many suffered ill-effects
and have left school; we have no
idea about long-range bad results
of the gradual sort that alter
personality adversely or produce
depende cy, yet are not
recognized by students in their
self-reporting as undesirable."
Previous Blum research has
shown that where the users have
said they were better than ever
and felt just fine, at least 10
percent of their employers,
friends and family said they had
"gone downhill," Dr. Blum points
out.
Drug use is very much a part of
today's student's life; if it doesn't
"fit" him, he will stop using it; if
it does, he will probably continue.
"The more common drug use
becomes, the less significance it
will have to students and the less
it will stand out as an item which
discriminates between classes of
persons . . .
"Student drug use will
continue to expand and as these
students grow older, many forms
of drug use now considered
deviant or dangerous will become
part of what otherwise-respectable
adults do," Dr. Blum predicts.
Youthful drug use has now
spread to the upper elementary
grades in such metropolitan areas
as San Francisco, Los Angeles,
Boston and New York, a new
Stanford study published this
week reveals.
Marijuana is the most popular
drug. The potent hallucinogenic
drugs and opiates are the least
used, reports Dr. Richard H. Blum
and associates in "Society and
Drugs," Vol. I, and "Students and
Drugs," Vol. II (799 pp.,
Jossey-Bass Inc., San Francisco,
$25).
Dr. Blum, a psychologist and
research associate at Stanford's
Institute for the Study of Human
Problems, spent more than eight
years on the study, supported in
part with funds from the national
Institute of Mental Health.
Since the drug culture was
introduced about 15 years ago by
the professional, intellectual and
artistic communities, Dr. Blum
reports, "what we see now is a
rapidly increasing tempo" which

has spread down from graduate
and undergraduate college
students through high school and
now to the upper elementary
grades.
"As the base number of
marijuana-experienced students
expands, so does the proportion
willing to risk LSD, DMT, STP,
opium, heroin and the like," he
reports.
Nearly 30 scientists assisted in
the study, which covered some
20,000 individuals, 250 cultures, a
variety of other nations, historical
events and special groups.
Control of either student drug
traffic or use is difficult, if not
impossible, the study points out.
"Most adults are not eager for
massive police action to invest
campuses so that hundreds of
thousands of their sons and
daughters would be arrested.
"Most universities must ignore
discrete illicit-drug use on the
campus or be forced into painful
policing of the sort which would
arouse new antagonism between

students and authorities and
which would, if it were to result
in arrests of all students actually
using such drugs, cut the campus
population—at least in some
areas—in half," the report says.
(The Blum study covered five
Western colleges or universities
and six California high schools.)
When older students suffer
"bad trips" from either LSD or
alcohol-induced illness, they
endure their ill-effects and take
care of themselves or one another
without calling a physician—hence
the scarcity of official reports.
But the danger lies in the fact
that the younger students, with
less sophistication and maturity
than college students, "will be less
able* to care for their own bad
reactions and less able as well to
seek competent professional help
on their own," the report says.
Also, younger students will
subject themselves to greater risks
because of lack of drug
information, be less able to handle
the reactions from "strong

psychoactive drugs" and the
strong emotional reactions of guilt
and anxiety from "novel, illicit
and taboo" behavior.
The study predicts that wider
use of drugs by the younger
student population will result in
greater official attention.
The Blum survey covered drug
use in middle- and upper-class
colleges and high schools. But the
lower-class of use of heroin ("H"
or "hard stuff" in the vernacular,
as well as of amphetamine or
"speed") is expected to spread
u so that a certain homogeneity in
use is to be expected in the
coming years," he notes.
Student drug users, as Dr.
Blum found among adults in his
1964 study, "Utopiates," are
"secure by reasons of wealth, are
white, Anglo-Saxon Rrotestants,
are more free of convention and
more attentive to matters of
adjustment, mind, aesthetics, and
social philosophy .. . These are
friends and teachers of drug use to
the other students."

There is also a connection
between drug use and the New
Left, with a higher incidence there
of distant or poor intra-family
relations, the Blum study reveals.
Among the family heritages of
student drug users is a high
incidence of drug use among
parents, including alcohol and
tobacco, and a liberal-permissive
atmosphere, the survey shows.
Generalizations are difficult,
the survey emphasizes, and there
is a veritable "constellation" of
other difficulties involved:
"family mobility, disagreement
with parents on topical issues,
dissatisfaction with school, career
pessimism, drop-out history, early
gratification from illness, and
early eating problems"—to name
only a few.

campus or be forced into painful
policing of the sort which would
arouse new antagonism between

students and authorities and
which would, if it were to result
in arrests of all students actually
using such drugs, cut the campus
population—at least in some
areas—in half," the report says.
(The Blum study covered five
Western colleges or universities
and six California high schools.)
When older students suffer
"bad trips" from either LSD or
alcohol-induced illness, they
endure their ill-effects and take
care of themselves or one another
without calling a physician—hence
the scarcity of official reports.
But the danger lies in the fact
that the younger students, with
less sophistication and maturity
than college students, "will be less
able* to care for their own bad
reactions and less able as well to
seek competent professional help
on their own," the report says.
Also, younger students will
subject themselves to greater risks
because of lack of drug
information, be less able to handle
the reactions from "strong

psychoactive drugs" and the
strong emotional reactions of guilt
and anxiety from "novel, illicit
and taboo" behavior.
The study predicts that wider
use of drugs by the younger
student population will result in
greater official attention.
The Blum survey covered drug
use in middle- and upper-class
colleges and high schools. But the
lower-class of use of heroin ("H"
or "hard stuff" in the vernacular,
as well as of amphetamine or
"speed") is expected to spread
u so that a certain homogeneity in
use is to be expected in the
coming years," he notes.
Student drug users, as Dr.
Blum found among adults in his
1964 study, "Utopiates," are
"secure by reasons of wealth, are
white, Anglo-Saxon Rrotestants,
are more free of convention and
more attentive to matters of
adjustment, mind, aesthetics, and
social philosophy .. . These are
friends and teachers of drug use to
the other students."

There is also a connection
between drug use and the New
Left, with a higher incidence there
of distant or poor intra-family
relations, the Blum study reveals.
Among the family heritages of
student drug users is a high
incidence of drug use among
parents, including alcohol and
tobacco, and a liberal-permissive
atmosphere, the survey shows.
Generalizations are difficult,
the survey emphasizes, and there
is a veritable "constellation" of
other difficulties involved:
"family mobility, disagreement
with parents on topical issues,
dissatisfaction with school, career
pessimism, drop-out history, early
gratification from illness, and
early eating problems"—to name
only a few.
Yet a major factor is the
youthful search for new pleasures
and experiences, a desire to be
"cool" and "with it,"the survey
makes clear.
It is difficult for the non-user
to be aloof to the drug scene
because of social pressure on
metropolitan campuses where the
majority has used marijuana. Thus
the non-user becomes the unusual
case.
"Over the college years, the
abstainers at least become users of
approved drugs," Dr. Blum writes.

Marijuana thus becomes an
"approved" drug by student
standards "and an unknown but
probably large portion of some
faculties as well, so that one must
expect that even the upright will
succumb to social pressure and
personal titillation . . ."
Ironically, students are
shunning tobacco because they
are heeding the warnings about
lung-cancer and addiction; yet
they smoke marijuana, because it
gives oral gratification, gives
pleasure, is not believed to be
addictive, leaves no hangover, and,
according to the students
interviewed, is also symbolic.
. The climate of civil
disobedience, the availability of a
set of moral justification for
active violation of the law, and
the apparent inequities of present
drug penalties . . . combine to give
a sense of righteousness to the
drug user on campus.
. . Illicit drug use on campus
is not only attractive . . . but is
safe," the Blum survey declares.
Actual arrests are few and fewer
students yet are disciplined by
school authorities, he points out.
But two points of inference
garnered from the exhaustive
survey left Dr. Blum and his
investigators "with a strong sense
of worry or dissatisfaction."

First, student drug innovators
and intensive users, they found,
were "change-oriented, more
removed from family closeness,
more dissatisfied and pessimistic."
Yet the interests of these
"liberal students," ironically, are
closely allied with those of "many
social scientists, psychiatrists and
school administrators."
Their values are the same—"the
importance of adjustment, of
curiosity, of social criticism, and
of 'progressive' socio-political
doctrine, as well as emphasis on
aesthetics, on finding one's
identity, on spontaneity in
relationships, and on being
antagonistic toward national
authority . . ."
"Consequently, when these
scientists and clinicians undertake
to evaluate today's left and/or
drug-using students, they are
often looking at people much like
themselves," and maybe overly
sympathetic.
Second, they found that drug
users are not "people in despair or
undergoing acute psychological
distress." Though an unpleasant
variety of results can be achieved
through drug use, they found that
there was no evidence of anything
damaging over the long run.
"Thus, one can conclude, as we
do, that anything but toxic
ill-effects are unlikely, and that
illicit-exotic drugs when used as
students are now doing, for the
most part, do not seem to pose
serious hazards to school
performance or health."
But, Dr. Blum and his
investigators warn: "We have no
idea how many suffered ill-effects
and have left school; we have no
idea about long-range bad results
of the gradual sort that alter
personality adversely or produce
depende cy, yet are not
recognized by students in their
self-reporting as undesirable."
Previous Blum research has
shown that where the users have
said they were better than ever
and felt just fine, at least 10
percent of their employers,
friends and family said they had
"gone downhill," Dr. Blum points
out.
Drug use is very much a part of
today's student's life; if it doesn't
"fit" him, he will stop using it; if
it does, he will probably continue.
"The more common drug use
becomes, the less significance it
will have to students and the less
it will stand out as an item which
discriminates between classes of
persons . . .
"Student drug use will
continue to expand and as these
students grow older, many forms
of drug use now considered
deviant or dangerous will become
part of what otherwise-respectable
adults do," Dr. Blum predicts.
Youthful drug use has now
spread to the upper elementary
grades in such metropolitan areas
as San Francisco, Los Angeles,
Boston and New York, a new
Stanford study published this
week reveals.
Marijuana is the most popular
drug. The potent hallucinogenic
drugs and opiates are the least
used, reports Dr. Richard H. Blum
and associates in "Society and
Drugs," Vol. I, and "Students and
Drugs," Vol. II (799 pp.,
Jossey-Bass Inc., San Francisco,
$25).
Dr. Blum, a psychologist and
research associate at Stanford's
Institute for the Study of Human
Problems, spent more than eight
years on the study, supported in
part with funds from the national
Institute of Mental Health.
Since the drug culture was
introduced about 15 years ago by
the professional, intellectual and
artistic communities, Dr. Blum
reports, "what we see now is a
rapidly increasing tempo" which

has spread down from graduate
and undergraduate college
students through high school and
now to the upper elementary
grades.
"As the base number of
marijuana-experienced students
expands, so does the proportion
willing to risk LSD, DMT, STP,
opium, heroin and the like," he
reports.
Nearly 30 scientists assisted in
the study, which covered some
20,000 individuals, 250 cultures, a
variety of other nations, historical
events and special groups.
Control of either student drug
traffic or use is difficult, if not
impossible, the study points out.
"Most adults are not eager for
massive police action to invest
campuses so that hundreds of
thousands of their sons and
daughters would be arrested.
"Most universities must ignore
discrete illicit-drug use on the
campus or be forced into painful
policing of the sort which would
arouse new antagonism between

students and authorities and
which would, if it were to result
in arrests of all students actually
using such drugs, cut the campus
population—at least in some
areas—in half," the report says.
