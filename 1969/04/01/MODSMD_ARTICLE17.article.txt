# Chairman Selected

### 
President Kenneth S. Pitzer of
Stanford has named William L.
i Leland, a fraternity cluster staff
resident, chairman of a new Presi
dential Committee on New Under
-1 graduate Living Ideas.
The committee, which includes
five students and four faculty, will
study the need for additional
undergraduate student residential
units and suggest the general size,
type and pattern for such units.
A recent report from the Study
of Education at Stanford recom
mended construction of new co
j educational residence units for
about 500 undergraduates "as a
matter of highest priority." It also
recommended construction of at
least 40 apartment units nearby
for younger faculty members and

graduate students.
Pitzer said the committee
should give due consideration
both to the student's need for
privacy and to the need for a
sense of community in any new
buildings.
Students on the committee
are: E. Graham Baker, junior
architecture major; Fletcher R.
Catron, senior history major; i
Steven W. Myroie, graduate stu
dent in electrical engineering; and
Miss Frances K. Wade, junior
architecture major.
F acuity members are Profs.
Carl Degler, history; Stanley E.
Fischman, psychiatry; Albert J. 1
Gelpi, English, and a faculty resi- ;
dent in Wilbur; and David M.
Kennedy, history.
