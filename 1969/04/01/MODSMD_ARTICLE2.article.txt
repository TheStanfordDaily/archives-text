# ASSU Election Nears; Petitions Available
## 
### DAVID DAVENPORT 
With the primary election for next
year's ASSU president only two weeks
away, petitions lor candidates ire now
available in the ASSU office.
Although no petition deadline has
been established, and will not be until
this Thursday's meeting of the student
legislature (LASSU), candidates are
encouraged to take out petitions as soon
as possible.
At this point, no candidate has
officially registered to run for the
presidency. However several names of
probably candidates have been advanced
to the Daily: Barry Askinas, graduate
student in sociology, with his running
mate Fred Alvarez, freshman in general
studies; Jeff Kane, senior in physiology,
with Tim Coburn, medical student in
genetics; Pat Shea, junior in political
science; Jim Schnieder, junior in
psychology; and John Spiegel, senior in
history.
Petition Procedure
The petitions for the April 15 and 16
election require the signatures of only
15 members of the Associated Students.
When properly filed with the ASSU
office, the petition will place the
candidate's name on the ballot for the
primary election. Write-in candidates
will also be permitted in the April 15
and 16 primary.
If no candidate receives a majority of
the votes cast in the primary, the top
two candidates will be placed on a final
run-off ballot. This final election, if it is
necessary, would be held "as soon as the

Election Commission counts the
primary ballot and prepares the new
one: probably within a week,"
according to LASSU Speaker Yale
Braunstein.
Write-in votes will not be counted in
the final ballot, so all candidates must
submit a petition or conduct a write-in
campaign during the primary April 15
and 16.
LASSU Determination
The specific election procedures and
regulations, particularly the pressing
matter of a deadline for petitions, must
be determined by the student legislature
in its meeting this Thursday night.
The first LASSU meeting of the
Spring Quarter is scheduled for 7:30 in
room 320. Besides the election rules,
LASSU will also be considering the new
constitution from Denis Hayes.
This document, Hayes' second new
constitution, will probably be drawn
from the table, discussed and voted
upon. Should the legislature vote
favorably on the proposal, it will be
placed on the April 15 and 16 Spring
election ballot.
Refcrendu ms
The Spring election ballot is
generally a popular time for placing
constitutions, amendments, and
propositions before the student body
for consideration. Petitions for such
proposals must contain the signature of
one-fifth of the student body, and must
be submitted to the ASSU office.
