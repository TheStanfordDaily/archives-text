# Coalition Calls Campus Forum To Block Severance of SRI
## 
### 
The SRI Coalition last night decided
to call a campus-wide meeting on
Thursday to discuss plans for the
control of the Stanford Research
Institute (SRI).
A statement was issued inviting those
persons who share the following
concerns to attend: "that
chemical-biological warfare (CBW) and
counter-insurgency research be stopped;
that a decision about the relations of
Stanford and SRI be made before the
end of the spring because of the nature
of that work and its effects; that
Stanford exert its control over SRI and
direct its work toward positive social
ends."
Possible positive contributions of
SRI will be discussed, such as urban and
environmental research, and research on
the relation of science to society.
"There will also be discussion of
expansion of the scope of the proposal
beyond CBW and counter-insurgency to
such questions as anti-ballistic missiles

and other dubious weapon systems,"
the statement said.
Alternative Positions
A general vote will be taken at the
Thursday meeting on courses of action.
Position papers on tactical alternatives
are being sought for presentation of
ideas at the meeting, and can be given to
Andrew Smith at the Medical Center.
The call was issued by the following
groups: the United Student Movement,
the United Christian Ministry staff, the
Resistance, Students for a Democratic
Society, the North Santa Clara Peace
and Freedom Movement, Palo Alto
Concerned Citizens, American
Federation of Teachers Local no. 1316,
Canada Spectrum, the Committee for
New Politics, the Junior Faculty Forum,
the New University Conference, the
Peninsula Observer, the Mid-Peninsula
Free University, and the March 4
Convocation.
Positions Circulation
The meeting will take place at 1 p.m.
on Thursday in either Dinklespiel or
Cubberly Auditoriums. Leaflets and
petitions will be circulated by the
Coalition this week.
The idea for this meeting arose, says
the Coalition, from the mood of the
March 1 1 meeting with the Trustees and
a general sense that the student body
desires an open decision-making meeting
on the question of SRI.
The report of the student-faculty
committee studying the relationship
between the University and the
Stanford Research Institute is expected
to be released in two weeks.

Originally due to report March 15th,
the committee asked for, and received,
an extension until April 15th. One of
the major reasons given for the delay
was the press of exams, both on student
and faculty members of the committee.
