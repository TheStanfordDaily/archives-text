## Ray Case Judge Dies 
### 
MEMPHIS, TENN. (AP)-The judge
who presided over the James Earl Ray
case since last summer died of an
apparent heart attack in his chambers
Monday.
Shelby County Criminal Court Judge
VV. Preston Battle, 60, was found
slumped over his desk. He was
pronounced dead on arrival at a
Memphis hospital.
Battle accepted Ray's March 10 plea
of guilty to the murder of Dr. Martin
Luther King Jr., and sentenced Ray to
99 years in the Tennessee state
penitentiary in Nashville.
While Ray entered a guilty plea to
the King slaying, he later said he was
pressured into doing so and would seek
a review of his case.
■ Eisenhower Funeral
WASHINGTON (AP) —Dwight David
Eisenhower, warrior and president, was
committed Monday to the mercy,
protection and peace of God in majestic
state funeral before the mighty men of
American and other lands.

Then, in the simple steel coffin of a
soldier, the body of the man the world
knew as Ike began aboard an ancient
railroad baggage car the long last
journey to a grave on the Prairie of
Kansas.
As the train moved westward across
the Virginia countryside into the Blue
Ridge Mountains crowds stood at the
depots and along rural stretches of
track. Most just watched but, at
Charlottesville, Va., some onlookers
began singing "Battle Hymn of the
Republic."
The splendor of the funeral in the
vaulted grandeur of Washington
National Cathedral, the simpler tribute
of Americans who filed past the
flag-draped coffin in the Rotunda of the
Capitol, and a final procession across
the city to Union State offered the final
farewell of a sorrowing capital.
The three days of rites for the
78-year-old leader who died Friday were
days of military precision, the trembling
salutes of aging comrades in arms, the
Spartan grief of a veiled widow, the
repeated thunder of "Hail to the Chief."
