# Pink Slips Burned
## 27 SDSers Denied Reg 
### FRANK MILLER 
Confronting Dean of Students Joel
Smith in the lobby of the Memorial
Auditorium, students convicted of
disrupting a Trustees meeting last
January attempted yesterday to register
and were denied because they had not
paid half of the fines levied against
them.
After receiving pink hold cards
instead of their registration packet, a
group of the defendants noticed Dean
Smith sitting on the stairs to the
balcony nearby. Led by Fred Cohen
they rushed to Dean Smith. Several
burned their pink hold cards, and Cohen
demanded that Smith answer publicly
why a donation to the Black Panthers
would not substitute for the fines which
were to be paid to the Martin Luther
King Fund as specified by the Judicial
Council.
Dean Smith said that the "Judicial
Council recommended that the fines be
paid to the Martin Luther King Fund"
which uses the funds for scholarships
for black students, and that he was
implementing that decision. Smith
denied that according to the Judicial
Charter any appeal should be made to
the Dean of Students. He indicated that
he was only implementing a

recommendation of the Judicial Council
which President Pitzer decided to
enforce.
Fred Cohen ended his talk with
Smith by addressing the crowd of
students and news reporters. "Maybe
eventually we'll have to appeal to the
students," he said.
The SDS students who had refused
to pay their fines were undecided as to
what to do after they received their
hold cards. They were told that they
could net receive their registration
material until they had paid at least
one-half of their fines, which totaled
$1900, at the student accounts office in
the Old Union. They were looking for a
university official to confront and
found Dean Smith who was watching
the proceedings.
Panther Donation Offer
The group has offered to pay over
$900 to the Black Panther Party instead
of one-half of $1900 to the Martin
Luther King Fund. The administration
has refused this proposal on the basis
that the Judicial Council's
recommended punishment should be
carried out without change.
Marc Weiss, spokesman for the
group, said that according to President
Pitzer the primary purpose for levying
the fines was to punish the students.
Weiss quoted Pitzer as saying, "To let
students choose who the fine would be
paid to would be less of a punishment."
The SDS, according to Weiss, feels
that Stanford's interests are basically
opposed to those of the blacks and
should not control funds for their use.
Since the SDS felt the fines were being
donated to the fund in order to aid
blacks, they decided that funds would
be better donated to the Black Panthers
since the party is directed by the blacks
and identifies more strongly with the
black community. The Martin Luther
King Fund helps only a small number of
blacks and tends to create a black elite
rather than a community.
Weiss continued, "We do recognize
our obligation to help black liberation.
If the administration is really sincere
they should accept this donation in lieu
of that to the Martin Luther King
Fund."
Pitzer Supports Decision
President Pitzer refused to deny or
agree with Weiss's version of their
meeting yesterday but indicated that it
was Weiss's interpretation of what was
said. "They [the defendants) had asked
for reconsideration. ] had written that
the Judicial Council's decision was final.
My decision has been to confirm the
decision of the Council. It is a
reasonable and responsible decision and
I confirmed it."

He indicated that the SDS
defendants could appeal to him but "ar
appeal is possible only on the basis o)
some outright departure from rules
There has been no showing of this."
Pitzer also indicated that he
personally, would not accept th
donation to the Black Panthers. "
would not accept for an entity from
without and not in Stanford."
"The situation is that the case is
closed," concluded President Pitzer.
Plans of The Twenty-Nine
Dean Smith questioned the reasons
behind yesterday's events. "I had talked
to several of the defendants. I had
answered all their questions. They were
not interested in answers. They were
interested in other things."
Weiss, again speaking for the group
said "What the 29 defendants intended
to do is to unite with everyone toward
getting Stanford out of Southeast Asia.
We will continue to attempt to get them
out. Refusal of registration has not
changed this."
Attempting to execute this goal,
Weiss continued, "some of us intend to
make use of resources of the
University." He indicated that some
would attend classes where teachers
were in sympathy or would do nothing
to prevent them from attending.
Dean Smith said that at least 2 of the
original 29 defendants had paid one-half
of their fines and could register.
SDS Not Intimidated
The SDS released the following
formal statement in response to
yesterday's events:
"In our continuing opposition to the
wars in Southeast Asia we have been
forced to recognize that the Trustees of
Stanford have economic involvement in
the prosecution of these wars. We
desired to open the Trustees' meeting of
January 14 to reveal their interest in
continuing war related research in the
university and in their own industries.
"In response to our pressure the
Trustees were forced to expose
Stanford's support of American war
policy at a mass meeting on March 11.
There is burgeoning campus concern
over Stanford's and SRl's research in
counter-insurgency operations in
Southeast Asia, urban ghettos,
chemical-biological warfare, missile
defense systems (ABM) and business
investment surveys in Southeast Asia
and Latin America.
"Today we are not being allowed to
register because of our effectiveness in
exposing Stanford's and the Trustee's
role in the U.S. war efforts. We will not
be intimidated in our efforts to end the
wars in Southeast Asia."

Pitzer also indicated that he

"The situation is that the case is

Plans of The Twenty-Nine
Dean Smith questioned the reasons
behind yesterday's events. "I had talked
to several of the defendants. I had
answered all their questions. They were
not interested in answers. They were
interested in other things."
Weiss, again speaking for the group
said "What the 29 defendants intended
to do is to unite with everyone toward
getting Stanford out of Southeast Asia.
We will continue to attempt to get them
out. Refusal of registration has not
changed this."
Attempting to execute this goal,
Weiss continued, "some of us intend to
make use of resources of the
University." He indicated that some
would attend classes where teachers
were in sympathy or would do nothing
to prevent them from attending.
Dean Smith said that at least 2 of the
original 29 defendants had paid one-half
of their fines and could register.
SDS Not Intimidated
The SDS released the following
formal statement in response to
yesterday's events:
"In our continuing opposition to the
wars in Southeast Asia we have been
forced to recognize that the Trustees of
Stanford have economic involvement in
the prosecution of these wars. We
desired to open the Trustees' meeting of
January 14 to reveal their interest in
continuing war related research in the
university and in their own industries.
"In response to our pressure the
Trustees were forced to expose
Stanford's support of American war
policy at a mass meeting on March 11.
There is burgeoning campus concern
over Stanford's and SRl's research in
counter-insurgency operations in
Southeast Asia, urban ghettos,
chemical-biological warfare, missile
defense systems (ABM) and business
investment surveys in Southeast Asia
and Latin America.
"Today we are not being allowed to
register because of our effectiveness in
exposing Stanford's and the Trustee's
role in the U.S. war efforts. We will not
be intimidated in our efforts to end the
wars in Southeast Asia."
Confronting Dean of Students Joel
Smith in the lobby of the Memorial
Auditorium, students convicted of
disrupting a Trustees meeting last
January attempted yesterday to register
and were denied because they had not
paid half of the fines levied against
them.
After receiving pink hold cards
instead of their registration packet, a
group of the defendants noticed Dean
Smith sitting on the stairs to the
balcony nearby. Led by Fred Cohen
they rushed to Dean Smith. Several
burned their pink hold cards, and Cohen
demanded that Smith answer publicly
why a donation to the Black Panthers
would not substitute for the fines which
were to be paid to the Martin Luther
King Fund as specified by the Judicial
Council.
Dean Smith said that the "Judicial
Council recommended that the fines be
paid to the Martin Luther King Fund"
which uses the funds for scholarships
for black students, and that he was
implementing that decision. Smith
denied that according to the Judicial
Charter any appeal should be made to
the Dean of Students. He indicated that
he was only implementing a

recommendation of the Judicial Council
which President Pitzer decided to
enforce.
Fred Cohen ended his talk with
Smith by addressing the crowd of
students and news reporters. "Maybe
eventually we'll have to appeal to the
students," he said.
The SDS students who had refused
to pay their fines were undecided as to
what to do after they received their
hold cards. They were told that they
could net receive their registration
material until they had paid at least
one-half of their fines, which totaled
$1900, at the student accounts office in
the Old Union. They were looking for a
university official to confront and
found Dean Smith who was watching
the proceedings.
Panther Donation Offer
The group has offered to pay over
$900 to the Black Panther Party instead
of one-half of $1900 to the Martin
Luther King Fund. The administration
has refused this proposal on the basis
that the Judicial Council's
recommended punishment should be
carried out without change.
Marc Weiss, spokesman for the
group, said that according to President
Pitzer the primary purpose for levying
the fines was to punish the students.
Weiss quoted Pitzer as saying, "To let
students choose who the fine would be
paid to would be less of a punishment."
The SDS, according to Weiss, feels
that Stanford's interests are basically
opposed to those of the blacks and
should not control funds for their use.
Since the SDS felt the fines were being
donated to the fund in order to aid
blacks, they decided that funds would
be better donated to the Black Panthers
since the party is directed by the blacks
and identifies more strongly with the
black community. The Martin Luther
King Fund helps only a small number of
blacks and tends to create a black elite
rather than a community.
Weiss continued, "We do recognize
our obligation to help black liberation.
If the administration is really sincere
they should accept this donation in lieu
of that to the Martin Luther King
Fund."
Pitzer Supports Decision
President Pitzer refused to deny or
agree with Weiss's version of their
meeting yesterday but indicated that it
was Weiss's interpretation of what was
said. "They [the defendants) had asked

My decision has been to confirm the
decision of the Council. It is a
reasonable and responsible decision and

Smith by addressing the crowd of
students and news reporters. "Maybe
eventually we'll have to appeal to the
students," he said.
The SDS students who had refused
to pay their fines were undecided as to
what to do after they received their
hold cards. They were told that they
could net receive their registration
material until they had paid at least
one-half of their fines, which totaled
$1900, at the student accounts office in
the Old Union. They were looking for a
university official to confront and
found Dean Smith who was watching
the proceedings.
Panther Donation Offer
The group has offered to pay over
$900 to the Black Panther Party instead
of one-half of $1900 to the Martin
Luther King Fund. The administration
has refused this proposal on the basis
that the Judicial Council's
recommended punishment should be
carried out without change.
Marc Weiss, spokesman for the
group, said that according to President
Pitzer the primary purpose for levying
the fines was to punish the students.
Weiss quoted Pitzer as saying, "To let
students choose who the fine would be
paid to would be less of a punishment."
The SDS, according to Weiss, feels
that Stanford's interests are basically
opposed to those of the blacks and
should not control funds for their use.
Since the SDS felt the fines were being
donated to the fund in order to aid
blacks, they decided that funds would
be better donated to the Black Panthers
since the party is directed by the blacks
and identifies more strongly with the
black community. The Martin Luther
King Fund helps only a small number of
blacks and tends to create a black elite
rather than a community.
Weiss continued, "We do recognize
our obligation to help black liberation.
If the administration is really sincere
they should accept this donation in lieu
of that to the Martin Luther King
Fund."
Pitzer Supports Decision
President Pitzer refused to deny or
agree with Weiss's version of their
meeting yesterday but indicated that it
was Weiss's interpretation of what was
said. "They [the defendants) had asked
for reconsideration. ] had written that
the Judicial Council's decision was final.
My decision has been to confirm the
decision of the Council. It is a
reasonable and responsible decision and
I confirmed it."

He indicated that the SDS
defendants could appeal to him but "ar
appeal is possible only on the basis o)
some outright departure from rules
There has been no showing of this."
Pitzer also indicated that he
personally, would not accept th
donation to the Black Panthers. "
would not accept for an entity from
without and not in Stanford."
"The situation is that the case is
closed," concluded President Pitzer.
Plans of The Twenty-Nine
Dean Smith questioned the reasons
behind yesterday's events. "I had talked
to several of the defendants. I had
answered all their questions. They were
not interested in answers. They were
interested in other things."
Weiss, again speaking for the group
said "What the 29 defendants intended
to do is to unite with everyone toward
getting Stanford out of Southeast Asia.
We will continue to attempt to get them
out. Refusal of registration has not
changed this."
Attempting to execute this goal,
Weiss continued, "some of us intend to
make use of resources of the
University." He indicated that some
would attend classes where teachers
were in sympathy or would do nothing
to prevent them from attending.
Dean Smith said that at least 2 of the
original 29 defendants had paid one-half
of their fines and could register.
SDS Not Intimidated
The SDS released the following
formal statement in response to
yesterday's events:
"In our continuing opposition to the
wars in Southeast Asia we have been
forced to recognize that the Trustees of
Stanford have economic involvement in
the prosecution of these wars. We
desired to open the Trustees' meeting of
January 14 to reveal their interest in
continuing war related research in the
university and in their own industries.
"In response to our pressure the
Trustees were forced to expose
Stanford's support of American war
policy at a mass meeting on March 11.
There is burgeoning campus concern
over Stanford's and SRl's research in
counter-insurgency operations in
Southeast Asia, urban ghettos,
chemical-biological warfare, missile
defense systems (ABM) and business
investment surveys in Southeast Asia
and Latin America.
"Today we are not being allowed to
register because of our effectiveness in
exposing Stanford's and the Trustee's
role in the U.S. war efforts. We will not
be intimidated in our efforts to end the
wars in Southeast Asia."
Confronting Dean of Students Joel
Smith in the lobby of the Memorial
Auditorium, students convicted of
disrupting a Trustees meeting last
January attempted yesterday to register
and were denied because they had not
paid half of the fines levied against
them.
After receiving pink hold cards
instead of their registration packet, a
group of the defendants noticed Dean
Smith sitting on the stairs to the
balcony nearby. Led by Fred Cohen
they rushed to Dean Smith. Several
burned their pink hold cards, and Cohen
demanded that Smith answer publicly
why a donation to the Black Panthers
would not substitute for the fines which
were to be paid to the Martin Luther
King Fund as specified by the Judicial
Council.
Dean Smith said that the "Judicial
Council recommended that the fines be
paid to the Martin Luther King Fund"
which uses the funds for scholarships
for black students, and that he was
implementing that decision. Smith
denied that according to the Judicial
Charter any appeal should be made to
the Dean of Students. He indicated that
he was only implementing a

recommendation of the Judicial Council
which President Pitzer decided to
enforce.

Smith by addressing the crowd of
