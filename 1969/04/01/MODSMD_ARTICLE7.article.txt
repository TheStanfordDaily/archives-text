# Missile Hassle
## 
### 
The installation of a Minuteman missile
system on Stanford land is in itself a
reprehensible act, but the fact that it was
done without the knowledge of the
University administration makes it almost
obscene.
On top of this comes the discovery that
the government plans further military
incursions into the groves of academe with
the new safeguard anti-ballistic missile
(ABM), now scheduled to be installed here
as protection for its sister weapon as well as
the Bay Area military-industrial complex.
The Minuteman may be billed as an
offensive weapon and the safeguard as a
purely defensive one, but both missiles are
completely offensive to the entire
community which surrounds their sites.
Both their presence and the underhanded
means by which the Minuteman missiles
have been installed represent a new low for
the United States government—an
organization which has long experience at
plumbing the depths of morality.
While University administrators have
tacitly defended Stanford's participation in

classified military research for the
government by their silence—although at
the same time expressing personal
opposition to America's military forays in
Southeast Asia-we do not believe they can
stand idly by in this instance. The
government's blatant disregard for public
opinion in favor of what they-and they
alone-believe to be the best interests of
the Establishment cannot be allowed to
continue.
We urge President Pitzer to vigorously
fight for the removal of the Minuteman
missiles which have already been emplaced
and oppose further missile installations on
University property. It would be the
ultimate insult to have an ABM system at
Stanford, where the majority of the
community opposes the development of
such weaponry anywhere.
The University's ties to the
military-industrial complex have long been
explored and deplored, but this latest
violation of the academic environment is
beyond the realm of sanity.
