## Stanford Apathy 
### 
Editor, THE DAILY:
I should like to congratulate
The Daily and the entire Stanford
community on its apathy and lack
of concern for American society.
It never ceases to amaze me how
self-centered and insensible the
students and faculty can be in the
face of our present social crises.
Except for an extreme concern
with Viet Nam (and the fear of
the draft) and with student
power, student and faculty efforts
are fully turned towards the
advancement of their own
resources and pleasures. I doubt
that the cause lies in an inability
to coordinate the "gigantic"
number of projects formed for the
benefit of the community (East
Palo Alto, San Francisco, the
Negroes, the Mexican-Americans,
etc.) or to combat poverty,
racism, insufficient medical care,
and the urban crisis. In fact, the
number of efforts being made by
this university to use its funds and
personnel to combat social ills
even in areas less than a mile away
are almost null. The Stanford
community lives in a world of its
own, unconcerned with problems
which, seemingly, have no direct
affect of it: it is a true "ivory
tower."
I suppose it is somewhat naive
of me to expect the sons and
daughters of the wealthiest class
of this society to concern
themselves with poverty and
medical care except through
textbooks and petty
actions ... or even through the
highly lauded method of
exhibiting one's sympathy
(nothing else) for the less
fortunate. So return to your
stereos, your cars, your week-ends
in San Francisco, your discussions
of your "oh, so difficult" mental
problems and of the ideal this or
the ideal that—enjoy your wealth
for why, in fact, should you give a
damn about anyone but yourself?

•New Myths ?
Editor, THE DAILY:
During March sth's SDS rally,
Professor Bruce Franklin said that
the Stanford Music Department
taught the music of the rulling
class and gave Mozart as an
example. Mozart has never been
the musical preference of the
political or economic rullers of
this country. Rather, with the
exception of Thomas Jefferson,
their tastes have ranged from
army songs to Stephen Foster,
from folk ballads to Lerner and

Lowe. Of course, now and then a
First Lady tries to impress a
foreign dignitary by inviting
Leontyne Price to sing a little
Verdi after dinner or VanCliburn
to display his manual dexterity.
But let's be realistic; were he alive
today, Andrew Jackson would dig
Dylan more than Mozart. And
don't worry, even without a
second American Revolution, our
future rullers will groove to
Dylan, Aretha and the Stones
because ordinary men with
popular tastes rule America.
Actually, I'm not sure whether
Mr. Franklin was saying
something about America's
rullers, Mozart or the Stanford
Music Department. If what he
meant to say was that Stanford
should teach more Music
Ethnology, then I agree. But since
neither he nor I are Stanford
students, I don't think our
opinion is relevant.
Perhaps you're wondering why
I bother to object to one bit of
absurdity in Mr. Franklin's
basically sound speech. Well
someone has to keep the old
myths about American History
from being replaced by new
myths and someone has to keep
the snobs who look down on one
kind of music because it is
undisciplined from being replaced
by new snobs who look down on
another type of music because it
is not popular (people's)
music as if there should ever
be one style of music or literature
or humanbeing entitled to a
monopoly on man's favor.
Anyhow, I enjoy Mozart and Ella
Fitzgerald and sunshine and
beagle dogs and come the
revolution I don't want these
things put down because they
were the tastes of the old order.
Now someone is telling me that
the real issue is the oppressed
millions all over the world. Well
baby, I didn't start this nonsense
about Mozart and the rulling class.
