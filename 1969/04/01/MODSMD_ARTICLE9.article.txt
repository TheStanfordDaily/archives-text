# Conspiracy Of One
## Ike And Paranoid US Pride 
### Daniel Snell 
This weekend, watching the
newscasters with glum looks on
their young faces recount the
career of General Dwight
Eisenhower, I think I perceived
something about his relation to
his country.
For in at least one way the
General and America were very
similar. They became aware of
and involved in the affairs of
other nations at much the same
time and in much the same way.
Eisenhower did not get to
participate in the battles of World
War I, but instead he studied tank
warfare and established a name
for himself that got him selected
later to a staff position in the
Army.
For America World War I had
somehow been rather much of a
mistake. We had helped win, but
it was the old nations playing the
same old games. Tyranny was
crushed, but tyranny was very like
what crushed it.
Talent For Disarming
But with the coming of the
Second War, caused by our
incompetence in not settling the
first, Eisenhower's talent for
disarming people, for making
them want to work together,
brought him to the fore. And of
course a similar talent, as well as
an essential supply of war
materiel, also made the United
States more important than she
had ever been.
And the nation with her Allies
were going to irradicate the evil
that was "Hitlerism," as General
Eisenhower later termed it.
Almost everyone in the world
agreed that it was bad and that to
irradicate it was good. So we all

could be the fine shining knights
of the Apocalypse. And
Eisenhower could lead us.
It was later the hope that this
same man could get us out of
Korea by his skill and wisdom,
could make simple again a
complex situation. Although
Eisenhower did succeed in halting
that conflict, he was still in a
world of complexities.
History
He had failed to learn the
lesson of the history of
democratization, that it is very
dangerous for any nation or group
to try to determine the fate of
another.
But of course Eisenhower was
not given to realizations of this
sort.. His talent was disarming
people and listening to his
advisers, his businessmen friends
and his almost-statesmen who
burrowed the nation into
Southeast Asia and made us the
guardians of the morals of
Europe, though not of Hungary in
1956.
There was something more in
Eisenhower's character, and also
in the character of his nation, that
brought him to the position of
power. That something seems
most evident in Eisenhower's
decision to run for a second term
in 1956 after he had suffered two
attacks of various sorts and was
not in the best of health. Perhaps
it was a pride in his skill, a pride
perceived as duty. And a pride
nurtured by the response of his
followers and the advice of his
advisers —not the least among
whom was the young
Congressman with the funny nose

who now calls himself President.
Pride In Self
His nation had pride in itself,
that its citizens could produce
what other people could not. That
its citizens could maintain the
peace almost anywhere.
This pride for Eisenhower and
for the United States was built
not just on the enormous
accomplishment of conquering
Europe during World War II and
then proceding to rebuild same.
The pride thrived because it was
charmingly paranoid, essentially
unsure of itself on the world
stage. But the memory of the
motivated paranoia of the war
years made the unmotivated fears
attractive.
A pride, in other words, that
wanted missiles instead of
international disarmament and
bombers instead of
self-determination by distant
"uncivilized" peoples.
And though he strangely
warned the nation in his farewell
address about the
military-industrial complex that
might in the future gain more
power that was good for it, all his
life he gave himself to be the tool
of that complex. And his mindless
support of the war in Vietnam
shows him not to have understood
that what he spoke in that speech
was already happening.
Disarming Smile
But what could he and his
country have done otherwise?
They blundered onto the bloody
international scene, with material
might and a disarming smile.
Called upon to lead, they failed to
see that desiring freedom for

others demands selflessness from
the powerful.
But let us not be too quick to
condemn: Eisenhower did disarm
the people he worked with, and
he made his countrymen feel
proud to have him lead. He could
not say twelve words without
stumbling twice, but he did it in a
good-natured way.
And if he was overly proud, he
hid it well.
In his last days old and kind,
he was essentially American. If we
can love him—which I at least
can—because he thought he was
just, we can also pity outselves
because we must live in the world
he helped to make.
The desire for simplicity and
the paranoia Eisenhower
represents remain with us, though.
And we must work toward an
un-Eisenhower mentality if this
nation is ever to be just.
