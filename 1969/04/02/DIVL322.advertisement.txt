IS THIS YOU
I am opposed to the Viet Nam War (and any such war that is not based upon de
fense of our country). Please send me application to the Ministry of your church, as
well as information as to its beliefs and membership throughout the world.
It is my understanding that if I am accepted to the ministry of your church, I can
not conscientiously participate in any military involvement not directly concerned
with the defense of our country or its possessions. I further understand that train
ing will not interfere with my normal work or academic schedule, and I can choose
my own location of service to God and hmanity.
Enclosed is $1.00 to cover clerical expenses and cost of mailing.
