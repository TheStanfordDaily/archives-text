Ph.D:s at IBM
"The diversity
helps you
keep up to date!'
"At iBM you're constantly working with people in
a lot of different fields." says Gary Kozak.
A Ph.D. in analytical-physical chemistry, Gary's an
IBM Development Chemist and Project Manager. "The
diversity helps you keep up to date." he says. "You
find out what's new in fields that affect your specialty,
and you get a batter idea of where you fit into the total
picture."
Gary describes how people with different back
used in our System/350 computers:
A ||l An E.E. tells you how many conductors you'll have,
A II where they go. and what should be at the terminals.
An M.E. designs fixturing and automatic processes.
A polymer chemist formulates insulators and says how
mam they should be used. The metallurgist specifies alloy
compositions. The physicist decides how to optimize
Jv a process for producing transistors and diodes. And
mm all these people have to talk with each other and help
-% JW each other."
