That's the key word this year at the Daily. We have a new flag, a new look on the
front page (six columns inste ad of seven), new columnists, new cartoonists,
new logotypes, and even a new way of setting the copy. But the one new
thing that we still need is new people. The Daily is always long on
ideas and short on sta iff, and this year is no exception. So help us
.
innovate â€” join the Daily. We need your brainstorms, but,
more important, > /ve need you. There will be an orien
tation meeting for new staffers Friday, April 4, at
4 p.m. in th e Daily office, Lomita Drive be
tween Par lama and Santa Teresa. If you
can't it then, call us at x 4632
and v /e'll contact you. Try some
thing new.
