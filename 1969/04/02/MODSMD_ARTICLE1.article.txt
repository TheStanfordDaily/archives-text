# April Fool Story Fools Stanford

"I just saw some trucks going up into
the hills. I think they're going to take
the missiles out," declared an excited
professor from the Food Research
Institute.
"I'm sorry, sir, but the story was an
April Fool's joke. There are no
missiles," a harried Daily news editor
responded.
Eventually, the overwrought
gentleman was convinced that there
were no Minuteman missiles in the
foothills above Stanford, but not until
considerable effort was expended on the
task.
He was not alone in his fear
yesterday. The major part of the
Stanford community spent at least part
of the day believing an important
segment of the United States' military
arsenal was located on Stanford land.
More than 90 students and faculty
called The Daily office yesterday trying
to confirm the validity of the lead story
in Tuesday morning's paper.
When they were told it was only a
joke, some laughed, some were angry,
and some heaved a sign of relief.
"Thank God," one woman said. "I was
ready to pack my bags and leave
California."
The news media jumped into action
when they first got wind of the story.
The Palo Alto Times city room was in a
state of mild chaos early in the morning.
They woke up Daily editor Phil
Taubman with a 7 a.m. phone call, but
their distress became laughter when
they were told the truth.
The San Francisco Chronicle checked
in shortly after 9 a.m., followed by the
San Francisco Examiner. The latter had
already called the Pentagon, where Air
Force spokesmen rightly branded the
story a hoax.
Robert W. Beyers, director of the
Stanford News Service, called The Daily
after the Associated Press contacted
him. "I told them it sounded like a
well-done spoof, but I wanted to make
sure," he said.
The only representative of the news
media who was angry about the hoax
was KNXT-TV in Los Angeles. They
had received a call informing them of

the story and sent out a crew to fly up
here before calling The Daily for
confirmation. It was never learned
whether they were able to stop their
crew before they boarded the aircraft.
Later in the day, United Press
International's New York office called,
and spread the story of the hoax on
their national wire.
Meanwhile, The Daily itself was
victimized by several pranksters. One
called the office saying there was a
person-to-person call for the editor from
a "John Q. Howell, legal counsel for
David Packard," deputy secretary of
defense. Editor Taubman wasn't in, so
"Mr. Howell" left his number. When
Taubman called the Pentagon later, he
found that John Q. Howell was as
ficticious as Stanford's Minuteman
missiles.
Late in the afternoon, another
long-distance (supposedly) call came in
for the editor. A woman was speaking,
and the telephone operators could bq
heard in the background.
"This is the White House," she said.
"I have a person-to-person call for Mr.
Philip Taubman from Richard Allen,"
the Nixon adviser and former Hoover
Institution researcher who was
"quoted" in The Daily story.
Again the editor was fortuitously
absent, and the woman said Mr. Allen
would call back shortly. He never did.
On campus, confusion reigned. Tn an
early morning ROTC class, discussion of
the article raged. The captain teaching
the class checked a topographic map of
the area to find out what was located
where the "bunker" was supposed to
be.
"It's a water reservoir," he said. "At
least I think it's a water reservoir."
He was right.
The "bunker," as noted above, is
actually an underground reservoir. The
radar shown is part of the radio
astronomy division's set-up on Alpine
Roadâ€”and actually is the type of radar
used in ABM guidance. The gate and
warning signs are at a back entrance to
the large radio telescope (the "Big
Dish") near Alpine House, the old
infirmary.


CONFRONTATION-Some people took yesterday's April Fool story in the DAILY too
seriously. Here, one overzealous antimilitarist is prevented from attacking the "Minuteman
bunker" (actually a water reservoir) by an equally excited ROTC cadet.
