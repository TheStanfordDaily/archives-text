Keep Flag At Half Mast

Editor, THE DAILY:
It was a day not terribly differ
ent from many others, in fact it
wouldn't have stood out
*at all if it hadn't been for regis
tration, a sign of beginning and
tending all neatly stuffed* in a drab
Cresting place of 3"x6" over
worked manilla. Then later in the
! day, sitting at a desk trying to
write to (for?) the draft board,
the sinking down feeling came it
ijwas time to get up and do some
thing, maybe even something con
structive. So it's off to the book
'store and then to the post office
tor everyone knows books are
! constructive and stamps to be able
to convey thoughts to friends are
'constructive too . . .well sort of.
But then you walk to the plaza
;and notice that on the staff the
! flag has slipped down and the day
stands out a bit more, and later
you find the post office itself is
closed and this time the day
stands out in stale red letters
"DEATH". But not a terribly un
usual death at that, in fact the
! death of one who's time had come
and was perhaps even overdue.
But then again he was a President,
and he was a general, many people
say even a great general, although
what a great general is I am not
sure I know.

And so the flag flies at half
mast and the post office closes.
But many have died and (damn
it!) will die and these not of
natural causes, but simply because
others have deemed their deaths
necessary. True they are not
nearly as well known as presidents
and their deaths may seem as
ripples to a wave, but when
ripples continue to come one
upon another it is hard to tell
them from the mightiest of waves.
And so I ask (and yes, maybe
even plead) do not raise the flag
but let it remain; let it hand in
sorrow and let it hang in shame.
Let it hang as a remembrance
while the deaths continue. Let it
hang until people can longer toler
ate viewing the war deaths of
others as necessary.
And if not perhaps we shall
hang in its stead.

• A Bomb ?
Editor, THE DAILY:
Your lead story and editorial

yesterday was a real bomb . . .
pardon me, it was a real gas. As all
young moderates know, life is
only a joke. It certainly is wonder
ful to know we have all adjusted
to the concept of mega-death.
However, I'm slightly saddened
that you didn't also rerun your
editorial from last quarter on
David Packard's departure from
the Board of Trustees. If I remem
ber correctly, you called the most
liberal member of the board and
wis! Ed him well in Washington.
He toe has adjusted well.

• Originality ?
You J re Strangely Calm. Calm
because you don't really believe in
your own mortality. Calm because
of a sense of inevitability. You've
slowed to a few miles an hour,
and the other car has stopped.
The ice is solid: the steering wheel
has no effect whatever. You see
the driver in the other car,
swearing at you. And just before
the collision, you burst out
laughing.
You're an engineering student,
doing your homework. Problem 5.
Turn the crank. Problem 7. No
trouble. Problem 11. A little
harder. A little thinking involved
with this one. And then you come
to Problem 12. There's a

straightforward way to solve this
problem. There has to be.
Textbook problems are always
that way. But it's going to have to
be blind plugging into a
formula. No intuition about this
solution. Unless . . .suppose you
form the dual . . .and arrive at the
complement . . .and
then . . .hmmm . . .
G R E ATBE AUTIFULSUPER
FANTASM AGORIC AL ! It works!
Roundabout, but intuitive and
simple at every step. You bound
around the room till the
excitement dies down, then write
it up and hand it in, feeling proud
of your cleverness.
And it comes back, scrawled
across with YOU ARE NOT
SUPPOSED TO DO THIS.
You're strangely calm .. .a
University . . .original thought
rewarded and encouraged . . .and
you burst out laughing.
Because if you didn't, you'd
have to cry.

Though shaken, you're still
alive. It's true—it really is
true—you are immortal after all.
Except for once in a while.
But one of those rare spurts of
mortality is going to kill you some
day.

• SRI Research
Editor, THE DAILY:
Okay. So even after the dormi
tory discussions, the Old Union
rally, and the open forum of
March 11 (where Trustee Hewlett
admitted that his policy for Stan
ford would be that of the U.S.
government), you're still turned
off by SDS tactics. Come to the
April 3 open meeting and make
the decision on how to stop Stan
ford's nvolvement in the South
east Asia killing, yourself.
A lot of people whom I've
talked to about the nine demands
were against the research but
thought it was unreasonable to de
mand the resignations of some
trustees. We can talk about that
also.
We want to get Stanford out of
Southeast Asia. I don't care if you
do it by dancing naked around
Hoover Tower three times with
chicken bones in your teeth. Just
get it done. Just help us get it
done. April 3.

• Joke Childish
Editor, THE DAILY:
You're supposed to be an offi
cial paper, and I don't regard your
April fool's front page story of
the Minuteman System which was
uncovered in the foothlls as very
humorous. I consider it childish.
This paper is representative of
the entire Stanford student body.
We can laugh about this article on
campus, but it will go beyond this
community as it is sent to Alumni
across the nation. Your subject
was just too serious a thing with
which to play around.
