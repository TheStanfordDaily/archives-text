## Breakthrough In Air Travel 
### Art Buchwald 
WASHI N G T O N-I am
constantly amazed how the
airlines are solving their problems.
Everyone is aware that one of the
big stumbling blocks to future air
transportation is airport facilities.
No airport in the country is
prepared to handle the new air
buses carrying 400 passengers that
will soon be put into service.
I was under the impression that
no one was working on the crisis,
but I was wrong. The airlines and

airports together are solving th.
problem in one of the most
unconventional ways that human
engineers have ever devised.
They're making people walk to
their destinations.
As the airports get larger, they
keep extending their terminals,
and the gates to the aircraft keep
getting further away.
I discovered the consequence
of this the other day when I had
to catch a plane in Chicago for

Davenport, lowa. I started
walking toward my gate, then
realizing I had only an hour to
make it, I started jogging. A few
miles later I discovered I still
wasn't anywhere near the gate, so
I started sprinting. But because I
was carrying a brief case, I just
didn't have the spurt I needed for
the last few miles, and I missed
my plane.
The airline ticket attendant
was very sympathetic and said to

me, "Why don't you walk to
Davenport? It's only a few more
miles down the road."
"Only a few more miles down
the road?"
"Yes, we don't like to talk
about it, because we naturally
want people to fly, but more of
our airline terminals have been
spreading out so far that out
departure gates are located only a
few miles from where people are
going. If you look out the
window, you can see the lights of
Davenport right over there."
"That's amazing," I said. "I
knew I had gone pretty far, but I
didn't think I was anywhere near
Davenport."
"Most people don't," the
ticket attendant said. "But, you
see, we have to keep extending
the wings of the terminal to
handle the traffic and so the cities
get nearer and nearer. Someday
we hope to link the Davenport
and Chicago airports so passengers
can walk between the two of
them without getting wet. It
certainly will solve the pressing,
airport traffic problems."
I thought Chicago was the only
airport doing this, but not long
ago I was out in Los Angeles and
had to make a plane for Santa
Barbara. When I was given my
gate number for the flight, I
started for it. And you can
imagine my delight and surprise
when I discovered that by the
time I got there I was only five
miles from the Santa Barbara city
limits.
Then last week, I was in Miami
and had to fly to Tampa. As I
walked through the terminal to
my gate, I stopped off for lunch
at the Palm Beach Airport snack
bar, and then continued straight
on to find my plane was parked at
a gate number just beyond
Orlando.
I found out that every major
airport in the country is now
working on tunnels and ramps
which will eventually hook up
with airports in other cities. It's
the first breakthrough in airline
congestion.

bar, and then continued straight
on to find my plane was parked at
a gate number just beyond
Orlando.
I found out that every major
airport in the country is now
working on tunnels and ramps
which will eventually hook up
with airports in other cities. It's
the first breakthrough in airline
congestion.
WASHI N G T O N-I am
constantly amazed how the
airlines are solving their problems.
Everyone is aware that one of the
big stumbling blocks to future air
transportation is airport facilities.
No airport in the country is
prepared to handle the new air
buses carrying 400 passengers that
will soon be put into service.
I was under the impression that
no one was working on the crisis,
but I was wrong. The airlines and

airports together are solving th.
problem in one of the most
unconventional ways that human
engineers have ever devised.
They're making people walk to
their destinations.
As the airports get larger, they
keep extending their terminals,
and the gates to the aircraft keep
getting further away.
I discovered the consequence
of this the other day when I had
to catch a plane in Chicago for

Davenport, lowa. I started
walking toward my gate, then
realizing I had only an hour to
make it, I started jogging. A few
miles later I discovered I still
wasn't anywhere near the gate, so
I started sprinting. But because I
was carrying a brief case, I just
didn't have the spurt I needed for
the last few miles, and I missed
my plane.
The airline ticket attendant
was very sympathetic and said to

me, "Why don't you walk to
Davenport? It's only a few more
miles down the road."
"Only a few more miles down
the road?"
"Yes, we don't like to talk
about it, because we naturally
want people to fly, but more of
our airline terminals have been
spreading out so far that out
departure gates are located only a
few miles from where people are
going. If you look out the
window, you can see the lights of
Davenport right over there."
"That's amazing," I said. "I
knew I had gone pretty far, but I
didn't think I was anywhere near
Davenport."
"Most people don't," the
ticket attendant said. "But, you
see, we have to keep extending
the wings of the terminal to
handle the traffic and so the cities
get nearer and nearer. Someday
we hope to link the Davenport
and Chicago airports so passengers
can walk between the two of
them without getting wet. It
certainly will solve the pressing,
airport traffic problems."
I thought Chicago was the only
airport doing this, but not long
ago I was out in Los Angeles and
had to make a plane for Santa
Barbara. When I was given my
gate number for the flight, I
started for it. And you can
imagine my delight and surprise
when I discovered that by the
time I got there I was only five
miles from the Santa Barbara city
limits.
Then last week, I was in Miami
and had to fly to Tampa. As I
walked through the terminal to
my gate, I stopped off for lunch
at the Palm Beach Airport snack
bar, and then continued straight
on to find my plane was parked at
a gate number just beyond
Orlando.
