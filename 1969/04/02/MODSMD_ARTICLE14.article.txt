## Best Of Calendars 
### John Cody 
Many students I have talked to
oppose the SES-proposed
semester system because it does
not—leave a free Christmas
vacation and because it does not
allow sufficient "sampling" of
courses.
I wish to propose a semester
system that alleviates these
problems but which retains the
good aspects of semesters, namely
a more relaxed pace and a chance
to explore course material in
greater depth. The disadvantages
of a quarter system are very
real - hurried pace and lack of
time for a meaningful reading
period.
I propose the following
academic calendar: Two 12 week

semesters running from
September 13 to December 9 and
February 12 to May 20, with a
—oae—week —yae&iiefr -during the
spring. Dead week and exam week
would extend the fall term to
Devember 20 and the spring term
to May 31. Between January 8
and February 12 I propose a
5-week reading period.
The Following full courses
might be structured:
1) 13 weeks ending with dead
week and exam week
2) The above in fall term with
an extension into reading period
for special projects.
3) Individual projects in
reading period followed by a 13
week course during spring term.
Examinations would be utterly
excluded from reading period.
Exam free, 5 week half or
intensive full courses could be
scheduled during reading period,

alleviating student complaints that
"sampling" is inhibited by a
semester system. The main
emphasis during reading period,
however, would be individual
study, field work, or other
projects which might not fit a
long term structure. Faculty
would be generally free from
lecture committments and could
join students in special projects or
field trips.
An alternate suggestion is that
we abandon the Christmas
holidays and replace them with a
vacation free from materialistic
Christmas trappngs, at some time
to be decided by the community.
I will support either of the
above suggestions in Education
Council meetings if there is
sufficient expression of student
interest.
