A Stanford researcher suggests
two means of strengthening
graduate educationâ€”encouraging
prospective Ph.D.'s in classroom
instruction of undergraduates and
providing them more open,
explicit information on future job
opportunities.
Joseph Katz, executive director
of the Institute for the Study of
Human Problems, notes that the
campus life of graduate students
in many respects is more
restricted than that of
undergraduates.
Many students start graduate
work with no clear commitment.
They quickly discover that their
field is criss-crossed by an array of
conceptual camps.
"The student cannot easily risk
offending some of his professors
by advocating a position not in
conformity with the theoretical or
methodological 'party line'," Katz
notes.
"In the life of the graduate
department, minor differences are
often elevated into major
theoretical heresies, calling forth
all the passion that men expend
upon the dissident."
Graduate school usually brings
an end to studies fostering the
general cultivation of the mind,
Katz adds. "The student discovers
his department wants all of him.
"Invisible Berlin walls separate
one department from the other.

Intellectual and even social
interchange of students from
different departments often is
minimal . . .
"Many graduate students
perform their teaching of
undergraduates with disinterest,
and in this way they are often
supported by their department's
implicit disregard of teaching.
"The disregard of
undergraduate teaching is not
only a dis-service to the student in
his future role as professor, it also
cuts him off from one source of
emotional and intellectual supply
that could vivify and make more
human his passage through
graduate school."
When it comes to getting a job,
the graduate student discovers
that placement "is almost entirely
dependent upon the academic
grapevine and the chain of
friendships and connections,"
Katz relates. "Hence the
cultivation of the right professor
with the right connections is very
important. This breeds
opportunism." He suggests these
corrective measures:
-Encouraging both
independent and inter-disciplinary
research projects;
-Involving students from the
very beginning in planning
graduate-level curriculum; and
-Discussing job possibilities,
personal motivations and
aspirations more openly.
