# Spring Reg 9674
## 
### 
First-day registration for spring
quarter at Stanford this year
totaled 9,674—a drop of 158 from
the same time a year ago,
Registrar Harvey Hall reported
yesterday.
Enrollment of graduate men
sLill trails last year's figures by
more than 300 —continuing a
pattern which became apparent
last quarter. Enrollment of
women students has increased by
nearly 150 compared to a year
ago, mainly among
undergraduates.
Hall predicted final spring
quarter enrollment will reach
about 10,600, compared to
10,946 last year.
According to William Leland,
senior counselor for special
services, only 20 to 30 graduate
students have been drafted at
Stanford so far this year.

Several who completed their
master's degrees may not have
continued their studies toward a
Ph.D. because of the draft, while
others may have dropped out for
fear they could not complete the
quarter for military reasons.
Most graduate men now
enrolled probably will be able to
complete the quarter, even if they
receive induction notices, Leland
believes.
So far, about 115 graduate
men have received induction
notices. Some have left the
University, while others have had
their induction postponed until
June.
In January, Leland estimated
that about 400 men would receive
induction notices before the end
of the academic year. This figure
may prove a little high, he now
believes.
