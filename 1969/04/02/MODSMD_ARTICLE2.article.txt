BOSTON (AP)—A federal judge ruled
Tuesday the 1967 Military Selective
Service Act violates the Constitution by
granting to conscientious objectors
exemption on religious grounds but not
granting exemption to genuine objectors
among atheists or agnostics.
U.S. District Judge Charles E.
Wyzanski suggested the case of John H.
Sisson Jr., 23, of Lincoln, Mass., go to
the U.S. Supreme Court and he granted
a motion of "arrested judgment" for
Sisson pending a final ruling.
Sisson was convicted by a federal
jury of refusing induction because of his
claim the Vietnam war was illegal and
immoral.
Judge Wyzanski stressed in a 21-page
finding that he was not ruling on those
claims, but only on whether Sisson had
a right to claim exemption as a
conscientious objector.
Sub Missile System
WASHINGTON (AP)-The Navy,
which has started to convert its Polaris
submarines with multiwarhead Poseidon
missiles, told Congress Tuesday of plans
to develop a new multibillion dollar,
longer range submarine missile system in
the late 19705.
Secretary of the Navy John H.
Chafee echoed warnings of Soviet sea
power given the Senate Armed Services
Committee last month by Secretary of
Defense Melvin R. Laird, declaring:
"It is quite clear that the Soviet Navy
present a serious and growing threat to
our continued supremacy on the seas.
"Over the years," Chafee said, "the
Soviet strategic threat to the United
States has grown more rapidly than
expected, both in quality and in
number."
He commented that the Soviets
"might well mount an extensive
antisubmarine warfare effort" against
U.S. nuclear naval power and added:
"In preparation for such Soviet efforts,
we are examining a longer-range
submarine launched missile system."
Chafee said the system planned for
introduction in the late 19705, is called
the "Undersea Long Range Missile
System and, "The ULMS submarines
would reach be armed with a large
number of ballistic missiles."
Sir hail Trial
LOS ANGELES (AP)—Sirhan Bishara
Sirhan leaped to his feet in a
table-pounding rage Tuesday after a
state witness suggested he faked amnesia
to mask premeditation in Ihe
assassination of Sen. Robert F.
Kennedy.
"He wanted very much to kill
Kennedy . . .Sirhan at no time expected
to be a martyr," said Dr. Seymour
Pollack, the state's star psychiatric
witness at the first-degree murder trial

of the 25-year-old, Jordanian-born Arab.
Pollack rejected defense claims that
Sirhan was in a psychotic state and not
meaningfully and maturely responsible
when he shot Kennedy June 5, 1968,
while the senator was campaigning for
the Democratic presidential nomination.
The psychiatrist's testimony
apparently found favor with the
defendant at first. He consistently has
grown angry when described as mentally
ill, although he has testified he does not
remember shooting Kennedy.
Sirhan also has said he doesn't
remember writing "RFK must die"
repeatedly in his private notebooks
before the assassination. It was by
dismissing this claim that Pollack
inadvertently triggered Sirhan's
outburst.
"You settle down or I'll do what I
told you I'd do," Superior Court Judge
Herbert V. Walker warned Sirhan.
A previous outburst in the 12-week
trial led the judge to threaten to have
Sirhan bound and gagged in the
courtroom.

Tuesday the 1967 Military Selective

granting to conscientious objectors
exemption on religious grounds but not
granting exemption to genuine objectors
among atheists or agnostics.
U.S. District Judge Charles E.
Wyzanski suggested the case of John H.
Sisson Jr., 23, of Lincoln, Mass., go to

immoral.
Judge Wyzanski stressed in a 21-page

claims, but only on whether Sisson had
a right to claim exemption as a
conscientious objector.
Sub Missile System
WASHINGTON (AP)-The Navy,
which has started to convert its Polaris
submarines with multiwarhead Poseidon
missiles, told Congress Tuesday of plans
to develop a new multibillion dollar,
longer range submarine missile system in
the late 19705.
Secretary of the Navy John H.
Chafee echoed warnings of Soviet sea
power given the Senate Armed Services
Committee last month by Secretary of
Defense Melvin R. Laird, declaring:
"It is quite clear that the Soviet Navy
present a serious and growing threat to
our continued supremacy on the seas.
"Over the years," Chafee said, "the
Soviet strategic threat to the United
States has grown more rapidly than
expected, both in quality and in
number."
He commented that the Soviets
"might well mount an extensive
antisubmarine warfare effort" against
U.S. nuclear naval power and added:
"In preparation for such Soviet efforts,
we are examining a longer-range
submarine launched missile system."
Chafee said the system planned for
introduction in the late 19705, is called
the "Undersea Long Range Missile
System and, "The ULMS submarines
would reach be armed with a large
number of ballistic missiles."
Sir hail Trial
LOS ANGELES (AP)—Sirhan Bishara
Sirhan leaped to his feet in a
table-pounding rage Tuesday after a
state witness suggested he faked amnesia
to mask premeditation in Ihe
assassination of Sen. Robert F.
Kennedy.
"He wanted very much to kill
Kennedy . . .Sirhan at no time expected
to be a martyr," said Dr. Seymour
Pollack, the state's star psychiatric
witness at the first-degree murder trial

of the 25-year-old, Jordanian-born Arab.
Pollack rejected defense claims that
Sirhan was in a psychotic state and not
meaningfully and maturely responsible
when he shot Kennedy June 5, 1968,
while the senator was campaigning for
the Democratic presidential nomination.
The psychiatrist's testimony
apparently found favor with the
defendant at first. He consistently has
grown angry when described as mentally
ill, although he has testified he does not
remember shooting Kennedy.
Sirhan also has said he doesn't
remember writing "RFK must die"
repeatedly in his private notebooks
before the assassination. It was by
dismissing this claim that Pollack
inadvertently triggered Sirhan's
outburst.
"You settle down or I'll do what I
told you I'd do," Superior Court Judge
Herbert V. Walker warned Sirhan.
A previous outburst in the 12-week
trial led the judge to threaten to have
Sirhan bound and gagged in the
courtroom.

BOSTON (AP)—A federal judge ruled
Tuesday the 1967 Military Selective
Service Act violates the Constitution by
granting to conscientious objectors
exemption on religious grounds but not
granting exemption to genuine objectors
among atheists or agnostics.
U.S. District Judge Charles E.
Wyzanski suggested the case of John H.
Sisson Jr., 23, of Lincoln, Mass., go to
the U.S. Supreme Court and he granted
a motion of "arrested judgment" for
Sisson pending a final ruling.
Sisson was convicted by a federal
jury of refusing induction because of his
claim the Vietnam war was illegal and
immoral.
Judge Wyzanski stressed in a 21-page
finding that he was not ruling on those
claims, but only on whether Sisson had
a right to claim exemption as a
conscientious objector.
Sub Missile System
WASHINGTON (AP)-The Navy,
which has started to convert its Polaris
submarines with multiwarhead Poseidon
missiles, told Congress Tuesday of plans
to develop a new multibillion dollar,
longer range submarine missile system in
the late 19705.
Secretary of the Navy John H.
Chafee echoed warnings of Soviet sea
power given the Senate Armed Services
Committee last month by Secretary of
Defense Melvin R. Laird, declaring:
"It is quite clear that the Soviet Navy
present a serious and growing threat to
our continued supremacy on the seas.
"Over the years," Chafee said, "the
Soviet strategic threat to the United
States has grown more rapidly than
expected, both in quality and in
number."
He commented that the Soviets
"might well mount an extensive
antisubmarine warfare effort" against
U.S. nuclear naval power and added:
"In preparation for such Soviet efforts,
we are examining a longer-range
submarine launched missile system."
Chafee said the system planned for
introduction in the late 19705, is called
the "Undersea Long Range Missile
System and, "The ULMS submarines
would reach be armed with a large
number of ballistic missiles."
Sir hail Trial
LOS ANGELES (AP)—Sirhan Bishara
Sirhan leaped to his feet in a
table-pounding rage Tuesday after a
state witness suggested he faked amnesia
to mask premeditation in Ihe
assassination of Sen. Robert F.
Kennedy.
"He wanted very much to kill
Kennedy . . .Sirhan at no time expected
to be a martyr," said Dr. Seymour
Pollack, the state's star psychiatric
witness at the first-degree murder trial

of the 25-year-old, Jordanian-born Arab.
Pollack rejected defense claims that
Sirhan was in a psychotic state and not
meaningfully and maturely responsible
when he shot Kennedy June 5, 1968,
while the senator was campaigning for
the Democratic presidential nomination.
The psychiatrist's testimony
apparently found favor with the
defendant at first. He consistently has
grown angry when described as mentally
ill, although he has testified he does not
remember shooting Kennedy.
Sirhan also has said he doesn't
remember writing "RFK must die"
repeatedly in his private notebooks
before the assassination. It was by
dismissing this claim that Pollack
inadvertently triggered Sirhan's
outburst.
"You settle down or I'll do what I
told you I'd do," Superior Court Judge
Herbert V. Walker warned Sirhan.
A previous outburst in the 12-week
trial led the judge to threaten to have
Sirhan bound and gagged in the
courtroom.
