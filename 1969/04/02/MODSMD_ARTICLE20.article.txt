# ACT's 'The Architect': Undeserved Great Effort
## 
### GARY SCHMIDGALL 
The American Conservatory
Theater (ACT) has opened its
premiere American production of
The Architect and the Emperor of
Assyria by the young Spaniard
Fernando Arrabal. The ACT
production, though modest (one
set, two actors), is as fine as one
could wish
directed by Robert Goldsby and
spectacularly acted by Michael
O'Sullivan as the "civilized" (and
manic-depressive homosexual)
Emperor and Peter Donat as the
"savage" Architect. The play
itself, however, presents problems
not as easily summarized.
Arrabal's concern is with games
people — and nations and
civilizations—play. He has a
wide-angle mind, imaginativeness,

and a great ability to diddle with
language. It would be easy to label
Arrabal's style virtuosic, but this
would be misleading. Virtuosity
can be stunningly apropos, or it
can be grotesquely out of place
and self-conscious in a rather
infantile way. Arrabal's virtuosity
is of the latter sort. His basic pose
is one of grossly affected
nonchalance.
He is, in short, a sensationalist.
The debilities of the personality
and the surpassing madness of
allegedly civilized life are toys for
Arrabal to play with, tease, or
masturbate as his vivid
imagination dictates. The level of
the play is ultimately one of
infantile incomprehension, an
easy and u nsat is lying—even
cowardly—level for a playwright

to choose.
Another difficulty lies in the
"absurdity" of Arrabal's style. If
The Architect qualifies Arrabal
for the theater of the absurd, he
gets in through the back door: it
is one thing to show how and why
life is absurd by writing absurdly
(so to speak). It is quite another
to use mere syntactical or visual
absurdities to escape from
dramatic dead-ends or to jaunt
capriciously over crucial moral
issues.
The playwright, of all people,
must see and manipulate the
irrationality which lies at the
heart of absurdity—not succumb
to it or accept it merely as
irrationality as Arrabal does. Who
is left if the playwright himself
makes the ignominious escape to
irrationality? Only a confounded
audience.
The play is also burdened by a
tediously reiterated theme of
homosexuality. I realize the topic
is now "in" with American
producers and repertory
companies, but The Architect is
so far "in" that it is definitely
"out." I can take it like a man
when a playwright throws overt
homosexuality at me, but I can
stand very little overt Freudian
homosexual theory and
symbolism. This stuff is
dreadfully dull and old-hat, and
small quantities of it are enough
to set me adrift. In The Architect
Arrabal piles up a debt to Freud
he won't be able to pay off with a
dozen "straight" plays.
The Architect is an
hermaphroditic affair: it is not
meaningfully related to my world
or the real world. The playbill
author apparently realizes this and
tells us it belongs to "the world of
Fernando Arrabal." If so, this is
nothing to boast about, for it
means simply that Arrabal never
escapes from his world and the
audience never penetrates into it.
It was a sad experience to see
O'Sullivan give the play such a
magnificent effort; his resources
are apparently unlimited. Any
competent actor can master the
outburst, but few could protray as
well as O'Sullivan the Emperor's
violent inbursts of neurotic guilt. I
wish I could report that the play
deserved his efforts.
The Architect is the work of a
short-change artist. It's style is
scathing but its meaning is only
lukewarm.

issues.
The playwright, of all people,
must see and manipulate the
irrationality which lies at the
heart of absurdity—not succumb
to it or accept it merely as
irrationality as Arrabal does. Who
is left if the playwright himself
makes the ignominious escape to
irrationality? Only a confounded
audience.
The play is also burdened by a
tediously reiterated theme of
homosexuality. I realize the topic
is now "in" with American
producers and repertory
companies, but The Architect is
so far "in" that it is definitely
"out." I can take it like a man
when a playwright throws overt
homosexuality at me, but I can
stand very little overt Freudian
homosexual theory and
symbolism. This stuff is
dreadfully dull and old-hat, and
small quantities of it are enough
to set me adrift. In The Architect
Arrabal piles up a debt to Freud
he won't be able to pay off with a
dozen "straight" plays.
The Architect is an
hermaphroditic affair: it is not
meaningfully related to my world
or the real world. The playbill
author apparently realizes this and
tells us it belongs to "the world of
Fernando Arrabal." If so, this is
nothing to boast about, for it
means simply that Arrabal never
escapes from his world and the
audience never penetrates into it.
It was a sad experience to see
O'Sullivan give the play such a
magnificent effort; his resources
are apparently unlimited. Any
competent actor can master the
outburst, but few could protray as
well as O'Sullivan the Emperor's
violent inbursts of neurotic guilt. I
wish I could report that the play
deserved his efforts.
The Architect is the work of a
short-change artist. It's style is
scathing but its meaning is only
lukewarm.
The American Conservatory
Theater (ACT) has opened its
premiere American production of
The Architect and the Emperor of
Assyria by the young Spaniard
Fernando Arrabal. The ACT
production, though modest (one
set, two actors), is as fine as one
could wish
directed by Robert Goldsby and
spectacularly acted by Michael
O'Sullivan as the "civilized" (and
manic-depressive homosexual)
Emperor and Peter Donat as the
"savage" Architect. The play
itself, however, presents problems
not as easily summarized.
Arrabal's concern is with games
people — and nations and
civilizations—play. He has a
wide-angle mind, imaginativeness,

and a great ability to diddle with
language. It would be easy to label
Arrabal's style virtuosic, but this
would be misleading. Virtuosity
can be stunningly apropos, or it
can be grotesquely out of place
and self-conscious in a rather
infantile way. Arrabal's virtuosity
is of the latter sort. His basic pose
is one of grossly affected
nonchalance.
He is, in short, a sensationalist.
The debilities of the personality
and the surpassing madness of
allegedly civilized life are toys for
Arrabal to play with, tease, or
masturbate as his vivid
imagination dictates. The level of
the play is ultimately one of
infantile incomprehension, an
easy and u nsat is lying—even
cowardly—level for a playwright

to choose.
Another difficulty lies in the
"absurdity" of Arrabal's style. If
The Architect qualifies Arrabal
for the theater of the absurd, he
gets in through the back door: it
is one thing to show how and why
life is absurd by writing absurdly
(so to speak). It is quite another
to use mere syntactical or visual
absurdities to escape from
dramatic dead-ends or to jaunt
capriciously over crucial moral
issues.
The playwright, of all people,
must see and manipulate the
irrationality which lies at the
heart of absurdity—not succumb
to it or accept it merely as
irrationality as Arrabal does. Who
