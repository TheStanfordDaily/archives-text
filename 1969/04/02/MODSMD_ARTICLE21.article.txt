# Voting, Drinking
## Laws Under Fire 
### 
The definition of an adult is
always a controversial topic. But
to at least one state legislator,
present legal standards are largely
unrealistic.
Assemblyman John
Vascancellos of San Jose has
introduced over a period of less
than a month a series of bills
aimed at lowering the state voting
and drinking age from 21 to 18
and has additionally asked for a
study considering the full
emancipation of 18 year olds in
California.
The probability for passage of
the bills are slight if past history is
any evidence of future action. But
the fact that the bills are being
introduced and considered may be
some evidence of a liberalizing of
attitudes in the state legislature.
Vascancellos has called for
lowering the drinking age because
"the drinking age limit of 21 is
currently largely unenforceable. It
creates a situation reminiscent of
the Prohibition era—a 1967
national study by the Cooperative
Commission on the Study of
Alcoholism indicated that over 75
percent of high school students
report that they have had
alcoholic beverages more than
once prior to graduation; one
third of the students stated that
they drank with some regularity.
No Assist
According to the
Assemblyman, today's young

person is not now being assisted in
adapting realistically to a society
where drinking is condoned and
practiced by a majority of
persons .. . They are put in a
position of violating a law that is
enforced neither very effectively
nor wholeheartedly by the older
generation and by many
authorities.
Regarding the voting age
Vascancellos says "we pride
ourselves on representative
government based on the consent
of the governed. Yet s%—roughly
1,000,000-of our 20,000,000
Californians, aged 18-21 are not
allowed to participate in our
government's decisions. We tax
many of them, ask them to fight
for us, and still deny them the
right to vote."
"Today's youth are better
educated, more mature, more
involved and concerned than ever
before. We condemn their civil
disobedience, and tell them to
change the laws instead. Yet we
deny them access to the voting
booth, the law-changer, the
foundation of democracy. If we
expect them to stop their
disobedience, we must allow them
the right to vote."
Vascancellos soon after the
introduction of the bills called for
a study of the possibilities of
granting full extension of rights to
18 year olds.
