# "Isch" Worked For Med Team
## Cat Helps Research 
### 
A cat who missed a lot of cat
naps, helping man to gain a better
understanding .of mental illness,
has stepped back into the leisure
class after two years of service for
science.
His name is Isch and he used to
work for a Stanford University
medical team as an experimental
subject in sleep and dream

research. Now he is a pet, but
several tiny electric wires had to
be removed from his head before
he could return to normal life.
After a painless operation, Isch
has gone to live with Kathy
McGarr, a research assistant in the
sleep laboratory, and her husband
Bill, a graduate student in business
at Stanford. Kathy says when she
first took Isch home he was afraid
to go more than five feet from the
front door. "But now," she says,
"he's not so dependent on human
company. In fact, I think he is
majoring in 'neighborhood
exploration,' and minoring in
'sniffing'.
''He sniffs absolutely
everything," she adds.
Isch and several other cats
participated in studies which have
led Stanford neurophysiologist
William C. Dement and his team
to a new discovery about the
nature of mental illness and its
relationship to sleep and
dreaming.
The cats furnished the brain
wave data which have provided
clues that a defect in the function
of an essential brain chemical
gives rise to abnormal behavior,
and seems to induce
hallucinations, or dreaming,
during wakefulness.
