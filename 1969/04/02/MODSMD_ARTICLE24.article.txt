# Stanford Survey Shows Dovish Clergy Lost Support
## 
### 
In California, Protestant
ministers are a lot more "dovish"
about the Vietnam war than their
parishioners, a Stanford political
science survey shows.
Many clergymen who
advocated withdrawal from
Vietnam were called before their
church board for an explanation;
many others lost both members
and financial support, according
to a survey of 2800 ministers in
nine denominations conducted by
Harold E. Quinley.
Quinley is a doctoral candidate
in political science at Stanford's
Institute for Political Studies.
From 2800 questionnaires,
Quinley received nearly 1600
responses —an unusually good 63
percent return.
The survey was conducted last
year before the Presidential
election and the onset of the Paris
peace talks. Quinley's survey
showed that:
-"A large proportion of those
clergymen who advocated
withdrawal from Vietnam were
censured by their parishioners for
their anti-war activities and views;
-"Sixty-nine percent reported
that their parishioners had
expressed private opposition to
their views;
-"Twenty percent had the
issue taken up publicly before
their church board;

-"Twenty-four percent lost
financial contributions because of
their stand on the war;
"Eight percent faced attempts
to have them removed from the
church;and
-"Twenty-eight percent lost
members over the issue."
Asked to compare their
personal views on the war with
those of their colleagues,
parishioners and denominational
leaders, the clergymen replied that
their local denominational leaders
and their own colleagues held
either the same or more "dovish"
views, while they perceived their
parishioners as more "hawkish"
than themselves.
"Even among ministers who
themselves favored intensification
of war efforts," Quinley found,
"23 percent reported that the
majority of the members of their
congregation held more hawkish
attitudes . . .
"Seventy two percent of those
(ministers) who advocated
withdrawal from Vietnam felt
their parishioners held more
hawkish beliefs . . .
"The overwhelming impact of
parishioner attitudes was to
reinforce the position of the
hawks and to contradict those of
the ministerial doves," the survey
showed.
Quinley divided his sample into

four separate categories—funda
mentalists, conservatives,
neo-orthodoxists and liberals.
Not surprisingly, the former
two were more hawkish and the
latter two more dovish.
"Theological doctrines which
divide contemporary Protestant
ministers divide them on political
grounds as well," Quinley found.
Thus the doves are one and a
half times more likely to make
their views on the war known, the
survey showed, twice as likely to
write to a public official and
almost seven times as likely to
sign a petition.
Eighty-two percent of the
Southern Baptist ministers
responding to the questionnaire
favored an escalation of the war,
while 40 percent of the ministers
representing either the United
Church of Christ or the
Methodists favored withdrawal.
He surveyed the denominations
of American Baptist, American
Lutheran Church, Lutheran
Church in America, Missouri
Synod of the Lutheran Church,
Methodist, Presbyterian,
Episcopal, Southern Baptists and
the United Church of Chiist.

University in Appleton, Wis.,
Quinley holds a master's degree in
political science from Stanford.
