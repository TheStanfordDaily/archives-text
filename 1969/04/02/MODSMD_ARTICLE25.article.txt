# Stanford Groups Concerned
## Apathy Endangering Ecology 
### SCOTT THACHER 
Despite the unconcerned
attitude of some members of the
Stanford community, the Stanford
Population and Environment
Forum and the Stanford
Conservation Group are working to
keep apathetic man from
destroying himself and his
environment.
"I know a crisis is coming," says
Bill Atherton, director of the
Stanford Population and
Environment Forum (SPEF). He
feels man is in the process of
causing such grave destruction in
his environment by his own
negligence that a world-wide
catastrophe involving the deaths of
hundreds of millions of people is
almost inevitable.
Atherton, who is a senior
majoring in biology, bases his
warnings on the science of ecology,
especially human ecology. Ecology
deals with the highest level of
biological organization: the
relationships of populations of
organisms to one another.
In studying ecology, a science
only recently come into
prominence, biologists have found
that there are many important
cycles in nature with which men
are interfering. For instance, use of
insecticides has killed off many
bacteria which are vital for
trapping the nitrogen of the
atmosphere and transferring it in

an altered form as vital nutrients
for growing plants.
The modern farmer's attempt to
remedy this damaged cycle has
been to add great amounts of
nitrogen fertilizer to the soil. The
end result has been that excess
nitrates are washed into fresh water
tributaries in unusually high
concentrations, with poisonous
effects on aquatic life.
Nature's food webs and
chemical cycles are extraordinarily
durable, however, and are just
beginning to be harmfully altered
by men. But Atherton, who admits
to being a pessimist in this area,
sees the destruction of these
natural balances as almost
unavoidable.
Compelled by these unfavorable
scientific omens, Atherton and
other concerned Stanford students
organized the Forum last Spring as
a project supported by Tresidder
Union.
The Forum's main objective has
been education -both in the
Stanford comriunity and outside
it. Using Stanford's manpower and
prestige to give their ideas an
outlet, they hope to influence state
and national decisions on the
problem.
During the fall quarter, they
brought five speakers, including
Stewart Udall, then Secretary of
the Interior, and Paul McCloskey,
Republican congressman from the

San Mateo area, to discuss the
problem and legislation necessary
to solve it.
Winter quarter has seen five
panel discussions of topics
including birth control, abortion,
sex education, urban crowding,
and overpopulation. The majority
of these discussions have been
subsequently televised.
Plans for the future center
around a desire for more formal
education at Stanford and in public
schools on the subject of ecology
and conservation. Atherton would
like to see a course in ecology that
would fulfill the General Studies
requirement in science.
SPEF also plans to present a
proposal to the administration
concerning the role in conservation
education that Stanford must take
in initiating programs outside the
campus.
A workshop of educators has
already been planned to take place
at Stanford on the weekend of May
10-11. They will discuss the nature
of human ecology and how it
should be taught.
The Forum, with a nucleus of
about two dozen highly active
students, complememts the less
dramatic Stanford Conservation
Group (SCG), also student-run,
which claims a membership of
about 300.
The SCG, organized
independently about two years
ago, is very similar in aims to the
Sierra Club, so it is not surprising
that about half the members of the
SCG also belong to the Sierra Club.
The SCG'S efforts are centered
mainly on bringing pressure to bear
on national and state legislators
and county boards dealing with the
use of natural resources. In this
area they have had many successes.
For example, last year a lumber
company applied for a logging
permit for an area of untouched
redwoods, Purisima Canyon in San
Mateo County. The application
aroused great concern among many
conservation groups, including
Stanford's, and many of these
groups presented statements at the
hearing for the application. As a
result of the vigorous protest, the
county's policy on lumbering was
altered, and the lumber company
was severely limited on the
location and the quantity of the
wood it could cut.
"The fate of San Francisco Bay
will be the most important local
conservation fight of the year,"
says Robert Mark, physics graduate
student and vice-president of the

SCG. The Bay Conservation and
Development Commission, set up
three years ago by the legislature,
was given control over the use of
most bay lands and the job of
formulating a plan for their future
use.
The plan, termed "Fabian
Socialism" by the Leslie Salt
Company which owns much bay
real estate, aims to limit greatly the
filling of the 25% of the bay which
is shallow enough to be filled.
Conservationists argue that besides
destroying the natural beauty of
the bay, increased fill would
eliminate wild life feeding grounds
and lessen the bay's
temperature-moderating effect.
This year, the legislature must
either extend the commission's
control over bay fill or enact its
recommendations. Otherwise, the
moratorium oil bay fill will end and
control will return to local zoning
boards.
An important adjunct to the
SCG is the Conservation Issues
Workshop, which has small groups
working on air and water pollution,
open space in slums, wilderness and
national parks, and offshore oil
drilling. Members of the workshop
have also worked with the
Department of Communication to
find out better ways of influencing
the attitudes of a small group of
people.
But despite the seeming
disparity of concerns, from
ecology to redwoods, of the
Population and Environment
Forum and the Conservation
Group both are quite concerned
with the public's general awareness
and reaction to the far away
possibilities of world-wide famine
or the more familiar but equally
noxious effects of air-pollution.
David Sachs, president of the
SCG, sees "a type of sophistication
in the general public that was not
here 3 to 5 years ago." This first hit
him after he had written an article
on pollution for McCall's magazine
and was asked to appear on a KGO
radio talk show. When the show
began, the announcer commented
that, "people aren't generally
interested in water pollution." For
the remainder of the show, KGO's
ten telephone lines were tied up
with calls from "uninterested"
listeners.
This interest, as evidenced by an
SCG survey of its members
showing one-fifth wrote letters to
public officials on any one issue,
allows legislators to go out on a
limb, with the confidence that they
have the public's support.
Atherton, on the other hand,
does not feel nearly as encouraged
about SPEF's success. It seems to
him that the men who have a real
appreciation of how limited man's
technology will be in solving the
problems he foresees are in the
"hard" sciences and not among the
general public.
He also laments the tendency of
underdeveloped countries to adopt
the westerner's means of "death
control" (programs for better
health) while ignoring birth
control, a sin of which all nations
are guilty.
On campus, he deplores the
"vicious tokenism" of those who
work for Biafran/Nigerian relief to
sooth their consciences and ignore
the fact that much more
determined work must be done to
avoid famines many times greater
that are sure to occur in the next
decade.

Stanford comriunity and outside
it. Using Stanford's manpower and
prestige to give their ideas an
outlet, they hope to influence state
and national decisions on the
problem.
During the fall quarter, they
brought five speakers, including
Stewart Udall, then Secretary of
the Interior, and Paul McCloskey,
Republican congressman from the

San Mateo area, to discuss the
problem and legislation necessary
to solve it.
Winter quarter has seen five
panel discussions of topics
including birth control, abortion,
sex education, urban crowding,
and overpopulation. The majority
of these discussions have been
subsequently televised.
Plans for the future center
around a desire for more formal
education at Stanford and in public
schools on the subject of ecology
and conservation. Atherton would
like to see a course in ecology that
would fulfill the General Studies
requirement in science.
SPEF also plans to present a
proposal to the administration
concerning the role in conservation
education that Stanford must take
in initiating programs outside the
campus.
A workshop of educators has
already been planned to take place
at Stanford on the weekend of May
10-11. They will discuss the nature
of human ecology and how it
should be taught.
The Forum, with a nucleus of
about two dozen highly active
students, complememts the less
dramatic Stanford Conservation
Group (SCG), also student-run,
which claims a membership of
about 300.
The SCG, organized
independently about two years
ago, is very similar in aims to the
Sierra Club, so it is not surprising
that about half the members of the
SCG also belong to the Sierra Club.
The SCG'S efforts are centered
mainly on bringing pressure to bear
on national and state legislators
and county boards dealing with the
use of natural resources. In this
area they have had many successes.
For example, last year a lumber
company applied for a logging
permit for an area of untouched
redwoods, Purisima Canyon in San
Mateo County. The application
aroused great concern among many
conservation groups, including
Stanford's, and many of these
groups presented statements at the
hearing for the application. As a
result of the vigorous protest, the
county's policy on lumbering was
altered, and the lumber company
was severely limited on the
location and the quantity of the
wood it could cut.
"The fate of San Francisco Bay
will be the most important local
conservation fight of the year,"
says Robert Mark, physics graduate
student and vice-president of the

SCG. The Bay Conservation and
Development Commission, set up
three years ago by the legislature,
was given control over the use of
most bay lands and the job of
formulating a plan for their future
use.
The plan, termed "Fabian
Socialism" by the Leslie Salt
Company which owns much bay
real estate, aims to limit greatly the
filling of the 25% of the bay which
is shallow enough to be filled.
Conservationists argue that besides
destroying the natural beauty of
the bay, increased fill would
eliminate wild life feeding grounds
and lessen the bay's
temperature-moderating effect.
This year, the legislature must
either extend the commission's
control over bay fill or enact its
recommendations. Otherwise, the
moratorium oil bay fill will end and
control will return to local zoning
boards.
An important adjunct to the
SCG is the Conservation Issues
Workshop, which has small groups
working on air and water pollution,
open space in slums, wilderness and
national parks, and offshore oil
drilling. Members of the workshop
have also worked with the
Department of Communication to
find out better ways of influencing
the attitudes of a small group of
people.
But despite the seeming
disparity of concerns, from
ecology to redwoods, of the
Population and Environment
Forum and the Conservation
Group both are quite concerned
with the public's general awareness
and reaction to the far away
possibilities of world-wide famine
or the more familiar but equally
noxious effects of air-pollution.
David Sachs, president of the
SCG, sees "a type of sophistication
in the general public that was not
here 3 to 5 years ago." This first hit
him after he had written an article
on pollution for McCall's magazine
and was asked to appear on a KGO
radio talk show. When the show
began, the announcer commented
that, "people aren't generally
interested in water pollution." For
the remainder of the show, KGO's
ten telephone lines were tied up
with calls from "uninterested"
listeners.
This interest, as evidenced by an
SCG survey of its members
showing one-fifth wrote letters to
public officials on any one issue,
allows legislators to go out on a
limb, with the confidence that they
have the public's support.
Atherton, on the other hand,
does not feel nearly as encouraged
about SPEF's success. It seems to
him that the men who have a real
appreciation of how limited man's
technology will be in solving the
problems he foresees are in the
"hard" sciences and not among the
general public.
He also laments the tendency of
underdeveloped countries to adopt
the westerner's means of "death
control" (programs for better
health) while ignoring birth
control, a sin of which all nations
are guilty.
On campus, he deplores the
"vicious tokenism" of those who
work for Biafran/Nigerian relief to
sooth their consciences and ignore
the fact that much more
determined work must be done to
avoid famines many times greater
that are sure to occur in the next
decade.
Despite the unconcerned
attitude of some members of the
Stanford community, the Stanford
Population and Environment
Forum and the Stanford
Conservation Group are working to
keep apathetic man from
destroying himself and his
environment.
"I know a crisis is coming," says
Bill Atherton, director of the
Stanford Population and
Environment Forum (SPEF). He
feels man is in the process of
causing such grave destruction in
his environment by his own
negligence that a world-wide
catastrophe involving the deaths of
hundreds of millions of people is
almost inevitable.
Atherton, who is a senior
majoring in biology, bases his
warnings on the science of ecology,
especially human ecology. Ecology
deals with the highest level of
biological organization: the
relationships of populations of
organisms to one another.
In studying ecology, a science
only recently come into
prominence, biologists have found
that there are many important
cycles in nature with which men
are interfering. For instance, use of
insecticides has killed off many
bacteria which are vital for
trapping the nitrogen of the
atmosphere and transferring it in

an altered form as vital nutrients
for growing plants.
The modern farmer's attempt to
remedy this damaged cycle has
been to add great amounts of
nitrogen fertilizer to the soil. The
end result has been that excess
nitrates are washed into fresh water
tributaries in unusually high
concentrations, with poisonous
effects on aquatic life.
Nature's food webs and
chemical cycles are extraordinarily
durable, however, and are just
beginning to be harmfully altered
by men. But Atherton, who admits
to being a pessimist in this area,
sees the destruction of these
natural balances as almost
unavoidable.
Compelled by these unfavorable
scientific omens, Atherton and
other concerned Stanford students
organized the Forum last Spring as
a project supported by Tresidder
Union.

redwoods, Purisima Canyon in San
Mateo County. The application
aroused great concern among many
conservation groups, including
Stanford's, and many of these
groups presented statements at the
hearing for the application. As a
result of the vigorous protest, the
county's policy on lumbering was
altered, and the lumber company
was severely limited on the
location and the quantity of the
wood it could cut.
"The fate of San Francisco Bay
will be the most important local
conservation fight of the year,"
says Robert Mark, physics graduate
student and vice-president of the

SCG. The Bay Conservation and
Development Commission, set up
three years ago by the legislature,
was given control over the use of
most bay lands and the job of
formulating a plan for their future
use.
The plan, termed "Fabian
Socialism" by the Leslie Salt
Company which owns much bay
real estate, aims to limit greatly the
filling of the 25% of the bay which
is shallow enough to be filled.
Conservationists argue that besides
destroying the natural beauty of
the bay, increased fill would
eliminate wild life feeding grounds
and lessen the bay's
temperature-moderating effect.
This year, the legislature must
either extend the commission's
control over bay fill or enact its
recommendations. Otherwise, the
moratorium oil bay fill will end and
control will return to local zoning
boards.
An important adjunct to the
SCG is the Conservation Issues
Workshop, which has small groups
working on air and water pollution,
open space in slums, wilderness and
national parks, and offshore oil
drilling. Members of the workshop
have also worked with the
Department of Communication to
find out better ways of influencing
the attitudes of a small group of
people.
But despite the seeming
disparity of concerns, from
ecology to redwoods, of the
Population and Environment
Forum and the Conservation
Group both are quite concerned
with the public's general awareness
and reaction to the far away
possibilities of world-wide famine
or the more familiar but equally
noxious effects of air-pollution.
David Sachs, president of the
SCG, sees "a type of sophistication
in the general public that was not
here 3 to 5 years ago." This first hit
him after he had written an article
on pollution for McCall's magazine
and was asked to appear on a KGO
radio talk show. When the show
began, the announcer commented
that, "people aren't generally
interested in water pollution." For
the remainder of the show, KGO's
ten telephone lines were tied up
with calls from "uninterested"
listeners.
This interest, as evidenced by an
SCG survey of its members
showing one-fifth wrote letters to
public officials on any one issue,
allows legislators to go out on a
limb, with the confidence that they
have the public's support.
Atherton, on the other hand,
does not feel nearly as encouraged
about SPEF's success. It seems to
him that the men who have a real
appreciation of how limited man's
technology will be in solving the
problems he foresees are in the
"hard" sciences and not among the
general public.
He also laments the tendency of
underdeveloped countries to adopt
the westerner's means of "death
control" (programs for better
health) while ignoring birth
control, a sin of which all nations
are guilty.
On campus, he deplores the
"vicious tokenism" of those who
work for Biafran/Nigerian relief to
sooth their consciences and ignore
the fact that much more
determined work must be done to
avoid famines many times greater
that are sure to occur in the next
decade.
Despite the unconcerned
attitude of some members of the
Stanford community, the Stanford
Population and Environment
Forum and the Stanford
Conservation Group are working to
keep apathetic man from
destroying himself and his
environment.
"I know a crisis is coming," says
Bill Atherton, director of the
Stanford Population and
Environment Forum (SPEF). He
feels man is in the process of
causing such grave destruction in
his environment by his own
negligence that a world-wide
catastrophe involving the deaths of
hundreds of millions of people is
almost inevitable.
Atherton, who is a senior
majoring in biology, bases his
warnings on the science of ecology,
especially human ecology. Ecology
deals with the highest level of
biological organization: the
relationships of populations of
organisms to one another.
In studying ecology, a science
only recently come into
prominence, biologists have found
that there are many important
cycles in nature with which men
are interfering. For instance, use of
insecticides has killed off many
bacteria which are vital for
trapping the nitrogen of the
atmosphere and transferring it in

an altered form as vital nutrients
for growing plants.
The modern farmer's attempt to
remedy this damaged cycle has
been to add great amounts of
nitrogen fertilizer to the soil. The
end result has been that excess
nitrates are washed into fresh water
tributaries in unusually high
concentrations, with poisonous
effects on aquatic life.
Nature's food webs and
chemical cycles are extraordinarily
durable, however, and are just
beginning to be harmfully altered
by men. But Atherton, who admits
to being a pessimist in this area,
sees the destruction of these
natural balances as almost
unavoidable.
Compelled by these unfavorable
scientific omens, Atherton and
other concerned Stanford students
organized the Forum last Spring as
a project supported by Tresidder
Union.
The Forum's main objective has
been education -both in the
Stanford comriunity and outside
it. Using Stanford's manpower and
prestige to give their ideas an
outlet, they hope to influence state
and national decisions on the
problem.
During the fall quarter, they
brought five speakers, including
Stewart Udall, then Secretary of
the Interior, and Paul McCloskey,
Republican congressman from the

San Mateo area, to discuss the
problem and legislation necessary
to solve it.
Winter quarter has seen five
panel discussions of topics
including birth control, abortion,
sex education, urban crowding,
and overpopulation. The majority
of these discussions have been
subsequently televised.
Plans for the future center
around a desire for more formal
education at Stanford and in public
schools on the subject of ecology
and conservation. Atherton would
like to see a course in ecology that
would fulfill the General Studies
requirement in science.
SPEF also plans to present a
proposal to the administration
concerning the role in conservation
education that Stanford must take
in initiating programs outside the
campus.
A workshop of educators has
already been planned to take place
at Stanford on the weekend of May
10-11. They will discuss the nature
of human ecology and how it
should be taught.
The Forum, with a nucleus of
about two dozen highly active
students, complememts the less
dramatic Stanford Conservation
Group (SCG), also student-run,
which claims a membership of
about 300.
The SCG, organized
independently about two years
ago, is very similar in aims to the
Sierra Club, so it is not surprising
that about half the members of the
SCG also belong to the Sierra Club.
The SCG'S efforts are centered
mainly on bringing pressure to bear
on national and state legislators
and county boards dealing with the
use of natural resources. In this
area they have had many successes.
For example, last year a lumber
company applied for a logging
permit for an area of untouched
redwoods, Purisima Canyon in San
Mateo County. The application
aroused great concern among many

and reaction to the far away
possibilities of world-wide famine
or the more familiar but equally
noxious effects of air-pollution.
David Sachs, president of the
SCG, sees "a type of sophistication
in the general public that was not
here 3 to 5 years ago." This first hit
him after he had written an article
on pollution for McCall's magazine
and was asked to appear on a KGO
radio talk show. When the show
began, the announcer commented
that, "people aren't generally
interested in water pollution." For
the remainder of the show, KGO's
ten telephone lines were tied up
with calls from "uninterested"
listeners.
This interest, as evidenced by an
SCG survey of its members
showing one-fifth wrote letters to
public officials on any one issue,
allows legislators to go out on a
limb, with the confidence that they
have the public's support.
Atherton, on the other hand,
does not feel nearly as encouraged
about SPEF's success. It seems to
him that the men who have a real
appreciation of how limited man's
technology will be in solving the
problems he foresees are in the
"hard" sciences and not among the
general public.
He also laments the tendency of
underdeveloped countries to adopt
the westerner's means of "death
control" (programs for better
health) while ignoring birth
control, a sin of which all nations
are guilty.
On campus, he deplores the
"vicious tokenism" of those who
work for Biafran/Nigerian relief to
sooth their consciences and ignore
the fact that much more
determined work must be done to
avoid famines many times greater
that are sure to occur in the next
decade.
Despite the unconcerned
attitude of some members of the
Stanford community, the Stanford
Population and Environment
Forum and the Stanford
Conservation Group are working to
keep apathetic man from
destroying himself and his
environment.
"I know a crisis is coming," says
Bill Atherton, director of the
Stanford Population and
Environment Forum (SPEF). He
feels man is in the process of
causing such grave destruction in
his environment by his own
negligence that a world-wide
catastrophe involving the deaths of
hundreds of millions of people is
almost inevitable.
Atherton, who is a senior
majoring in biology, bases his
warnings on the science of ecology,
especially human ecology. Ecology
deals with the highest level of
biological organization: the
relationships of populations of
organisms to one another.
In studying ecology, a science
only recently come into
prominence, biologists have found
that there are many important
cycles in nature with which men
are interfering. For instance, use of
insecticides has killed off many
bacteria which are vital for
trapping the nitrogen of the
atmosphere and transferring it in

an altered form as vital nutrients
for growing plants.
The modern farmer's attempt to
remedy this damaged cycle has
been to add great amounts of
nitrogen fertilizer to the soil. The
end result has been that excess
nitrates are washed into fresh water
tributaries in unusually high
concentrations, with poisonous
effects on aquatic life.
Nature's food webs and
chemical cycles are extraordinarily
durable, however, and are just
beginning to be harmfully altered
by men. But Atherton, who admits
to being a pessimist in this area,
sees the destruction of these
natural balances as almost
unavoidable.
Compelled by these unfavorable
scientific omens, Atherton and
other concerned Stanford students
organized the Forum last Spring as
a project supported by Tresidder
Union.
The Forum's main objective has
been education -both in the
Stanford comriunity and outside
it. Using Stanford's manpower and
prestige to give their ideas an
outlet, they hope to influence state
and national decisions on the
problem.
During the fall quarter, they
brought five speakers, including
Stewart Udall, then Secretary of
the Interior, and Paul McCloskey,
Republican congressman from the

San Mateo area, to discuss the
problem and legislation necessary
to solve it.
Winter quarter has seen five
panel discussions of topics
including birth control, abortion,
sex education, urban crowding,
and overpopulation. The majority
of these discussions have been
subsequently televised.
Plans for the future center
around a desire for more formal
education at Stanford and in public
schools on the subject of ecology
and conservation. Atherton would
like to see a course in ecology that
would fulfill the General Studies
requirement in science.
SPEF also plans to present a
proposal to the administration
concerning the role in conservation
education that Stanford must take
in initiating programs outside the
campus.
A workshop of educators has
already been planned to take place
at Stanford on the weekend of May
10-11. They will discuss the nature
of human ecology and how it
should be taught.
The Forum, with a nucleus of
about two dozen highly active
students, complememts the less
dramatic Stanford Conservation
Group (SCG), also student-run,
which claims a membership of
about 300.
The SCG, organized
independently about two years
ago, is very similar in aims to the
Sierra Club, so it is not surprising
that about half the members of the
SCG also belong to the Sierra Club.
The SCG'S efforts are centered
mainly on bringing pressure to bear
on national and state legislators
and county boards dealing with the
use of natural resources. In this
area they have had many successes.
For example, last year a lumber
company applied for a logging
permit for an area of untouched
redwoods, Purisima Canyon in San
Mateo County. The application
aroused great concern among many
conservation groups, including
Stanford's, and many of these
groups presented statements at the
hearing for the application. As a
result of the vigorous protest, the
county's policy on lumbering was
altered, and the lumber company
was severely limited on the
location and the quantity of the
wood it could cut.
"The fate of San Francisco Bay
will be the most important local
conservation fight of the year,"
says Robert Mark, physics graduate
student and vice-president of the

SCG. The Bay Conservation and
Development Commission, set up
three years ago by the legislature,
was given control over the use of
most bay lands and the job of
formulating a plan for their future
use.
The plan, termed "Fabian
Socialism" by the Leslie Salt
Company which owns much bay
real estate, aims to limit greatly the
filling of the 25% of the bay which
is shallow enough to be filled.
Conservationists argue that besides
destroying the natural beauty of
the bay, increased fill would
eliminate wild life feeding grounds
and lessen the bay's
temperature-moderating effect.
This year, the legislature must
either extend the commission's
control over bay fill or enact its
recommendations. Otherwise, the
moratorium oil bay fill will end and
control will return to local zoning
boards.
An important adjunct to the
SCG is the Conservation Issues
Workshop, which has small groups
working on air and water pollution,
open space in slums, wilderness and
national parks, and offshore oil
drilling. Members of the workshop
have also worked with the
Department of Communication to
find out better ways of influencing
the attitudes of a small group of
people.
But despite the seeming
disparity of concerns, from
ecology to redwoods, of the
Population and Environment
Forum and the Conservation
Group both are quite concerned
with the public's general awareness
and reaction to the far away
possibilities of world-wide famine
or the more familiar but equally
noxious effects of air-pollution.
