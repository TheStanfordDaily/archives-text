# Cagers End Season With Big Game Win
## 
### FRED MANN 
The basketball season ended
three weeks ago, but the ups and
downs are still being remembered
as all-star selections and Pacific-8
final statistics are circulated.
Stanford finished a poor season
in the league basement, but gained
some consolation in the last game
of the year. Their amazing
double-overtime win over
California gave them company in
the cellar. Both the Indians and
the Bears finished with 4-10
conference marks.
The farewell performances of
Co-captains Mai McElwain and
Don Griffin proved inspiring. It
was the ever-improving McElwain
who hit the last second bucket to
send the Cal game into overtime.
Mai finished with 20 points and
11 rebounds.
Griffin broke out of a shooting
slump and popped 24 points in
the 83 79 victory. He fell eight
points short in his effort to tie the
Art Harris-held school scoring
record, but wound up a great
career as the fifth leading scorer in
Stanford history with 1256 tallies.
Against the Bears, sophomores
Dennis O'Neill (18) and Mike
Michel (15) played great ball, and
showed everyone that they will be
standouts in the years to come.
The whole year seemed to
revolve around the Co-captains.
Only Griffin and McElwain
finished the year hitting in double
figures, (20.4 and 12.7
respectively). The Indians suffered
considerable problems under the
basket. Center Bill Palmer stands
only 6-7, the smallest big-man in
the league. Although he grabbed
off more than nine rebounds a
game, he had obvious difficulty
defensing many taller opposing
centers.
Coach Howie Dallmar had
trouble early in the year finding
the right man for the corner
opposite McElwain. Once Michel
nailed down the job, the team
seemed to jell.
As the stats show, the Tribe
controlled the ball well, and got
off a large number of shot
attempts. In fact, Stanford hit
only three less baskets than did
their opponents. They lost 17 of
26 games, and still managed to
average over 70 points per
contest.
It was at the free throw line
that the season was lost. They
dropped 41 points to the enemy
from the charity stripe.
The Cards did not crack the
first division in any of the Pac-8
team statistics. In league they
averaged 66 a game (sixth place)
and gave up 72.9 (also number
six). They hit on only 41.5 per
cent from the field (ahead of only
Cal), and hit 65.9 from the line
for fifth. The small varsity squad
placed highest in the rebounding
category with 40.7 a game (fourth
place).
On the individual level, Griffin
finished third among Pac-8 scorers
behind Lew Alcindor of UCLA
and Jackie Ridgle of Cal.
McElwain was tied for 12th with
Curtis Rowe of the Bruins.
McElwain was the only Indian in
the top ten in free throwing,
ranking fifth.
O'Neill tied Sidney Wicks of
UCLA for fifth in field goal
percentage in the race won by
Alcindor. Dennis hit on 54.4 in
league. Alcindor nailed 63.1.
UCLA showed their unbeatable
team strength in this category by
capturing the top three spots and
placing six men in the first ten.
O'Neill was the only Stanford
placer.
Alcindor also won the rebound
race with 13.6 a game. Palmer
(9.1) was fifth.
Stanford's Griffin was named
to the Pac-8 All-conference
second team for his efforts. The

first squad consisted of Alcindor
(the only unanamous choice for
the third straight year) and Rowe
of UCLA, Ted Wierman, the 6-9
senior from Washington State,
Cal's great sophomore guard
Charlie Johnson, and USC's senior
playmaker Mack Calvin.
The Stanford freshman team
completed a fine 10-6 season with
a tremendous 83-69 win over the
Cal Cubs. Brian Hewitt and
Claude Terry led the winners.
Terry finished the year with a
number of frosh records including
the most points in a single game
(40) and overall point per game
average.
The lanky guard canned 22.2
on the average to break the mark
held by Dennis O'Neill at 21.4.
Hewitt finished with 13.3 per
game, and Brad Lind had 13.1.
The frosh improved as the year
progressed and came within inches
of knocking off the powerful
Santa Clara frosh in their second
meeting, 70-69.
With Terry and a few others
moving up to the varsity next
year, the Stanford story may
improve. Cal will be loaded with
talent as will both Washington
schools. UCLA will, as usual play
the favorites role, and USC is
always ready for Stanford.
Then again, Lew will be gone.
Anything is possible.

defensing many taller opposing
centers.
Coach Howie Dallmar had
trouble early in the year finding
the right man for the corner
opposite McElwain. Once Michel
nailed down the job, the team
seemed to jell.
As the stats show, the Tribe
controlled the ball well, and got
off a large number of shot
attempts. In fact, Stanford hit
only three less baskets than did
their opponents. They lost 17 of
26 games, and still managed to
average over 70 points per
contest.
It was at the free throw line
that the season was lost. They
dropped 41 points to the enemy
from the charity stripe.
The Cards did not crack the
first division in any of the Pac-8
team statistics. In league they
averaged 66 a game (sixth place)
and gave up 72.9 (also number
six). They hit on only 41.5 per
cent from the field (ahead of only
Cal), and hit 65.9 from the line
for fifth. The small varsity squad
placed highest in the rebounding
category with 40.7 a game (fourth
place).
On the individual level, Griffin
finished third among Pac-8 scorers
behind Lew Alcindor of UCLA
and Jackie Ridgle of Cal.
McElwain was tied for 12th with
Curtis Rowe of the Bruins.
McElwain was the only Indian in
the top ten in free throwing,
ranking fifth.
O'Neill tied Sidney Wicks of
UCLA for fifth in field goal
percentage in the race won by
Alcindor. Dennis hit on 54.4 in
league. Alcindor nailed 63.1.
UCLA showed their unbeatable
team strength in this category by
capturing the top three spots and
placing six men in the first ten.
O'Neill was the only Stanford
placer.
Alcindor also won the rebound
race with 13.6 a game. Palmer
(9.1) was fifth.
Stanford's Griffin was named
to the Pac-8 All-conference
second team for his efforts. The

first squad consisted of Alcindor
(the only unanamous choice for
the third straight year) and Rowe
of UCLA, Ted Wierman, the 6-9
senior from Washington State,
Cal's great sophomore guard
Charlie Johnson, and USC's senior
playmaker Mack Calvin.
The Stanford freshman team
completed a fine 10-6 season with
a tremendous 83-69 win over the
Cal Cubs. Brian Hewitt and
Claude Terry led the winners.
Terry finished the year with a
number of frosh records including
the most points in a single game
(40) and overall point per game
average.
The lanky guard canned 22.2
on the average to break the mark
held by Dennis O'Neill at 21.4.
Hewitt finished with 13.3 per
game, and Brad Lind had 13.1.
The frosh improved as the year
progressed and came within inches
of knocking off the powerful
Santa Clara frosh in their second
meeting, 70-69.
With Terry and a few others
moving up to the varsity next
year, the Stanford story may
improve. Cal will be loaded with
talent as will both Washington
schools. UCLA will, as usual play
the favorites role, and USC is
always ready for Stanford.
Then again, Lew will be gone.
Anything is possible.
The basketball season ended
three weeks ago, but the ups and
downs are still being remembered
as all-star selections and Pacific-8
final statistics are circulated.
Stanford finished a poor season
in the league basement, but gained
some consolation in the last game
of the year. Their amazing
double-overtime win over
California gave them company in
the cellar. Both the Indians and
the Bears finished with 4-10
conference marks.
The farewell performances of
Co-captains Mai McElwain and
Don Griffin proved inspiring. It
was the ever-improving McElwain
who hit the last second bucket to
send the Cal game into overtime.
Mai finished with 20 points and
11 rebounds.
Griffin broke out of a shooting
slump and popped 24 points in
the 83 79 victory. He fell eight
points short in his effort to tie the
Art Harris-held school scoring
record, but wound up a great
career as the fifth leading scorer in
Stanford history with 1256 tallies.
Against the Bears, sophomores
Dennis O'Neill (18) and Mike
Michel (15) played great ball, and
showed everyone that they will be
standouts in the years to come.
The whole year seemed to
revolve around the Co-captains.
Only Griffin and McElwain
finished the year hitting in double
figures, (20.4 and 12.7
respectively). The Indians suffered
considerable problems under the
basket. Center Bill Palmer stands
only 6-7, the smallest big-man in
the league. Although he grabbed
off more than nine rebounds a
game, he had obvious difficulty
defensing many taller opposing
centers.

UCLA showed their unbeatable
team strength in this category by
capturing the top three spots and
placing six men in the first ten.
O'Neill was the only Stanford
placer.
Alcindor also won the rebound
race with 13.6 a game. Palmer
(9.1) was fifth.
Stanford's Griffin was named
to the Pac-8 All-conference
second team for his efforts. The

first squad consisted of Alcindor
(the only unanamous choice for
the third straight year) and Rowe
of UCLA, Ted Wierman, the 6-9
senior from Washington State,
Cal's great sophomore guard
Charlie Johnson, and USC's senior
playmaker Mack Calvin.
The Stanford freshman team
completed a fine 10-6 season with
a tremendous 83-69 win over the
Cal Cubs. Brian Hewitt and
Claude Terry led the winners.
Terry finished the year with a
number of frosh records including
the most points in a single game
(40) and overall point per game
average.
The lanky guard canned 22.2
on the average to break the mark
held by Dennis O'Neill at 21.4.
Hewitt finished with 13.3 per
game, and Brad Lind had 13.1.
The frosh improved as the year
progressed and came within inches
of knocking off the powerful
Santa Clara frosh in their second
meeting, 70-69.
With Terry and a few others
moving up to the varsity next
year, the Stanford story may
improve. Cal will be loaded with
talent as will both Washington
schools. UCLA will, as usual play
the favorites role, and USC is
always ready for Stanford.
Then again, Lew will be gone.
Anything is possible.
The basketball season ended
three weeks ago, but the ups and
downs are still being remembered
as all-star selections and Pacific-8
final statistics are circulated.
Stanford finished a poor season
in the league basement, but gained
some consolation in the last game
of the year. Their amazing
double-overtime win over
California gave them company in
the cellar. Both the Indians and
the Bears finished with 4-10
conference marks.
The farewell performances of
Co-captains Mai McElwain and
Don Griffin proved inspiring. It
was the ever-improving McElwain
who hit the last second bucket to
send the Cal game into overtime.
Mai finished with 20 points and
11 rebounds.
Griffin broke out of a shooting
slump and popped 24 points in
the 83 79 victory. He fell eight
points short in his effort to tie the
Art Harris-held school scoring
record, but wound up a great
career as the fifth leading scorer in
Stanford history with 1256 tallies.
Against the Bears, sophomores
Dennis O'Neill (18) and Mike
Michel (15) played great ball, and
showed everyone that they will be
standouts in the years to come.
The whole year seemed to
revolve around the Co-captains.
Only Griffin and McElwain
finished the year hitting in double
figures, (20.4 and 12.7
respectively). The Indians suffered
considerable problems under the
basket. Center Bill Palmer stands
only 6-7, the smallest big-man in
the league. Although he grabbed
off more than nine rebounds a
game, he had obvious difficulty
defensing many taller opposing
centers.
Coach Howie Dallmar had
trouble early in the year finding
the right man for the corner
opposite McElwain. Once Michel
nailed down the job, the team
seemed to jell.
As the stats show, the Tribe
controlled the ball well, and got
off a large number of shot
attempts. In fact, Stanford hit
only three less baskets than did
their opponents. They lost 17 of
26 games, and still managed to
average over 70 points per
contest.
It was at the free throw line
that the season was lost. They
dropped 41 points to the enemy
from the charity stripe.
The Cards did not crack the
first division in any of the Pac-8
team statistics. In league they
averaged 66 a game (sixth place)
and gave up 72.9 (also number
six). They hit on only 41.5 per
cent from the field (ahead of only
Cal), and hit 65.9 from the line
for fifth. The small varsity squad
placed highest in the rebounding
category with 40.7 a game (fourth
place).
On the individual level, Griffin
finished third among Pac-8 scorers
behind Lew Alcindor of UCLA
and Jackie Ridgle of Cal.
McElwain was tied for 12th with
Curtis Rowe of the Bruins.
McElwain was the only Indian in
the top ten in free throwing,
ranking fifth.
O'Neill tied Sidney Wicks of
UCLA for fifth in field goal
percentage in the race won by
Alcindor. Dennis hit on 54.4 in
league. Alcindor nailed 63.1.
UCLA showed their unbeatable
team strength in this category by
