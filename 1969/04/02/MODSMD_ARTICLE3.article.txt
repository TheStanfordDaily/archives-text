# Nerve Gas Production Proceeds Amid Public Outcry, Security
## 
### LANG ATWOOD 
DENVER, COLO—Many residents
of this mile-high city are becoming
increasingly concerned that they might
be quietly wiped out by an invisible but
deadly product of the arms race—nerve
gas.
Last year over 4,000 sheep were
killed in Utah and only a fortunate
change in wind direction saved Salt
Lake City when an unspecified amount
of nerve gas "escaped" from an army
test.
The reason for the recent concern in

Denver was a disclosure in The New
York Times that the U.S. Army's Rocky
Mountain Arsenal, located at the
northeastern edge of Denver, was
manufacturing and storing large
quantities of G-B type nerve gas.
Lieutenant John Sheppard, newly
appointed public information officer at
the arsenal, acknowledged in a Daily
interview that, due to civilian pressure
and the growth of the city, the army
was discontinuing the storage of "large
quantities" of "chemical agents" at the
facility.
He also indicated that production
was being scaled down and, an 18,000
acre site, was acquired in 1942 and is
engaged in the production of munitions.
No Testing On Base
According to Sheppard no testing or
research takes place on the base,
although areas that could be testing sites
are visible on a hill behind the
administration building.
The army employs 1000 people at
the arsenal, 90 percent of whom are
civilians. They comprise the work force,
while the military complement deals
with base security and administrative
functions.
None of the civilians live on the base,
and although there appear to be enough
barracks for 300 men, only part of the
100 soldiers live on the base.
Security at the base is very tight and
entry is restricted. Visitors must be

cleared through the commander before
proceeding to the provost marshal's
officer where they are issued a visitors
badge.
The guardhouses at the entrances to
the arsenal are manned 24 hours a day
and are equipped with gas masks,
presumably as a protection against
possible leakage of "chemical agents."
Security Tightened
According to one of the guards,
security has been tightened up by the
new base commander, Lt. Col. John A.
Bryan. The public and press are not
normally allowed to enter the facility
although Shell Oil Co. leases land inside
the base and operates a chemical
manufacturing facility there.
The Army recently turned over 651
acres of arsenal property to the City of
Denver for expansion of Stapleton
Airport, thus saving the city
approximately $1.5 million in land
acquisition costs. Shortly afterward the
army announced plans to resume
"limited" pumping from wells
containing radioactive wastes.
Pumping was halted last year when
earth tremors occurred after pumping
began. Although no definite link was
established between the pumping and
the tremors, pumping was halted. No
reason was given as to why pumping was
being resumed.

Lake City when an unspecified amount
of nerve gas "escaped" from an army
test.
The reason for the recent concern in

Denver was a disclosure in The New
York Times that the U.S. Army's Rocky
Mountain Arsenal, located at the
northeastern edge of Denver, was
manufacturing and storing large
quantities of G-B type nerve gas.
Lieutenant John Sheppard, newly
appointed public information officer at
the arsenal, acknowledged in a Daily
interview that, due to civilian pressure
and the growth of the city, the army
was discontinuing the storage of "large
quantities" of "chemical agents" at the
facility.
He also indicated that production
was being scaled down and, an 18,000
acre site, was acquired in 1942 and is
engaged in the production of munitions.
No Testing On Base
According to Sheppard no testing or
research takes place on the base,
although areas that could be testing sites
are visible on a hill behind the
administration building.
The army employs 1000 people at
the arsenal, 90 percent of whom are
civilians. They comprise the work force,
while the military complement deals
with base security and administrative
functions.
None of the civilians live on the base,
and although there appear to be enough
barracks for 300 men, only part of the
100 soldiers live on the base.
Security at the base is very tight and
entry is restricted. Visitors must be

cleared through the commander before
proceeding to the provost marshal's
officer where they are issued a visitors
badge.
The guardhouses at the entrances to
the arsenal are manned 24 hours a day
and are equipped with gas masks,
presumably as a protection against
possible leakage of "chemical agents."
Security Tightened
According to one of the guards,
security has been tightened up by the
new base commander, Lt. Col. John A.
Bryan. The public and press are not
normally allowed to enter the facility
although Shell Oil Co. leases land inside
the base and operates a chemical
manufacturing facility there.
The Army recently turned over 651
acres of arsenal property to the City of
Denver for expansion of Stapleton
Airport, thus saving the city
approximately $1.5 million in land
acquisition costs. Shortly afterward the
army announced plans to resume
"limited" pumping from wells
containing radioactive wastes.
Pumping was halted last year when
earth tremors occurred after pumping
began. Although no definite link was
established between the pumping and
the tremors, pumping was halted. No
reason was given as to why pumping was
being resumed.
DENVER, COLO—Many residents
of this mile-high city are becoming
increasingly concerned that they might
be quietly wiped out by an invisible but
deadly product of the arms race—nerve
gas.
Last year over 4,000 sheep were
killed in Utah and only a fortunate
change in wind direction saved Salt
Lake City when an unspecified amount
of nerve gas "escaped" from an army
test.
