## Success Down South 
### 
Santa Clara scored a run on a
single, a sacrifice, a force-out and
a passed ball in the gathering
gloom of the tenth ining late
yesterday to beat Stanford 6-5.
The Indians take on the Broncos
again today at 3:00 in Buck Shaw
Stadium in San Jose.
Yesterday's contest was an
angry, four-hour event which
began in bright, warm spring sun
shine and ended in cold light pro
vided by large moon rising over
the scoreboard. Both teams scored
once in the second inning, but the
visitors moved ahead with a four
run third, which was highlighted
by a run-producing double lashed
to left-center by Santa Clara third
baseman Bill McMongle, who
went four for four on the day.
The Tribe came back with one
in the fifth as Mark Marquess
walked, advanced on outs, and
scored on Russ Tweet's ground
single through shortstop. Stanford
tied the game with three more
runs the following frame. Pitcher
Phil Keller, who had relieved Bob
Boone in the top of the inning,
walked to lead off the sixth and
advanced on a single through
short by catcher Bob Edie. After
Marquess walked to load the bases
with none out, Santa Clara

brought in freshman pitcher Rich
Troesden, lanky southpaw,
Troesden quickly jeopardized the
prudence of this decision by walk
ing Jack Hodges on four pitches
to force in a run. Then two more
runs came across on a passed ball
while Mike Ewing was at the
plate.
The stage was thus set for the
extra inning, as the Indians could
do little more at the plate, but
kept the score tied with some
sparkling defense, including a
nifty 5-6-3 double play on a bunt
in the seventh. The last inning was
prolonged by lengthy and loud
debate among fans and partici
pants as to whether there was
enough light to continue play.
Actually, a bat would have had a
hard time reaching base in the
bottom of the tenth, as the
Indians found out. Unfortunately,
the umpires, who had seemed con
fused all day, decided that play
could—and would—continue.
Earlier coach Young's squad
had split a double-header with Los
Angeles State, here, on March 22,
then had won four and lost one in
a week-long jaunt in Southern Cal
ifornia.
Stanford won the first L.A.
State contest 2-1, in ten innings,

but lost the services of second
baseman Mike Ammirato in the
process. Ammirato broke his wrist
in an unsuccessful head-first slide
into home in the seventh frame of
the game probably ending his col
legiate career. The Tribe lost the
second game 5-2.
Two days later Rod Poteete
went nine innings to beat Cal Poly
at Pomona 3-1. The 6'7" Senior
gave up only four hits in the win.
Marquess had a hit and two runs
batted in, and Hodges and right
fielder Jack Lynn each had a pair
of hits.
On March 25 Keller and Bob
Marshall teamed up to beat Long
Beach State 11-5. Marquess' hot
streak continued as he collected
two triples and two singles with
two r.b.i's. Hodges and Boone also
had a pair of safeties. The next
day the Tribe romped over San
Fernando Valley State 19-10, as
nearly all the starters collected
hits. Boone shut out L.A. State on
March 28, giving up four hits and
hitting a homer in a 5-0 win. The
excursion ended with a 6-4 loss to
Chapman College in Anaheim on
March 29.
