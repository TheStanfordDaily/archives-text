## 
### 
Volunteers in Asia (VIA) will
send 60 young men and women
its largest group—to the Ear East
this year.
The Stanford-based "private
Peace Corps" sent undergraduates
to summer and six-month posi
tions and graduates to two-year
posts in seven Asian areas.
"Most of this year's program
comes as a result of increased stu
dent interest in longer-term in
volvement in Asian field work
assignments," said Dwight Clark,
VlA's executive director.
After four Stanford students
successfully completed the six
month program's trial run from
July to December 1968, 13 of
their fellows from Stanford and
the University of California-
Santa Cruz will follow them in the
coming academic year.
VIA began at Stanford in
1963, when a group of freshmen
decided that a service experience
in a developing country would not
only provide an outlet for their
idealism but add a valuable
personal education.
Most of the volunteers serve as

English teachers. English is the
second language of most Asian
countires. VIA assist promising
students and older professionals in
increasing their competency in the
spoken language. The Stanford
Linguistics Department and
School of Education will offer a
special course to prepare the
volunteers to teach English as a
second language. In addition,
other volunteers will teach mathe
matics, physical sciences, and
social sciences. Pre medical stu
dents will serve in clinics and hos
pitals.
'i he summer programs will
send volunteers to Hong Kong,
the Philippines, Japar, Korea and
Macao. Six-month students will go
to Indonesia, Nepal, the Philip
pines, Korea, Hong Kong, Japan.
Two-year volunteers have been
assigned to Indonesia, the Philip
pines, and Japan to augment
long-term volunteers already in
those countries.
The organization, largely
student-run, is entirely supported
by private contributions and the
work of the volunteers.
