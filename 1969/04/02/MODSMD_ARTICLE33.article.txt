# Premieres Coming To Summer Festival
## 
### 
Seven West Coast premieres
will be seen this August when the
City Center Joffrey Ballet returns
for its third season at the Stanford
Summer Festival.
The celebrated New York com
pany, which many critics have
credited with singlehandedly
triggering resurgence in dance
interest in America, will appear
Aug. 12-17.
Highlighting the seven
performance stand are four major
works introduced during the com
pany's just-completed spring
season in New York:
" Konservatoriet," "Facade,"
"Animus," and "William Tell
Variations."
Also new to the West Coast are
''The Lesson," "A Light
Fantastic," and "Fanfarita" from
the company's N.Y. season of
October 1968.
Repeating ballets which make
up the full repertory of 10 works
to be shown at Stanford are new
versions of "Astarte," "The
Clowns," and "Olympics."
"Konservatoriet," the classic
creation of the famed Danish
choreographer August Bournon
ville, is imported for its first
American production by Joffrey.
"Konservatoriet" is a series of ele
gant dances, an adornment to the
American repertory.
"Of compelling historical inter
est because it depicts dancing 120
years ago, this classic fragment is
also good ballet," Dance Critic
Clive Barnes wrote in The New
York Times.
"Facade" is Frederick Ashton's
great satirical look at the vaude
ville dances of the 1920'5. It is
another first American pro
duction, a special gift to the com
pany ' y Mr. Ashton.
iiree of the new works are
creations of Gerald Arpine, chief
Joffrey choreographer "A Light

Fantastic" is a stylish romp
danced a breakneck speeds, giving
modern interpretations to Renais
sance dance forms. "Fanfarita" is
an affectionate joke about
Spanish choreography, brilliantly
executed by the flashy Luis
Fuente. "Animus" appears on the
surface as a smooth and shiny
avant-garde ballet, but has an
undertone of hman anxiety.
"The Lesson" is the creation of
Netherlands Ballet Director
Flemming Flindt, and is based on
the lonesco horror story. Flindt's
highly theatrical piece depicts a
ballet master who is a pathological
killer and whose students are his
victims.
