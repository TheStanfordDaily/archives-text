A drama of passion and frus
tration, "Blood Wedding" by
Federico Garcia Lorca opening
April 2, will be the third play of
Stanford Repertory Theater's cur
rent season.
With poetry rich in the imagery
of nature and elemental forces,
Lorca describes the acheing sad
ness of frustration and loss. A
mother who has lost in feuds all
of her family but one remaining
son fears that he too may be con
sumed in the endless battles of
family honor. He is to be married
to a girl whose former sweetheart
was one of the family's bitterest
enemies. The conflict arises when
human desire comes face to face
with the unbending code of the
Spanish culture.
Written in 1933 by the young
poet who died a violent death
three years later in the Spanish
Civil War, "Blood Wedding"

stands not only as a modern
masterpiece of theater and poetry
but as a living reminder of the
hopes that men died for in 1936.
Although Lorca took his plot
idea from a sensational newspaper
story, he has molded it into a
timeless story, calling his charac
ters simply, "the Bride," "the
Bridegroom," "the Mother." The
rpoduction, under the direction of
Emily Garnica, follows a style of
abstract realism.
