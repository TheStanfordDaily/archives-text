# Bradley Leading LA Mayor Race
## 
### 
LOS ANGELES (AP)-City
Councilman Thomas Bradley, a Negro
supported by Democratic party leaders,
held a lead over Sam Yorty, the
Democratic incumbent, Tuesday night
in a mayor's election headed for a
runoff next month.
With 858 out of 2,888 precincts
reporting, the results for mayor were:
Bradley 77,745
Yorty 54,682
Former television newscaster Baxter
Ward 31,233
Rep. Alphonzo Bell, R-Calif. 27,520
In another race, Barry Goldwater Jr.,
son of the 1964 Republican presidential
nominee, ran ahead of his opponents in
a special congressional race in the Los
Angeles area.
With 34 out of 466 precincts
reporting, Goldwater has 2,540 votes to
his nearest challenger's 1,130. There
were nine other Republicans and six
Democrats in the race in the
traditionally Republican San Fernando
Valley area district.
Bradley told newsmen that early
returns were no surprise, declaring "I've
felt all along that the polls showing him
leading reflected what was happening."

Yorty, seeking an unprecedented
third term, is running up against
tradition. No mayor forced into a
runoff has been re-elected.
Bradley said voters—only 15 per cent
of whom are Negro—ignored the racial
issue. "Race is not relevant to this
campaign as much as a man's
background and ability to lead," he
said.
State Democratic leaders—wanting to
punish Yorty for his refusal to support
Democratic candidates in past
elections—has united behind Bradley in
a nonpartisan race.
Heavy voting was reported with
election supervisor Walter Peterson
forecasting "a record turnout—between
60 and 65 percent." The city clerk had
forecast 55-56 percent.
In the congressional race, election
officials stuck with their projection of
45 percent turnout. More than 350
congressional and mayoralty precincts
overlap.
John K. Van de Kamp, a former
Justice Department attorney backed by
organized labor and some volunteer
Democratic groups, and Gary
Schlessinger, an attorney, were
front-running Democrats in the
congressional contest.
Campaigning with help from
supporters of Sen. Edward M. Kennedy,
D-Mass., and former Vice President
Hubert H. Humphrey, Bradley united
the state Democratic organization
behind him.
Although the mayor's race is
nonpartisan, the party jumped in to try
to defeat Yorty, who endorsed Richard
Nixon over John F. Kennedy in 1960
and opposed then Gov. Edmund G.
Brown in the 1966 Democratic primary.
After the primary, Yorty refused to
endorse Brown.
Bradley, a 50-year-old attorney, is a
former policeman who joined the force
as a patrolman and rose to lieutenant
and night watch commander of a
predominantly white area in 20 years.
Victory would put him in the front
rank of Negro officials, along with
Mayors Richard Hatcher of Gary, Ind.,
and Carl Stokes of Cleveland.
Like his opponents, Bradley hit hard
at Yorty's record, pointing out that five
of the mayor's city commissioners have
been indicted on criminal charges.
