# Committee Member Speaks
## SRI Criticized As World Exploiter 
### SUSAN SWARD 
Though he speaks with vehemance
about "free" private enterprise's
exploitation of the Third World, Harry
Cleaver ? .. s that he must not be
classified as A Marxist economist.
Cleaver grew up in Dayton, Ohio,
where his father worked for the Air
Force. As an undergraduate at Antioch
he became involved in the civil rights
movement in the mid 60's. At Stanford
now as a graduate student in economics,
Cleaver is one of the five students sitting
on the Stanford Research Institute
(SRI) Study Committee set up by
Acting-President Robert Glaser.
When Cleaver came to Stanford last
year, he started working with the
Students for a Democratic Society
(SDS) because he felt that the group
was the only left-wing organization on
campus that was doing "anything of
interest." His association with SDS has
been an on-the-fringe relationship
consisting mainly of writing and
research.
During his own personal study of the
economic development of Latin
American countries, Cleaver became
acquainted with the extensive work in
Latin America being done by SRI and
the Graduate School of Business in
Lima, Peru, which was intially set up by
Stanford. As a result of his studies,
Cleaver came to see the major thrust of
SRl's international activities as "the
co-ordination of American corporate
expansion abroad."
Historical Perspective
As a contributor to the SRI Study
Committee's research on SRI itself.
Cleaver feels that SRl's ties with
Stanford may be put into an historical
perspective. According to Cleaver, the
founding charter of SRI states quite
clearly that Institute's purpose is to
support the growth of Pacific Coast
business.

The SRI Committee member sees
two major evolutions within SRl's
structure since the Institute came into
being after World War II: the increased
proportion of SRI research funded by
the federal government and the
increased support provided for
international business and international
military oppression.
Basically, Cleaver sees SRI as part of
a tri-partite system operating in the
local area. The university is "the brain
center providing basic research ability
for the surrounding industry. SRI
provides the applied research, and
industry produces the products."
Research Talent Pool
From the point of view of industry,
Cleaver maintains, SRI —operating as a
pool of diversified research
talent —presents the optimal solution to
the problem of overhead costs which

arise when small businesses attempt to
maintain large research staffs.
Seen through Cleaver's eyes, the
implications of SRl's ties with the
university are far-reaching at best and
disastrous at worst.
Because the university "is run by and
for the upper class" and has so many
ties with the industrial-military segment
of the society, Cleaver feels that the
opportunity for the university to be an
instrument for social critique and
change is extremely limited.
Private Enterprise Support
"In the maintainance of its
socio-economic role, the university
supports private industry," said Cleaver.
"The university is in fact controlled by
representatives of private enterprise: the
Trustees. Through their administrative
appointees, they operate the university
in such away as to maximize its
usefulness to private enterprise in
general without, of course, becoming a
simple trade school.
In its capacity as an adjunct of
"free" enterprise, Stanford "has
contributed to the economic
exploitation of most of the world by a
wealthy few," Cleaver states. "And by
helping to maintain the existence of
social classes, the university has helped
to create a society characterized by
artificiality and alienation. The isolation
of individuals from one another and the
de-human i z at i on of personal
relationships is perhaps the most terrible
results of this system."
In short, Cleaver is contending that
the university is presently far removed
from the area that should be its primary
concern—contributing toward a solution
of the major problems of economic
exploitation and social-political
alienation and racism.
Effective Solutions
In order for the university to help in
the search for effective solutions to

these problems, it must separate itself
from the present economic-political
structure in which it now controls it,
according to Cleaver.
This separation would mean that
Stanford would have to throw off its
ties with industry, and Cleaver
recognizes that the separation would
not come without tremendous financial
burden to the university.
Operating funds now obtained from
student tuition fees, endowment and
gifts would probably be reduced and
limited to individuals who approved of
Stanford's new orientation in the
economic-political sphere. Future funds
for construction such as the Aero-Astro
building would probably be cut off.
Cleaver admits that a totally new
orientation is impossible at this time
because there are not enough individuals
within and without the university who
would be willing to affect such a
separation.
No Stimulation for Students
The SRI Committee member's facial
expression took on a serious cast. "On
the whole," he observed, "the structure
of the university is not one which
stimulates students to look for solutions
to problems in a new way.
"If we really wish to solve the
devastating problems that surround us,
we must cut our ties with the forces
opposing change."

Stanford. As a result of his studies,
Cleaver came to see the major thrust of
SRl's international activities as "the
co-ordination of American corporate
expansion abroad."
Historical Perspective
As a contributor to the SRI Study
Committee's research on SRI itself.
Cleaver feels that SRl's ties with
Stanford may be put into an historical
perspective. According to Cleaver, the
founding charter of SRI states quite
clearly that Institute's purpose is to
support the growth of Pacific Coast
business.

The SRI Committee member sees
two major evolutions within SRl's
structure since the Institute came into
being after World War II: the increased
proportion of SRI research funded by
the federal government and the
increased support provided for
international business and international
military oppression.
Basically, Cleaver sees SRI as part of
a tri-partite system operating in the
local area. The university is "the brain
center providing basic research ability
for the surrounding industry. SRI
provides the applied research, and
industry produces the products."
Research Talent Pool
From the point of view of industry,
Cleaver maintains, SRI —operating as a
pool of diversified research
talent —presents the optimal solution to
the problem of overhead costs which

arise when small businesses attempt to
maintain large research staffs.
Seen through Cleaver's eyes, the
implications of SRl's ties with the
university are far-reaching at best and
disastrous at worst.
Because the university "is run by and
for the upper class" and has so many
ties with the industrial-military segment
of the society, Cleaver feels that the
opportunity for the university to be an
instrument for social critique and
change is extremely limited.
Private Enterprise Support
"In the maintainance of its
socio-economic role, the university
supports private industry," said Cleaver.
"The university is in fact controlled by
representatives of private enterprise: the
Trustees. Through their administrative
appointees, they operate the university
in such away as to maximize its
usefulness to private enterprise in
general without, of course, becoming a
simple trade school.
In its capacity as an adjunct of
"free" enterprise, Stanford "has
contributed to the economic
exploitation of most of the world by a
wealthy few," Cleaver states. "And by
helping to maintain the existence of
social classes, the university has helped
to create a society characterized by
artificiality and alienation. The isolation
of individuals from one another and the
de-human i z at i on of personal
relationships is perhaps the most terrible
results of this system."
In short, Cleaver is contending that
the university is presently far removed
from the area that should be its primary
concern—contributing toward a solution
of the major problems of economic
exploitation and social-political
alienation and racism.
Effective Solutions
In order for the university to help in
the search for effective solutions to

these problems, it must separate itself
from the present economic-political
structure in which it now controls it,
according to Cleaver.
This separation would mean that
Stanford would have to throw off its
ties with industry, and Cleaver
recognizes that the separation would
not come without tremendous financial
burden to the university.
Operating funds now obtained from
student tuition fees, endowment and
gifts would probably be reduced and
limited to individuals who approved of
Stanford's new orientation in the
economic-political sphere. Future funds
for construction such as the Aero-Astro
building would probably be cut off.
Cleaver admits that a totally new
orientation is impossible at this time
because there are not enough individuals
within and without the university who
would be willing to affect such a
separation.
No Stimulation for Students
The SRI Committee member's facial
expression took on a serious cast. "On
the whole," he observed, "the structure
of the university is not one which
stimulates students to look for solutions
to problems in a new way.
"If we really wish to solve the
devastating problems that surround us,
we must cut our ties with the forces
opposing change."


HARRY CLEAVER
Though he speaks with vehemance
about "free" private enterprise's
exploitation of the Third World, Harry
Cleaver ? .. s that he must not be
classified as A Marxist economist.
Cleaver grew up in Dayton, Ohio,
where his father worked for the Air
Force. As an undergraduate at Antioch
he became involved in the civil rights
movement in the mid 60's. At Stanford
now as a graduate student in economics,
Cleaver is one of the five students sitting
on the Stanford Research Institute
(SRI) Study Committee set up by
Acting-President Robert Glaser.
When Cleaver came to Stanford last
year, he started working with the
Students for a Democratic Society
(SDS) because he felt that the group
was the only left-wing organization on
campus that was doing "anything of
interest." His association with SDS has
been an on-the-fringe relationship
consisting mainly of writing and
research.
During his own personal study of the
economic development of Latin
American countries, Cleaver became
acquainted with the extensive work in
Latin America being done by SRI and
the Graduate School of Business in
Lima, Peru, which was intially set up by
Stanford. As a result of his studies,

the problem of overhead costs which

arise when small businesses attempt to
maintain large research staffs.
Seen through Cleaver's eyes, the
implications of SRl's ties with the
university are far-reaching at best and
disastrous at worst.
Because the university "is run by and
for the upper class" and has so many
ties with the industrial-military segment
of the society, Cleaver feels that the
opportunity for the university to be an
instrument for social critique and
change is extremely limited.
Private Enterprise Support
"In the maintainance of its
socio-economic role, the university
supports private industry," said Cleaver.
"The university is in fact controlled by
representatives of private enterprise: the
Trustees. Through their administrative
appointees, they operate the university
in such away as to maximize its
usefulness to private enterprise in
general without, of course, becoming a
simple trade school.
In its capacity as an adjunct of
"free" enterprise, Stanford "has
contributed to the economic
exploitation of most of the world by a
wealthy few," Cleaver states. "And by
helping to maintain the existence of
social classes, the university has helped
to create a society characterized by
artificiality and alienation. The isolation
of individuals from one another and the
de-human i z at i on of personal
relationships is perhaps the most terrible
results of this system."
In short, Cleaver is contending that
the university is presently far removed
from the area that should be its primary
concern—contributing toward a solution
of the major problems of economic
exploitation and social-political
alienation and racism.
Effective Solutions
In order for the university to help in
the search for effective solutions to

these problems, it must separate itself
from the present economic-political
structure in which it now controls it,
according to Cleaver.
This separation would mean that
Stanford would have to throw off its
ties with industry, and Cleaver
recognizes that the separation would
not come without tremendous financial
burden to the university.
Operating funds now obtained from
student tuition fees, endowment and
gifts would probably be reduced and
limited to individuals who approved of
Stanford's new orientation in the
economic-political sphere. Future funds
for construction such as the Aero-Astro
building would probably be cut off.
Cleaver admits that a totally new
orientation is impossible at this time
because there are not enough individuals
within and without the university who
would be willing to affect such a
separation.
No Stimulation for Students
The SRI Committee member's facial
expression took on a serious cast. "On
the whole," he observed, "the structure
of the university is not one which
stimulates students to look for solutions
to problems in a new way.
"If we really wish to solve the
devastating problems that surround us,
we must cut our ties with the forces
opposing change."


HARRY CLEAVER
Though he speaks with vehemance
about "free" private enterprise's
exploitation of the Third World, Harry
Cleaver ? .. s that he must not be
classified as A Marxist economist.
Cleaver grew up in Dayton, Ohio,
where his father worked for the Air
Force. As an undergraduate at Antioch
he became involved in the civil rights
movement in the mid 60's. At Stanford
now as a graduate student in economics,
Cleaver is one of the five students sitting
on the Stanford Research Institute
(SRI) Study Committee set up by
Acting-President Robert Glaser.
When Cleaver came to Stanford last
year, he started working with the
Students for a Democratic Society
(SDS) because he felt that the group
was the only left-wing organization on
campus that was doing "anything of
interest." His association with SDS has
been an on-the-fringe relationship
consisting mainly of writing and
research.
During his own personal study of the
economic development of Latin
American countries, Cleaver became
acquainted with the extensive work in
Latin America being done by SRI and
the Graduate School of Business in
Lima, Peru, which was intially set up by
Stanford. As a result of his studies,
Cleaver came to see the major thrust of
SRl's international activities as "the
co-ordination of American corporate
expansion abroad."
Historical Perspective
As a contributor to the SRI Study
Committee's research on SRI itself.
Cleaver feels that SRl's ties with
Stanford may be put into an historical
perspective. According to Cleaver, the
founding charter of SRI states quite
clearly that Institute's purpose is to
support the growth of Pacific Coast
business.

The SRI Committee member sees
two major evolutions within SRl's
structure since the Institute came into
being after World War II: the increased
proportion of SRI research funded by
the federal government and the
increased support provided for
international business and international
military oppression.
Basically, Cleaver sees SRI as part of
a tri-partite system operating in the
local area. The university is "the brain
center providing basic research ability
for the surrounding industry. SRI
provides the applied research, and
industry produces the products."
Research Talent Pool
From the point of view of industry,
Cleaver maintains, SRI —operating as a
pool of diversified research
talent —presents the optimal solution to
the problem of overhead costs which

arise when small businesses attempt to
maintain large research staffs.
Seen through Cleaver's eyes, the
implications of SRl's ties with the
university are far-reaching at best and
disastrous at worst.
Because the university "is run by and
for the upper class" and has so many
ties with the industrial-military segment
of the society, Cleaver feels that the
