For some it took a second to laugh,
others an hour, and there are still those
who are digging air raid shelters.
Yesterday's Minuteman story was a joke
for April 1. Yet its humor and impact were
too real for comfort. It is unlikely that the
Defense Departrhent would ever go haywire
enough to install a Minuteman site on uni
versity land. Yet more people than not be
lieved the story, probably because they
think the Pentagon capable of any insanity.
The theme of the campus and even
national reaction to the story was paranoia.
People are simply ready to believe the
military-industrial complex is everywhere.
Civilization is totally oriented to warheads
■and missiles and prepared to accept
thoughts of backyard bombs.
Motivation for the story was mixed
; partially to have fun, equally to make a
; point and hope people would be startled to
• think about a time when instant de
; struction is possible. More specifically, aca
= demic debate on the proposed ABM system
I

for the United States does not often inspire
desire to act on principle.
We hope most of the campus feels more
personally concerned about the ABM
today, having faced the question head-on,
if only for a bleary-eyed, bewildered
moment over breakfast yesterday.
The humor and the hoax were not a one
way street. The Daily was out manuevered
once yesterday. In a moment of sheer
panic, the editor tensely dialed the Penta
gon in Washington, returning a call to
David Packard's legal counsel, John Q.
Howell.
"Department of Defense, May I help
you?"
"Mr. John Q. Howell, please, in Secre
tary Packard's office."
"Who? I am sorry. There is no Mr.
Howell in the Department of Defense."
The paranoia had gone full circle.
No more jokes this year.
Just watch out for the Polaris submarine
in Lake Lagunita.
