The Daily may be only a student newspaper, but that doesn't mean we're just a bunch of amateurs. The
six editors and staffers you see above are also local representatives of professional publications—Time
magazine, Newsweek, The New York Times, Los Angeles Times, San Francisco Chronicle, and San Jose
Mercury. They make as much as $200 a month or more working for these august disseminators of the news.
Not all of the Daily staff is on this level, however. We welcome anyone—amateur or pro. Why not join us?
There will be a special orientation meeting for new staffers at the Daily office tomorrow at 4 p.m. (In case
you don't know where we are, the Daily-is located in the Storke Student Publications Building, Lomita
Drive between Panama and Santa Teresa.) If you can't make it then, call us and we'll contact you. But come
on over. Join the pros.
