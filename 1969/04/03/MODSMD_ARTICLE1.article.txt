# 'Coalition' Plans Meeting Today
## 
### CRAIG WILSON 
The SRI Coalition will step up its
operation today with a campus wide
meeting to formally discuss plans for
the Control of the Stanford Research
Institute. The meeting is scheduled for 4
p.m. in Dinkelspiel Auditorium.
The meeting will be conducted in the
form of an open discussion with a
prepared agenda. Doren Weinberg of the
law school will moderate.
According to a statement issued by
the Coalition earlier in the week,
persons are urged to attend who feel
"that chemical-biological warfare and
counter-insurgency research be stopped;
that a decision about the relations of
Stanford and SRI be made before the
end of the spring because of the nature
of that work and its effects; that
Stanford exert its control over SRI and
direct its work toward positive social
ends."
The meeting will attempt to set
down modes of action both political,
procedural and tactical.
"M inimal"
Paul Rupert of the Resistance said
yesterday that the meeting would
present "the minimal kinds of things we
feel; the least that could be asked of
Trustees."
"I feel we represent a large segment
of people. We don't have to talk in
terms of demands. We are the people. It
is up to the Trustees to prove to us why
23 men have the right to make decisions
which affect our lives. In fact, they are
the minority."
Place On Agenda
Rupert said he hoped the decisions
can be reached for presentation to
President Kenneth Pitzer and placement
on the agenda of the Trustees meeting
April 8 in San Francisco.
The appearance of the "program" on
the April 8 agenda would enable
discussion by the Trustees at the May
13 meeting.
Rupert says that the agenda will deal
first with the political action to be
sought: specifically, whether SRI should
be kept, or severed from the University.
Following that, the decision must be

.nade whether "we want to ask for an
end to Chemical and Biological
Research at SRI, or on campus as well."
Research Stoppage
There is also the possibility of asking
for "a research stoppage until the
decision is made,"
Procedurally, the question of
whether students are content to wait for
the meeting in May for
consideration—should a special trustee
meeting be requested in late April.
Rupert said it was also possible that a
community meeting might be called
with the trustees invited to attend.
Tactically, a march to SRI or a 24
hour vigil at the Trustees meeting are
possibilities to be considered.
Move Ouickly
Whatever occurs Rupert emphasized
that the "program" must be decided
upon quickly and presented to President
Pitzer as rapidly as possible.
Yesterday a flyer was circulated on
campus urging the community to attend
the meeting stating in part, "We believe
a large number of people in this
community share our basic assumptions
that the university should be a positive
and creative force in the society and
that its research and research institute
should become better vehicles for
fulfilling such goals; that chemical and
biological warfare studies and
counter-insurgency research are
indefensible; that any decision on these
issues and, specifically, on retaining and
improving SRI must be made openly in
the community; and that the urgency of
these issues demands a decision during
the course of Spring Quarter.

The SRI Coalition will step up its
operation today with a campus wide
meeting to formally discuss plans for
the Control of the Stanford Research
Institute. The meeting is scheduled for 4
p.m. in Dinkelspiel Auditorium.
The meeting will be conducted in the
form of an open discussion with a
prepared agenda. Doren Weinberg of the
law school will moderate.
According to a statement issued by
the Coalition earlier in the week,
persons are urged to attend who feel
"that chemical-biological warfare and
counter-insurgency research be stopped;
that a decision about the relations of
Stanford and SRI be made before the
end of the spring because of the nature
of that work and its effects; that
Stanford exert its control over SRI and
direct its work toward positive social
ends."
The meeting will attempt to set
down modes of action both political,
procedural and tactical.
"M inimal"
Paul Rupert of the Resistance said
yesterday that the meeting would
present "the minimal kinds of things we
feel; the least that could be asked of
Trustees."
"I feel we represent a large segment
of people. We don't have to talk in
terms of demands. We are the people. It
is up to the Trustees to prove to us why
23 men have the right to make decisions
which affect our lives. In fact, they are
the minority."
Place On Agenda
Rupert said he hoped the decisions
can be reached for presentation to
President Kenneth Pitzer and placement
on the agenda of the Trustees meeting
April 8 in San Francisco.
The appearance of the "program" on
the April 8 agenda would enable
discussion by the Trustees at the May
13 meeting.
Rupert says that the agenda will deal
first with the political action to be
sought: specifically, whether SRI should
be kept, or severed from the University.
Following that, the decision must be

.nade whether "we want to ask for an
end to Chemical and Biological
Research at SRI, or on campus as well."
Research Stoppage
There is also the possibility of asking
for "a research stoppage until the
decision is made,"
Procedurally, the question of
whether students are content to wait for
the meeting in May for
consideration—should a special trustee
meeting be requested in late April.
Rupert said it was also possible that a
community meeting might be called
with the trustees invited to attend.
Tactically, a march to SRI or a 24
hour vigil at the Trustees meeting are
possibilities to be considered.
Move Ouickly
Whatever occurs Rupert emphasized
that the "program" must be decided
upon quickly and presented to President
Pitzer as rapidly as possible.
Yesterday a flyer was circulated on
campus urging the community to attend
the meeting stating in part, "We believe
a large number of people in this
community share our basic assumptions
that the university should be a positive
and creative force in the society and
that its research and research institute
should become better vehicles for
fulfilling such goals; that chemical and
biological warfare studies and
counter-insurgency research are
indefensible; that any decision on these
issues and, specifically, on retaining and
