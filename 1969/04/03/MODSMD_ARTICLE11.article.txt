In the report of the SHS committee on
government of the university (published in
The Daily last quarter) two interrelated
phenomena were pervasive: assumptions
which led to a treatment of
decision-making from an elitist perspective
and assumptions which led to a
condescending treatment of students.
In the published report the footnote
commentary of ASSU president Denis
Hayes, while differing in tone from the rest
of the report, spoke to the issues in a
revealing way. When compared with the
report itself, Haye's remarks showed much
greater perception of the true state of
affairs on campus and of the needs of the
University.
The tone of the university government
report at times is sheer institutional
self-congratulation. The report says:
"Stanford is far from being poorly
equipped to withstand the shocks that will
inevitably attend this time of change."
Though radicals will notice the assumption
here that the University should survive, in
the context of the Study of Education it is
certainly relevant for us to point out that
now is no time for the University patting
itself on the back.
The January 1968 of UC Berkeley's
Study Commission on University
Governance said: "The inertia of our
institutions and our lack ot a rooted
tradition of educational innovation have
had a paradoxical result: they have led to a
brave and unwarranted complacency, as
though the campus truly believed its
official rhetoric that this is a 'great
university,' the peer of any institution of
higher learning in the world."
No similar recognition of the failures ot
Stanford can be found in the SES report.
This is indicative of the committee's failure
to go to the roots of the "governance
crisis" which it mentions. In differentiating
the University from other social
institutions—business corporations, labor
unions, and political entities—the report
fails to note and comprehend why these
institutions and the universities are all
having a "governance crisis."
The SES steering committee charged its
committee on government of the university
to consider "what institutional
arrangements will best advance the conduct
of the University's affairs, showing due

regard Tor the appropriate role of each of
its constituent elements."
When given a similar mission the study
commission at Berkeley had protested
saying: "Clearly the campus 'society' is
here viewed as a collection of status-bound
interest groups, each having a special
preserve and each possessing claims to
participation in varying degrees-subject to
negotiation--in the activities assigned to the
other components." The Berkeley
governance commission did not find
university government to be preordained as
a pluralism of collective bargaining by
interest groups. But the SES committee
report takes the opposite tack, saying, for
example, that the concept of community
government is "quite without operational
content," and then going on to make
procedural reforms in the present system.
Denis Hayes resonds in a footnote,
pointing out that the common thread in all
proposals for community government "is
that there should be a central
student-faculty deliberative body to
evaluate and pass judgement on items of
mutual concern. The Stanford faculty has
repeatedly shown itself far too jealous of
its authority to seriously consider sharing it
in this manner."
The fact that the SES report starts its
treatment of Stanford government with the
phrase "to begin at the top" shows what
assumptions are accepted. Instead of
starting with the question of what
government the students and faculty need
to further the educational endeavor, the
report searches for the approprate reforms
and new powers for the existing University
administration and the faculty
governmental structure. It begins with the
University presdent and not with the
students and faculty-the victims of the
"governance crisis."
From the description of the Trustees as
an "able" group and "one of the
University's great strengths" to the
statement that "a direct student voice and
vote in the faculty selection process would
be inappropriate," the report treats
government as a top-down process. As
Denis Hayes comments, today's students
are not asking for a "right to give advice."
What both students and faculty need now
is participation and self-determination in
education.
