# From The Ivory Tower
## Daily Accused Of Cover-up 
### Robert M. Brown 
I am surprised and shocked by
your attempt to dismiss your
April 1 Minuteman scoop as an
"April Fool Story" (Stanford
Daily, Vol. 155, No. 28, April 2,
1969, p. 1), Your purpose in
breaking the story initially was
transparently clear: you wanted
to embarrass the administration,
and particularly President Pitzer,
by making a non-negotiable
demand upon him, as you did in
your cogent editorial, insisting
that he have the Minuteman site
dismantled immediately.
The fact that he met your
demand promptly is something
that you should have had the
journalistic honesty to admit. It is
curious that you are always
willing to attack the
administration, but are unwilling
to report the news when the
administration does something
creative. Thus, rather than telling
your readers about President
Pitzer's heroic and successful
efforts on the morning of April 1,
you employed the subterfuge of
an "April Fool" retraction, trying
to make it look as though there
had never been a missile site at all.
I called President Pitzer's office
as soon as I read your April 1
story and editorial, to lodge a
protest, and threaten to refuse to
use any' of the recreational
facilities on the Stanford campus
until such time as the missile site
was removed. This was a 9:06
a.m. I was informed at that time
(about 9:06.30 a.m.) by President
Pitzer's secretary, that my act of
protest would be unnecessary,
since Dr. Pitzer had already had
the missile site removed.
Unbelieving, I immediately
went out to the Stanford hills to
check on the veracity of her
report, and discovered this to be
the case, thereby making myself
two minutes late for my 10 a.m.
class, as well over 100 students are
willing to testify in court. I was,
needless to say, highly impressed
with this degree of administration
efficiency in dealing so promptly
with a problem, and by dint of
assiduous sleuthing (which I think
should have been more properly
the task of your own reporters)
pieced together the facts of the
case, whicH I think your readers
are entitled to know:
a. at 6:17 a.m. President Pitzer
was informed of the existence of
the missile site, by a former

trustee of the university now
temporarily attached to the
Pentagon.
b. at 6:29 a.m. President
Pitzer, Provost Lyman, and 67
members of SDS, started for the
hills to confirm the existence of
the missile site. Provost Lyman's
right hand was badly burned as he
held the highly charged electric
wire under which President Pitzer
ducked.
c. at 7:14 a.m. President
Pitzer, a former chemist, entered
the Chemistry Building. Provost
Lyman's left hand was badly cut
as he picked the lock to the chem
lab with a hairpin he had
borrowed from Mrs. Provost
Lyman.
d. at exactly 7:30 a.m.
President Pitzer shouted "Eureka"
(an ancient formula common
among scientists of his degree of
eminence) and whispered to
Provost Lyman that he had
worked out a formula which
would make the Minuteman
self-destruct.
e. while Assistant to the
President Fred Glover crept back
up the hill to the missile site and
poured the recently discovered
combination of chemicals (Top
Secret) into the top of the
installation, Provost Richard
Lyman got busy on the telephone.
These activities consumed about
24, and no more than 25,
minutes.
112. at 8:03 a.m. the
Commandant at the Moffett Field
Naval AirStationreceived a phone
call, which he presumed to be
from the White House, since the
caller identified himself as
"Richard ..." (the second name
being lost through a faulty
connection) and said, "You are
hereby instructed to launch the
twelve Minutemen in compliance
with the code word Stanford Red,
since our radar scope has picked
up rockets on their way from
Moscow."
g. at 8:03.31, the
Commandant, obeying orders
from his supposed
commander-in-chief, pressed the
button, and the Minutemen,
impregnated with the fluid
developed by President Pitzer (see
points d and e above),
self-destructed by dissolving into a
pool of water.
h. the "earthquake" which all
of us felt at 8:03.32 a.m. (and

which you curiously failed to
report in your April 2 edition)
was in reality this chemical
transformation, to be known by
historians of science as the "Pitzer
Effect."
i. When 1 arrived at the site at
about 9:24 a.m., all I discovered
was a water reservoir. Q.E.D.
I hope that the revealing of this
sequence of events (to the
authenticity of which I am willing
to swear on a stack of King James
Bibles, but not on any modern
translations) will set your readers
straight, and lead them to look
with great suspicion on any
similar face-saving devices you
employ in the future, when you
are unable to embarrass the
administration and are forced to
resort to such preposterous
journalistic hoaxes as "April 2"
retractions.

Robert McAfee Brown
I am surprised and shocked by
your attempt to dismiss your
April 1 Minuteman scoop as an
"April Fool Story" (Stanford
Daily, Vol. 155, No. 28, April 2,
1969, p. 1), Your purpose in
breaking the story initially was
transparently clear: you wanted
to embarrass the administration,
and particularly President Pitzer,
by making a non-negotiable
demand upon him, as you did in
your cogent editorial, insisting
that he have the Minuteman site
dismantled immediately.
The fact that he met your
demand promptly is something
that you should have had the
journalistic honesty to admit. It is
curious that you are always
willing to attack the
administration, but are unwilling
to report the news when the
administration does something
creative. Thus, rather than telling
your readers about President
Pitzer's heroic and successful
efforts on the morning of April 1,
you employed the subterfuge of
an "April Fool" retraction, trying
to make it look as though there
had never been a missile site at all.
I called President Pitzer's office
as soon as I read your April 1
story and editorial, to lodge a
protest, and threaten to refuse to
use any' of the recreational
facilities on the Stanford campus
until such time as the missile site
was removed. This was a 9:06
a.m. I was informed at that time
(about 9:06.30 a.m.) by President
Pitzer's secretary, that my act of
protest would be unnecessary,
since Dr. Pitzer had already had
the missile site removed.
Unbelieving, I immediately
went out to the Stanford hills to
check on the veracity of her
report, and discovered this to be
the case, thereby making myself
two minutes late for my 10 a.m.
class, as well over 100 students are
willing to testify in court. I was,
needless to say, highly impressed
with this degree of administration
efficiency in dealing so promptly
with a problem, and by dint of
assiduous sleuthing (which I think
should have been more properly
the task of your own reporters)
pieced together the facts of the
case, whicH I think your readers
are entitled to know:
a. at 6:17 a.m. President Pitzer
was informed of the existence of
the missile site, by a former

trustee of the university now
temporarily attached to the
Pentagon.
b. at 6:29 a.m. President
Pitzer, Provost Lyman, and 67
members of SDS, started for the
hills to confirm the existence of
the missile site. Provost Lyman's
right hand was badly burned as he
held the highly charged electric
wire under which President Pitzer
ducked.
c. at 7:14 a.m. President
Pitzer, a former chemist, entered
the Chemistry Building. Provost
Lyman's left hand was badly cut
as he picked the lock to the chem
lab with a hairpin he had
borrowed from Mrs. Provost
Lyman.
d. at exactly 7:30 a.m.
President Pitzer shouted "Eureka"
(an ancient formula common
among scientists of his degree of
eminence) and whispered to
Provost Lyman that he had
worked out a formula which
would make the Minuteman
self-destruct.
e. while Assistant to the
President Fred Glover crept back
up the hill to the missile site and
poured the recently discovered
combination of chemicals (Top
Secret) into the top of the
installation, Provost Richard
Lyman got busy on the telephone.
These activities consumed about
24, and no more than 25,
minutes.
112. at 8:03 a.m. the
Commandant at the Moffett Field
Naval AirStationreceived a phone
call, which he presumed to be
from the White House, since the
caller identified himself as
"Richard ..." (the second name
being lost through a faulty
connection) and said, "You are
hereby instructed to launch the
twelve Minutemen in compliance
with the code word Stanford Red,
since our radar scope has picked
up rockets on their way from
Moscow."
g. at 8:03.31, the
Commandant, obeying orders
from his supposed
commander-in-chief, pressed the
button, and the Minutemen,
impregnated with the fluid
developed by President Pitzer (see
points d and e above),

eminence) and whispered to
Provost Lyman that he had
worked out a formula which
would make the Minuteman
self-destruct.
e. while Assistant to the
President Fred Glover crept back
up the hill to the missile site and
poured the recently discovered
combination of chemicals (Top
Secret) into the top of the
installation, Provost Richard
Lyman got busy on the telephone.
These activities consumed about
24, and no more than 25,
minutes.
112. at 8:03 a.m. the
Commandant at the Moffett Field
Naval AirStationreceived a phone
call, which he presumed to be
from the White House, since the
caller identified himself as
"Richard ..." (the second name
being lost through a faulty
connection) and said, "You are
hereby instructed to launch the
twelve Minutemen in compliance
with the code word Stanford Red,
since our radar scope has picked
up rockets on their way from
Moscow."
g. at 8:03.31, the
Commandant, obeying orders
from his supposed
commander-in-chief, pressed the
button, and the Minutemen,
impregnated with the fluid
developed by President Pitzer (see
points d and e above),
self-destructed by dissolving into a
pool of water.
h. the "earthquake" which all
of us felt at 8:03.32 a.m. (and

which you curiously failed to
report in your April 2 edition)
was in reality this chemical
transformation, to be known by
historians of science as the "Pitzer
Effect."
i. When 1 arrived at the site at
about 9:24 a.m., all I discovered
was a water reservoir. Q.E.D.
I hope that the revealing of this
sequence of events (to the
authenticity of which I am willing
to swear on a stack of King James
Bibles, but not on any modern
translations) will set your readers
straight, and lead them to look
with great suspicion on any
similar face-saving devices you
employ in the future, when you
are unable to embarrass the
administration and are forced to
resort to such preposterous
journalistic hoaxes as "April 2"
retractions.
Robert McAfee Brown
I am surprised and shocked by
your attempt to dismiss your
April 1 Minuteman scoop as an
"April Fool Story" (Stanford
Daily, Vol. 155, No. 28, April 2,
1969, p. 1), Your purpose in
breaking the story initially was
transparently clear: you wanted
to embarrass the administration,
and particularly President Pitzer,
by making a non-negotiable
demand upon him, as you did in
your cogent editorial, insisting
that he have the Minuteman site
dismantled immediately.
The fact that he met your
demand promptly is something
that you should have had the
journalistic honesty to admit. It is
curious that you are always
willing to attack the
administration, but are unwilling
to report the news when the
administration does something
creative. Thus, rather than telling
your readers about President
Pitzer's heroic and successful
efforts on the morning of April 1,
you employed the subterfuge of
an "April Fool" retraction, trying
to make it look as though there
had never been a missile site at all.
I called President Pitzer's office
as soon as I read your April 1
story and editorial, to lodge a
protest, and threaten to refuse to
use any' of the recreational
facilities on the Stanford campus
until such time as the missile site
was removed. This was a 9:06
a.m. I was informed at that time
(about 9:06.30 a.m.) by President
Pitzer's secretary, that my act of
protest would be unnecessary,
since Dr. Pitzer had already had
the missile site removed.
Unbelieving, I immediately
went out to the Stanford hills to
check on the veracity of her
report, and discovered this to be
the case, thereby making myself
two minutes late for my 10 a.m.
class, as well over 100 students are
willing to testify in court. I was,
needless to say, highly impressed
with this degree of administration
efficiency in dealing so promptly
with a problem, and by dint of
assiduous sleuthing (which I think
should have been more properly
the task of your own reporters)
pieced together the facts of the
case, whicH I think your readers
are entitled to know:
a. at 6:17 a.m. President Pitzer
was informed of the existence of
the missile site, by a former

trustee of the university now
temporarily attached to the
Pentagon.
b. at 6:29 a.m. President
Pitzer, Provost Lyman, and 67
members of SDS, started for the
hills to confirm the existence of
the missile site. Provost Lyman's
right hand was badly burned as he
held the highly charged electric
wire under which President Pitzer
ducked.
c. at 7:14 a.m. President
Pitzer, a former chemist, entered
the Chemistry Building. Provost
Lyman's left hand was badly cut
as he picked the lock to the chem
lab with a hairpin he had
borrowed from Mrs. Provost
Lyman.
d. at exactly 7:30 a.m.
President Pitzer shouted "Eureka"
(an ancient formula common
among scientists of his degree of
eminence) and whispered to
Provost Lyman that he had
worked out a formula which
would make the Minuteman
self-destruct.
e. while Assistant to the
President Fred Glover crept back

combination of chemicals (Top
