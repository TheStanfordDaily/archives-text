Yes, California is slipping
away:
The SDS fault, accompanied
by the Black Panther thrust and
the BSU, is slipping off to the left
to the north.
To the right of the SDS fault
the YAF and the YR segment are
moving south horizontally
accompanied by the Stanford
Board of Trustees and the
Administration.
The SDS fault indeed is moving
into a deep void, contrary to the
optimistic opinion of the eminent
Dr. Richard Henry Jahns,whom I
respect greatly indeed.
This deep void consists of
chaos, anarchy, riots and
revolution led by the Pied Piper
Associate Prof. H. Bruce Franklin
of the English Department and his
cohorts of the behavioral sciences.

The epicenter of the SDS fault
is located some 30 miles north of
The Farm at a place called San
Francisco State College. The force
of this epicenter, in constant
turmoil and motion, approaches
Force 10 on the Richter scale,
which is maximum. Buildings have
been wrecked at SFSC as a result
of this temblor, never before seen
since 1906.
The great majority of Stanford
students, however, are "weakly
magnetized" (as per Robert L.
Kovach, associate professor of
geophysics, School of Earth
Sciences) and only dimly realize
that activist SDS forces of
destruction on every campus are
shrewdly manipulated by
organizers who have fanned out
all over the nation.
