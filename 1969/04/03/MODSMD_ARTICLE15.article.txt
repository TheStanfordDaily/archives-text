# But No Siesta
## Students Work in Mexicali 
### BARBARA HYLAND 
Grimy, sunburnt, and
splattered with paint, many of the
Stanford students who spent
Spring Break on the Mexicali
Work Project looked like migrant
workers as they recrossed the
Mexican border into California. It
was not surprising that custom
officials viewed them skeptically
for they seemed the antithesis of
clean-cut Stanford youth.
Personal belongings and several
cars were extensively searched for
"grassy products." In one case an
official even checked the gas tank.
It seemed strange being back in
the United States again with its

paved roads, houses with inside
plumbing, dimes, mild food,
dustless air, and quiet streets. The
week in Mexicali had given
everyone a glance at a different
culture that one could not help
but miss a little. The "manana"
procrastination was replaced by
efficiency and haste. Compared to
the laughing, easy way of life in
Mexicali, cities like L.A. seemed
painfully sterile and cold on the
way back.
The week in Mexicali was a
true vacation, a total change from
the mental strain of exam week.
Under the auspices of the Rotary
Club 72 students had come to

Mexicali to do physical work.
They stayed at Ihe Casa de la
Juventud, a national youth center,
which is the Mexican equivalent
of a glorified YMCA. Since it had
a pool, gym, and showers, sleeping
at the Casa was hardly roughing it.
School children came there
everyday after school so there was
constant contact with the
Mexicans. Highlights of the stay
there included the USA vs.
Mexico basketball game, which
the U.S. lost, and a rock dance
that Stanford gave for the
Mexicans. Despite the repetitive
music (there were only four
records), it drew a larger number
of kids.
Numerous Industries
The week began with a briefing
from the American consul in
Mexicali. He explained that
Mexicali differs from other border
towns because of its numerous
industries. Several large American
firms have set up assembly plants
because of the available cheap
labor. Even with added costs for
duties and transportation it is still
profitable for these companies to
have plants there.
On hearing of the 80c an hour
wage that the American
companies offer, several Stanford
students became indignant and
asked the consul if he did not
think the U.S. was exploiting the
workers. He countered by saying
that if the U.S. did not hire these
workers they would be
unemployed. The meeting ended
with many people feeling bitter
about the United States' role in
developing Mexico.
On the first work day students
split into two work parties. Some
painted a school house; the others
rebuilt and painted a building that
is to be an orthopedic clinic.
Huck Finn Venture
Working at the school turned
into a Huckleberry Finn-type
venture, with the children doing
as much painting as the Stanford
students. Besides painting, there
were volleyball games, basketball
games, and even school lunches.
Stanford students were supposed
to plant trees around the grounds
and spent a day with picks and
shovels trying to dig the hard
earth. The trees never came so the
elementary school is now
surrounded by pits two feet deep.
Work at the clinic was more
strenuous and lacked the
continuous association with the

Mexicans that one found at the
school. The building was repaired;
roofing and masonry were also
done. Both the inside and outside
were painted. It is now ready to
be used for a workshop to make
braces in connection with the
orthopedic clinic.
Although much work was
accomplished, students still had
several days to tour the Mexicali
area. One trip was to Guadalupe
Canyon, an oasis 35 miles into a
desert. Noted for its hot mineral
springs, it has lush foliage which is
in contrast with the sand and rock
mountains abounding it. Students
spent a day there sunning,
swimming, and hiking to a
waterfall.
Obnoxious Tourists
Another day was spent on the
beach at a small fishing village,
San Felipe, on the Gulf of
California. Seeing obnoxious
tourists at their best made many
people thankful that the group
had worked in Mexicali which
does not attract tourists.
Other activities in free time
included a rodeo, a carnival, a
party at a nearby college, and a
Rotary dinner where they showed
slides of Alaska.
At nights most people headed
for the town of Mexicali for
dinner. Just walking the streets
turned out to be entertaining. A
carnival atmosphere prevailed.
Vendors sell their wares in the
roads and most of the citizens
stand around on the sidewalks. If
it weren't for little barefoot boys
in ripped shirts trying to sell
chewing gum, one could almost
forget that there is so much
poverty and unemployment in
this seemingly happy town.
One of Mexicali's major
industries is beer and Stanford
students took this opportunity to
support Mexican business. The
"Caballo Blanco" with its fat
women who dance for a peso was
frequented for its beer and live
music.
Although Montezuma's
Revenge and the flu took their
toll, most students who went on
the Work Project agreed that it
was an enjoyable and worthwhile
way to spend vacation. The more
cynical members of the group
noted that Stanford students
enthusiastically rush to Mexico to
do social work and yet ignore the
less exotic work needed in East
Palo Alto.

cynical members of the group
noted that Stanford students
enthusiastically rush to Mexico to
do social work and yet ignore the
less exotic work needed in East
Palo Alto.
Grimy, sunburnt, and
splattered with paint, many of the
Stanford students who spent
Spring Break on the Mexicali
Work Project looked like migrant
workers as they recrossed the
Mexican border into California. It
was not surprising that custom
officials viewed them skeptically
for they seemed the antithesis of
clean-cut Stanford youth.
Personal belongings and several
cars were extensively searched for
"grassy products." In one case an
official even checked the gas tank.
It seemed strange being back in
the United States again with its

paved roads, houses with inside
plumbing, dimes, mild food,
dustless air, and quiet streets. The
week in Mexicali had given
everyone a glance at a different
culture that one could not help
but miss a little. The "manana"
procrastination was replaced by
efficiency and haste. Compared to
the laughing, easy way of life in
Mexicali, cities like L.A. seemed
painfully sterile and cold on the
way back.
The week in Mexicali was a
true vacation, a total change from
the mental strain of exam week.
Under the auspices of the Rotary
Club 72 students had come to

Mexicali to do physical work.
They stayed at Ihe Casa de la
Juventud, a national youth center,
which is the Mexican equivalent
of a glorified YMCA. Since it had
a pool, gym, and showers, sleeping
at the Casa was hardly roughing it.
School children came there
everyday after school so there was
constant contact with the
Mexicans. Highlights of the stay
there included the USA vs.
Mexico basketball game, which
the U.S. lost, and a rock dance
that Stanford gave for the
Mexicans. Despite the repetitive
music (there were only four
records), it drew a larger number
of kids.
Numerous Industries
The week began with a briefing
from the American consul in
Mexicali. He explained that
Mexicali differs from other border
towns because of its numerous
industries. Several large American
firms have set up assembly plants
because of the available cheap
labor. Even with added costs for
duties and transportation it is still
profitable for these companies to
have plants there.
On hearing of the 80c an hour
wage that the American
companies offer, several Stanford
students became indignant and
asked the consul if he did not
think the U.S. was exploiting the
workers. He countered by saying
that if the U.S. did not hire these
workers they would be
unemployed. The meeting ended
with many people feeling bitter
about the United States' role in
developing Mexico.
On the first work day students
split into two work parties. Some
painted a school house; the others
rebuilt and painted a building that
is to be an orthopedic clinic.
Huck Finn Venture
Working at the school turned
into a Huckleberry Finn-type
venture, with the children doing
as much painting as the Stanford
students. Besides painting, there
were volleyball games, basketball
games, and even school lunches.
Stanford students were supposed
to plant trees around the grounds
and spent a day with picks and
shovels trying to dig the hard
earth. The trees never came so the
elementary school is now
surrounded by pits two feet deep.
Work at the clinic was more
strenuous and lacked the
continuous association with the

Mexicans that one found at the
school. The building was repaired;
roofing and masonry were also
done. Both the inside and outside
were painted. It is now ready to
be used for a workshop to make
braces in connection with the
orthopedic clinic.
Although much work was
accomplished, students still had
several days to tour the Mexicali
area. One trip was to Guadalupe
Canyon, an oasis 35 miles into a
desert. Noted for its hot mineral
springs, it has lush foliage which is
in contrast with the sand and rock
mountains abounding it. Students
spent a day there sunning,
swimming, and hiking to a
waterfall.
Obnoxious Tourists
Another day was spent on the
beach at a small fishing village,
San Felipe, on the Gulf of
California. Seeing obnoxious
tourists at their best made many
people thankful that the group
had worked in Mexicali which
does not attract tourists.
Other activities in free time
included a rodeo, a carnival, a
party at a nearby college, and a
Rotary dinner where they showed
slides of Alaska.
At nights most people headed
for the town of Mexicali for
dinner. Just walking the streets
turned out to be entertaining. A
carnival atmosphere prevailed.
Vendors sell their wares in the
roads and most of the citizens
stand around on the sidewalks. If
it weren't for little barefoot boys
in ripped shirts trying to sell
chewing gum, one could almost
forget that there is so much
poverty and unemployment in
this seemingly happy town.
One of Mexicali's major
industries is beer and Stanford
students took this opportunity to
support Mexican business. The
"Caballo Blanco" with its fat
women who dance for a peso was
frequented for its beer and live
music.
Although Montezuma's
Revenge and the flu took their
toll, most students who went on
the Work Project agreed that it
was an enjoyable and worthwhile
way to spend vacation. The more
cynical members of the group
noted that Stanford students

Revenge and the flu took their
toll, most students who went on
the Work Project agreed that it
was an enjoyable and worthwhile
way to spend vacation. The more
cynical members of the group
noted that Stanford students
enthusiastically rush to Mexico to
do social work and yet ignore the
less exotic work needed in East
Palo Alto.
Grimy, sunburnt, and
splattered with paint, many of the
Stanford students who spent
Spring Break on the Mexicali
Work Project looked like migrant
workers as they recrossed the
Mexican border into California. It
was not surprising that custom
officials viewed them skeptically
for they seemed the antithesis of
clean-cut Stanford youth.
Personal belongings and several
cars were extensively searched for
"grassy products." In one case an
official even checked the gas tank.
It seemed strange being back in
the United States again with its

paved roads, houses with inside
plumbing, dimes, mild food,
dustless air, and quiet streets. The
week in Mexicali had given
everyone a glance at a different
culture that one could not help
but miss a little. The "manana"
procrastination was replaced by
efficiency and haste. Compared to
the laughing, easy way of life in
Mexicali, cities like L.A. seemed
painfully sterile and cold on the
way back.
The week in Mexicali was a
true vacation, a total change from
the mental strain of exam week.
Under the auspices of the Rotary
Club 72 students had come to

Mexicali to do physical work.
They stayed at Ihe Casa de la
Juventud, a national youth center,
which is the Mexican equivalent
of a glorified YMCA. Since it had
a pool, gym, and showers, sleeping
at the Casa was hardly roughing it.
School children came there
everyday after school so there was
constant contact with the
Mexicans. Highlights of the stay
there included the USA vs.
Mexico basketball game, which
the U.S. lost, and a rock dance
that Stanford gave for the
Mexicans. Despite the repetitive
music (there were only four
records), it drew a larger number
of kids.
Numerous Industries
The week began with a briefing
from the American consul in
Mexicali. He explained that
Mexicali differs from other border
towns because of its numerous
industries. Several large American
firms have set up assembly plants
because of the available cheap
labor. Even with added costs for
duties and transportation it is still
profitable for these companies to
have plants there.
On hearing of the 80c an hour
wage that the American
companies offer, several Stanford
students became indignant and
asked the consul if he did not
think the U.S. was exploiting the
workers. He countered by saying
that if the U.S. did not hire these
workers they would be
unemployed. The meeting ended
with many people feeling bitter
about the United States' role in
developing Mexico.
On the first work day students
split into two work parties. Some
painted a school house; the others
rebuilt and painted a building that
is to be an orthopedic clinic.
Huck Finn Venture
Working at the school turned
into a Huckleberry Finn-type
venture, with the children doing
as much painting as the Stanford
students. Besides painting, there
were volleyball games, basketball
games, and even school lunches.
Stanford students were supposed
to plant trees around the grounds
and spent a day with picks and
shovels trying to dig the hard
earth. The trees never came so the
elementary school is now
surrounded by pits two feet deep.
Work at the clinic was more
strenuous and lacked the
continuous association with the

Mexicans that one found at the
school. The building was repaired;
roofing and masonry were also
done. Both the inside and outside
were painted. It is now ready to
be used for a workshop to make
braces in connection with the
orthopedic clinic.
Although much work was
accomplished, students still had
several days to tour the Mexicali
area. One trip was to Guadalupe
Canyon, an oasis 35 miles into a
desert. Noted for its hot mineral
springs, it has lush foliage which is
in contrast with the sand and rock
mountains abounding it. Students
spent a day there sunning,
swimming, and hiking to a
waterfall.
Obnoxious Tourists
Another day was spent on the
beach at a small fishing village,
San Felipe, on the Gulf of
California. Seeing obnoxious
tourists at their best made many
people thankful that the group
had worked in Mexicali which
does not attract tourists.
Other activities in free time
included a rodeo, a carnival, a
party at a nearby college, and a
Rotary dinner where they showed
slides of Alaska.
At nights most people headed
for the town of Mexicali for
dinner. Just walking the streets
turned out to be entertaining. A
carnival atmosphere prevailed.
Vendors sell their wares in the
roads and most of the citizens
stand around on the sidewalks. If
it weren't for little barefoot boys
in ripped shirts trying to sell
chewing gum, one could almost
forget that there is so much
poverty and unemployment in
this seemingly happy town.
One of Mexicali's major
industries is beer and Stanford
students took this opportunity to
support Mexican business. The
"Caballo Blanco" with its fat
women who dance for a peso was
frequented for its beer and live
music.
