# Lambda Nu Starts Rush Functions
## 
### 
Lambda Nu Fraternity begins
its rush for both men and women
this week. Rush functions will
begin with a dance tonight at 7:30
p.m. at the house, and will
continue with a series of
barbecues, open houses, and
informal parties during the first
three weeks in April.
Students wishing to become
members must sign a card
indicating their wish before April
20. To sign a card, students must
visit the house at least twice,
either on an informal basis or
during the more organized
activities.
The house will conduct its own
"draw" on April 20. Spaces in the
house will be filled from those
chosen on the basis of a random
draw from a hat containing the
names of all those who have
signed cards. If two students wish
to draw together, they may, but
both names will be on the same
card in the hat.
Spaces for two women and
three men will be reserved for
students overseas desiring to live
in the house. Selection of these
will be made by random draw
from names provided by the
University Housing Office.
Students considering Lambda
Nu should realize that living in the
house involves certain duties.
Active members are largely
responsible for the maintenance
of the grounds and the house.

All members should be actively
involved in the house activities.
Social funds are available to any
member of the house who is
planning an activity open to all
members and which will be
attended by at least 20 percent of
the house members.
Scheduled rush functions are as
follows: April 4, party-dance,
band, etc.; April 6, barbecue;
April 8, informal open house,
wine tasting, mobile-making,
finger-painting; April 13,
barbecue; April 20, barbecue and
draw.
