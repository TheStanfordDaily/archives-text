### 
NEW YORK (AP)- -A Black Panther
plot to bomb five Manhattan
department stores on Thursday during
the Easter shopping rush has been
broken up by indictment of 21
members of the militant Negro group,
Dist. Atty. Frank S. Hogan said
Wednesday.
Twelve of the defendants were
arrested and pleased innocent before
supreme Court Justice Charles Marks.
They were held in $100,000 bail each
over the objection of their attorneys,
who claimed the amount was
unconstitutional.
Those in custody included Robert S.
Collier, 31, convicted in 1965 of
plotting to blow up the statue of
Liberty and other national shrines.
Police said Collier was the Black Panther
minister of education for the New York
area.

Hogan told a news conference the
conspirators, intending to damage the
white "power structure" on Thursday,
plotted to:
—Set off bombs in the midtown
stores of Macy's, Alexander's,
Bloomingdale's, Korvette's and
Abercrombie & Fitch. The bombings
were to be accompanied by gunfire in
the crowded stores.
