A new publication of value to
teachers, administrators and
educational researchers has been
announced by the ERIC
Clearinghouse on Educational
Media and Technology at
Stanford University.
The clearinghouse at Stanford
and the 18 others in the
nationwide system will join in
indexing articles for "Current
Index to Journals in Education,"
which will be published monthly
starting in April. More than 200
education journals will be
monitored, as well as periodicals
in related fields.
The new index will be a
companion publication to
"Research in Education," which
for two years has organized
almost all educational literature
except that appearing in regular
journals. The documents listed in
"Research in Education" are
made available in microfiche (a
form of microfilm) and hardcopy,
and many schools and colleges are
establishing complete collections
of the microfiche.
Because the journals
themselves are available in most
libraries, articles will just be cited
in "Current Index to Journals in
Education," using the same
descriptions as those employed in
"Research in Education."
