## 
### 
Students and faculty will have an
opportunity to make their views known
on Stanford Research Institute's
affiliation with the University prior to
any Board of Trustee decision,
University President Kenneth S. Pitzer
said Wednesday
In accord with recommendations
from the University Advisory
Committee, a student-faculty-trustee
group, Pitzer said he would appoint a

committee to draft a questionnaire in
which various constituencies may make
their views known following publication
of the report on Stanford-SRI relations,
now expected April 15.
Members of the Advisory
Committee, which includes five students
and five faculty chosen by their
respective groups, have been invited to
attend the trustee's regular monthly
meeting in San Francisco Tuesday,
April 8.
One of the agenda items for the
meeting will be procedures for
considering the SRI report. Several
additional recommendations from the
Advisory Committee will be discussed at
that time. These include means for
prompt publication and wide
distribution of the report and for
presentation of views to board
members.
