# University Plans Housing For 400
## 
### MARK WEINBERGER 
If the Trustees give the stamp of
approval at their meeting next Tuesday,
"crash construction" will begin
immediately on apartments on campus
for 400 students.
Although no plans have been
officially released, The Daily learned
from involved students and
administrators that at least half of the
apartments—built and operated by a
private developer—will be ready in time
for classes next fall, with the remainder
scheduled for completion by January,
1970.
The building program is meant to
take some of the super heated pressure
off the annual frantic race for local
housing. The situation has worsened in
recent years, with waiting lists for
University housing growing longer and
competition increasing for off campus
space.
The Trustees will vote on a plan to
allow a private construction firm to
erect 100 apartment units, each with
space for four persons, on University
land adjacent to Escondido Village.
Plans call for the structures to be
constructed on Campus Drive near
Escondido Road. They will be located
next to the Hacienda apartments and
Bing Nursery School.
Experienced Company
Similar two story apartment
complexes have been built at several
other universities, including the
Universities of Utah and Colorado, by
the same company, whose name is not
yet available. Rent is set at $70 per
month per student.
The student apartments are all built
on a two story plan. The upstairs is the
bedroom-study floor, with two double
bedrooms and a bathroom for the four
occupants.
Downstairs, the area is divided into a
living room and a partitioned kitchen.
The kitchen area includes double
stainless steel sinks with disposal,
refrigerator with freezer compartment, a
four burner electric stove, and a
pass-through counter to the dining area.
Each unit also has an upstairs
balcony, a half bath off the entry way in
the living room, and the entire
apartment is fully furnished. It will be a
coed housing complex (though not by
room).
Many of the details for the operation
of the new units have not been settled.
It is not as yet clear how students will
be selected to fill the places; what
proportion of the residents will be
undergraduates, graduates, and foreign;
and what regulations will govern the
complex. The University will play no
role in the operation of the apartments.

The proposed "crash" program is
intended to stave off a crisis such as the
one that hit campus last fall when
droves of students arrived without
housing. Many searched for adequate
accomodations for weeks, often being
forced into high priced, distant housing.
The current proposal is the result of
several months' work by the Dean of
Students and Business offices. Besides
the privately developed apartments, also
under consideration for immediate
construction were prefabricated housing
and, trailers.
The cost of these alternatives were
deemed prohibitive by University
officials, and crash apartment
construction for 200 undergraduates
was settled upon early last month.
However, Graduate Student
Association President Barry Askinas got
wind of the proposal and immediately
protested to Dean of Students Joel
Smith and Vice President for Business
Alf Brandin. „ . , .
In a March 12 letter from Askinas
and Jurgen Muller, president of the
International Association, the
administration was asked to add 300
places for graduate students, including
100 spots for foreign students, in any
crash program, with eating and lounge
facilities provided.
Askinas and Muller stated in their
letter: "Given the difficult housing
situation in the Stanford area which
graduate students experience to an even
greater extent that undergraduates (22
per cent of all graduate students have on
campus housing, versus 68 per cent of
the undergraduates; the year-long wait
waiting list at Escondido Village; the
pressure on a new graduate student each
fall who arrives without knowledge of
the area, often without a car to find a
space in a rapidly disappearing market),
we feel that the need for new on
campus spaces for graduate students in
an even greater priority than new
undergraduate housing."
The letter included threats of legal
action if the University did not move to
include graduate students in next year's
plans. March 31 was set as a deadline for
an administration response.
No answer was received directly,
although soon thereafter the apartment
proposal grew from 200 to 400
students. Askinas claims he has
assurances that 200 of those spots will
be filled by graduates.
However, one administrator is not
quite so sure. The question of
apportionment of the available places
has not been settled, the administrator
explained. "Undergraduates are out first
priority, but we hope there will also be
room for graduates."

be filled by graduates.
However, one administrator is not
quite so sure. The question of
apportionment of the available places
has not been settled, the administrator
explained. "Undergraduates are out first
priority, but we hope there will also be
room for graduates."
If the Trustees give the stamp of
approval at their meeting next Tuesday,
"crash construction" will begin
immediately on apartments on campus
for 400 students.
Although no plans have been
officially released, The Daily learned
from involved students and
administrators that at least half of the
apartments—built and operated by a
private developer—will be ready in time
for classes next fall, with the remainder
scheduled for completion by January,
1970.
The building program is meant to
take some of the super heated pressure
off the annual frantic race for local
housing. The situation has worsened in
recent years, with waiting lists for
University housing growing longer and
competition increasing for off campus
space.
The Trustees will vote on a plan to
allow a private construction firm to
erect 100 apartment units, each with
space for four persons, on University
land adjacent to Escondido Village.
Plans call for the structures to be
constructed on Campus Drive near
Escondido Road. They will be located
next to the Hacienda apartments and
Bing Nursery School.
Experienced Company
Similar two story apartment
complexes have been built at several
other universities, including the
Universities of Utah and Colorado, by
the same company, whose name is not
yet available. Rent is set at $70 per
month per student.
The student apartments are all built
on a two story plan. The upstairs is the
bedroom-study floor, with two double
bedrooms and a bathroom for the four
occupants.
Downstairs, the area is divided into a
living room and a partitioned kitchen.
The kitchen area includes double
stainless steel sinks with disposal,
refrigerator with freezer compartment, a
four burner electric stove, and a
pass-through counter to the dining area.
Each unit also has an upstairs
balcony, a half bath off the entry way in
the living room, and the entire
apartment is fully furnished. It will be a
coed housing complex (though not by
room).
Many of the details for the operation
of the new units have not been settled.
It is not as yet clear how students will
be selected to fill the places; what
proportion of the residents will be
undergraduates, graduates, and foreign;
and what regulations will govern the
complex. The University will play no
role in the operation of the apartments.

The proposed "crash" program is
intended to stave off a crisis such as the
one that hit campus last fall when
droves of students arrived without
housing. Many searched for adequate
accomodations for weeks, often being
forced into high priced, distant housing.
The current proposal is the result of
several months' work by the Dean of
Students and Business offices. Besides
the privately developed apartments, also
under consideration for immediate
construction were prefabricated housing
and, trailers.
The cost of these alternatives were
deemed prohibitive by University
officials, and crash apartment
construction for 200 undergraduates
was settled upon early last month.
However, Graduate Student
Association President Barry Askinas got
wind of the proposal and immediately
protested to Dean of Students Joel
Smith and Vice President for Business
Alf Brandin. „ . , .
In a March 12 letter from Askinas
and Jurgen Muller, president of the
International Association, the
administration was asked to add 300
places for graduate students, including
100 spots for foreign students, in any
crash program, with eating and lounge
facilities provided.
Askinas and Muller stated in their
letter: "Given the difficult housing
situation in the Stanford area which
graduate students experience to an even
greater extent that undergraduates (22
per cent of all graduate students have on
campus housing, versus 68 per cent of
the undergraduates; the year-long wait
waiting list at Escondido Village; the
pressure on a new graduate student each
fall who arrives without knowledge of
the area, often without a car to find a
space in a rapidly disappearing market),
we feel that the need for new on
campus spaces for graduate students in
an even greater priority than new
undergraduate housing."
The letter included threats of legal
action if the University did not move to
include graduate students in next year's
plans. March 31 was set as a deadline for
an administration response.
No answer was received directly,
although soon thereafter the apartment
proposal grew from 200 to 400
students. Askinas claims he has
assurances that 200 of those spots will

No answer was received directly,
although soon thereafter the apartment
proposal grew from 200 to 400

has not been settled, the administrator
explained. "Undergraduates are out first
priority, but we hope there will also be
room for graduates."
