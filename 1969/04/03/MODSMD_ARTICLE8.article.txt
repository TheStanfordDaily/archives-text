# Six-Year Process
## Evolution Of A Resistance Member 
### ANN DENTON 
More than a beard separates Paul
Rupert from his freshman year.
Today Paul Rupert faces arraignment
for refusal to submit to induction into
the Armed Services. March 11 Paul
soared into campus renown at the open
student-trustee meeting with his
passionate introductory statement
urging trustees to lay down their
weapons. Daily he works for Resistance,
a group that opposes the draft.
Quite an evolution from the crew-cut
young lad of Chatham, Mass., who
entered Stanford with the intention of
becoming President of the United
States.
Rupert comes from a small
lower-middle-class family. His father is a
plumber, his mother runs a small
grocery store. Although no other
member of his family had ever attended
college, Paul, as a successful student and
president of his class for four years, was
expected to.
"All Figured Oul"
So, Rupert came to Stanford in
September, 1963. "I had it all figured
out by my senior year in high school. I
liked politics and was active, and
California seemed to be the

key—anyone who could govern
California could govern the U.S. So, all I
had to do was become Governor, then
Senator, then President. I had no
positive academic reason for choosing
Stanford."
Rupert found his freshman year
"dull. I disliked Civ and English. I hated
Bio. So then I got active in other
things."
Paul Rupert, budding politician, was
elected president of his freshman dorm,
joined Young Republicans, campaigned
for Barry Goldwater, joined Army
ROTC, and as a clincher, chaired the Big
Game Bonfire Committee. In the spring
he rushed and pledged Theat Chi.
In the summer after his freshman
year, "when people were asking me how
1 liked college, I couldn't really say I
had learned anything. I realized I had no
positive reason for being at Stanford
and very few people did.
Junior Y ear
His junior year was a definite turning
point. "Six months outside the country,
talking, traveling, seeing other systems
at work —all gave me new perspectives. I
simply changed my mind. I became
anti-war."
By his senior year, during which he

was a sponsor at Rinconada, Rupert
realized he had dropped his plans for
any type of traditional career.
About February he thought of
turning in his draft card, but was
terrified of the idea "because I was
really scared of jail. I just wasn't ready
then. So I applied to divinity school; it
had always been a minor theme at out
house."
After a summer as a Stanford
hanitor, he entered the University of
Chicago divinity school, but spent most
of his time with the Chicago Resistance.
"I couldn't study at divinity school
with what was going on all around. For
a while, I felt really inadequate because
I was discovering I couldn't fit into any
of the traditional careers. Then I
realized I wasn't inadequate, society and
its institutions are because it is not
possible to lead an integrated life under
them. I didn't want to go to work from
9 to 5 and then live—l wanted my work
to be my life.
Relating To People
"I worked more with Resistance and
found a whole new way of relating to
people. My previous assumption about
the unlikeliness of any serious social
transformation changed because I
realized all the myths about people are
false . . . .You can demand an awful lot
of people and they'll give it to you "
On October 21, 1967, Rupert burned
his draft card in front of the Pentagon.
In March, 1968, he refused induction.

He returned to Stanford as a
part-time member of the United
Campus Christian Ministry.
"I try to show people that education
is very difficult within the context of
this university. Education does not
concern the development of self, but
research and training."
This idea led Rupert to the meeting
on March 11 where he gave his opinion
on what Stanford was and on what it
ought to be. Change is necessary and the
need will culminate in a lot of activity
this spring. "We must confront the
nature of Stanford University and its
purposes —and that means resolving the
issue of who's going to make those
decisions."


I VOI HI lON OR REVOLUTlON?—Resistance leader Paul Rupert has changed quite a lot, in
appearance us well as thinking, since he first entered Stanford some six years ago. For a survey
of his present attitudes read the above interview-profile.

entered Stanford with the intention of
becoming President of the United
States.
Rupert comes from a small
lower-middle-class family. His father is a
plumber, his mother runs a small
grocery store. Although no other
member of his family had ever attended
college, Paul, as a successful student and
president of his class for four years, was
expected to.
"All Figured Oul"
So, Rupert came to Stanford in
September, 1963. "I had it all figured
out by my senior year in high school. I
liked politics and was active, and
California seemed to be the

key—anyone who could govern
California could govern the U.S. So, all I
had to do was become Governor, then
Senator, then President. I had no
positive academic reason for choosing
Stanford."
Rupert found his freshman year
"dull. I disliked Civ and English. I hated
Bio. So then I got active in other
things."
Paul Rupert, budding politician, was
elected president of his freshman dorm,
joined Young Republicans, campaigned
for Barry Goldwater, joined Army
ROTC, and as a clincher, chaired the Big
Game Bonfire Committee. In the spring
he rushed and pledged Theat Chi.
In the summer after his freshman
year, "when people were asking me how
1 liked college, I couldn't really say I
had learned anything. I realized I had no
positive reason for being at Stanford
and very few people did.
Junior Y ear
His junior year was a definite turning
point. "Six months outside the country,
talking, traveling, seeing other systems
at work —all gave me new perspectives. I
simply changed my mind. I became
anti-war."
By his senior year, during which he

was a sponsor at Rinconada, Rupert
realized he had dropped his plans for
any type of traditional career.
About February he thought of
turning in his draft card, but was
terrified of the idea "because I was
really scared of jail. I just wasn't ready
then. So I applied to divinity school; it
had always been a minor theme at out
house."
After a summer as a Stanford
hanitor, he entered the University of
Chicago divinity school, but spent most
of his time with the Chicago Resistance.
"I couldn't study at divinity school
with what was going on all around. For
a while, I felt really inadequate because
I was discovering I couldn't fit into any
of the traditional careers. Then I
realized I wasn't inadequate, society and
its institutions are because it is not
possible to lead an integrated life under
them. I didn't want to go to work from
9 to 5 and then live—l wanted my work
to be my life.
Relating To People
"I worked more with Resistance and
found a whole new way of relating to
people. My previous assumption about
the unlikeliness of any serious social
transformation changed because I
realized all the myths about people are
false . . . .You can demand an awful lot
of people and they'll give it to you "
On October 21, 1967, Rupert burned
his draft card in front of the Pentagon.
In March, 1968, he refused induction.

He returned to Stanford as a
part-time member of the United
Campus Christian Ministry.
"I try to show people that education
is very difficult within the context of
this university. Education does not
concern the development of self, but
research and training."
This idea led Rupert to the meeting
on March 11 where he gave his opinion
on what Stanford was and on what it
ought to be. Change is necessary and the
need will culminate in a lot of activity
this spring. "We must confront the
nature of Stanford University and its
purposes —and that means resolving the
issue of who's going to make those
decisions."


I VOI HI lON OR REVOLUTlON?—Resistance leader Paul Rupert has changed quite a lot, in
appearance us well as thinking, since he first entered Stanford some six years ago. For a survey
of his present attitudes read the above interview-profile.
More than a beard separates Paul
Rupert from his freshman year.
Today Paul Rupert faces arraignment
for refusal to submit to induction into
the Armed Services. March 11 Paul
soared into campus renown at the open
student-trustee meeting with his
passionate introductory statement
urging trustees to lay down their
weapons. Daily he works for Resistance,
a group that opposes the draft.
Quite an evolution from the crew-cut
young lad of Chatham, Mass., who
entered Stanford with the intention of
becoming President of the United
States.
