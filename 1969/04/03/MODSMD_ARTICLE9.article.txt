# Pitzer Will Address Legislature Tonight
## 
### 
President Kenneth Pitzer will address
the student legislature (LASSU) tonight
during its first meeting of the Spring
quarter. The LASSU session, to be held
at 7:30 in room 320, will also draw up
specific procedures for the Spring
election and consider Denis Hayes' new
constitution, copies of which are
available in the ASSU office.
In his first appearance before
LASSU, Pitzer apparently intends to
discuss a wide range of subjects. His
speech will cover items of recent
campus importance: alternatives fo
handling a report from the Stanford
Research Institute (SRI), minority
problems as they have been expressed in
most recent reports, and, he said, he
"may mention the upcoming faculty
vote on ROTC."
i itzer noted that he would not be

calling for any specific action from
LASSU. The appearance is intended to
provide an opportunity for Pitzer to
talk to LASSU about current issues in
much the same way that he will address
the Academic Council, the faculty
legislative body on Friday.
Immediately following Pitzer's
address, LASSU will attempt to draw up
specific procedures for the Spring
election, The most urgent problem is to
establish a deadline for the filing of
candidates' petitions.
Denis Hayes' newest constitution,
which is presently on the table, will
likely be drawn from the table and
discussed at the meeting. The Hayes
consitution, which would replace
LASSU with a smaller governing body,
will also be placed on the Spring ballot
if it is approved by LASSU tonight.
