# Pitzer Discusses Dorms, Demands
## 
### DENNIS PERLUSS 
President Kenneth Pitzer last night
supported the creation of the post of
Dean of Undergraduate Education and
said that demands for a moratorium of
war research at Stanford Research
Institute would be presented to the
Board of Trustees at their next meeting.
Speaking and answering questions for
over an hour before the Legislature of
the Associated Students (LASSU),
Pitzer also announced that there would
be no new on-campus housing by the
start of the next academic year.
Pitzer declared that although the
formal agenda for the next trustee
meeting was mailed several days ago, he
intended to introduce before the Board
the SRI Coalition demands which he
expects to receive this afternoon.
Smaller Freshman Class
The President explained that because
of high cost or length of time for
construction, there could be no new
housing units on campus by this fall.
To ease the increasing housing
squeeze, the size of next year's
freshman class will be limited to 1,350.
This is a reduction of 100 from the
number of freshmen admitted this year.
The plan reported in yesterday's
Daily for apartments designed to
accomodate 200 graduate and 200
undergraduate students collapsed
because there was no land suitable for
immediate use which does not conflict
with long-range university plans,
according to Pitzer.
During his prepared remarks Pitzer
declared that he and Provost Richard
Lyman had agreed to support the
recommendation of the Study of
Education at Stanford (SES) for a Dean
of Undergraduate Education. He also
announced that there be at least four
additional black faculty members next
fall.
Constitutional Debate
Following Pitzer's remarks LASSU
turned to a lengthy parliamentary
exhibition while supposedly debating a
new constitution proposed by ASSU
President Denis Hayes.
The most controversial aspect of the
new constitution, a 40-man Senate to
replace the current LASSU, was
amended out of existence, defeated in
amended form, reinstated in original

form, defeated in that iorm, and finally
tabled with the entire constitution
because there were no longer enough
legislators present to act on the
document.
Before it adjorned, however, LASSU
approved the selection of Steve Otto
and Renton Rolph as co-chairmen for
next fall's pre-registration activities.
Committee Appointments
Jeffrey Kane, Frank Philpot, Dick
Fenske, and Fay Armstrong were
appointed to the ASSU Professor
Commission; and Charles Kaplan and
Fred Herring were appointed to a
committee on planning of the Stanford
physical plant.
LASSU appropriated $750 to the
African Students at Stanford for a
week-long African-culture-week festival
planned for April 13-20. A $3,000
appropriation was made to the Graduate
Student Association for a tutorial
project, a planned conference on
technology and the Third World, and
various social functions.

intended to introduce before the Board
the SRI Coalition demands which he
expects to receive this afternoon.
Smaller Freshman Class
The President explained that because
of high cost or length of time for
construction, there could be no new
housing units on campus by this fall.
To ease the increasing housing
squeeze, the size of next year's
freshman class will be limited to 1,350.
This is a reduction of 100 from the
number of freshmen admitted this year.
The plan reported in yesterday's
Daily for apartments designed to
accomodate 200 graduate and 200
undergraduate students collapsed
because there was no land suitable for
immediate use which does not conflict
with long-range university plans,
according to Pitzer.
During his prepared remarks Pitzer
declared that he and Provost Richard
Lyman had agreed to support the
recommendation of the Study of
Education at Stanford (SES) for a Dean
of Undergraduate Education. He also
announced that there be at least four
additional black faculty members next
fall.
Constitutional Debate
Following Pitzer's remarks LASSU
turned to a lengthy parliamentary
exhibition while supposedly debating a
new constitution proposed by ASSU
President Denis Hayes.
The most controversial aspect of the
new constitution, a 40-man Senate to
replace the current LASSU, was
amended out of existence, defeated in
amended form, reinstated in original

form, defeated in that iorm, and finally
tabled with the entire constitution
because there were no longer enough
legislators present to act on the
document.
Before it adjorned, however, LASSU
approved the selection of Steve Otto
and Renton Rolph as co-chairmen for
next fall's pre-registration activities.
Committee Appointments
Jeffrey Kane, Frank Philpot, Dick
Fenske, and Fay Armstrong were
appointed to the ASSU Professor
Commission; and Charles Kaplan and
Fred Herring were appointed to a
committee on planning of the Stanford
physical plant.
LASSU appropriated $750 to the
African Students at Stanford for a
week-long African-culture-week festival
planned for April 13-20. A $3,000
appropriation was made to the Graduate
Student Association for a tutorial
project, a planned conference on
technology and the Third World, and
various social functions.
