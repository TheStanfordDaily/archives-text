# SRI Controversy
## 
### 
The committment expressed and the
warning sounded yesterday afternoon in
Dinkelspiel was absolutely clear-cut. A
large portion of this campus is fed-up with
double talk from trustees and Stanford
Research Institute administrators. The 700
in Dinkelspiel, and the many who were not
there, want action and they want it fast.
The issues discussed yesterday can be
easily manipulated by people interested in
preserving the present mode of operation at
SRI vis-a-vis chemical-biological warfare
and counterinsurgency research. They can
claim that matters are fearfully complex
and a quick end to such research is
unrealistic. They can argue that CBW work
is in the national interest and that Stanford
cannot question the needs of the nation.
And they often declare that no one person
has the right to set guidelines for the
of another.

The meeting yesterday cut through the
amoral and immoral arguments of SRI
defenders. If the alternatves suggested
yesterday to stop CBW work are simple or
simplistic, they suffer from the weird belief
that human life is important and worth
preserving, even if it is the life of someone
who doesn't believe in capitalism.
President Pitzer and the Trustees are
faced with a series of demands and the
possibility of an impending crisis. The
issues are on the table and the potential for
an explosion at Stanford this spring is very
real. We would like to think the
unthinkable-that the trustees will hear out
the students and make some effectve
changes in work done at SRI and Stanford,
and that some powerful people here will
wake up to the realization that the status
quo must shift immediately.
