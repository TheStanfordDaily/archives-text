# Guest Column
## Where 'Get Ahead' Got Us 
### Craig Laughton 
This column might be a waste
of time. It's about what you and I
and 200 million other Americans
have done, are doing, and
probably will continue to do to
our environment.
If you're too depressed, a
fatalist, or just don't give a damn
about choking on smog, urban
sprawl, overpopulation, and the
general insanity of our actions,
please don't squander your time
by reading further. For those of
you who maintain any hope of
man solving his self-imposed
problems, or who just like the
idea of a big challenge, please read
on.
I have a basic assumption (to
which many have and a few still
do disagree) that the
environmental decay being
perpetuated by man against
himself is, in fact, his most
awesome, devastating and
sickening dilemma. This is a 'man'
thing. He's got no one to dump on
but himself. His greed, ego,
stupidity and insanity are driving
him to the point of no return.
Predictably, finite resources, and
delicate natural balances have
been, are being, and will continue
to be destroyed.
Didn't Have To Be
Too bad—it didn't have to be
this way. We could have done
things differently, but somehow
we didn't. Don't get me wrong:
It's all very profitable, patriotic,
comforting and traditional to "get

ahead." I guess we just didn't see
where we were getting, or
something like that.
Anyway, we're there: A
comfortable home in suburbia, 2
or 3 cars per family, 40 hour work
week, golf on the weekends,
barbecues, cocktail parties, the
latest fashions, a sense of
motivation (more is good; bigger
is better)—and what's left of
whatever sanity we had in the first
place.
Harrison Brown, a noted
biologist from Cal Tech hasn't
quite given up yet: "Man will
decide his own fate within the
next 15 years," he said at a recent
forum with Paul Ehrlich and
Dudley Kirk. I doubt that Ehrlich
will give us that long to decide.
Even Mr. Kirk, a relative optimist
has expressed his dismay at the
way American is forging ahead
with its quantity vs. quality
existence.
Overpopulation
Even though Mr. Kirk plays
down the importance of
population growth as the main
factor contributing to our present
sickening (literally) state of
affairs, he certainly doesn't deny
the effect of overpopulation: "I
personally feel that this country,
with its available resourses, would
be better off with 50 million
people than its present 200
million.
Most of us have heard the
dismal but realistic figures of

projected population, so I won't
bore you with them again. If
somehow you doubt that
overpopulation is a problem, just
open your eyes, and start looking
around: people, smog, urban
sprawl, 'progress', and more
people. It may not be very
scientific, but it's sure as hell
convincing.
I agree completely with Dr.
Ehrlich that overpopulation is the
practical root cause of our
problems . All measures are
stop-gap until the population is
stabalized.
Sterilization
Since our deadline with destiny
appears so near, I propose what at
first seems to be an absurdly
radical idea, but one that soon
falls into a more moderate sphere
when a logical analysis is applied
to our present dangerous
situation: A governmentally
controlled mandatory sterilization
program involving all persons,
regardless of race or financial
situation, after they have
produced two children.
This is hardly a novel idea, but
it has been carefully concealed,
because it's been considered "too
hot to touch" by most public
people. The ramifications of such
a program are many and varied. I
will try to present them in a
future column.

situation, after they have
produced two children.
This is hardly a novel idea, but
it has been carefully concealed,
because it's been considered "too
hot to touch" by most public
people. The ramifications of such
a program are many and varied. I
will try to present them in a
future column.
(Craig Laughton is a freshman
and has not yet declared a
major-Ed.)
This column might be a waste
of time. It's about what you and I
and 200 million other Americans
have done, are doing, and
probably will continue to do to
our environment.
If you're too depressed, a
fatalist, or just don't give a damn
about choking on smog, urban
sprawl, overpopulation, and the
general insanity of our actions,
please don't squander your time
by reading further. For those of
you who maintain any hope of
man solving his self-imposed
problems, or who just like the
idea of a big challenge, please read
on.
I have a basic assumption (to
which many have and a few still
do disagree) that the
environmental decay being
perpetuated by man against
himself is, in fact, his most
awesome, devastating and
sickening dilemma. This is a 'man'
thing. He's got no one to dump on
but himself. His greed, ego,
stupidity and insanity are driving
him to the point of no return.
Predictably, finite resources, and
delicate natural balances have
been, are being, and will continue
to be destroyed.
Didn't Have To Be
Too bad—it didn't have to be
this way. We could have done
things differently, but somehow
we didn't. Don't get me wrong:
It's all very profitable, patriotic,
comforting and traditional to "get

ahead." I guess we just didn't see
where we were getting, or
something like that.
Anyway, we're there: A
comfortable home in suburbia, 2
or 3 cars per family, 40 hour work
week, golf on the weekends,
barbecues, cocktail parties, the
latest fashions, a sense of
motivation (more is good; bigger
is better)—and what's left of
whatever sanity we had in the first
place.
Harrison Brown, a noted
biologist from Cal Tech hasn't
quite given up yet: "Man will
decide his own fate within the
next 15 years," he said at a recent
forum with Paul Ehrlich and
Dudley Kirk. I doubt that Ehrlich
will give us that long to decide.
Even Mr. Kirk, a relative optimist
has expressed his dismay at the
way American is forging ahead
with its quantity vs. quality
existence.
Overpopulation
Even though Mr. Kirk plays
down the importance of
population growth as the main
factor contributing to our present
sickening (literally) state of
affairs, he certainly doesn't deny
the effect of overpopulation: "I
personally feel that this country,
with its available resourses, would
be better off with 50 million
people than its present 200
million.
Most of us have heard the
dismal but realistic figures of

projected population, so I won't
bore you with them again. If
somehow you doubt that
overpopulation is a problem, just
open your eyes, and start looking
around: people, smog, urban
sprawl, 'progress', and more
people. It may not be very
scientific, but it's sure as hell
convincing.
I agree completely with Dr.
Ehrlich that overpopulation is the
practical root cause of our
problems . All measures are
stop-gap until the population is
stabalized.
Sterilization
Since our deadline with destiny
appears so near, I propose what at
first seems to be an absurdly
radical idea, but one that soon
falls into a more moderate sphere
when a logical analysis is applied
to our present dangerous
situation: A governmentally
controlled mandatory sterilization
program involving all persons,
regardless of race or financial
situation, after they have
produced two children.
This is hardly a novel idea, but
it has been carefully concealed,
because it's been considered "too
hot to touch" by most public
