# Conspiracy Of One
## Nixon Augustus Sendeth A Decree 
### Daniel Snell 
And it came to pass in those
days that a decree went forth
from Nixon Augustus that all the
campuses be at peace. And this
was the first oppression, when
Kenneth was governor of the
Great University of the Western
World.
And money was to be the
means of restraint, for it was to be
kept from the people if they were
unkind, even to them that were
themselves unkind to others.
And Robert the Consul sent
word to Kenneth and to his
fellows with him, saying with
imperial candor, "Under this
(anti-riot) legislation, the burden
of administration falls upon the
institution."
And so all determined to be at
peace, all those who governed
colleges and universities, and some
of those who taught and learned
there so decided also.
And Kenneth too went up
from Palo Alto, out of the land of
Hewlett and Packard, unto San
Francisco, unto the city of the
Hayakawa, there to learn what
was to be done.
Reason For Concern
And though he learned from
the Hayakawa many useful
precepts, concerning, among other
things, how to keep one's hat on
it a volley of tomatoes, Kenneth
could not fathom the reason for
the Emporer's concern.
For, you see, where Kenneth
reigned, tranquility was a constant
passion, very like love or football
elsewhere, and quietness was the
disposition of the many. It is true
that there were a few who
objected at Kenneth's having
helped to kill people and at the
magnificent private armies that
made the trustees of his court so

powerful and respected. But so
great was the passion for
tranquility that the serfs and their
taskmasters preferred vaulted
libraries to rallies bent on social
change, which, after all, Nixon
Augustus deplored.
"Tranquility," said those who
helped Kenneth administer his
realm, "is better than justice, for
it leads to continuing alumni
support."
Better Than Honor
And those who taught the
precepts of the past at Kenneth's
University used to say,
"Tranquility is better than honor,
for it allows for individual grants
of great magnitude and scholarly
acclaim."
And even the students, who
elsewhere were so prone to deride
the blessings of tranquility had a
saying that was said among them,
"Tranquility is better than

conscience, for it allows one to
get one's degree and to earn a
great deal more money in one's
life."
And so one day Kenneth sent
word on the carrier pigeon
network known as the "cold line"
and inquired diligently of the
Emporer where campus dissent
could be found, so that he could
properly carry out his sovereign's
wishes.
Disruption
The Emporer's note of reply
read, "Surely you know, Kenneth,
for you have had a Black Student
Union Rampage, A Students For
A Democratic Soceity Disruption
too during your short reign
already."
But Kenneth truthfully replied,
"For nay, dear sire, it is not so.
For our excellent punitive system
has promptly punished the vile
SDS members, and the BSU's

importunities have been
negotiated out of memory. We
have had disorder but it is quickly
set into order."
"Then are you truly our
servant, Kenneth," Nixon
Augustus' bird message read. "For
you act with precision and some
grace and cover up crises even as
we should wish to. Therefore shall
your Great University not suffer
financially from us but shall
prosper as before, yea, even more
so."
And Kenneth was glad in his
heart that Nixon Augustus had
called him a good and faithful
servant. And his people, as usual,
were tranquil and, as usual, gave
little thought to what had come
to pass among them.
