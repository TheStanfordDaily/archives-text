## In Memoriam 
### 
Editor, THE DAILY:
It was dead week of winter
quarter, and Stanford was
preparing for its ritual of final
exams. There were no
communication!, no 'Daily. In a
quiet room at the Hoover Hospital
died Gordon R. Davis, a man
whom few of us knew, but whose
dedication and sincerity affected
the Stanford community in a way
that will not be forgotten.
The lengthy article in the
Times told of his life's
accomplishments, and his activity
in the Elks, the Masons, and the
Scouts. It also talked about his
thirty-plus years at Stanford, as
head of the campus security force
from its inception until his
retirement last fall.
But the other half of the story,
what the man was like to those
who knew and worked with him,
cannot go untold. He believed
fervently in service to others. As

advisor to Alpha Phi Omega for
many years, Chief Davis kept the
fraternity alive in its weaker years
with perserverance, devotion, and
enthusiasm. He originally joined
the scouting movement as an
adult interested for his son, but
through the years he also helped
hundreds of other boys grow to
manhood. His proudest
accomplishment in scouts was the
establishment of a new troop at
the Stanford Children's
Convalescent Home.
The final tribute to Cordon
Davis is that he was a Stanford
man in every way: proud of his
school, but sensitive to its
problems and energetic in finding
solutions tothem. Those who had
contact with him had nothingbut
admiration and respect for this
man's forthright and
understanding manner; he had a
sympathetic ear to every student
that needed it.
Three decades ago Chief Davis
was married under the dome of
Stanford Memorial Church.
Amidst wreathes of red and white,
his funeral took place under the
same dome. And, the final hymn
was the Stanford alma mater.
Gordon Davis was our friend. We
will miss him.

Editor, THE DAILY:
Generally pleased with much
of what The Daily has done this
year, I was surprised to see that its
staff had decided to observe April
Fool's Day in its report that a
Minuteman system had been
uncovered in the foothills.
Reminiscent of the
irresponsibility of earlier issues of
The Daily, I cannot help but
advocate that The Daily should be
distributed on a subscription
basis. Hopefully, this would
improve the quality and the
degree of responsibility displayed
by The Daily.
