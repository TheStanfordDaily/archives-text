## Packard's Credibility Gap 
### Art Buchwald 
WASHINGTON — The
seismograph in Washington, D.C.,
showed a slight quake in the
Credibility Gap last week when
Undersecretary of Defense David
Packard testified in front of the
Senate Foreign Relations
subcommittee on disarmament on
the ABM. Asked to name a
science adviser not connected
with the Pentagon who had
participated in a review of the
missile system, Packard came up
with Dr. Wolfgang K. H.
Panofsky, a noted physicist from
Stanford.
Unfortunately for Packard, Dr.
Panofsky denied he had
participated in any review of the
safe guard system and said he was
opposed to it. He also said that his
only encounter with Packard was
an accidental meeting at the
airport in San Francisco where the
men talked informally about
different defense systems while
waiting for their planes.
I was very curious about the
Pentagon's new method of talking
to scientists, and I was fortunate
to run into a friend of mine who
happens to be an assistant
secretary of defense. He was
standing next to the insurance
counter at New York's La Guardia
field.
Stationed Here
"Where are you going?" I
asked him.
"I'm not going anywhere," he
said. "I'm stationed here working
on a research project."

"What do you mean?"
"We're interviewing scientists
at airports on the ABM."
"Why at the airports?" I asked.
"None of them wants to come
to Washington, so we have to
catch them on the run. Look,
there's Prof. Bezilsky of Harvard
University." He stopped the
professor.
"Dr. Bezilsky," he said, "my
name's Carnaby of the Defense
Department, and I was wondering
if you could give my your opinion
of the ultrahigh frequencies in
radar simulation vis-vis the ABM."
Prof. Bezilsky looked annoyed.
"I haf to catch my plane."
"It will only take a minute,
sir."
"Please, this is not the place to
go into ultrahigh frequencies in
radar simulation," Bezilsky said,
trying to move on.
"Professor, are you for it or
against it?"
"Vill you let me catch my
plane, dummkoph?"
Bezilsky pushed Carnaby aside
and rushed off with his bag.
Carnaby said, "Well, he's for
it."
"How did you figure that?" I
asked him.
"Our orders are that if a
scientist doesn't come out
specifically and say he's against
the ABM, then he must be for it."
Carnaby wrote something in his
notebook. "I have four scientists
for the ABM and one against."

"That's marvelous," I said in
admiration. "All you have to do is
wait by the New York to Boston
shuttle and you catch the whole
MIT, Harvard and Tufts scientific
establishment."
Foolproof
"Right. It's foolproof because
we could never get to talk to this
many scientists in Washington. Of,
my goodness, look who's over
there — it's Dr. Heinrich
Spitzelbaron, who discovered
manifold pressure under glass. Dr.
Spitzelbaron, Dr. Spitzelbaron,
would you care to participate in
an instant seminar we're holding
here on the ABM system?"
"No, but I'd like to buy some
flight insurance. I'm scared to
death of flying."
"But what about the threat of
the Soviet Multiple Weapon
Launchers and their first-strike
superiority?"
"If I could just get to
Cleveland safely, I'd be grateful."
"Doctor, could I ask you about
the Chinese first generation of
nuclear weapons?"
"I usually get drunk when I
fly," Dr. Spitzelbaron said. "I
know it's stupid, but I'm afraid of
heights."
After he bought his insurance
and left, I asked Carnaby, "Is he
pro or con?"
"If I had to testify in front of a
Senate committee, I'd say he was
pro—but with a few reservations."

Spitzelbaron, Dr. Spitzelbaron,
would you care to participate in
an instant seminar we're holding
here on the ABM system?"
"No, but I'd like to buy some
flight insurance. I'm scared to
death of flying."
"But what about the threat of
the Soviet Multiple Weapon
Launchers and their first-strike
superiority?"
"If I could just get to
Cleveland safely, I'd be grateful."
"Doctor, could I ask you about
the Chinese first generation of
nuclear weapons?"
"I usually get drunk when I
fly," Dr. Spitzelbaron said. "I
know it's stupid, but I'm afraid of
heights."
After he bought his insurance
and left, I asked Carnaby, "Is he
pro or con?"
"If I had to testify in front of a
Senate committee, I'd say he was
pro—but with a few reservations."
WASHINGTON — The
seismograph in Washington, D.C.,
showed a slight quake in the
Credibility Gap last week when
Undersecretary of Defense David
Packard testified in front of the
Senate Foreign Relations
subcommittee on disarmament on
the ABM. Asked to name a
science adviser not connected
with the Pentagon who had
participated in a review of the
missile system, Packard came up
with Dr. Wolfgang K. H.
Panofsky, a noted physicist from
Stanford.
Unfortunately for Packard, Dr.
Panofsky denied he had
participated in any review of the
safe guard system and said he was
opposed to it. He also said that his
only encounter with Packard was
an accidental meeting at the
airport in San Francisco where the
men talked informally about
different defense systems while
waiting for their planes.
I was very curious about the
Pentagon's new method of talking
to scientists, and I was fortunate
to run into a friend of mine who
happens to be an assistant
secretary of defense. He was
standing next to the insurance
counter at New York's La Guardia
field.
Stationed Here
"Where are you going?" I
asked him.
"I'm not going anywhere," he
said. "I'm stationed here working
on a research project."

"What do you mean?"
"We're interviewing scientists
at airports on the ABM."
"Why at the airports?" I asked.
"None of them wants to come
to Washington, so we have to
catch them on the run. Look,
there's Prof. Bezilsky of Harvard
University." He stopped the
professor.
"Dr. Bezilsky," he said, "my
name's Carnaby of the Defense
Department, and I was wondering
if you could give my your opinion
of the ultrahigh frequencies in
radar simulation vis-vis the ABM."
Prof. Bezilsky looked annoyed.
"I haf to catch my plane."
"It will only take a minute,
sir."
"Please, this is not the place to
go into ultrahigh frequencies in
radar simulation," Bezilsky said,
trying to move on.
"Professor, are you for it or
against it?"
"Vill you let me catch my
plane, dummkoph?"
Bezilsky pushed Carnaby aside
and rushed off with his bag.
Carnaby said, "Well, he's for
it."
"How did you figure that?" I
asked him.
"Our orders are that if a
scientist doesn't come out
specifically and say he's against
the ABM, then he must be for it."
Carnaby wrote something in his
notebook. "I have four scientists
for the ABM and one against."

"That's marvelous," I said in
admiration. "All you have to do is
wait by the New York to Boston
shuttle and you catch the whole
MIT, Harvard and Tufts scientific
establishment."
Foolproof
"Right. It's foolproof because
we could never get to talk to this
many scientists in Washington. Of,
my goodness, look who's over
there — it's Dr. Heinrich
Spitzelbaron, who discovered
manifold pressure under glass. Dr.
Spitzelbaron, Dr. Spitzelbaron,
would you care to participate in
