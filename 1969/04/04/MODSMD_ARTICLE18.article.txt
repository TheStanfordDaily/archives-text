## Mom Locates Missing Girl Friend 
### Cissie Bonini 
Dear Mom,
For two weeks now my girl
friend has been promising to meet
me at noon at the kiosk outside
the Undergraduate Library. She is
never there, and yet has always
been a truthful and punctual
person in the past. How do you
explain this?
Faithful Dobbin
Dear Faithful,
She is probably waiting inside
the kiosk. Patiently,
Mom

Dear Mom,
I have a deep religious faith
and feel that one should have
complete faith in God.
Consequently, when driving, I
leave the driving to Him. Thus far,
I have totaled three cars. Am I
lacking in faith?
Saintly
Dear Saintly,
No, you are not lacking in
faith, but you are definitely
lacking in something. I can't quite
put my finger on it, and I bet you

can't quite put your hat on it.
M oni
Dear Mom,
I have some questions on
history, and don't want to appear
ignorant by asking my Prof. What
was the "Sack of Rome"? and
what is St. Thomas's Sum ma?
History Major
Beta House
Dear H. M.,
I think that the "sack of
Rome" was the bag in which the
Visigoths carried away the

treasures of Italy after Genghis
Khan and his hordes descended
there. St. Thomas's Sum ma is the
Italian translation for St.
Thomas's "Addition" in which he
added on a lot of stuff he thought
should have been in the Scriptures
and wasn't.
Historically yours,
Mom
