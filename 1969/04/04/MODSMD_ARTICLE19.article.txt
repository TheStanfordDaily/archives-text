# Senate, Ed Council Make No Progress
## 
### DOUGLAS ANDERSON 
A disappointingly low
attendance at the joint meeting of
the Academic Senate and the
Student Education Council
yesterday produced a
disappointingly unproductive
meeting.
As announced, the discussion
centered around the management
of "curricular guidelines,"
''supervision of Freshman
writing," "scrutiny of historical
studies," "the undergraduate
major," and limits to be imposed
on departmental major programs.
Discussion often times,
however, got bogged down in
semantic battles as students and
professors grappled over wording
of curricular guidelines of such
sections as 111-B. which was finally
revised to read:
"Where special circumstances
are deemed to warrant it the
Committee on Undergraduate
Studies, or such committee as the
Academic Senate may designate,
shall have authority to allow
exceptions of policies and
requirements stated herein.
Changes of any requirements must
be approved by the Academic
Senate." That battle took one
hour.
After haggling over procedures
to supervise the freshman writing
course and historical studies
requirement, the body decided
that "too many members were
absent to make straw votes
indicative of the total sentiment
of the group."
It was further agreed that
discussion of the role and

make-up of sub-committees on
writing and historical studies
would be more productive once
formal general studies area
requirements are adopted.
The question of rectroactivity
of the SES recommendations that
was singled out to be the most
controversial issue of the meeting
by Associate Dean Larry Ryan of
the School of Humanities and
Sciences and chairman of the
Floor Management Team, proved
to merit only secondary
importance, with no firm decision
being reached.
Undergraduate Majors
The question of undergraduate
majors and the limits to be placed
on department requirements for
degrees dominated the latter part
of the meeting.
It was decided that
"Departments are responsible for
establishing requirements for their
major programs," but that "major
programs which fall outside the
scope of any department would
require the approval of the
Committee on Undergraduate
Studies" or a sub-committee to be
established by the Academic
Senate.
"Each school or department
offering and undergraduate degree
program must include at least one
option that prescribes no more
than one half of any Student's
total academic work, including
courses required to be taken in
subjects other than the field on
concentration."
The next scheduled joint
meeting of the Academic Senate
and the Student Educational
Council has been set for April 17.
