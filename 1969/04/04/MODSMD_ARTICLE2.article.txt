# Academic Council Meets
## Faculty Vote On ROTC 
### FRANK MILLER 
The entire faculty decides the future
of the Reserve Officers Training Corps
(ROTC) at Stanford this afternoon.
The Academic Council, consisting of
faculty members of assistant professor
or higher stature, meets at 4:15 p.m. in
Dinkelspiel Auditorium and will
reconsider the decision of the Academic
Senate to deny academic credit for all
ROTC courses.
A petition with over 50 faculty
signatures asking for this
reconsideration was presented late last
quarter. This is the first regular Council
meeting since that time.
The Academic Council has a wide
choice of what it can do in regard to
ROTC. The Council could approve the

Senate's decision, refer the issue back to
committee or the Senate, approve the
minority report of the original
committee, or to make any compromise
the faculty felt advisable.
Both supporters of ROTC and
opponents of the program have been
attempting to gather support for their
views.
Support Gathered
A group of professors, led by Jean
Mayers, professor of aeronautical
engineering, and David M. Mason,
professor of chemical engineering and
chemistry, has sent letters to a:l
members of the Council and purchased
an advertisement in today's Daily in
order to express their support of ROTC.
In the letter the professors call the
action of the Senate hasty and urge a
rejection of that action. "We urge the
Academic Council to disapprove the
recent Senate Decision relative to
ROTC, either by vote at the April 4th
meeting or through a subsequent general
mail referendum." They also ask careful
consideration of any decisions, whatever
it might be.
The advertisement, costing over
$100, was paid for by individual
donations from those professors signing
the advertisement.
Prof. Mason called the group's action
a "grass-roots movement" of people
interested in the ROTC issue. A few
engineering and science professors
eveidently started the movement and
then recruited some people from other
disciplines. The group consists of very
few, if any, of the younger professors at
Stanford.
Strategy Planned
The majority of the committee on
ROTC held a meeting last Monday to
plan strategy for today's Council
meeting, according to Anne
Kostelanetz, assistant professor of
English. Lyman Van Slyke, professor of
History, will probably speak in favor of

the Senate's action and Thomas J.
Connolly, professor of mechanical
engineering, will try to answer the
questions raised by the pro-ROTC letter
circulated to Council members.
Prof. Kostelanetz and Joseph D.
Sneed, professor of philosophy, have
also circulated a letter among "their
friends" asking them to attend the
Council meeting.
Last Fall, a faculty-student
administration committee was
appointed to study and make
recommendations concerning the
l.ationship between ROTC and
Stanford. The committee reported on
February 12 with a 6-3 majority that
ROTC was incompatible with the
University's primary commitment to
unrestricted creation and dissemination
of knowledge. The majority
recommended denying credit for ROTC
courses while the minority report
wanted to retain the ROTC program
with minor revisions.
Senate Denys Credit
The Academic Senate decided to
deny credit for ROTC but decided to
refer two other proposals to a
committee. These called for elimination
of non-credit military training on
campus and for the relegation of ROTC
to a voluntary student organization
status.

$100, was paid for by individual
donations from those professors signing
the advertisement.
Prof. Mason called the group's action
a "grass-roots movement" of people
interested in the ROTC issue. A few
engineering and science professors
eveidently started the movement and
then recruited some people from other
disciplines. The group consists of very
few, if any, of the younger professors at
Stanford.
Strategy Planned
The majority of the committee on
ROTC held a meeting last Monday to
plan strategy for today's Council
meeting, according to Anne
Kostelanetz, assistant professor of
English. Lyman Van Slyke, professor of
History, will probably speak in favor of

the Senate's action and Thomas J.
Connolly, professor of mechanical
engineering, will try to answer the
questions raised by the pro-ROTC letter
circulated to Council members.
Prof. Kostelanetz and Joseph D.
Sneed, professor of philosophy, have
also circulated a letter among "their
friends" asking them to attend the
Council meeting.
Last Fall, a faculty-student
administration committee was
appointed to study and make
recommendations concerning the
l.ationship between ROTC and
Stanford. The committee reported on
February 12 with a 6-3 majority that
ROTC was incompatible with the
University's primary commitment to
unrestricted creation and dissemination
of knowledge. The majority
recommended denying credit for ROTC
courses while the minority report
wanted to retain the ROTC program
with minor revisions.
Senate Denys Credit
The Academic Senate decided to
deny credit for ROTC but decided to
refer two other proposals to a
committee. These called for elimination
of non-credit military training on
campus and for the relegation of ROTC
to a voluntary student organization
status.
The entire faculty decides the future
of the Reserve Officers Training Corps
(ROTC) at Stanford this afternoon.
The Academic Council, consisting of
faculty members of assistant professor
or higher stature, meets at 4:15 p.m. in
Dinkelspiel Auditorium and will
reconsider the decision of the Academic
Senate to deny academic credit for all
ROTC courses.
A petition with over 50 faculty
signatures asking for this
reconsideration was presented late last
quarter. This is the first regular Council
meeting since that time.
The Academic Council has a wide
choice of what it can do in regard to
ROTC. The Council could approve the

Senate's decision, refer the issue back to
committee or the Senate, approve the
minority report of the original
committee, or to make any compromise
the faculty felt advisable.
Both supporters of ROTC and
opponents of the program have been
attempting to gather support for their
views.
Support Gathered
A group of professors, led by Jean
Mayers, professor of aeronautical
engineering, and David M. Mason,
professor of chemical engineering and
chemistry, has sent letters to a:l
members of the Council and purchased
an advertisement in today's Daily in
order to express their support of ROTC.
In the letter the professors call the
action of the Senate hasty and urge a
rejection of that action. "We urge the
Academic Council to disapprove the
recent Senate Decision relative to
ROTC, either by vote at the April 4th
meeting or through a subsequent general
mail referendum." They also ask careful
consideration of any decisions, whatever
it might be.
The advertisement, costing over
$100, was paid for by individual
donations from those professors signing
