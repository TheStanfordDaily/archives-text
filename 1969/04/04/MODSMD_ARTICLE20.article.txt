# Debate Team Nets Congressional Cup
## 
### 
The Stanford debate team met
with both success and
disappointment in its two Spring
Break tournaments. At the
American University tournament
in Washington, D.C., two Stanford
teams finished first and fourth;
and at the District Qualifier
tournament for Nationals the
Stanford team compiled a 4-4
win-loss record and failed to
qualify for the National meet.
Stanford fielded two teams at
the American University
tournament which was attended
by 51 universities. Ken Philpot
and Dean Schwartz collected five
victories against one defeat to
earn them a fourth place finish.
The team of Ron Oster-Bob
Cory defeated the University of
Virginia, the University of
Vermont, the University of
Miami, William and Mary College,
the University of Connecticut,
and Cornell on the way to its finai
round debate against Rutgers.
Team Wins Cut
Oster and Cory upheld the
negative arguments on the
question of a reduction of
executive control over U.S.
foreign policy, and received a 5-2

decision in the final round, giving
them first place and a
"Congressional Cup" presented by
the president of the university.
At the District Qualifier
tournament, held here on the
Stanford campus, the team of
Cory-Oster were pitted against
eight of the most advanced West
Coast debate teams.
In what must have been one of
the biggest disappointments of the
debate season, Cory and Oster
were dumped four times, by
Loyola, Redlands, Berkeley, and
UCLA, to give them a 4-4 mark.
They had victories over Santa
Barbara, Whittier, and San Fer
nando Valley State College.
With a 4-4 record, Cory and
Oster were unable to qualify for
the National College Debate
Tournament. Three teams were
chosen from the West Coast as
"at-large selections" for the
National meet. Cory and Oster
were under consideration for one
of these berths, but were passed
over because they had received
less tournament competition over
the year than Arizona State.
