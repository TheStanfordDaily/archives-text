# Where Is Truffaut? New Film Lacking Style
## 
### TODD McCARTHY 
I was greatly looking forward
to seeing Francois Truffaut's
newest film, Stolen Kisses, a
follow-up to his first feature, The
400 Blows, and his first
"personal" film since 1964. On
the basis of his first three pictures
alone, I have always included
Truffaut among my favorite
directors and have even found
myself resorting to the auteur
theory to justify his recent
unspectacular efforts. Yet Stolen
Kisses forces me to realize that
something unfortunate has
happened to Truffaut as a creative
talent and, instead of expanding
as he did so impressively in his
youth, he has compromised his
style and ambition for the sake of
the commercial cinema. His
results, while salable to some
sympathetic critics, are
unsatisfying aesthetically and, at
the same time, curiously
uncommercial.
Truffaut himself has always
admitted an uncertainty of
commitment; should he make
films to satisfy the critics or the
public? He has apparently decided
upon the latter, for his recent
films have been in color, have
been more "carefully" done
technically and have dealt with
topics traditionally popular in the
commercial cinema
(science-fiction in Fahrenheit 451
and murder in The Bride Wore
Black). Neither of these films have
done much to enhance Truffaut's
image, however; the press and
public alike preferred the more
adventurous Truffaut of The 400
the Piano Flayer and
>tiles and Jim.
With Stolen Kisses, Truffaut
has returned to Paris as a local
and, as in The 400 Blows, has
used Jean-Pierre Leaud in the
autobiographical role of Antoine.
The similarity ends there. In this
film, there are none of the
tongue-in-cheek homages to great
directors that constantly
confronted audiences in his
previous pictures and there is no
virtuoso use of fluid match
cutting, once considered a
Truffaut speciality. Also
sorrowfully missing are the
impeccable cinematography of
Raoul Coutard and the evocative
music of Georges Delerue, these
individuals having contributed
highly to the sweetly melancholy
tone of the director's earlier work.
Though Stolen Kisses
concentrates almost exclusively
upon the activities of one
individual, there is a disturbing
lack of focus in the film. In the
course of an hour and a half's
running time, Truffaut moves

Antoine episodically from jobs as
an army volunteer, a
n i g h twatch man, a private
detective and a shoe clerk, with
frequent visits to prostitutes and
his girl friend interspersed for
good measure. Such plotting
allows no time for sufficient
development, comic or dramatic,
of any of the situations, the few
laughs that do come being solely a
result of the eccentricities of the
lead character.
An accurate definition of the
Truffaut style is difficult to
pinpoint, but I think what made
his first three films great (and to a
lesser degree, his fourth film, The
Soft Skin) was that the director,
with the help of an ideal
combination of technical men and

actors, was able to find an
exquisite happy medium between
comedy and tragedy. The
melancholy was great but
something lively or funny always
popped up in the next shot to
keep the films from bogging
down. In attempting another
autobiographical film, Truffaut
had ten years of his life to
account for, and could do so in
only the most general, and
therefore uninteresting way.
Stolen Kisses is light and very
frothy entertainment and in
trying to oblige the public,
Truffaut, while still independent,
has come more dangerously close
to Hollywood than one could
have believed possible of the
ex-leader of the New Wave.
