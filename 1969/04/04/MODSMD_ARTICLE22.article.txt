# Former MASC Head
## Nogales Aids Pitzer 
### CICELY BATES 
Luis Nogales is soft-spoken and
calm, but intensely concerned
over the future welfare of
Mexican-Americans in the realm
of education.
In March, he was named a
presidential assistant in
Mexican-Americans Affairs. He
now has a chance to implement
one of his main objectives which
is ''to fully incorporate
Mexican- Americans into the
educational process at Stanford."
Nogales assumed his new post
after having graduated from the
Stanford Law School in February
of this year. The 25 year old
administrator is a native of
Calexico, California, and is the
son of a migrant farm labor
family.
As an assistant to President
Pitzer, Nogales will be working
directly with the president in
co-ordinating and increasing
University admissions,
employment, counseling and
academic programs affecting

Mexican-Americans.
To increase admissions lor next
year, Nogales and the
Mexican-American S t udents
Confederation at Stanford
(MASC) organized a recruitment
program over Spring Break. About
20 Mexican-American students
traveled to high schools in
Colorado, New Mexico, Arizona,
and California to talk to high
school students. "The student
recruiters were very effective,"
Nogales said. "We have money for
about 60 students who may need
financial aid and at least that
many highly qualified
Mexican-American students have
applied after the student
recruiters visited their schools."
Because few students had
previously submitted applications
to Stanford, Nogales was
instrumental in getting the
deadline for admissions extended
to April 5.
Before his present post,
Nogales was the first chairman of
MASC. Last December his group
made several "strong requests" to
the administration. The students
urged the Administration to
appoint a Mexican-American
associate provost, counselor and
financial aids officer and recruiter.
They also urged increased
enrollment of Mexican-Americans.
These requests are now being
answered.
Instead of an associate provost,
the post of presidential assistant
was created. When a search
committee looked about to find
someone who was qualified to fill
the post, Nogales was
recommended as the one person
who was both in close contact with
the students and aware of their
needs.
As presidential assistant, he is
now forming a committee which
will select a counselor and
financial aids officer. MASC

students have taken over much of
the recruiting and their efforts
should pay off in increased
enrollment.
While negotiating for the
requests last December, Nogales
deliberately avoided deadlines and
confrontation tactics. Nogales
feels that "the tactics and
arguments used by groups often
reflect the capabilities of that
group." However he does not
entirely write off confrontation as
a means of change. "Sometimes
demonstrations and sit-ins are
necessary, but it is important to
assess each particular situation,"
Nogales stated.
Nogales has also worked with
the Law School in its attempts to
recruit more Mexican-Americans.
Last year he helped organize a
new program which will permit
minority students to complete
LL.B. degree work in four years
instead of the normal three.


PRESIDENTIAL ASSISTANT: l.uis
Nogales, former head of MASC, will
work with Pitzer in co-ordinating and
increasing the admission, employment,
counseling, and academic programs of
Mexican-American students at
Stanford.
