# Poly Sci Students Form Association
## 
### FELICITY BARRINGER 
In an attempt to combat
growing curriculum difficulties,
political science majors at
Stanford have formed their own
association.
Students dissatisfied with their
inability to join the courses and
seminars most appealing to them
met on February 10 and founded
the association. All political
science majors are automatically
included in its membership.
Soon after its initial formation,
the group, with the advice of
faculty members, set up a steering
committee to work through the
bureaucratic channels of the
University. This committee set up
the structure of the group, as well
as writing its constitution and
by-laws. The group has been given
organizational status by the Dean
of Student's office.
Many of the students in the
group had been frustrated in their
attempts to enroll in the more
interesting courses in the
department. "The really

interesting courses are the senior
colloquiums and the seminars,"
said Stephen Strick, a political
science major. He added that
these courses were the hardest to
get into.
One course, Political Science
180-3 a, which was the only course
in urban politics offered to poli
sci students, was signed-up for by
over 75 students. There was only
room for 30 students in the
course.
In another instance, Professor
John Lewis offered a seminar on
Vietnam. He, too, received far
more applicants than he could
admit. He screened each of the
applicants in individual sessions,
but only fifteen could be included
in the seminar.
The steering committee of the
association will be active in trying
to effect curriculum changes that
will give more students the
opportunity to take the seminars,
so that the individual political
science students schedule will not
be overloaded with large
lecture-type courses.
