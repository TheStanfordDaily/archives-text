# A
						REPORT FROM STANFORD FACULTY CONCERNED ABOUT RAMIFICATIONS OF THE SENATE DECISION AFFECTING R.O.T.C.
## 
### 
On April 4, 1969, the Academic Council will meet to
consider, among other matters, a review of the recent
Senate decision to end academic credit for military
training and education at Stanford. This review is the
result of a faculty petition of more than 50 signatures
to the Academic Secretary to the University calling
for a reconsideration by the Academic Council of the
Senate's decision to eliminate academic credit for all
ROTC courses and requesting adequate consideration
of the Minority Report of the ad hoc Committee on
ROTC.
Although the focus of the forthcoming review is
ROTC, the signatories of this report believe that the
issues involved have ramifications which extend well
beyond the immediate status of ROTC at Stanford.
Fundamentally, our concern is directed toward the
precipitant action of the Senate. Not only was the Mi
nority Report of the ad hoc Committee on ROTC given
little consideration in the Senate debate, but the Ma
jority Report of the Committee was approved, in the
main, within an unduly short time after the report was
issued. Also, there is an assumption of the uniqueness
of purpose of Stanford University underlying the Ma
jority Report, and therefore the Senate action, which
is not shared by many faculty members. This assump
tion, if allowed to stand, has major implications for
other areas of the University.
It is recognized that Senate members expect to vote
according to their own judgment, and not under in
struction from their constituents. But, when decisions
of major impact are to be taken, a broad basis of Uni
versity wide discussion and sharing of opinion should
precede the decision. We submit that no adequate dis
cussion or testing of opinion preceded the vote by
which, on the latter part of a single afternoon, the Aca
demic Senate took up the Committee Reports on ROTC
and made sweeping decisions concerning them after
less than three hours of debate. Those decisions were
of far reaching academic consequences and were, in
fact, of national importance. On matters of major sig
nificance the importance of obtaining a consensus of
the Academic Council itself overrides considerations
both of the prestige of the Senate and of the incon
venience of convening the Academic Council in ple
nary session to speak its collective mind.
To address the issue of ROTC directly, it is well to
point out the inconsistencies between the original ar
guments in the proposal of September 1968 by 10 fac
ulty members, which initiated study of ROTC at Stan
ford, and the arguments contained in the Majority Re
port adopted by the Senate on February 13, 1969. 1 In
the September proposal, the authors stated that "cer
tain features of the Military Science programs at Stan
ford are undesirable first, because they compromise the
integrity of Stanford's degrees; second, because they
compromise the academic integrity of faculty rank at
Stanford; and third, because they are incompatible
with the University's commitment to encourage the free
intellectual development of all its students". In addi
tion, they stated that "the quality of the teaching staff
in the military science programs is not comparable with
that in other departments at Sanford," and that "there
is some indication that this (course) material does not
present a significant challenge to Stanford students.
The majority of the ad hoc Committee on ROTC,
ironically —after lengthy deliberations — moved away
from these issues and based their objections to ROTC
upon the philosophical precept that RO TC is institu
tionally incompatible with the academic objectives of
the University. The case against ROTC presented by
the Majority appears to be founded principally not on

the argument that abuses or degradation of standards
exist in the ROTC program as it now operates, but that
theoretically, such abuses might develop at some un
forseen time. The Senate originally charged the Com
mittee to define a basis on which "proper relations be
tween the ROTC Department and the University may
be established by review and reform of the present re
lations." The Majority of the Committee, in spite of
these instructions asserts that "there can be no proper
relations between the University Departments and
ROTC as an organized on campus program" and it
ignores the specific, substantial, and sweeping pro
posals of the Minority Report to work out a positive
and progressive relationship which will be responsive
to legitimate criticisms and will assure curricular con
trol of ROTC by Stanford University.
A number of faculty members were unaware at the
time of the Senate vote on ROTC that allegations of
inferior teaching and poor quality of ROTC courses
had not been substantiated nor vindicated by the Sen
ate ad hoc Committee on ROTC. Moreover, a preced
ing charge that "ROTC compromises the integrity of
Stanford's degrees" and"the academic integrity of fac
ulty rank" seems more and more questionable in the
light of the recent Allan Cartter report of the American
Council on Education. 2 That is, wouldn't it be absurd
to argue that academic integrity at Stanford University
is compromised because of studies in the Humanities
which relegated Stanford to second place relative to the
University of California in excellence of graduate educa
tion? The University of California has the same ROTC
programs as Stanford and has recently acted to retain
those programs within the curriculum.
The one area where initial and subsequent charges
against ROTC invoked some doubt on the part of con
cerned faculty is that ROTC is "incompatible with free
intellectual development of students." But while the
Majority Report expresses alarm that ROTC may sub
vert intellectual freedom, it ignores the impairment of
ROTC courses which many have chosen to take and
many wish to take. No compulsion requires any student
to take ROTC courses unless he so chooses, and only a
minority do so. Now the Academic Senate has adopted
a compulsory act which deprives the student minority
of the present freedom to include ROTC courses in its
curriculum. The Senate has done so under the extra
ordinary theory that it will protect the freedom of stu
dents by compulsorily depriving them of an option
which they now possess.
It is noteworthy that the Majority Report on ROTC
specifically mentions that "the Majority also consciously
sought to exclude personal feeling about the war in
Vietnam from its deliberations. I he very fact that
this point is stressed in the final report is sufficient to
lead one to conjecture on the degree to which the sig
natories of that report and members of the Senate have
been capable of separating the analysis of ROTC from
their feelings about the war in Vietnam. Five of the ten
faculty members who signed the September resolution
opposing ROTC are members of the Senate of the Aca
demic Council. One Senate member who spoke elo
quently for and voted for the Majority Report has pro
mulgated a position paper which directly ties the US-
Vietnam and other foreign involvements, and the ready
supply of young men, with his opposition to ROTC.
We faculty members who are concerned about the fu
ture 1 of ROTC at Stanford cannot accept the arguments
of those who claim that the Vietnam involvement had
no influence on their decisions regarding ROTC,'. We
urge that loriu range decisions which would tend to re
move the training of officers from the civilian influences

of the University life ought not to be taken hastily and
perhaps irresponsibly in an atmosphere of frustration
and anguish over a controversial involvement in Viet
nam.
The plea of the concerned faculty is that members of
the Academic Council become concerned and consider
objectively the arguments to be presented on April 4th.
The question today primarily is ROTC, but it also in
volves the welfare of any department at Stanford which
in the future may meet the disapproval of a majority of
members of the Senate involving slightly more than a
quorum.
When you evaluate the arguments to be presented on
April 4th, please note the recent student referendum on
ROTC which, in an unusually large turnout, favored
support and some academic credit for ROTC. The
Board of Trustees, on March 12th, directed President
Pitzer to continue negotiations with the Department of
Defense officially "leading to appropriate actions which
will improve and vitalize this important program." The
Trustees also urged that full weight be given to the fol
lowing two considerations:
1. This nation has a strong and valued tradition of
civilian participation in military leadership.
2. Deterioration of that tradition would move us very
quickly towards the emergency of a miltary caste.
We believe with the minority of the ad hoc Commit
tee on ROTC that Stanford University has an obliga
tion to serve the nation and society, for the University
benefits from its privileged place in that society. Stan
ford University may choose or not choose to continue
to participate in ROTC. If the University chooses to
continue, it is obligated to support ROTC in conditions
that offer reasonable assurances of vitality and worth
to its students, as well as to the military service.
Among the arguments which we commend to your
consideration are the following:
This nation has traditionally relied upon its civilian
academic institutions for the preponderance of its mili
tary officers — particularly in times of national emer
gency, but also in times of comparative peace.
This tradition has served this nation well in the past,
maintaining civilian influence and control over the mili
tary through civilian participation. There has been a
continued infusion into our armed forces of leaders with
dominantly civilian concerns and outlooks, and a return
from service to prominent positions in civilian life of
men who can knowledgeably criticize and shape the
role of our armed forces.
The pitfalls of moving away from a strong tradition
of civilian participation in military leadership are evi
dent in the history of countries in Europe and Latin
America whose armed forces have been dominated by
an isolated military caste, and whose public life has
been blighted by the arbitrary use of military forces
in civil affairs. A narrowness of viewpoint which tends
to evolve in any military establishment becomes greatly
compounded through isolation of that establishment
from other elements in society.
The concept of ROTC is entirely consistent with the
military traditions of this nation. There are those who
hold the aribtrarv removal of ROTC courses from the
academic structure of our major universities will force
the military services to develop quickly suitable alter
natives. The fact is that at present no suitable long
range alternative to the ROTC program is available to
provide the quality and the numbers of officers to pro
vide leadership for our armed forces. Additional actions
at this time which will erode thai status of ROTC] and
degrade the worth of the programs to students may seri

ously impair the vitality of ROTC at our major univer
sities. Such action would be a grave disservice to this
nation.
Dissatisfaction with the draft and the Vietnam con
flict has created an environment on our campuses
which, for several years, has deterred participation in
ROTC. But we urge that the question of American in
volvement in Vietnam should not be confused with the
question whether American college men should have an
opportunity, while at college, to qualify as officers or
whether this training for civilian pursuits should be seg
gregrated from training for military pursuits.
Concern over the present forms of ROTC has fre
quently obscured recognition of the benefiical aspects
of the programs to the students of Stanford. The courses
are relevant, of interest to over 350 students, and of
worthy academic quality. The ROTC programs provide
approximately $250,000 each year in student financial
aid, bringing to Stanford very able students, including
some who otherwise would not be able to come to Stan
ford. There are also some 40 graduate students presently
enrolled in ROTC programs at Stanford. The operative
question is whether any unrestrained group in the
University shall, by compulsion, deprive these students
of this freedom which they have possessed and exer
cised for many years and which the Majority Report
does not even claim has had any serious adverse con
sequences.
In the past three years the military services have in
stituted reforms in the ROTC programs in concert with
universities and colleges. The services have indicated a
willingness to continue to modify programs to adjust
to individual institutional requirements. The Secretary
of Defense recently stated: "The Department of De
fense stands ready at any time to coordinate with those
institutions having ROTC programs in resolving any
problems, current or potential and would welcome their
ideas and assistance." There is no reason that suitable
programs responsive to legitimate criticism cannot be
evolved providing premature action removing ROTC
from the academic structure of the University does not
foreclose suitable options before negotiations can be
undertaken.
All Stanford faculty members have reason to be con
cerned with the ramifications of the recent Academic
Senate vote to end academic credit for ROTC courses.
They should not resign their right to pass final judg
ment on the recommendations of the Senate. They
should not overlook the fact that the Senate policy is at
variance with the wishes of a substantial majority of
students in a recent referendum, and is also at variance
with the exploratory approach of the Board of Trustees.
The whole nation may be affected by what happens at
Stanford on April 4th. Stanford need not follow the
lead of other universities, but should take the lead in
the development of an acceptable on-campus ROTC
Program. The ROTC issue can be resolved with time.
We should give President Pitzer and the Department of
Defense that time.
