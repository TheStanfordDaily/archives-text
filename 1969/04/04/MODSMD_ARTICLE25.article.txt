## Films Mirror Society But Remain Trite 
### CHRIS MORRIS 
The movies' responsibility to
society has been tuken lightly.
Although movies are today
mirroring the times with a realism
not seen since the World War,
their treatment of story material
is still for the most part
superficial, and in fact most
pictures are still devoted to
trivialities.
These words are not very
reassuring, are they? They do not
come from the pens of Pauline
Kael or John Simon, however.
They were written 30 years ago
by the film historian Lewis
Jacobs, and unfortunately they
are as true now as they were then.
American cinema has produced
little in the last two years of any
value concerning U.S. social and
political realities. The trivia that
Jacobs was seeing in 1939 has
assaulted the screen in the sixties
in full force. A film concerning a
social problem is still considered
by many to be controversial, and
most of the films are produced as
ego-boosters for "liberal"
producers (see Stanley Kramer) or
for a big cleanup at the
box-office. Generally the
productions have copped awards
from easy-to-please critics grateful
to see social themes exposed at all
on the screen.
American films got off to a late
start with social themes due to an
historical consideration. The
sixties started off as a hangover
from the schlock fifties. Film in
the early fifties was in a state of
McCarthyized parlysis. A director
couldn't make a movie on
flouridation without being called
a communist. Only in the early
sixties did Hollywood directors
acquire the balls and the
technique to shake off their
inhibitions.
The films that Hollywood has
produced in the last two years
have been cut from the material
of reaction and exploitation. The
rise of the Negro in America, the
war in Vietnam, civil disorders
and the domestic outbreaks of
violence are all marketable
commodities. They are news. So
films which reflect today's
domestic strife are cut from
today's newsprint.
Art should be a little more
than the blandest and most
sensational expositions of hot
themes. In order to prove my
point, I'll have to review a few
categories which have been dealt
with. In going over these pithy
movies which the critics have
deemed "significant social
documents," perhaps some
alternatives to the pap Hollywood
is trying to pawn off on the
unsuspecting American "liberal"
will be found.
Black and White Comedies
Movies about race relations in
the U.S. could be dealt with in an
article entitled "The Resistable
Rise of Sidney Poitier."
Single-handed, Mr. Poitier has lit
up the eyes of thousands of
American critics with his
port<v.yals of "the button-down
Negro' in In the Heat of the
Night and Guess Who's Coming to
Dinin r? I couldn't see what the
uproar was all about: the movies
provided few insights, and their
impact on the American critics
was a result of good public
relations work. All that they had
to show for themselves was
Poitier's phony black persona: a
view of Ralph Bunche as the
universal Negro.
I will have to admit that In the
Heat oi the Night is the one film
of the two that I am qualified to
write about; the mere idea of
Guess Who's Coming to Dinner? j

offended me so that I didn't go to
see it. But Heal will do.
I agree with Andrew Sarris that
the film is "vaudeville." In fact it
is worse, for it is a cartoon. It is a
black Jerry kicking a white Rom
right in his sociopathic ass. Rod
Steiger's caricature is good, but
the fact remains that it is a
caricature. The entire film is Birth
of a Nation in reverse: dumb
white bigots are substituted for
clownish Negroes. The cliche has
been reversed. Instead of
Griffith's "Mammy, the faithful
servant." we get Poitier's Virgil
Tibbs, who's sharper than
Sherlock Holmes and black, too.
Ideas, Insight Lacking
It is not a film of ideas or
insight. It is a film for white
liberals to get a charge out of. One
hundred years of slavery and
ghetto living are titrated down to
the fact that Poitier is one of
those black men who made good.
What about Harlem and Watts,
Messrs. Jewison and Silliphant?
Other films give us the same
black and white comedies. Guess
Who's Coming to Dinner?
featured an idea that was so
patently hokey that I couldn't
bear to see it. Otto Preminger's
white trash spectacular Hurry
Sundown loaded the dice by
making the black couple in the
film the only bodies that
resembled human beings. The film
can hardly be taken seriously,
though; no film that uses a line
like "Ah killed him, jest as shore
as Ah put a bullet in his haid" can
be.
None of these films concern a
real world. They try to make us
happy by showing us bigots, ogres
and other misguided souls getting
along with a black man of
superhuman capabilities. All this
was done so much better in Ritt's
Edge of the City in the early
fifties, when Poitier, and the
American Negro in films, was still
a mortal being. A restoration of
human values to stories of
black-white relations is badly
needed.
Vietnam: Cowboys and Vietcong
The only American movie
about our foreign war has been The
Green Berets, starring Indian
fighter John Wayne. The movie,
the critics said, played the game
of Cowboys and Vietcong, with
the special forces troops playing
the sheriff and his posse. The
good guy-bad guy ideology was
roasted by the critics with good
reason.
America has as yet produced
no film criticism of the war in
Vietnam, at least on the major
studio level. Berets made by
Wayne's company, took an

ultra-hawkish stance. As is the
case with much that is stimulating
in American arts today, one has to
poke his nose underground to find
a film on Vietnam at home.
Indeed, no American film has
dealt significantly (or popularly)
with war and its horrors since Dr.
Strange love, while on the
continent we have seen among
others, The War Game and How I
Won the War.
Vietnam is the first war since
World War I which has been
ignored by American filmmakers.
Perhaps it is a combinaton of
factors which makes this war such
a problem for the director: its
complexities, a large home-front
opposition, a coterie of very vocal
and censorious hawks, the studio
system, etc. But still, there is
absolutely no reason why
American filmmakers should
remain as sonmolent as the
diplomats in Paris. One thing is
certain, and that is that an
obnoxious oversimplification such
as The Green Berets should not be
the only work on the war to come
out of Hollywood.
The Student as a Nebbish
The Graduate was the most
popular move of 1967-68. Its
central was Benjamin Braddock, a
graduate from a supposedly
accredited American university.
Benjamin is by turns naive, stupid,
and lovesick. To Mike Nichols:
this Mr. Nichols, is the American
college student?
My distress with The Graduate
is magnified by one every time a
friend of mine comes to me with
the admission that he identifies
passionately with poor boob
Benjamin. Many of these friends
paradoxically snarl about the
"over-30's," and their enjoyment
of the film confuses me. Benjamin
is over 30. He is a nebbish. As for
identifying with him, how can
anyone? I can't conceive of a boy
like Benjamin existing in the real
world past the age of 10.
Benjamin's character is only
once facet of The Graduate, but it
does relate to another unfortunate
oversight on the part of the
American filmmaker. The
completely warped portrayal of
youth in Hollywood's productions
is fast becoming one of my pet
peeves. Hollywood's view of
young people is the one reflected
in Frank Zappa's music: "cheap
thrills in the back of my car."
Although somewhat advanced
beyond the American-Inter
national beach-blanket syndrome,
the picture is still uncomfortably
similar. American kids are stupid
and like to make out.
But what about Columbia,
Wisconsin, and San Francisco

a few political smarts. However,
AIP gives us pill-popping sex
fiends in The Trip and Three in
the Attic. Young revolutionaries
are bypassed for the more colorful
speed freaks and hippies.
Jean-Luc Godard made an
atrocious film called La Chinoise
late in 1967. While its redeeming
characteristics were few, it
attempted to give a picture of the
young people who, in their
misdirected, Godard-like way,
created the Paris protests of 1968.
Yet in this country, we have to
look to hand-held documentaries
to catch a glimpse of politically
conscious Americans.
Few important or crucial
subjects have been covered even
adequately in Hollywood features.
Only one has been seen sharply,
and that is violence thanks largely
to Bonnie and Clyde and Targets.
I'm still not pleased, though.
Hollywood is swamped by its
phony pretensions on one hand,
or lies deaf and mute on the
other. Even a deaf-mute could feel
the tremors of America, however.
I don't feel that it is preposterous
to say that cinema is an -art. While
style and imagination are
requisites in the arts, they must
also mirror reality. A socialistic
fervor may not be necessary, but
the time has come for the camera
to become a critic of America. I'm
tired of the massage. I want the
real thing.

IJLACk SHERLOCK HOLMES, Virgil Tibbs. portrayed by Sidney Poitier,
wrestles his white avenger to the ground in In the Heat of the Night. The film,
especially appealing to white lilwrals was another step in the "resistable rise of
Sidney Poitier."

start with social themes due to an
historical consideration. The
sixties started off as a hangover
from the schlock fifties. Film in
the early fifties was in a state of
McCarthyized parlysis. A director
couldn't make a movie on
flouridation without being called
a communist. Only in the early
sixties did Hollywood directors
acquire the balls and the
technique to shake off their
inhibitions.
The films that Hollywood has
produced in the last two years
have been cut from the material
of reaction and exploitation. The
rise of the Negro in America, the
war in Vietnam, civil disorders
and the domestic outbreaks of
violence are all marketable
commodities. They are news. So
films which reflect today's
domestic strife are cut from
today's newsprint.
Art should be a little more
than the blandest and most
sensational expositions of hot
themes. In order to prove my
point, I'll have to review a few
categories which have been dealt
with. In going over these pithy
movies which the critics have
deemed "significant social
documents," perhaps some
alternatives to the pap Hollywood
is trying to pawn off on the
unsuspecting American "liberal"
will be found.
Black and White Comedies
Movies about race relations in
the U.S. could be dealt with in an
article entitled "The Resistable
Rise of Sidney Poitier."
Single-handed, Mr. Poitier has lit
up the eyes of thousands of
American critics with his
port<v.yals of "the button-down
Negro' in In the Heat of the
Night and Guess Who's Coming to
Dinin r? I couldn't see what the
uproar was all about: the movies
provided few insights, and their
impact on the American critics
was a result of good public
relations work. All that they had
to show for themselves was
Poitier's phony black persona: a
view of Ralph Bunche as the
universal Negro.
I will have to admit that In the
Heat oi the Night is the one film
of the two that I am qualified to
write about; the mere idea of
Guess Who's Coming to Dinner? j

offended me so that I didn't go to
see it. But Heal will do.
I agree with Andrew Sarris that
the film is "vaudeville." In fact it
is worse, for it is a cartoon. It is a
black Jerry kicking a white Rom
right in his sociopathic ass. Rod
Steiger's caricature is good, but
the fact remains that it is a
caricature. The entire film is Birth
of a Nation in reverse: dumb
white bigots are substituted for
clownish Negroes. The cliche has
been reversed. Instead of
Griffith's "Mammy, the faithful
servant." we get Poitier's Virgil
Tibbs, who's sharper than
Sherlock Holmes and black, too.
Ideas, Insight Lacking
It is not a film of ideas or
insight. It is a film for white
liberals to get a charge out of. One
hundred years of slavery and
ghetto living are titrated down to
the fact that Poitier is one of
those black men who made good.
What about Harlem and Watts,
Messrs. Jewison and Silliphant?
Other films give us the same
black and white comedies. Guess
Who's Coming to Dinner?
featured an idea that was so
patently hokey that I couldn't
bear to see it. Otto Preminger's
white trash spectacular Hurry
Sundown loaded the dice by
making the black couple in the
film the only bodies that
resembled human beings. The film
can hardly be taken seriously,
though; no film that uses a line
like "Ah killed him, jest as shore
as Ah put a bullet in his haid" can
be.
None of these films concern a
real world. They try to make us
happy by showing us bigots, ogres
and other misguided souls getting
along with a black man of
superhuman capabilities. All this
was done so much better in Ritt's
Edge of the City in the early
fifties, when Poitier, and the
American Negro in films, was still
a mortal being. A restoration of
human values to stories of
black-white relations is badly
needed.
Vietnam: Cowboys and Vietcong
The only American movie
about our foreign war has been The
Green Berets, starring Indian
fighter John Wayne. The movie,
the critics said, played the game
of Cowboys and Vietcong, with
the special forces troops playing
the sheriff and his posse. The
good guy-bad guy ideology was
roasted by the critics with good
reason.
America has as yet produced
no film criticism of the war in
Vietnam, at least on the major
studio level. Berets made by
Wayne's company, took an

ultra-hawkish stance. As is the
case with much that is stimulating
in American arts today, one has to
poke his nose underground to find
a film on Vietnam at home.
Indeed, no American film has
dealt significantly (or popularly)
with war and its horrors since Dr.
Strange love, while on the
continent we have seen among
others, The War Game and How I
Won the War.
Vietnam is the first war since
World War I which has been
ignored by American filmmakers.
Perhaps it is a combinaton of
factors which makes this war such
a problem for the director: its
complexities, a large home-front
opposition, a coterie of very vocal
and censorious hawks, the studio
system, etc. But still, there is
absolutely no reason why
American filmmakers should
remain as sonmolent as the
diplomats in Paris. One thing is
certain, and that is that an
obnoxious oversimplification such
as The Green Berets should not be
the only work on the war to come
out of Hollywood.
The Student as a Nebbish
The Graduate was the most
popular move of 1967-68. Its
central was Benjamin Braddock, a
graduate from a supposedly
accredited American university.
Benjamin is by turns naive, stupid,
and lovesick. To Mike Nichols:
this Mr. Nichols, is the American
college student?
My distress with The Graduate
is magnified by one every time a
friend of mine comes to me with
the admission that he identifies
passionately with poor boob
Benjamin. Many of these friends
paradoxically snarl about the
"over-30's," and their enjoyment
of the film confuses me. Benjamin
is over 30. He is a nebbish. As for
identifying with him, how can
anyone? I can't conceive of a boy
like Benjamin existing in the real
world past the age of 10.
Benjamin's character is only
once facet of The Graduate, but it
does relate to another unfortunate
oversight on the part of the
American filmmaker. The
completely warped portrayal of
youth in Hollywood's productions
is fast becoming one of my pet
peeves. Hollywood's view of
young people is the one reflected
in Frank Zappa's music: "cheap
thrills in the back of my car."
Although somewhat advanced
beyond the American-Inter
national beach-blanket syndrome,
the picture is still uncomfortably
similar. American kids are stupid
and like to make out.
But what about Columbia,
Wisconsin, and San Francisco

a few political smarts. However,
AIP gives us pill-popping sex
fiends in The Trip and Three in
the Attic. Young revolutionaries
are bypassed for the more colorful
speed freaks and hippies.
Jean-Luc Godard made an
atrocious film called La Chinoise
late in 1967. While its redeeming
characteristics were few, it
attempted to give a picture of the
young people who, in their
misdirected, Godard-like way,
created the Paris protests of 1968.
Yet in this country, we have to
look to hand-held documentaries
to catch a glimpse of politically
conscious Americans.
Few important or crucial
subjects have been covered even
adequately in Hollywood features.
Only one has been seen sharply,
and that is violence thanks largely
to Bonnie and Clyde and Targets.
I'm still not pleased, though.
Hollywood is swamped by its
phony pretensions on one hand,
or lies deaf and mute on the
other. Even a deaf-mute could feel
the tremors of America, however.
I don't feel that it is preposterous
to say that cinema is an -art. While
style and imagination are
requisites in the arts, they must
also mirror reality. A socialistic
fervor may not be necessary, but
the time has come for the camera
to become a critic of America. I'm
tired of the massage. I want the
real thing.

IJLACk SHERLOCK HOLMES, Virgil Tibbs. portrayed by Sidney Poitier,
wrestles his white avenger to the ground in In the Heat of the Night. The film,
especially appealing to white lilwrals was another step in the "resistable rise of
Sidney Poitier."
The movies' responsibility to
society has been tuken lightly.
Although movies are today
mirroring the times with a realism
not seen since the World War,
their treatment of story material
is still for the most part
superficial, and in fact most
pictures are still devoted to
trivialities.
These words are not very
reassuring, are they? They do not
come from the pens of Pauline
Kael or John Simon, however.
They were written 30 years ago
by the film historian Lewis
Jacobs, and unfortunately they
are as true now as they were then.
American cinema has produced
little in the last two years of any
value concerning U.S. social and
political realities. The trivia that
Jacobs was seeing in 1939 has
assaulted the screen in the sixties
in full force. A film concerning a
social problem is still considered
by many to be controversial, and
most of the films are produced as
ego-boosters for "liberal"
producers (see Stanley Kramer) or
for a big cleanup at the
box-office. Generally the
productions have copped awards

to see social themes exposed at all
on the screen.

the U.S. could be dealt with in an
article entitled "The Resistable
Rise of Sidney Poitier."
Single-handed, Mr. Poitier has lit
up the eyes of thousands of
American critics with his
port<v.yals of "the button-down
Negro' in In the Heat of the
Night and Guess Who's Coming to
Dinin r? I couldn't see what the
uproar was all about: the movies
provided few insights, and their
impact on the American critics
was a result of good public
relations work. All that they had
to show for themselves was
Poitier's phony black persona: a
view of Ralph Bunche as the
universal Negro.
I will have to admit that In the
Heat oi the Night is the one film
of the two that I am qualified to
write about; the mere idea of
Guess Who's Coming to Dinner? j

offended me so that I didn't go to
see it. But Heal will do.
I agree with Andrew Sarris that
the film is "vaudeville." In fact it
is worse, for it is a cartoon. It is a
black Jerry kicking a white Rom
right in his sociopathic ass. Rod
Steiger's caricature is good, but
the fact remains that it is a
caricature. The entire film is Birth
of a Nation in reverse: dumb
white bigots are substituted for
clownish Negroes. The cliche has
been reversed. Instead of
Griffith's "Mammy, the faithful
servant." we get Poitier's Virgil
Tibbs, who's sharper than
Sherlock Holmes and black, too.
Ideas, Insight Lacking
It is not a film of ideas or
insight. It is a film for white
liberals to get a charge out of. One
hundred years of slavery and
ghetto living are titrated down to
the fact that Poitier is one of
those black men who made good.
What about Harlem and Watts,
Messrs. Jewison and Silliphant?
Other films give us the same
black and white comedies. Guess
Who's Coming to Dinner?
featured an idea that was so
patently hokey that I couldn't
bear to see it. Otto Preminger's
white trash spectacular Hurry
Sundown loaded the dice by
making the black couple in the
film the only bodies that
resembled human beings. The film
can hardly be taken seriously,
though; no film that uses a line
like "Ah killed him, jest as shore
as Ah put a bullet in his haid" can
be.
None of these films concern a
real world. They try to make us
happy by showing us bigots, ogres
and other misguided souls getting
along with a black man of
superhuman capabilities. All this
was done so much better in Ritt's
Edge of the City in the early
fifties, when Poitier, and the
American Negro in films, was still
a mortal being. A restoration of
human values to stories of
black-white relations is badly
needed.
Vietnam: Cowboys and Vietcong
The only American movie
about our foreign war has been The
Green Berets, starring Indian
fighter John Wayne. The movie,
the critics said, played the game
of Cowboys and Vietcong, with
the special forces troops playing
the sheriff and his posse. The
good guy-bad guy ideology was
roasted by the critics with good
reason.
America has as yet produced
no film criticism of the war in
Vietnam, at least on the major
studio level. Berets made by
Wayne's company, took an

ultra-hawkish stance. As is the
case with much that is stimulating
in American arts today, one has to
poke his nose underground to find
a film on Vietnam at home.
Indeed, no American film has
dealt significantly (or popularly)
with war and its horrors since Dr.
Strange love, while on the
continent we have seen among
others, The War Game and How I
Won the War.
Vietnam is the first war since
World War I which has been
ignored by American filmmakers.
Perhaps it is a combinaton of
factors which makes this war such
a problem for the director: its
complexities, a large home-front
opposition, a coterie of very vocal
and censorious hawks, the studio
system, etc. But still, there is
absolutely no reason why
American filmmakers should
remain as sonmolent as the
diplomats in Paris. One thing is
certain, and that is that an
obnoxious oversimplification such
as The Green Berets should not be
the only work on the war to come
out of Hollywood.
The Student as a Nebbish
The Graduate was the most
popular move of 1967-68. Its
central was Benjamin Braddock, a
graduate from a supposedly
accredited American university.
Benjamin is by turns naive, stupid,
and lovesick. To Mike Nichols:
this Mr. Nichols, is the American
college student?
My distress with The Graduate
is magnified by one every time a
friend of mine comes to me with
the admission that he identifies
passionately with poor boob
Benjamin. Many of these friends
paradoxically snarl about the
"over-30's," and their enjoyment
of the film confuses me. Benjamin
is over 30. He is a nebbish. As for
identifying with him, how can
anyone? I can't conceive of a boy
like Benjamin existing in the real
world past the age of 10.
Benjamin's character is only
once facet of The Graduate, but it
does relate to another unfortunate
oversight on the part of the
American filmmaker. The
completely warped portrayal of
youth in Hollywood's productions
is fast becoming one of my pet
peeves. Hollywood's view of
young people is the one reflected
in Frank Zappa's music: "cheap
thrills in the back of my car."
Although somewhat advanced
beyond the American-Inter
national beach-blanket syndrome,
the picture is still uncomfortably
similar. American kids are stupid
and like to make out.
But what about Columbia,
Wisconsin, and San Francisco

a few political smarts. However,
AIP gives us pill-popping sex
fiends in The Trip and Three in
the Attic. Young revolutionaries
are bypassed for the more colorful
speed freaks and hippies.
Jean-Luc Godard made an
atrocious film called La Chinoise
late in 1967. While its redeeming
characteristics were few, it
attempted to give a picture of the
young people who, in their
misdirected, Godard-like way,
created the Paris protests of 1968.
Yet in this country, we have to
look to hand-held documentaries
to catch a glimpse of politically
conscious Americans.
Few important or crucial
subjects have been covered even
adequately in Hollywood features.
Only one has been seen sharply,
and that is violence thanks largely
to Bonnie and Clyde and Targets.
I'm still not pleased, though.
Hollywood is swamped by its
phony pretensions on one hand,
or lies deaf and mute on the
other. Even a deaf-mute could feel
the tremors of America, however.
I don't feel that it is preposterous
to say that cinema is an -art. While
style and imagination are
requisites in the arts, they must
also mirror reality. A socialistic
fervor may not be necessary, but
the time has come for the camera
to become a critic of America. I'm
tired of the massage. I want the
real thing.

IJLACk SHERLOCK HOLMES, Virgil Tibbs. portrayed by Sidney Poitier,
wrestles his white avenger to the ground in In the Heat of the Night. The film,
especially appealing to white lilwrals was another step in the "resistable rise of
Sidney Poitier."
The movies' responsibility to
society has been tuken lightly.
Although movies are today
mirroring the times with a realism
not seen since the World War,
their treatment of story material
is still for the most part
superficial, and in fact most
pictures are still devoted to
trivialities.
These words are not very
reassuring, are they? They do not
come from the pens of Pauline
Kael or John Simon, however.
They were written 30 years ago
by the film historian Lewis
Jacobs, and unfortunately they
are as true now as they were then.
American cinema has produced
little in the last two years of any
value concerning U.S. social and
political realities. The trivia that
Jacobs was seeing in 1939 has
assaulted the screen in the sixties
in full force. A film concerning a
social problem is still considered
by many to be controversial, and
most of the films are produced as
ego-boosters for "liberal"
producers (see Stanley Kramer) or
for a big cleanup at the
box-office. Generally the
productions have copped awards
from easy-to-please critics grateful
to see social themes exposed at all
on the screen.
American films got off to a late
start with social themes due to an
historical consideration. The
sixties started off as a hangover
from the schlock fifties. Film in
the early fifties was in a state of
McCarthyized parlysis. A director
couldn't make a movie on
flouridation without being called
a communist. Only in the early
sixties did Hollywood directors
acquire the balls and the
technique to shake off their
inhibitions.
The films that Hollywood has
produced in the last two years
have been cut from the material
of reaction and exploitation. The
rise of the Negro in America, the
war in Vietnam, civil disorders
and the domestic outbreaks of
violence are all marketable
commodities. They are news. So
films which reflect today's
domestic strife are cut from
today's newsprint.
Art should be a little more
than the blandest and most
sensational expositions of hot
themes. In order to prove my
point, I'll have to review a few
categories which have been dealt
with. In going over these pithy
movies which the critics have
deemed "significant social
documents," perhaps some
alternatives to the pap Hollywood
is trying to pawn off on the
unsuspecting American "liberal"
will be found.

caricature. The entire film is Birth
of a Nation in reverse: dumb
white bigots are substituted for
clownish Negroes. The cliche has
been reversed. Instead of
Griffith's "Mammy, the faithful
servant." we get Poitier's Virgil
Tibbs, who's sharper than
Sherlock Holmes and black, too.
Ideas, Insight Lacking
It is not a film of ideas or
insight. It is a film for white
liberals to get a charge out of. One
hundred years of slavery and
ghetto living are titrated down to
the fact that Poitier is one of
those black men who made good.
What about Harlem and Watts,
Messrs. Jewison and Silliphant?
Other films give us the same
black and white comedies. Guess
Who's Coming to Dinner?
featured an idea that was so
patently hokey that I couldn't
bear to see it. Otto Preminger's
white trash spectacular Hurry
Sundown loaded the dice by
making the black couple in the
film the only bodies that
resembled human beings. The film
can hardly be taken seriously,
though; no film that uses a line
like "Ah killed him, jest as shore
as Ah put a bullet in his haid" can
be.
None of these films concern a
real world. They try to make us
happy by showing us bigots, ogres
and other misguided souls getting
along with a black man of
superhuman capabilities. All this
was done so much better in Ritt's
Edge of the City in the early
fifties, when Poitier, and the
American Negro in films, was still
a mortal being. A restoration of
human values to stories of
black-white relations is badly
needed.
Vietnam: Cowboys and Vietcong
The only American movie
about our foreign war has been The
Green Berets, starring Indian
fighter John Wayne. The movie,
the critics said, played the game
of Cowboys and Vietcong, with
the special forces troops playing
the sheriff and his posse. The
good guy-bad guy ideology was
roasted by the critics with good
reason.
America has as yet produced
no film criticism of the war in
Vietnam, at least on the major
studio level. Berets made by
Wayne's company, took an

ultra-hawkish stance. As is the
case with much that is stimulating
in American arts today, one has to
poke his nose underground to find
a film on Vietnam at home.
Indeed, no American film has
dealt significantly (or popularly)
with war and its horrors since Dr.
Strange love, while on the
continent we have seen among
others, The War Game and How I
Won the War.
Vietnam is the first war since
World War I which has been
ignored by American filmmakers.
Perhaps it is a combinaton of
factors which makes this war such
a problem for the director: its
complexities, a large home-front
opposition, a coterie of very vocal
and censorious hawks, the studio
system, etc. But still, there is
absolutely no reason why
American filmmakers should
remain as sonmolent as the
diplomats in Paris. One thing is
certain, and that is that an
obnoxious oversimplification such
as The Green Berets should not be
the only work on the war to come
out of Hollywood.
The Student as a Nebbish
The Graduate was the most
popular move of 1967-68. Its
central was Benjamin Braddock, a
graduate from a supposedly
accredited American university.
Benjamin is by turns naive, stupid,
and lovesick. To Mike Nichols:
this Mr. Nichols, is the American
college student?
My distress with The Graduate
is magnified by one every time a
friend of mine comes to me with
the admission that he identifies
passionately with poor boob
Benjamin. Many of these friends
paradoxically snarl about the
"over-30's," and their enjoyment
of the film confuses me. Benjamin
is over 30. He is a nebbish. As for
identifying with him, how can
anyone? I can't conceive of a boy
like Benjamin existing in the real
world past the age of 10.
Benjamin's character is only
once facet of The Graduate, but it
does relate to another unfortunate
oversight on the part of the
American filmmaker. The
completely warped portrayal of
youth in Hollywood's productions
is fast becoming one of my pet
peeves. Hollywood's view of
young people is the one reflected
in Frank Zappa's music: "cheap
thrills in the back of my car."
Although somewhat advanced
beyond the American-Inter
national beach-blanket syndrome,
the picture is still uncomfortably
similar. American kids are stupid
and like to make out.
But what about Columbia,
Wisconsin, and San Francisco

a few political smarts. However,
AIP gives us pill-popping sex
fiends in The Trip and Three in
the Attic. Young revolutionaries
are bypassed for the more colorful
speed freaks and hippies.
Jean-Luc Godard made an
atrocious film called La Chinoise
late in 1967. While its redeeming
characteristics were few, it
attempted to give a picture of the
young people who, in their
misdirected, Godard-like way,
created the Paris protests of 1968.
Yet in this country, we have to
look to hand-held documentaries
to catch a glimpse of politically
conscious Americans.
Few important or crucial
subjects have been covered even
adequately in Hollywood features.
Only one has been seen sharply,
and that is violence thanks largely
to Bonnie and Clyde and Targets.
I'm still not pleased, though.
Hollywood is swamped by its
phony pretensions on one hand,
or lies deaf and mute on the
other. Even a deaf-mute could feel
the tremors of America, however.
I don't feel that it is preposterous
to say that cinema is an -art. While
style and imagination are
requisites in the arts, they must
also mirror reality. A socialistic
fervor may not be necessary, but
the time has come for the camera
to become a critic of America. I'm
tired of the massage. I want the
real thing.

IJLACk SHERLOCK HOLMES, Virgil Tibbs. portrayed by Sidney Poitier,
wrestles his white avenger to the ground in In the Heat of the Night. The film,
especially appealing to white lilwrals was another step in the "resistable rise of
Sidney Poitier."
The movies' responsibility to
society has been tuken lightly.
Although movies are today
mirroring the times with a realism
not seen since the World War,
their treatment of story material
is still for the most part
superficial, and in fact most
pictures are still devoted to
trivialities.
These words are not very
reassuring, are they? They do not
come from the pens of Pauline
Kael or John Simon, however.
They were written 30 years ago
by the film historian Lewis
Jacobs, and unfortunately they
are as true now as they were then.
American cinema has produced
little in the last two years of any
value concerning U.S. social and
political realities. The trivia that
Jacobs was seeing in 1939 has
assaulted the screen in the sixties
in full force. A film concerning a
social problem is still considered
by many to be controversial, and
most of the films are produced as
ego-boosters for "liberal"
producers (see Stanley Kramer) or
for a big cleanup at the
box-office. Generally the
productions have copped awards
from easy-to-please critics grateful
to see social themes exposed at all
on the screen.
American films got off to a late
start with social themes due to an
historical consideration. The
sixties started off as a hangover
from the schlock fifties. Film in
the early fifties was in a state of
McCarthyized parlysis. A director
couldn't make a movie on
flouridation without being called
a communist. Only in the early
sixties did Hollywood directors
acquire the balls and the
technique to shake off their
inhibitions.
The films that Hollywood has
produced in the last two years
have been cut from the material
of reaction and exploitation. The
rise of the Negro in America, the
war in Vietnam, civil disorders
and the domestic outbreaks of
violence are all marketable
commodities. They are news. So
films which reflect today's
domestic strife are cut from
today's newsprint.
Art should be a little more
than the blandest and most
sensational expositions of hot
themes. In order to prove my
point, I'll have to review a few
categories which have been dealt
with. In going over these pithy
movies which the critics have
deemed "significant social
documents," perhaps some
alternatives to the pap Hollywood
is trying to pawn off on the
unsuspecting American "liberal"
will be found.
Black and White Comedies
Movies about race relations in
the U.S. could be dealt with in an
article entitled "The Resistable
Rise of Sidney Poitier."
Single-handed, Mr. Poitier has lit
up the eyes of thousands of
American critics with his
port<v.yals of "the button-down
Negro' in In the Heat of the
Night and Guess Who's Coming to
Dinin r? I couldn't see what the
uproar was all about: the movies
provided few insights, and their
impact on the American critics
was a result of good public
relations work. All that they had
to show for themselves was
Poitier's phony black persona: a
view of Ralph Bunche as the
universal Negro.
I will have to admit that In the
Heat oi the Night is the one film
of the two that I am qualified to
write about; the mere idea of
Guess Who's Coming to Dinner? j

offended me so that I didn't go to
see it. But Heal will do.
I agree with Andrew Sarris that
the film is "vaudeville." In fact it
is worse, for it is a cartoon. It is a
black Jerry kicking a white Rom
right in his sociopathic ass. Rod
Steiger's caricature is good, but
the fact remains that it is a
caricature. The entire film is Birth

None of these films concern a
real world. They try to make us
happy by showing us bigots, ogres
and other misguided souls getting
along with a black man of
superhuman capabilities. All this
was done so much better in Ritt's
Edge of the City in the early
fifties, when Poitier, and the
American Negro in films, was still
a mortal being. A restoration of
human values to stories of
black-white relations is badly
needed.
Vietnam: Cowboys and Vietcong
The only American movie
about our foreign war has been The
Green Berets, starring Indian
fighter John Wayne. The movie,
the critics said, played the game
of Cowboys and Vietcong, with
the special forces troops playing
the sheriff and his posse. The
good guy-bad guy ideology was
roasted by the critics with good
reason.
America has as yet produced
no film criticism of the war in
Vietnam, at least on the major
studio level. Berets made by
Wayne's company, took an

ultra-hawkish stance. As is the
case with much that is stimulating
in American arts today, one has to
poke his nose underground to find
a film on Vietnam at home.
Indeed, no American film has
dealt significantly (or popularly)
with war and its horrors since Dr.
Strange love, while on the
continent we have seen among
others, The War Game and How I
Won the War.
Vietnam is the first war since
World War I which has been
ignored by American filmmakers.
Perhaps it is a combinaton of
factors which makes this war such
a problem for the director: its
complexities, a large home-front
opposition, a coterie of very vocal
and censorious hawks, the studio
system, etc. But still, there is
absolutely no reason why
American filmmakers should
remain as sonmolent as the
diplomats in Paris. One thing is
certain, and that is that an
obnoxious oversimplification such
as The Green Berets should not be
the only work on the war to come
out of Hollywood.
The Student as a Nebbish
The Graduate was the most
popular move of 1967-68. Its
central was Benjamin Braddock, a
graduate from a supposedly
accredited American university.
Benjamin is by turns naive, stupid,
and lovesick. To Mike Nichols:
this Mr. Nichols, is the American
college student?
My distress with The Graduate
is magnified by one every time a
friend of mine comes to me with
the admission that he identifies
passionately with poor boob
Benjamin. Many of these friends
paradoxically snarl about the
"over-30's," and their enjoyment
of the film confuses me. Benjamin
is over 30. He is a nebbish. As for
identifying with him, how can
anyone? I can't conceive of a boy
like Benjamin existing in the real
world past the age of 10.
Benjamin's character is only
once facet of The Graduate, but it
does relate to another unfortunate
oversight on the part of the
American filmmaker. The
completely warped portrayal of
youth in Hollywood's productions
is fast becoming one of my pet
peeves. Hollywood's view of
young people is the one reflected
in Frank Zappa's music: "cheap
thrills in the back of my car."
Although somewhat advanced
beyond the American-Inter
national beach-blanket syndrome,
the picture is still uncomfortably
similar. American kids are stupid
and like to make out.
But what about Columbia,
Wisconsin, and San Francisco

a few political smarts. However,
AIP gives us pill-popping sex
fiends in The Trip and Three in
the Attic. Young revolutionaries
are bypassed for the more colorful
speed freaks and hippies.
Jean-Luc Godard made an
atrocious film called La Chinoise
late in 1967. While its redeeming
characteristics were few, it
attempted to give a picture of the
young people who, in their
misdirected, Godard-like way,
created the Paris protests of 1968.
Yet in this country, we have to
look to hand-held documentaries
to catch a glimpse of politically
conscious Americans.
Few important or crucial
subjects have been covered even
adequately in Hollywood features.
Only one has been seen sharply,
and that is violence thanks largely
to Bonnie and Clyde and Targets.
I'm still not pleased, though.
Hollywood is swamped by its
phony pretensions on one hand,
or lies deaf and mute on the
other. Even a deaf-mute could feel
the tremors of America, however.
I don't feel that it is preposterous
to say that cinema is an -art. While
style and imagination are
requisites in the arts, they must
also mirror reality. A socialistic
fervor may not be necessary, but
the time has come for the camera
to become a critic of America. I'm
tired of the massage. I want the
real thing.

IJLACk SHERLOCK HOLMES, Virgil Tibbs. portrayed by Sidney Poitier,
wrestles his white avenger to the ground in In the Heat of the Night. The film,
especially appealing to white lilwrals was another step in the "resistable rise of
Sidney Poitier."
The movies' responsibility to
society has been tuken lightly.
Although movies are today
mirroring the times with a realism
not seen since the World War,
their treatment of story material
is still for the most part
superficial, and in fact most
pictures are still devoted to
trivialities.
These words are not very
reassuring, are they? They do not
come from the pens of Pauline
Kael or John Simon, however.
They were written 30 years ago
by the film historian Lewis
Jacobs, and unfortunately they
are as true now as they were then.
American cinema has produced
little in the last two years of any
value concerning U.S. social and
political realities. The trivia that
Jacobs was seeing in 1939 has
assaulted the screen in the sixties
in full force. A film concerning a
social problem is still considered
by many to be controversial, and
most of the films are produced as
ego-boosters for "liberal"
producers (see Stanley Kramer) or
for a big cleanup at the
box-office. Generally the
productions have copped awards
from easy-to-please critics grateful
to see social themes exposed at all
on the screen.
American films got off to a late
start with social themes due to an
historical consideration. The
sixties started off as a hangover
from the schlock fifties. Film in
the early fifties was in a state of
McCarthyized parlysis. A director
couldn't make a movie on
flouridation without being called
a communist. Only in the early
sixties did Hollywood directors
acquire the balls and the
technique to shake off their
inhibitions.
The films that Hollywood has
produced in the last two years
have been cut from the material
of reaction and exploitation. The
rise of the Negro in America, the
war in Vietnam, civil disorders
and the domestic outbreaks of
violence are all marketable
commodities. They are news. So
films which reflect today's
domestic strife are cut from
today's newsprint.
Art should be a little more
than the blandest and most
sensational expositions of hot
themes. In order to prove my
point, I'll have to review a few
categories which have been dealt
with. In going over these pithy
movies which the critics have
deemed "significant social
documents," perhaps some
alternatives to the pap Hollywood
is trying to pawn off on the
unsuspecting American "liberal"
will be found.
Black and White Comedies
Movies about race relations in
the U.S. could be dealt with in an
article entitled "The Resistable
Rise of Sidney Poitier."
Single-handed, Mr. Poitier has lit
up the eyes of thousands of
American critics with his
port<v.yals of "the button-down
Negro' in In the Heat of the
Night and Guess Who's Coming to
Dinin r? I couldn't see what the
uproar was all about: the movies
provided few insights, and their
impact on the American critics
was a result of good public
relations work. All that they had
to show for themselves was
Poitier's phony black persona: a
view of Ralph Bunche as the
universal Negro.
I will have to admit that In the
Heat oi the Night is the one film
of the two that I am qualified to
write about; the mere idea of
Guess Who's Coming to Dinner? j

offended me so that I didn't go to
see it. But Heal will do.
I agree with Andrew Sarris that
the film is "vaudeville." In fact it
is worse, for it is a cartoon. It is a
black Jerry kicking a white Rom
right in his sociopathic ass. Rod
Steiger's caricature is good, but
the fact remains that it is a
caricature. The entire film is Birth
of a Nation in reverse: dumb
white bigots are substituted for
clownish Negroes. The cliche has
been reversed. Instead of
Griffith's "Mammy, the faithful
servant." we get Poitier's Virgil
Tibbs, who's sharper than
Sherlock Holmes and black, too.
Ideas, Insight Lacking
It is not a film of ideas or
insight. It is a film for white
liberals to get a charge out of. One
hundred years of slavery and
ghetto living are titrated down to
the fact that Poitier is one of
those black men who made good.
What about Harlem and Watts,
Messrs. Jewison and Silliphant?
Other films give us the same
black and white comedies. Guess
Who's Coming to Dinner?
featured an idea that was so
patently hokey that I couldn't
bear to see it. Otto Preminger's
white trash spectacular Hurry
Sundown loaded the dice by
making the black couple in the
film the only bodies that
resembled human beings. The film
can hardly be taken seriously,
though; no film that uses a line
like "Ah killed him, jest as shore
as Ah put a bullet in his haid" can
be.
None of these films concern a
real world. They try to make us
happy by showing us bigots, ogres
and other misguided souls getting
along with a black man of
superhuman capabilities. All this
was done so much better in Ritt's
Edge of the City in the early
