# Tribe in Pac-8 Track Opener
## 
### 
The Pacific-8 dual meet
schedule opens tomorrow
afternoon at Stanford Stadium at
1:15 p.m. when the varsity track
team hosts Washington State in
what promises to be a difficult
meet for Coach Payton Jordan's
young Indians.
The Cougars placed second in
last year's NCAA finals, and word
from Pullman is that they have
the depth to knock off the
defending chamiopn USC Trojans
in dual meet competition.
Last week, the Cougars proved
to be poor hosts of their WSU
Invitational as they swept 16 of
18 first places and set 10 of the
11 individual meet records. Gerry
Lindgren may be gone, but the
track picture for Washington State
is brighter than ever.
Unfortunately for Stanford,
WSU stacks up strongly in the
same areas as the Indians. So in
order to keep the meet in reach,
the Tribe will have to beat them
at their own game. The key events
could come early as both teams
attempt to build the momentum
so important in setting the tone of
a meet.
The 440 relay is almost a must
for the home squad, for to upset
the Cougars, the Card spikers need
at least a split in the two baton
events. Assistant Coach Bill
Moultrie has worked his four
sprinters on baton passing all
week and good exchanges could
make the difference.
Sanford, Mac Donald In Mile
The next running event, the
mile, pits WSU's 1:47.1 half-miler
Art Sandison against A 1 Sanford
and Duncan Mac Donald. The
Stanford entrees have managed
consistant two-a-day workouts
recently and will try to burn off
some of Sandison's speed with a
hot pace.
Earlier this winter, Sandison
edged Mac Donald in an indoor
1000, but the added distance is to
Stanford's advantage. At any rate,
the Cougar will have a tough time
doubling back against sophomore
880 flash Pete Fairchild later in
the afternoon.
Another key event is the
intermediate hurdles where
Indians Randy White and Tom
Kommers face off with Olympian
Boyd Gittens. Both White and
Kommers have the potential for
an upset, and both plan to team
with either Jim Kauffman or Rick
Tipton and Fairchild in the
all-important mile relay finale.
The powerful Tipton represents
one possible winner in the high
hurdles and also runs a leg on the
440 relay.

In the field events, undefeated
school record holder Tom Colby
seeks revenge against Stu
Hennings who out-threw him last
year at Pullman. In addition to
Hennings, the Cougars display
South African import John Van
Reenan in the discus and shot.
Van Reenan has marks of 198-6
and 64-2 respectively and must be
conceeded the two muscle events.
In the jumping contests, Coach
Dick Reese looks for strong
performances from footballers
Kauffman and Bubba Brown in
the long jump, and Tom Massey in
the triple and high jumps.
Vaulters Clint Ostrander and
Steve Flannery will take aim at
duplicating last year's one-two
finish against WSU.
The edge in the distance events

goes to Washington State off of
Rick Kiley's 8:46 two-mile of last
week. But the Indians are always
strong in the endurance events
and will counter with Brook
Thomas and Steve Jones in the
steeplechase and Greg Brock in
the two-mile. However last week's
star, Chuck Menz, contracted the
flu and will watch from the
sidelines.
Running concurrently with the
varsity, the undefeated frosh take
on Monterey and Cabrillo JC's.
Sub 4:10 miler Bob Coe,
number-one cross-country man
Jack Lawson, and 9:08 two miler
Arvid Kretz lead the
distance-oriented Papooses along
with hard working hurdler Mark
Haight and high jumper Bob
Dews.


DUAL THREAT-Stanford's star defensive back in the football season turns
lea per in the spring. Tom Massey will be counted on for victories in the high
jump and triple jump tomorrow against rugged Washington State in the opening
Pac-8 meet.
