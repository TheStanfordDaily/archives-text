# Tribe Tunes Tomorrow
## Bat Season Nears 
### JOHN ARTHUR 
Don't look now, but the Pac-8 baseball season is fast approaching.
Coach Ray Young's squad begins league play a week from today
against U.C.L.A. in Los Angeles. Then it's across town and through
the smog for a Saturday double header with U.S.C. The home opener
is on April 18 against Oregon State.
Meanwhile, there's some preliminary business to be taken care
of . . . like a twin bill against Fresno State, here, tomorrow afternoon.
Then Stanford hosts Cal State at Hayward on Tuesday in the last
scheduled tune up before league competition begins.
On Wednesday, the Tribe dropped a 2-1 decision to Santa Clara in
a rain-shortened game in San Jose. Although it was the second Indian
loss to the Broncos in a row, both it and the 6-5 loss on Tuesday were
far tighter contests than an earlier one in February when Santa Clara
nearly ran the locals out of the park.
The highlight of the Wednesday game was the sharp pitching of
Rod Poteete. The tall right-hander pitched what Young called "one of
the best games he's thrown in his four years here." Poteete struck out
the side in the first inning, and gave up only a single while recording
four more strike outs during the next three frames.
He made his only mistake in the fifth. Santa Clara first baseman
Bill Borelli, a 6-4, 238 lb. behemoth, opened the inning with a homer.
In the Tuesday game Borelli had sent Indian outfielders to the fence
three times, including once when center fielder Mike Ewing caught a
lofty fly ball while leaning back against the barrier. It seemed obvious
then that it was only a matter of time before Borelli connected. And
on Wednesday he did.
Santa Clara's other run also came in the fifth. Bill McMonigle
reached base on a bleeder off the fists, then scored when shortstop
Albert Strane reached into the stratosphere to rifle a sky-high pitch
down the left field line for a freak double. Poteete probably would
have had more success with a fast ball down the middle. Rod finished
the game by retiring the side on three flies in the sixth.
Stanford, meanwhile, put runners in scoring position in each of the
first five innings but could score only once. Mark Marquess opened
the game with a triple, then came across on an error by the right
fielder. But the Indians' wasted opportunities can be traced to a
degree of feebleness at the plate: singles by Chuck Williams and Ewing
were Stanford's only other hits for the day.
Young, nevertheless, feels that his team is getting "more
aggressive" with the bat, and knows that despite three recent losses
the Tribe is playing good baseball. Hopefully, the combination of
tight defense and strong pitching, spearheaded by Poteete, will make
up for any offensive shortcomings.
