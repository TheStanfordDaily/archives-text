# Net Duals In LA
## 
### 
The toughest weekend of the
year faces Stanford's varsity
tennis contingent as they travel to
Southern California today to visit
the nation's two top teams.
The USC Trojans and UCLA
Bruins, last year's number one and
two finishers host Coach Dick
Gould's netters for their two day
stay. The Indians meet up with
Southern Cal today at 2:00 p.m.,
and then head west for a morning
exercise with the Bruins
tomorrow.
Judging from the LA talent,
Stanford must be considered the
underdogs. The Trojans have
Davis Cupper and former National
Junior Champion Bob Lutz
returning, along with Mexican
Davis Cuppers Joaquin
Loyo-Mayo and Marcello Lara.
Another former National Junior
Champ, Steve Avoyer, and George
Taylor (who upset Lutz in the
Southern California
Intercollegiates last weekend) add
to the USC gallery of stars.
Three outstanding
veterans—Roy Barth, Steve
Tidball and Ron Bornstead—head
the powerful UCLA contingent.
The Bruins will also be bolstered
this year by sophomore sensation
Jeff Borowiak. Doubles standout
Rob Rippner has returned from

Europe to boost Stanford's upset
hopes this weekend, but Rippner's
bad knee may limit his
effectiveness.
The two southern schools are
just more additions to the
impressive list of teams Stanford
has already faced this season. The
Tribe has battled Michigan, Utah,
Cal, and San Jose State.
In their most recent outing
against a ranked team, the result
was not encouraging.
Only sophomore Paul
Marienthal, playing fourth singles,
prevented the powerful University
of Florida team from shutting out
Stanford Thursday. Marienthal
eased by Florida's Greg Hilley 6-3,
6-1. The Indians' No. 1 doubles
team of Stan Pasarell and John
Spiegel drew with Florida's top
tandem of Armistead Neely and
Steve Beeland in a match halted
by darkness at 8-6, 4-6, 6-6.
Although the varsity has been
having its troubles, the freshman
squad is truly making a racquet.
The fantastic frosh established
themselves as the top tennis team
in Northern California by coming
within a whisker of beating the
University of Utah. The unbeaten
Cowboys had previously disposed
of Cal 6-3, San Jose State 6-3, and
the Stanford varsity 7-2.

Another former National Junior
Champ, Steve Avoyer, and George
Taylor (who upset Lutz in the
Southern California
Intercollegiates last weekend) add
to the USC gallery of stars.
Three outstanding
veterans—Roy Barth, Steve
Tidball and Ron Bornstead—head
the powerful UCLA contingent.
The Bruins will also be bolstered
this year by sophomore sensation
Jeff Borowiak. Doubles standout
Rob Rippner has returned from

Europe to boost Stanford's upset
hopes this weekend, but Rippner's
bad knee may limit his
effectiveness.
The two southern schools are
just more additions to the
impressive list of teams Stanford
has already faced this season. The
Tribe has battled Michigan, Utah,
Cal, and San Jose State.
In their most recent outing
against a ranked team, the result
was not encouraging.
Only sophomore Paul
Marienthal, playing fourth singles,
prevented the powerful University
of Florida team from shutting out
Stanford Thursday. Marienthal
eased by Florida's Greg Hilley 6-3,
6-1. The Indians' No. 1 doubles
team of Stan Pasarell and John
Spiegel drew with Florida's top
tandem of Armistead Neely and
Steve Beeland in a match halted
by darkness at 8-6, 4-6, 6-6.
Although the varsity has been
having its troubles, the freshman
squad is truly making a racquet.
The fantastic frosh established
themselves as the top tennis team
in Northern California by coming
within a whisker of beating the
University of Utah. The unbeaten
Cowboys had previously disposed
of Cal 6-3, San Jose State 6-3, and
the Stanford varsity 7-2.
