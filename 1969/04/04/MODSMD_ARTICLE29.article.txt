# Gym Season Ends
## 
### 
The Pacific-8 gymnastics finals
held at the University of Southern
California last week proved to be
one of the wildest league battles
in years.
Defending national champions,
the California Bears held off a
great Washington team, 161-158,
to retain the Pac-8 crown. The
Bears and underdogs to Penn
State and lowa in the race for the
NCAA title which is currently
underway. Penn State owns the
high score of 163.
Stanford Ail-American
gymnasts Craig Dickson and Steve
Rochell came up with fine
performances at the Pacific-8
meet. Dickson, facing the stiffest
competition in the country,
finished seventh in the all-around.
A junior, he had won the
all-around in nine of Stanford's 11
meets this year.

Sophomore Rochell took third
in the still rings with an excellent
9.05 routine. Stanford's first-year
coach Dan Millman called the
performance of Rochell and
Dickson "a conservative preview
of things to come."
