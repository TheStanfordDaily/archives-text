The Stanford Lacrosse team
travels up north this weekend for
a tilt against the University of
Oregon Ducks tomorrow.
The Indians beat Oregon 13-2
last year at Stanford. Little is
known about the Oregon squad
except rumors about Canadian
talent, but the Stanford squad is
listed as a clearcut favorite. The
Indians, hot off a 15-2 victory
over Utah, dominate western
lacrosse and an Oregon victory
would be a genuine upset.
