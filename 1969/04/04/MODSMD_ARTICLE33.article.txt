# Guitarist To Open
## 
### 
Oscar Ghiglia, a young,
world-renowned classical guitarist,
will make his Bay Area debut in
two Stanford Summer Festival
concerts July 22 and 25.
Ghiglia is called by many "the
guitarist who will replace
Segovia," perhaps the greatest
classical guitarist in the world.
Commenting on his
extraordinary technique, the
Washington Post has said, "Ghiglia
allows attention to focus at all
times on the music, rather than on
the wonder that his instrument
could produce such complexities
of counter-point, such levels of
registration and such evenness of
voiceleading and ornamentation.
