# Scientists And Seers
## Are Quake Jitters Justified? 
### LANG ATWOOD 
Is California in danger of being
shaken into the ocean by a major
earthquake during April?
According to Lawrence Pakiser, chief
of earthquake research for the U.S.
Geological Survey in Menlo Park,
"There is no scientific basis for a
prediction of a major earthquake in
April."

On the other hand, according to
Pakiser, "there's no such thing as an
absolute antiearthquake guarantee."
"We have not yet discovered the
scientific clues needed for earthquake
predictions," he emphasized.
The Department of Interior's
Geological Survey station in Menlo Park
has been flooded with calls and letters
from worried Californians asking about

the predictions made by various
prophets that spell doom for California
in April.
"We try to calm them down and
explain rationally what the chances
are," explained Pakiser.
The doomsday speculation
apparently began about a year ago when
the Rev. Donald Abernathy "saw a
vision that a giant earthquake will
destroy California and swallow the
entire state up into the ocean."
He led about 200 members of the
congregation of his church to "safety"
in Atlanta, Ga., which has subsequently
suffered a minor tremor.
A San Francisco seeress, Mrs.
Elizabeth Steen also had a vision of a
quake occuring during April 1969. She
and her family went to Spokane, Wash.,
in December after she got "good
vibrations" there while passing her hand
over a map.
Several astrological charts mention
April 14, as the date of the presumed
disaster. Other possible dates mentioned
in various sources include April 4, 7,
and any Friday.
Predictions Discounted
Dr. Charles Richter, developer of the
Richter Scale for measuring the
magnitude of earthquakes, discounts
these predictions.
"A few years ago, in 1965 to be
exact, we received spurious earthquake
predictions for Jan. 17, Feb. 4, March
17, April 1, 16, all of May and
sometime in June or July. But it was a
normal year —none came true."
Despite the small probability of a
major earthquake this month, some
people are taking no chances. A Daily

Cruz home and Soto house is
reportedly planning to construct a
similar vessel.
A serious earthquake at
Stanford would probably cause
considerable da mage, not
necessarily because of the
geological features of the area but
is due more to the type of
buildings.
"All those stone buildings and
roofing tiles aren't too good,"
explained David Stewart, assistant
director of the Geological Survey.
"Wood frame buildings are among
the safest, simply because they
have more flex and given than
stone," he said.
Stanford Damage
In the 1906 quake, several
areas of the campus were heavily
damaged and two persons were
killed. Floors collapsed in Roble
Hall and Encina, then a men's
dorm. One fraternity house was
completely wrecked and several
others damaged. Hardest hit
however, was the quad where a

giant arch crashed to the ground
and most buildings suffered major
damage. According to the April
18, issue of The Daily Palo Alto,
now The Stanford Daily,
Memorial Church was practically
destroyed. Its bell tower (never
rebuilt) fell inside the church and
most of the stained glass windows
as well as the mosaic on the front
of the building were ruined.
Today the buildings are
theoretically safer, however
countless high rise office and
apartment buildings have never
been tested against the swaying
motion of a strong quake. South
of San Francisco, subdivisions are
built directly on major faults
including the San Andreas which
runs within 500 yards of Stanford
property.
Mayor Joseph Alioto of San
Francisco says he is tired of
listening to rumors that the state
will crack up and he is planning a
giant public celebration to "dispel
the gloom." It is planned for April
18, the 63rd anniversary of the
1906 earthquake.

A serious earthquake at
Stanford would probably cause
considerable da mage, not
necessarily because of the
geological features of the area but
is due more to the type of

roofing tiles aren't too good,"

Stanford Damage
In the 1906 quake, several
areas of the campus were heavily
damaged and two persons were
killed. Floors collapsed in Roble
Hall and Encina, then a men's
dorm. One fraternity house was
completely wrecked and several
others damaged. Hardest hit
however, was the quad where a

giant arch crashed to the ground
and most buildings suffered major
damage. According to the April
18, issue of The Daily Palo Alto,
now The Stanford Daily,
Memorial Church was practically
destroyed. Its bell tower (never
rebuilt) fell inside the church and
most of the stained glass windows
as well as the mosaic on the front
of the building were ruined.
Today the buildings are
theoretically safer, however
countless high rise office and
apartment buildings have never
been tested against the swaying
motion of a strong quake. South
of San Francisco, subdivisions are
built directly on major faults
including the San Andreas which
runs within 500 yards of Stanford
property.
Mayor Joseph Alioto of San
Francisco says he is tired of
listening to rumors that the state
will crack up and he is planning a
giant public celebration to "dispel
the gloom." It is planned for April
18, the 63rd anniversary of the
1906 earthquake.
Is California in danger of being
shaken into the ocean by a major
earthquake during April?
According to Lawrence Pakiser, chief
of earthquake research for the U.S.
Geological Survey in Menlo Park,
"There is no scientific basis for a
prediction of a major earthquake in
April."

On the other hand, according to
Pakiser, "there's no such thing as an
absolute antiearthquake guarantee."
"We have not yet discovered the
scientific clues needed for earthquake
predictions," he emphasized.
The Department of Interior's
Geological Survey station in Menlo Park
has been flooded with calls and letters
from worried Californians asking about

the predictions made by various
prophets that spell doom for California
in April.
"We try to calm them down and
explain rationally what the chances
are," explained Pakiser.
The doomsday speculation
apparently began about a year ago when
the Rev. Donald Abernathy "saw a
vision that a giant earthquake will
destroy California and swallow the
entire state up into the ocean."
He led about 200 members of the
congregation of his church to "safety"
in Atlanta, Ga., which has subsequently
suffered a minor tremor.
A San Francisco seeress, Mrs.
Elizabeth Steen also had a vision of a
quake occuring during April 1969. She
and her family went to Spokane, Wash.,
in December after she got "good
vibrations" there while passing her hand
over a map.
Several astrological charts mention
April 14, as the date of the presumed
disaster. Other possible dates mentioned
in various sources include April 4, 7,
and any Friday.
Predictions Discounted
Dr. Charles Richter, developer of the
Richter Scale for measuring the
magnitude of earthquakes, discounts
these predictions.
"A few years ago, in 1965 to be
exact, we received spurious earthquake
predictions for Jan. 17, Feb. 4, March
17, April 1, 16, all of May and
sometime in June or July. But it was a
normal year —none came true."
