## Are Quake Jitters Justified? 
### LANG ATWOOD 
Is California in danger of being
shaken into the ocean by a major
earthquake during April?
According to Lawrence Pakiser, chief
of earthquake research for the U.S.
Geological Survey in Menlo Park,
"There is no scientific basis for a
prediction of a major earthquake in
April."

On the other hand, according to
Pakiser, "there's no such thing as an
absolute antiearthquake guarantee."
"We have not yet discovered the
scientific clues needed for earthquake
predictions," he emphasized.
The Department of Interior's
Geological Survey station in Menlo Park
has been flooded with calls and letters
from worried Californians asking about

the predictions made by various
prophets that spell doom for California
in April.
"We try to calm them down and
explain rationally what the chances
are," explained Pakiser.
The doomsday speculation
apparently began about a year ago when
the Rev. Donald Abernathy "saw a
vision that a giant earthquake will
destroy California and swallow the
entire state up into the ocean."
He led about 200 members of the
congregation of his church to "safety"
in Atlanta, Ga., which has subsequently
suffered a minor tremor.
A San Francisco seeress, Mrs.
Elizabeth Steen also had a vision of a
quake occuring during April 1969. She
and her family went to Spokane, Wash.,
in December after she got "good
vibrations" there while passing her hand
over a map.
Several astrological charts mention
April 14, as the date of the presumed
disaster. Other possible dates mentioned
in various sources include April 4, 7,
and any Friday.
Predictions Discounted
Dr. Charles Richter, developer of the
Richter Scale for measuring the
magnitude of earthquakes, discounts
these predictions.
"A few years ago, in 1965 to be
exact, we received spurious earthquake
predictions for Jan. 17, Feb. 4, March
17, April 1, 16, all of May and
sometime in June or July. But it was a
normal year —none came true."
Despite the small probability of a
major earthquake this month, some
people are taking no chances. A Daily

probable site for the next big earthquake. Crystal Springs and San Andreas Lakes were both
created by the movement of the fault.
