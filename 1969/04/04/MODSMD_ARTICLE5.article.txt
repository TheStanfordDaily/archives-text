# Tighter Control Of SRI Asked
## 
### CRAIG WILSON 
More than 800 people packed into
Dinkelspiel Auditorium voted yesterday
to demand that the Stanford trustees
"discontinue all plans for severance of
the Stanford Research Institute from
the University . . . that instead SRI be
brought under tighter control by the
University and that guidelines be
established for socially acceptable
research."
The vote was nearly unaminous.
The vote was taken soon after the
beginning of the two hour meeting
moderated by Doren Weinberg of the
Law School.
Participants also voted to oppose all
classified research at the Stanford
Research Institute as well as the
University. Additionally all research in
the areas of chemical and biological
warfare, counterinsurgency at home and
abroad and research in support of the
war against the people of Vietnam, Laos
and Thailand.
Declare Moratorium
The group then voted to ask the
trustees to declare a moratorium on any
new research in the above areas at their
next meeting on April 8 in San
Francisco.
An amendment was suggested by
SDS member Jean Friedman and passed
urging President Pitzer to put the
demands on the April 8 agenda of the
Trustees meeting. Pitzer was given until
Monday to confirm that this had been
done. It was learned last night that
Pitzer had already confirmed he would
do so.
The meeting which followed a
prepared agenda, also added other
stipulations demanding that a special
meeting of the Trustees be called during
week of April 21 to arrive at a decision
on the demands. The motion stressed

that an open meeting should be held in
which the Palo Alto-Stanford
community be allowed participation in
the discussion and to observe the
decision.
Set Meeting
The demand asked that a date for the
meeting be set at the April 8 meeting.
Associate Professor of English, H.
Bruce Franklin, who so often has been
the sparkplug for much of the radical
activity on campus, proposed the
motion to eliminate the classified
research as well as in the areas
described. Franklin stated, "we must
make demands which can be understood
and can be implimented. We don't want
to see research done that can be used
for repression. I would like to see the
research done in southeast Asia made
available in the fight against American
Imperialism. But I don't think that is
realistic."
He then made the basic proposal
concerning the end to research.
Professor Robert McAffe Brown
spoke saying he felt that too much
attention was being given to the
Trustee—something he felt which might
draw away from the real issue: the
stoppage of research into chemical and
biological warfare. He said, "I wouldn't
mind if the trustees decided to end their
search in a closed meeting."
