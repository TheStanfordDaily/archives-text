# Tighter Control Of SRI Asked
## 
### CRAIG WILSON 
More than 800 people packed into
Dinkelspiel Auditorium voted yesterday
to demand that the Stanford trustees
"discontinue all plans for severance of
the Stanford Research Institute from
the University . . . that instead SRI be
brought under tighter control by the
University and that guidelines be
established for socially acceptable
research."
The vote was nearly unaminous.
The vote was taken soon after the
beginning of the two hour meeting
moderated by Doren Weinberg of the
Law School.
Participants also voted to oppose all
classified research at the Stanford
Research Institute as well as the
University. Additionally all research in
the areas of chemical and biological
warfare, counterinsurgency at home and
abroad and research in support of the
war against the people of Vietnam, Laos
and Thailand.
Declare Moratorium
The group then voted to ask the
trustees to declare a moratorium on any
new research in the above areas at their
next meeting on April 8 in San
Francisco.
An amendment was suggested by
SDS member Jean Friedman and passed
urging President Pitzer to put the
demands on the April 8 agenda of the
Trustees meeting. Pitzer was given until
Monday to confirm that this had been
done. It was learned last night that
Pitzer had already confirmed he would
do so.
The meeting which followed a
prepared agenda, also added other
stipulations demanding that a special
meeting of the Trustees be called during
week of April 21 to arrive at a decision
on the demands. The motion stressed

that an open meeting should be held in
which the Palo Alto-Stanford
community be allowed participation in
the discussion and to observe the
decision.
Set Meeting
The demand asked that a date for the
meeting be set at the April 8 meeting.
Associate Professor of English, H.
Bruce Franklin, who so often has been
the sparkplug for much of the radical
activity on campus, proposed the
motion to eliminate the classified
research as well as in the areas
described. Franklin stated, "we must
make demands which can be understood
and can be implimented. We don't want
to see research done that can be used
for repression. I would like to see the
research done in southeast Asia made
available in the fight against American
Imperialism. But I don't think that is
realistic."
He then made the basic proposal
concerning the end to research.
Professor Robert McAffe Brown
spoke saying he felt that too much
attention was being given to the
Trustee—something he felt which might
draw away from the real issue: the
stoppage of research into chemical and
biological warfare. He said, "I wouldn't
mind if the trustees decided to end their
search in a closed meeting."

This was later rejected when
the timetable for the trustees to
act was formulated as the meeting
progressed.
During the course of the
meeting it was apparent that the
group was operating under the
assumption that the Trustee
meeting scheduled for May 13
would be on campus. The Daily
learned late last night the May
meeting, like next Tuesday's, is
set for San Francisco.
The meeting was conducted
with a large clock facing the
audience just in front of the
moderating table. The clock
punctuated the point Weinberg

made at the outset—that "we
must reach some of these
decisions today. 1 may have to cut
debate severely. But I must insist
you be relevant."
Weinberg was referring to the
fact that the proposals drafted at
the meeting would have to appear
on the April 8 agenda of the
Trustees in order for
consideration of the demands at
the following meeting.
Noon Kally
Presentation of the demands to
President Pitzer is expected today
following a noon rally in White
Plaza. The rally which will outline
what occurred at yesterday's
meeting will feature the

appearance of Art Melville, the
former Jesuit priest who recently
took part in the raid of Dow
Chemical files in Washington D.C.
According to yesterdays
meeting a contingent of students
will march over to President
Pitzer's office to present the
demands.
It was also decided that two
separate vigils will take place next
Tuesday—one on campus and one
outside the Buildings that the
trustees meet in next Tuesday.
The trustees are scheduled to
discuss procedures in their

Tuesday meeting for reaching a
decision on SHI.
The group announced that
several committees are to be
formed to help plan the weeks
coming activities. A steering
committee is scheduled to
organize today at 3 p.m. in
Tresidder 274-75 for the purpose
of forming committees concerned
with the planned vigils, to work
on the concept of a reviewing
board for the SRI coalition, and a
committee to work toward an
idea of what purpose SRI could
be used.

appearance of Art Melville, the
former Jesuit priest who recently
took part in the raid of Dow
Chemical files in Washington D.C.
According to yesterdays
meeting a contingent of students
will march over to President
Pitzer's office to present the
demands.
It was also decided that two
separate vigils will take place next
Tuesday—one on campus and one
outside the Buildings that the
trustees meet in next Tuesday.
The trustees are scheduled to
discuss procedures in their

Tuesday meeting for reaching a
decision on SHI.
The group announced that
several committees are to be
formed to help plan the weeks
coming activities. A steering
committee is scheduled to
organize today at 3 p.m. in
Tresidder 274-75 for the purpose
of forming committees concerned
with the planned vigils, to work
on the concept of a reviewing
board for the SRI coalition, and a
committee to work toward an
idea of what purpose SRI could
be used.
More than 800 people packed into
Dinkelspiel Auditorium voted yesterday
to demand that the Stanford trustees
"discontinue all plans for severance of
the Stanford Research Institute from
the University . . . that instead SRI be
brought under tighter control by the
University and that guidelines be
established for socially acceptable
research."
The vote was nearly unaminous.
The vote was taken soon after the
beginning of the two hour meeting
moderated by Doren Weinberg of the
Law School.
Participants also voted to oppose all
classified research at the Stanford
Research Institute as well as the
University. Additionally all research in
the areas of chemical and biological
warfare, counterinsurgency at home and
abroad and research in support of the
war against the people of Vietnam, Laos
and Thailand.
Declare Moratorium
The group then voted to ask the
trustees to declare a moratorium on any
new research in the above areas at their
next meeting on April 8 in San
Francisco.
An amendment was suggested by
SDS member Jean Friedman and passed
urging President Pitzer to put the
demands on the April 8 agenda of the
Trustees meeting. Pitzer was given until
Monday to confirm that this had been
done. It was learned last night that
Pitzer had already confirmed he would
do so.
The meeting which followed a
prepared agenda, also added other
stipulations demanding that a special
meeting of the Trustees be called during
week of April 21 to arrive at a decision
on the demands. The motion stressed

that an open meeting should be held in
which the Palo Alto-Stanford
community be allowed participation in
the discussion and to observe the
decision.
Set Meeting
The demand asked that a date for the
meeting be set at the April 8 meeting.
Associate Professor of English, H.
Bruce Franklin, who so often has been
the sparkplug for much of the radical
activity on campus, proposed the
motion to eliminate the classified
research as well as in the areas
described. Franklin stated, "we must
make demands which can be understood
and can be implimented. We don't want
to see research done that can be used
for repression. I would like to see the
research done in southeast Asia made
available in the fight against American
Imperialism. But I don't think that is
realistic."
He then made the basic proposal
concerning the end to research.
Professor Robert McAffe Brown
spoke saying he felt that too much
attention was being given to the
Trustee—something he felt which might
draw away from the real issue: the
stoppage of research into chemical and
biological warfare. He said, "I wouldn't
mind if the trustees decided to end their
search in a closed meeting."
This was later rejected when
the timetable for the trustees to
act was formulated as the meeting
progressed.
During the course of the
meeting it was apparent that the
group was operating under the
assumption that the Trustee
meeting scheduled for May 13
would be on campus. The Daily
learned late last night the May
meeting, like next Tuesday's, is
set for San Francisco.
The meeting was conducted
with a large clock facing the
audience just in front of the
moderating table. The clock
punctuated the point Weinberg

made at the outset—that "we
must reach some of these
decisions today. 1 may have to cut
debate severely. But I must insist
you be relevant."
Weinberg was referring to the
fact that the proposals drafted at
the meeting would have to appear
on the April 8 agenda of the
Trustees in order for
consideration of the demands at
the following meeting.
Noon Kally
Presentation of the demands to
President Pitzer is expected today
following a noon rally in White
Plaza. The rally which will outline
what occurred at yesterday's
meeting will feature the

appearance of Art Melville, the
former Jesuit priest who recently
took part in the raid of Dow
Chemical files in Washington D.C.

meeting it was apparent that the
group was operating under the
assumption that the Trustee
meeting scheduled for May 13
would be on campus. The Daily
learned late last night the May
meeting, like next Tuesday's, is
set for San Francisco.
The meeting was conducted
with a large clock facing the
audience just in front of the
moderating table. The clock
punctuated the point Weinberg

made at the outset—that "we
must reach some of these
decisions today. 1 may have to cut
debate severely. But I must insist
you be relevant."
Weinberg was referring to the
fact that the proposals drafted at
the meeting would have to appear
on the April 8 agenda of the
Trustees in order for
consideration of the demands at
the following meeting.
Noon Kally
Presentation of the demands to
President Pitzer is expected today
following a noon rally in White
Plaza. The rally which will outline
what occurred at yesterday's
meeting will feature the

appearance of Art Melville, the
former Jesuit priest who recently
took part in the raid of Dow
Chemical files in Washington D.C.
According to yesterdays
meeting a contingent of students
will march over to President
Pitzer's office to present the
demands.
It was also decided that two
separate vigils will take place next
Tuesday—one on campus and one
outside the Buildings that the
trustees meet in next Tuesday.
The trustees are scheduled to
discuss procedures in their

Tuesday meeting for reaching a
decision on SHI.
The group announced that
several committees are to be
formed to help plan the weeks
coming activities. A steering
committee is scheduled to
organize today at 3 p.m. in
Tresidder 274-75 for the purpose
of forming committees concerned
with the planned vigils, to work
on the concept of a reviewing
board for the SRI coalition, and a
committee to work toward an
idea of what purpose SRI could
be used.
