# School Board Candidates Say Minority Representation Vital
## 
### DAVE JONES 
Working for black school board
candidates in San Mateo County's April
15 election is Stanford students' last
chance "to communicate to black
America that there is hope for white
America," Sid Walton, former director
of Palo Alto's multi-cultural program,
told a Tresidder audience last nght.
"Without community control,"
Walton said, "we can start talking about
revolution. This election offers the last
chance for white people to prove
themselves in a hmanistic sense."
Walton spoke in behalf of four black
candidates for board positions: Herbert
Rhodes, candidate for the San Mateo
College board, Walter Randall and Larry
Fewell, candidates for the Ravenswood
Elementary School Board, and George
Grant, contender for the Sequoia Union
High School District Board.
Rhodes emphasized that his
candidacy calls for bolstering San Mateo
College's readiness program for minority
students, providing greater student
determination of curriculum offerings,
and "an end to discrimination in the
college's hiring practices." Rhodes
declared that he would offer "a link
between the college board and the
minority students of San Mateo."
Fewell said that for ten years the
Ravenswood School District "has
instituted programs for the sake of
instituting programs." The result, he
decumented, has been an exponential
retrogression in reading ability. Over
three-fourths of the district's teachers,
he added, do not live in the community.
Fewell called for in-service training
for teachers. He emphasized the need
for teachers to create expectations of
academic excellence from their
students. The 31-year-old biochemist
also called for creative competition in
which superior students tutored their
less advanced classmates.

Randall, also a candidate for the
Ravenswood Elementary School Board,
called for the end of a guinea pig
approach to black school children in
which untested programs are first
implemented in black schools.
Community Control Needed
He exphasized the need for
community control and community
participation in the education process.
Randall also urged more extensive
homework for elementary school
children who currently receive as few as
two take-home assignments weekly.
Rhodes challenged Stanford students

to walk precincts saying, "If white
students sit on their butts like their
racist parents, they're going to have to
contend with my boy ten years from
now—and he's going to be four times as
mean as I am."
Spokesman for Delia Ybarra, a
Mexican-American school board
candidate in Los Altos, emphasized her
plan for student-teacher participation in
curriculum planning.
Panel moderator Tim Coburn urged
students to walk precincts for the
candidates starting this Saturday at
10:30 from the ASSU office.

instituting programs." The result, he
decumented, has been an exponential
retrogression in reading ability. Over
three-fourths of the district's teachers,
he added, do not live in the community.
Fewell called for in-service training
for teachers. He emphasized the need
for teachers to create expectations of
academic excellence from their
students. The 31-year-old biochemist

which superior students tutored their
less advanced classmates.

Randall, also a candidate for the
Ravenswood Elementary School Board,

approach to black school children in
which untested programs are first
implemented in black schools.
Community Control Needed
He exphasized the need for
community control and community
participation in the education process.
Randall also urged more extensive
homework for elementary school
children who currently receive as few as
two take-home assignments weekly.
Rhodes challenged Stanford students

to walk precincts saying, "If white
students sit on their butts like their
racist parents, they're going to have to
contend with my boy ten years from
now—and he's going to be four times as
mean as I am."
Spokesman for Delia Ybarra, a
Mexican-American school board
candidate in Los Altos, emphasized her
plan for student-teacher participation in
curriculum planning.

SRI COALITION-Members of the Stanford Community file into Dinkelspiel Auditorium
yesterday afternoon for the meeting of the SRI Coalition.
Working for black school board
candidates in San Mateo County's April
15 election is Stanford students' last
chance "to communicate to black
America that there is hope for white
America," Sid Walton, former director
of Palo Alto's multi-cultural program,
told a Tresidder audience last nght.
"Without community control,"
Walton said, "we can start talking about
revolution. This election offers the last
chance for white people to prove
themselves in a hmanistic sense."
Walton spoke in behalf of four black
candidates for board positions: Herbert
Rhodes, candidate for the San Mateo
College board, Walter Randall and Larry
Fewell, candidates for the Ravenswood
Elementary School Board, and George
Grant, contender for the Sequoia Union
High School District Board.
Rhodes emphasized that his
candidacy calls for bolstering San Mateo
College's readiness program for minority
students, providing greater student
determination of curriculum offerings,
and "an end to discrimination in the
college's hiring practices." Rhodes
declared that he would offer "a link
between the college board and the
minority students of San Mateo."
Fewell said that for ten years the
Ravenswood School District "has
instituted programs for the sake of
instituting programs." The result, he
decumented, has been an exponential
retrogression in reading ability. Over
three-fourths of the district's teachers,
he added, do not live in the community.
