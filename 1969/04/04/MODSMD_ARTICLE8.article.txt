# Radical Clergyman Speaks Here Today
## 
### 
Two weeks ago, on March 22, nine
men and women smashed a plate glass
door in Washington, D.C. and entered
the office of Dow Chemical Company.
Once inside, they destroyed
machinery, poured blood on furniture,
threw records and correspondence into
the air five stories above a Capital
boulevard, and pasted pictures of
maimed Vietnamese children to the
walls.
Most of the nine were Catholic
clergy. One of them, Art, Melville,
formerly a Maryknoll missionary in
Guatemala, will visit Stanford today.
Melville will join a noon rally in
White Plaza, later at 2:15, he will speak
in the Tresidder Large Lounge.
The D.C. Nine, who have joined the
Catonsville Nine and the Milwaukee
Fourteen in the ranks of Vietnam
protesters, released an open letter to the
corporations of America in which they
explained their action:
''We are outraged by the
death-dealing exploitation of people of
the Third World, and of all the poor and
powerless who are victimized by your
profit-seeking ventures . . .Specifically,
we warn you, the Dow Chemical
Company, that we will no longer
tolerate your refusal to accept

responsibility for your programmed
destruction of human life.
"You, stockholders, company
executives and others, are so willing to
seek profit in the production of napalm,
defoliants, and nerve gas, have in the
same spirit cooperated with the I.J.
Farben Company, a chemical
manufacture in Nazi Germany during
the Second World War.
"Your offices have lost their right to
exist."
Participants in the Catonsville,
Milwaukee and D.C. incidents consider
themselves to have acted within the
tradition of nonviolence. The things
that are being done to people in
Vietnam are not to be considered in the
same class with destruction of property
that is used to oppress people, they say.
Melville initially criticized his brother
Tom's decision to burn draft records
with the Milwaukee Fourteen. His
estimate of the value of the nonviolent
tactics has apparently changed since
then.
The former priest's appearance at an
SDS noon rally during a period of
tension student opposition to
war-related research may mark the
introduction of non-violent direct
action into that struggle.
