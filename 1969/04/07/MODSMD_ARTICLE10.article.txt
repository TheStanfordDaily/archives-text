## April 3 Coalition Follow-up 
### 
Editor, THE DAILY:
We are writing to inform the
community of the work that is
presently being done by the group
which grew out of the April 3rd
community meeting.
Following that meeting a group
of students interested in doing
organizational work met in
Tresidder. Committees were
formed to work with the faculty,
to send documentation of
destructive research to the
Trustees, to organize two vigils,
one at Stanford and one in San
Francisco during the Trustees'
meeting Tuesday, and to come up
with a practical program to
reorient research toward socially
useful ends.
If anyone is interested in
forming a new committee or
working with one previously
mentioned, call Art Busse
(854-5835). Petitions supporting
the demands made at the April
3rd community meeting are
presently being circulated and
should be returned by Tuesday
morning to the ASSU office. An
informational booklet detailing
Stanford and SRl's research
relevant to our demands is
available in the ASSU office.
There will be another
community meeting Wednesday
night April 9th to consider the
Trustees' response to our
demands. A great deal of work has
been done throughout the year
and especially in the last few
weeks, but much more will be
necessary if we are to see our
goals succeed.
JOIN US!

Editor, THE DAILY:
In the late afternoon of April
22, 1968 nine people broke into
the Washington, D.C., office of
the Dow Chemical Company,
poured blood around the office,
threw files out the window, and
replaced pictures of Dow's
proudly owned plants and
factories with pictures of their
products napalmed children and
burning villages.
The Dow Chemical Company is
part of a society and an economic
system which places more
importance on monetary income
than on the I: "°is and welfare of
human beings. As a part of this
system Dow Chemical is allowed
to continue, in cooperation with
the U.S. Government and many
other American Corporations, in
the multi-billion dollar business of
death. The magnitude of these
crimes is simply too much to
grasp here in the peaceful confines
of Stanford University. And yet it
is our complicity which allows
Dow Chemical to continue to
market death in forms such as
napalm and nerve gas. And it is
our university and our fellows in
this university (and we?) who
carry on research for the
perfection of these mechanisms of
death.
The Dow Chemical Nine, in the
essentially non-violent spirit of
their brothers and sisters at
Catonsville and Milwaukee and
elsewhere around the country,
have placed their lives on the line
to protest this atrocious
exploitation of life. But more
than this, they have called
others—you—to action to change

this system and re-assert the voice
of humanity in an inhumane,
totally materialistic society. You
are students, professors,
secretaries, cooks, gardeners,
administrators, or whatever at a
university which—along with its
daughter research institution—is
doing millions of dollars of
research in how to kill people
more efficiently. It has been
reported that at least $400,000
worth of chemical and biological
warfare (CBW) research—which is
totally indefensible—is going on
here. The D.C. Nine»are going to
prison to make clear their
commitment to ending such
barbarous work. They are going to
prison to ask you why you are
supporting this work (which you
are, if you aren't actively
opposing it). They have let their
futures be destroyed because they
refuse to permit the further
destruction of the lives of others.
They have heard the voices of
men crying for an end to such
heinous crimes, and they have
given their answer.
How will you answer?
There is a growing effort at
Stanford to end this university's
associations with the merchants of
death and exploitation in this
country. Will you heed the call of
the D.C. Nine and come to the aid
of humanity—at at time when not
only the Third World, but also all
mankind, is threatened by our
work in how to kill more
efficiently?
Will you allow Stanford to
remain among the ranks of those
'whose product is war, whose
market is death?
