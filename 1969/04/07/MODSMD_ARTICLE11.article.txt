## This Week's Flicks 
### TODD McCARTHY 
No fewer than 85 full-length
films will be shown on campus
this quarter and this week's crop
is representative of the high
quality level to be maintained for
the next eight weeks.
Director Peter Brook and The
Royal Shakespeare Company
transferred their stunning stage
success of Marat/Sade to the
screen intact. Though some of the
direct excitement of the play is
lost, the arguments between the
two adversaries come into sharper
focus on celluloid. The acting is
impeccable on all counts. The
film, the first in the Western Civ
series, will be shown in Cubberley
on Tuesday and Wednesday at
4:15 and 7:30.
The brilliant Battle of Algiers
will also be shown on Tuesday
evening, at 7:30 and "possibly
9:30" in Mem Aud. The film is a
documentary-like reconstruction
of the conflict between the
French and Arabs from 1954 to
1962 but incredibly, "not one
foot" of newsreel is used. A
triumph of realistic re-creation,
Battle of Algiers is nominated for
Academy Awards for Best
eenplay and Best Direction (by
> Pontecrovo).

Due to a mix-up in scheduling,
Clive Miller will be offering three
pictures this week. Monkey
Business, a lightweight romantic

comedy by Howard Hawks
starring Gary Grant, Ginger
Rodgers and Marilyn Monroe, will
be shown on both Tuesday and
Wednesday in Geology 320.
Mary Astor was an Oscar for
The Great Lie a talky affair
co-starring Bette Davis, to be
shown on Tuesday. Wednesday,
the second feature will be City for
Conquest, a melodramatic boxing
story with James Cagney, Ann
Sheridan and Authur Kennedy.
Elia Kazan, later to become one
of America's leading directors, has
a small part in this one.
The Nights of Cabiria,
presented by the I-Center in
Physics Tank on Thursday at
B'ls, is considered in many
quarters to be Federico Fellini's
finest film. Giulietta Masina is
heart-breaking as a prostitute who
feels it is natural to give but can't
understand why no one will give
to her. A very moving film and
winner of an Academy Award as
Best Foreign Film of 1957, it
served as the basis for the current
stunning musical, Sweet Charity.
El (The Strange Passion) was
made by Luis Bunuel in Mexico in
1952 and, despite
under-financing, the director
managed to convey his digs at the
clergy, sexual hangups and
jealousy. This study of neurosis
and paranoia will be presented at
Tresidder on Friday night.

Showing in Cubberley on
Friday, at 7:30 and 9, is Sidney
Lumet's literate thriller, The
Deadly Affair. Basedon John Le
Carre's "Call for the Dead," this
"human" mystery suffered from
under-exposure upon its initial
release, despite the stunning cast
of James Mason, Simone Signoret,
Maximillian Schell, Harriet
Anderson, Harry Andrews and
Lynn Redgrave. It is among the
best of the spy pictures released
over the past few years.
Rebecca, at Tresidder on
Saturday, is not typical of most of
Alfred Hitchcock's work but is an
intriguing mystery nonetheless.
Closely based on Daphne du
Maurier's novel, one remembers
most vividly the sinister protrayal
of Mrs. Danvers by Judith
Anderson and the raging fire
which ultimately destroys the
Manderley estate. Also starring are
Laurence Olivier and Joan
Fontaine. The picutre won an
Oscar for Best Picture of 1940,
though Hitchcock himself has
never been awarded by the
Academy.
This Sunday's Flick is the
frenetic, distrubingly funny
Morgan! The picture (titled A
Suitable Case for Treatment in
Britain) features an anarchistic
ape-man as the lead character. It
stars David Warner and Vanessa
Redgrave.

No fewer than 85 full-length
films will be shown on campus
this quarter and this week's crop
is representative of the high
quality level to be maintained for
the next eight weeks.
Director Peter Brook and The
Royal Shakespeare Company
transferred their stunning stage
success of Marat/Sade to the
screen intact. Though some of the
direct excitement of the play is
lost, the arguments between the
two adversaries come into sharper
focus on celluloid. The acting is
impeccable on all counts. The
film, the first in the Western Civ
series, will be shown in Cubberley
on Tuesday and Wednesday at
4:15 and 7:30.
The brilliant Battle of Algiers
will also be shown on Tuesday
evening, at 7:30 and "possibly
9:30" in Mem Aud. The film is a
documentary-like reconstruction
of the conflict between the
French and Arabs from 1954 to
1962 but incredibly, "not one
foot" of newsreel is used. A
triumph of realistic re-creation,
Battle of Algiers is nominated for
Academy Awards for Best
eenplay and Best Direction (by

Due to a mix-up in scheduling,
Clive Miller will be offering three
pictures this week. Monkey
Business, a lightweight romantic

comedy by Howard Hawks
starring Gary Grant, Ginger
Rodgers and Marilyn Monroe, will
be shown on both Tuesday and
Wednesday in Geology 320.
Mary Astor was an Oscar for
The Great Lie a talky affair
co-starring Bette Davis, to be
shown on Tuesday. Wednesday,
the second feature will be City for
Conquest, a melodramatic boxing
story with James Cagney, Ann
Sheridan and Authur Kennedy.
Elia Kazan, later to become one
of America's leading directors, has
a small part in this one.
The Nights of Cabiria,
presented by the I-Center in
Physics Tank on Thursday at
B'ls, is considered in many
quarters to be Federico Fellini's
finest film. Giulietta Masina is
heart-breaking as a prostitute who
feels it is natural to give but can't
understand why no one will give
to her. A very moving film and
winner of an Academy Award as
Best Foreign Film of 1957, it
served as the basis for the current
stunning musical, Sweet Charity.
El (The Strange Passion) was
made by Luis Bunuel in Mexico in
1952 and, despite
under-financing, the director
managed to convey his digs at the
clergy, sexual hangups and
jealousy. This study of neurosis
and paranoia will be presented at
Tresidder on Friday night.

Showing in Cubberley on
Friday, at 7:30 and 9, is Sidney
Lumet's literate thriller, The
Deadly Affair. Basedon John Le
Carre's "Call for the Dead," this
"human" mystery suffered from
under-exposure upon its initial
release, despite the stunning cast
of James Mason, Simone Signoret,
Maximillian Schell, Harriet
Anderson, Harry Andrews and
Lynn Redgrave. It is among the
best of the spy pictures released
over the past few years.
Rebecca, at Tresidder on
Saturday, is not typical of most of
Alfred Hitchcock's work but is an
intriguing mystery nonetheless.
Closely based on Daphne du
Maurier's novel, one remembers
most vividly the sinister protrayal
of Mrs. Danvers by Judith
Anderson and the raging fire
which ultimately destroys the
Manderley estate. Also starring are
Laurence Olivier and Joan
Fontaine. The picutre won an
Oscar for Best Picture of 1940,
though Hitchcock himself has
never been awarded by the
Academy.
This Sunday's Flick is the
frenetic, distrubingly funny
Morgan! The picture (titled A
Suitable Case for Treatment in
Britain) features an anarchistic
ape-man as the lead character. It
stars David Warner and Vanessa
