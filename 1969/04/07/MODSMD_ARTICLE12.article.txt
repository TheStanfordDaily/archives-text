# Government Cuts Funds, Intern Program Limited
## 
### 
By MARGARET McGAUGHEY
Stanford-In-Washington (SIW)
which has been the largest
government internship program
on Capitol Hill, is facing a
substantially decreased enrollment
because of a cut in federal funds.
Under President Kennedy,
Congress had appropriated $750
for each Congressman to pay a
university age summer intern. As
most Congressmen are otherwise
financially unable to pay interns,
this appropriation made it
possible for students who must
earn their summer's expenses to
take advantage of internship
programs. Last year Stanford was
able to send nearly 100 students
to the Capitol.
At the end of last year's
Congressional session, however, a
"rider" was attached to another
bill which cancelled the
government subsidy of internship
programs. Interns must either
persuade their employer to pay
them enough to cover the
summer's expenses, or work for
free.
Many students cannot afford
to participate in SIW on this basis.
This year the program may send
only half its usual nmber to
Washington.
SIW has a limited number of
stipends for students who cannot
absorb a financial loss in order to
take part in the program. Last
year private donors gave $5,314,
which provided for 25
scholarships. Yet the officers of
SIW feel they must make more
stipends available to qualified
students.
The program has applied to
several foundations for financial
aid, and is hoping to establish an
endowment fund. SIW has sought
grants on the basis that the
present systems allow only
students who can pay their own
expenses to participate in the
program, a selective process which
eliminates minority groups among
others. Adequate funding would
end this discrimination.
There are several rumors as to
why Congress halted the
internship program last year. The

Administrative Assistant to a
Representative from Kansas
explained that it was because
student activists from several
university programs planned to
walk out of a reception given by
President Johnson in protest of
the Vietnam war.
Karen Bjorklund, Chairman of
SIW, said that the cut was the
work of only a few Congressmen
who were dissatisfied with the
outside activities of their interns.
Apparently several students
circulated what Miss Bjorklund
termed a "very mild" peittion
condemning the War in Vietnam.
Later the. interns held a press
conference in Congressman's
office while he was not there.
The Congressmen concerned
resented the implication that they
were responsible for this action,
which was, in fact, wholly the
doing of the interns. With the help

of several other Congressmen, the
financial cut was added to another
bill which was presented before
the House of Representatives
shortly before it adjourned.
A number of Congressmen
have been hoping that an
internship program would be
re-instituted. Summer interns
were a loophole in otherwise strict
limitations on the number and
salary of a representative's staff.
According to Miss Bjorklund,
however, "it would be hard for us
to gel the $750 back."
SIW was organized in 1963 by
a committee of students and
faculty who were interested in
helping Stanford students find
existing intern positions and make
the most of a unique opportunity
to learn first hand how the U.S.
government operates.

Stanford-In-Washington (SIW)
which has been the largest
government internship program
on Capitol Hill, is facing a
substantially decreased enrollment
because of a cut in federal funds.
Under President Kennedy,
Congress had appropriated $750
for each Congressman to pay a
university age summer intern. As
most Congressmen are otherwise
financially unable to pay interns,
this appropriation made it
possible for students who must
earn their summer's expenses to
take advantage of internship
programs. Last year Stanford was
able to send nearly 100 students
to the Capitol.
At the end of last year's
Congressional session, however, a
"rider" was attached to another
bill which cancelled the
government subsidy of internship
programs. Interns must either
persuade their employer to pay
them enough to cover the
summer's expenses, or work for
free.
Many students cannot afford
to participate in SIW on this basis.
This year the program may send
only half its usual nmber to
Washington.
SIW has a limited number of
stipends for students who cannot
absorb a financial loss in order to
take part in the program. Last
year private donors gave $5,314,
which provided for 25
scholarships. Yet the officers of
SIW feel they must make more
stipends available to qualified
students.
The program has applied to
several foundations for financial
aid, and is hoping to establish an
endowment fund. SIW has sought
grants on the basis that the
present systems allow only
students who can pay their own
expenses to participate in the
program, a selective process which
eliminates minority groups among
others. Adequate funding would
end this discrimination.
There are several rumors as to
why Congress halted the
internship program last year. The

Administrative Assistant to a
Representative from Kansas
explained that it was because
student activists from several
university programs planned to
walk out of a reception given by
President Johnson in protest of
the Vietnam war.
Karen Bjorklund, Chairman of
SIW, said that the cut was the
work of only a few Congressmen
who were dissatisfied with the
outside activities of their interns.
Apparently several students
circulated what Miss Bjorklund
termed a "very mild" peittion
