# Track Defeat
## Cougars Slosh Past Tribe 
### 
Forced by rain to run on San
Jose State's all-weather track, the
Stanford track team gradually fell
behind a deep Washington State
quuad until an Indian sweep in
the 440 sparked by surprise entry
Charlie Francis tied the meet with
eight events to go.
But with the pressure on, the
Cougars responded with one-two
finishes in the 880 and 220 to ice
the meet before finishing off the
Cards in the mile relay for a final
score of 88-66.
The opening track events went
as expected with Brook Thomas
splashing to an easy victory in the
wetter than usual steeplechase,
followed by a Cougar win in the
sprint relay. Then, in the mile, Art
Sandison turned back the
upset-minded Tribe with an
impressive 4:07.1.
Considered by his teammates
as the hardest working member of
the squad, Sandison outkicked
both Allen Sanford and Duncan
Mac Donald with a sub-60 second
final lap.

Meanwhile, in the field. Tom
Colby continued undefeated by
out-dueling Stu Hunnings in the
javelin while Cougar John Van
Reenan off-set Colby's effort with
powerful wins in both the discus
and shot. Jumping off a soggy
runway, Jim Kauffman kept the
Indians close with a 22-7 second
place leap in the long jump.
Back on the track, Rick Tipton
set a meet record in the highs
(14.3) and then the runners set
themselves in the blocks for the
440. Coming off the turn, injured
sprinter Francis (running his first
varsity one-lapper— led by seven
yards and held on to win while
Kauffman and Rich Faris battled
for second and third respectively.
Followed by Tipton's upset
victory in the 100 and word that
Pete Boyce had successfully
returned to action by out-leaping
the high-jump field at 6-10, the
Tribe finally had a shot at WSU.
But from here on out,
Washington State dominated the
meet with five new meet records

including last year's California
State J.C. champion Bob Martin's
1:50.4 half mile, Olympian Boyd
Gittins' 52.5 intermediate hurdles
and high school record holder
Rick Riley's 8:45.2 two mile. The
only Indian highlights in this
stretch were Tom Massey's come
from behind win in the triple
jump and Randy White's gutty
seasonal best in the intermediates
where he led Gittins until the final
set of barriers.
The frosh meet was rained out,
but the Papooses return to action
Thursday against Foothill and
Hartnell. Hartnell competed
Saturday, knocking off the San
Jose State JV squad, 73-45, while
Foothill has already destroyed the
Cal Frosh.
The varsity travels to UCLA
Saturday in search of their first
conference win. The Bruins who
were upset by Oregon State at
Corvallis 87-67, are led by sprinter
Wayne Collet, decatheloner Russ
Hodge and weight-man Steve
Marcus. The meet takes place in
the brand new UCLA track

Forced by rain to run on San
Jose State's all-weather track, the
Stanford track team gradually fell
behind a deep Washington State
quuad until an Indian sweep in
the 440 sparked by surprise entry
Charlie Francis tied the meet with
eight events to go.
But with the pressure on, the
Cougars responded with one-two
finishes in the 880 and 220 to ice
the meet before finishing off the
Cards in the mile relay for a final
score of 88-66.
The opening track events went
as expected with Brook Thomas
splashing to an easy victory in the
wetter than usual steeplechase,
followed by a Cougar win in the
sprint relay. Then, in the mile, Art
Sandison turned back the
upset-minded Tribe with an
impressive 4:07.1.
Considered by his teammates
as the hardest working member of
the squad, Sandison outkicked
both Allen Sanford and Duncan
Mac Donald with a sub-60 second
final lap.

Meanwhile, in the field. Tom
Colby continued undefeated by
out-dueling Stu Hunnings in the
javelin while Cougar John Van
Reenan off-set Colby's effort with
powerful wins in both the discus
and shot. Jumping off a soggy
runway, Jim Kauffman kept the
Indians close with a 22-7 second
place leap in the long jump.
Back on the track, Rick Tipton
set a meet record in the highs
(14.3) and then the runners set
themselves in the blocks for the
440. Coming off the turn, injured
sprinter Francis (running his first
varsity one-lapper— led by seven
yards and held on to win while
Kauffman and Rich Faris battled
for second and third respectively.
Followed by Tipton's upset
victory in the 100 and word that
Pete Boyce had successfully
returned to action by out-leaping
the high-jump field at 6-10, the
Tribe finally had a shot at WSU.
But from here on out,
Washington State dominated the
meet with five new meet records

including last year's California
State J.C. champion Bob Martin's
1:50.4 half mile, Olympian Boyd
Gittins' 52.5 intermediate hurdles
and high school record holder
Rick Riley's 8:45.2 two mile. The
only Indian highlights in this
stretch were Tom Massey's come
from behind win in the triple
jump and Randy White's gutty
seasonal best in the intermediates
where he led Gittins until the final
set of barriers.
The frosh meet was rained out,
but the Papooses return to action
Thursday against Foothill and
Hartnell. Hartnell competed
Saturday, knocking off the San
Jose State JV squad, 73-45, while
Foothill has already destroyed the
Cal Frosh.
The varsity travels to UCLA
Saturday in search of their first
conference win. The Bruins who
were upset by Oregon State at
Corvallis 87-67, are led by sprinter
Wayne Collet, decatheloner Russ
Hodge and weight-man Steve
Marcus. The meet takes place in
the brand new UCLA track
