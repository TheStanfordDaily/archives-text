# Keogh Opposes Mutiny Charges
## 
### 
William Keogh, Stanford
University law professor and
authority on military justice,
predicts that the Presidio mutiny
cases will be reversed and that
"there will come some new
military laws out of it."
Speaking on "Military Justice
and the Presidio Mutiny Trial" at
Lassen House Thursday night,
Keogh declared that the charge
"should have been disobedience
of the law or disturbance of the
peace, not mutiny."
Calling the trials a "booboo",
the former military judge told a
group of about 30 students, "You
really can't mutiny in a cell." The
legal definition of mutiny is a
concerted disobedience of a
military order with the intent to
override military authority.
"Somebody gummed it up,"
said Keogh in reteicnce to the
charges and the convictions. "No
prosecution could have achieved it
by himself."
Keogh feels that what is going
on at the Presidio now is rare in
military procedures.

To emphasize this belief, the
law professor declared, "If I had
to be tried for a criminal offense
and had a choice of the forum to
try me, I'd choose a military
trial."
Why? Because, Keogh says, the
main objective is to "beat the
rap" and you can "beat the rap"
much easier in a military court
than in a civil court.
Keogh went on to cite the
inequality of the bail system, the
secretive, one sided nature of
indictments, and the strenuous
appeal procedure as negative
aspects of civil proceedings.
The military judicial system,
according to Keogh, gives the
defendant a fair and represented
initial hearing, and "appeal is
automatic, free, with lawyers
supplied all the way through."
"I don't know of any criminal
proceeding that isn't crude, really
crude," admits Keogh, but he
adds for the sake of wary civilians,
"It's not a Star Chamber
proceedings that goes on in the
military."
