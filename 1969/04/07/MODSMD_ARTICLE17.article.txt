# Radical History Group To Hold Weekly Meeting
## 
### 
A new radical history group,
established to read, discuss, and
possibly write history, will hold
its first weekly meeting on
Tuesday, April 8, at 2 p.m. in the
Stanford Coffee House. This
quarter, the group hopes to
concentrate on how history is
taught in the United States.

The working thesis for the
group will be that the profession
of history today serves mainly the
interests of a small minority of
rich and "cultured" people. The
group believes that from their
position as scholars and teachers
they may discover if and why
academic history is alienated from
the working people and their
experiences.
Topics suggested for study and
reports include: the slave systems
of Greece and Rome, third world
people in America, the story of
Stanford and Palo Alto, and
radicals in America. The group
also plans to read some Marxist
works as a theoretical basis for
their study of history. They also
mentioned the possibility of
writing a popular history
magazine.
Those interested in joining the
group should contact Ralph Moss
in the Classics department at
3 28-2125, Bob 'Hiornton in
Anthropology at 327-2920 ext.
409, or Gary Coutin of the
History department at 968-1066.
