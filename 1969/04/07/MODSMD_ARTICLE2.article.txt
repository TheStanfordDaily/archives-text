# Several Possible Solutions Posited In Housing Crush
## 
### MARK WEINBERGER 
The crushing demand anticipated for
University student housing next fall will
be handled in several ways. A crash
building program is not one of them.
As outlined by Dean of Students Joel
Smith, the University intends to meet
the expected demand for dormitory
space by the following methods:
• A decrease in freshman enrollment
from this year's 1,450 to next year's
1,350.
• An increase in the occupancy ratio in
several dorms. This would extend the
current policy in Roble and Lagunita by
converting single into double and tripe
into quadruple rooms.
• The possible leasing of motels by the
University to accomodate any overflow.
• Investigation of the possibility of the
expansion of existing dormitory
structures. Smith said no specific
expansion or renovation plans have yet
been considered.
More Solutions
In addition, Smith indicated that the
administration is looking toward longef
term solutions to the recent housing
crisis by the expansion of Escondido
Village (alreadyl approved by the
trustees), the contruction of apartments
by a private developer, and the building
of new undergraduate dormitories. A
student-faculty committee headed by
Bill Leland, special services counselor, is
now investigating these long range
solutions.
The possibility of a crash program
for the construction of privately
developed apartments for 400 students
near Escondido Village fell through last
Thursday when it was decided that too
many barriers prevented immediate
construction of the apartments.
Smith explained that the decision
against immediate construction
stemmed from a lack of time to fully
consider and negotiate contracts which
would protect the long-term interests of
the University. Also, the required
installation of roads and utilities made
the project "unfeasible and impractical"
for next fall, he stated.
Site Opposed
There is also reported to be
significant faculty and administration
opposition to the construction at the
proposed site, near the Hacienda
apartments.
Despite the opposition to the
Escondido Village site, Smith made it
clear that plans for the eventual
consturction of the apartments have not
been abandoned. Negotiations are slated
to begin concerning the building of the
space for 400 students on a Willow
Road site on University land, behind the
hospital and near the golf course.
In commenting on the University's
housing plans, Smith stated that his
information shows "intensive demand"
for housing next fall, probably even
worse than this year.

However, even though the housing
squeeze will be "serious," he sees
another "aggressive, pull-out-all-the
stops effort" as sufficient to provide
relief for all students. And by the next
year, new permanent construction will
solve the current problems, according to
Smith.
Stopgap Measures
The University's decision to apply
stopgap measures for next year in place
of the crash building program drew
heavy fire from Barry Askinas, chairman
of the Graduate Student Association,
who has been active in recent housing
discussions.
According to Askinas, "What Joel
Smith is saying is that undergraduates
will be further overcrowded, and that
graduate and foreign students are to be
thrown into an even tighter and more
expensive local housing market than last
year."
"The so-called reduction of the size
of the freshman class for next year is a
myth," Askinas continued, "since this
year's class was abnormally large, and
next year's class is merely a return to
the normal size."
He feels that recent actions by the
administration demonstrates that it
"still refuses to do anything about the
plight of graduate and especially foreign
students. For three years they've
watched an incredibly tight housing
market and they've done nothing.
Administrators who make mistakes
don't pay the price. Students who are
here already at least have some place to
live. But it's the students who are
coming who have to pay t the price."
Business Office Concerns
Askinas also had few kind words
for the University Business Office,
which has also been involved in the
recent decisions. He claimed that the
business office thinks "only in terms of
dollars and cents, and not in terms of
human beings.
"I wonder if the time hasn't come
for new leadership in the business

office. We need people who are
concerned about students instead of
these accounting types who made basic
decisions that affect the quality of
student life at Stanford."
Askinas draws the conclusion that
"sinct the University administration is
taking no real action, one can only
conclude that they are oblivious to the
needs of graduate students, and
especially foreign students. He cited the
cases of several foreign students who
have returned home after searching
without success for adequate housing.
Dean Smith is reported to have told a
housing committee meeting last week
that his first concern was for the
housing of undergraduate students, and
that space would have to be found for
the 200 undergraduate spaces the
University is short before the needs of
graduate students could be considered.
Evasive Solution
Smith added yesterday that "there is
a mathematical exactness to it. With a
limited market, an extra effort for
undergraduates reduces space available
for graduate and foreign students. Their
worry is thoroughly justified; but not
every problem is soluble, and I don't
think that we can say now we can solve
this particular one."
Although Smith said yesterday that
no housing action would be placed
before the board of trustees at
tomorrow's meeting, Askinas made
public his plan for alleviating the
current space squeeze.
The Askinas plan calls for crash
construction by the University of low
rises in Escondido Village, with a Jan. 1,
1970 opening date. This would be
combined with leases on local motels
taken by the University to house these
students during the fall quarter.
An alternative plan would be the
erection of prefabricated, modular
housing next to Branner until adequate
permanent housing can be provided. He
added that the University could "easily
afford" the $100,000 a year cost for the
operation of the modular housing.

space for 400 students on a Willow
Road site on University land, behind the
hospital and near the golf course.
In commenting on the University's
housing plans, Smith stated that his
information shows "intensive demand"
for housing next fall, probably even
worse than this year.

However, even though the housing
squeeze will be "serious," he sees
another "aggressive, pull-out-all-the
stops effort" as sufficient to provide
relief for all students. And by the next
year, new permanent construction will
solve the current problems, according to
Smith.
Stopgap Measures
The University's decision to apply
stopgap measures for next year in place
of the crash building program drew
heavy fire from Barry Askinas, chairman
of the Graduate Student Association,
who has been active in recent housing
discussions.
According to Askinas, "What Joel
Smith is saying is that undergraduates
will be further overcrowded, and that
graduate and foreign students are to be
thrown into an even tighter and more
expensive local housing market than last
year."
"The so-called reduction of the size
of the freshman class for next year is a
myth," Askinas continued, "since this
year's class was abnormally large, and
next year's class is merely a return to
the normal size."
He feels that recent actions by the
administration demonstrates that it
"still refuses to do anything about the
plight of graduate and especially foreign
students. For three years they've
watched an incredibly tight housing
market and they've done nothing.
Administrators who make mistakes
don't pay the price. Students who are
here already at least have some place to
live. But it's the students who are
coming who have to pay t the price."
Business Office Concerns
Askinas also had few kind words
for the University Business Office,
which has also been involved in the
recent decisions. He claimed that the
business office thinks "only in terms of
dollars and cents, and not in terms of
human beings.
"I wonder if the time hasn't come
for new leadership in the business

office. We need people who are
concerned about students instead of
these accounting types who made basic
decisions that affect the quality of
student life at Stanford."
Askinas draws the conclusion that
"sinct the University administration is
taking no real action, one can only
conclude that they are oblivious to the
needs of graduate students, and
especially foreign students. He cited the
cases of several foreign students who
have returned home after searching
without success for adequate housing.
Dean Smith is reported to have told a
housing committee meeting last week
that his first concern was for the
housing of undergraduate students, and
that space would have to be found for
the 200 undergraduate spaces the
University is short before the needs of
graduate students could be considered.
Evasive Solution
Smith added yesterday that "there is
a mathematical exactness to it. With a
limited market, an extra effort for
undergraduates reduces space available
for graduate and foreign students. Their
worry is thoroughly justified; but not
every problem is soluble, and I don't
think that we can say now we can solve
this particular one."
Although Smith said yesterday that
no housing action would be placed
before the board of trustees at
tomorrow's meeting, Askinas made
public his plan for alleviating the
current space squeeze.
The Askinas plan calls for crash
construction by the University of low
rises in Escondido Village, with a Jan. 1,
1970 opening date. This would be
combined with leases on local motels
taken by the University to house these
students during the fall quarter.
An alternative plan would be the
erection of prefabricated, modular
housing next to Branner until adequate
permanent housing can be provided. He
added that the University could "easily
afford" the $100,000 a year cost for the
operation of the modular housing.
The crushing demand anticipated for
University student housing next fall will
be handled in several ways. A crash
building program is not one of them.
As outlined by Dean of Students Joel
Smith, the University intends to meet
the expected demand for dormitory
space by the following methods:
• A decrease in freshman enrollment
from this year's 1,450 to next year's
1,350.
• An increase in the occupancy ratio in
several dorms. This would extend the
current policy in Roble and Lagunita by
converting single into double and tripe
into quadruple rooms.
• The possible leasing of motels by the
University to accomodate any overflow.
• Investigation of the possibility of the
expansion of existing dormitory
structures. Smith said no specific
expansion or renovation plans have yet
been considered.
More Solutions
In addition, Smith indicated that the
administration is looking toward longef
term solutions to the recent housing
crisis by the expansion of Escondido
Village (alreadyl approved by the
trustees), the contruction of apartments
by a private developer, and the building
of new undergraduate dormitories. A
student-faculty committee headed by
Bill Leland, special services counselor, is
now investigating these long range
solutions.
The possibility of a crash program
for the construction of privately
developed apartments for 400 students
near Escondido Village fell through last
Thursday when it was decided that too
many barriers prevented immediate
construction of the apartments.
Smith explained that the decision
against immediate construction
stemmed from a lack of time to fully
consider and negotiate contracts which
would protect the long-term interests of
the University. Also, the required
installation of roads and utilities made
the project "unfeasible and impractical"
for next fall, he stated.
Site Opposed
There is also reported to be
significant faculty and administration
opposition to the construction at the
proposed site, near the Hacienda
apartments.
Despite the opposition to the
Escondido Village site, Smith made it
clear that plans for the eventual
consturction of the apartments have not
been abandoned. Negotiations are slated
to begin concerning the building of the
space for 400 students on a Willow
Road site on University land, behind the
hospital and near the golf course.

concerned about students instead of
these accounting types who made basic
decisions that affect the quality of
student life at Stanford."
Askinas draws the conclusion that
"sinct the University administration is
taking no real action, one can only
conclude that they are oblivious to the
needs of graduate students, and
especially foreign students. He cited the
cases of several foreign students who
have returned home after searching
without success for adequate housing.
Dean Smith is reported to have told a
housing committee meeting last week
that his first concern was for the
housing of undergraduate students, and
that space would have to be found for
the 200 undergraduate spaces the
University is short before the needs of
graduate students could be considered.
Evasive Solution
Smith added yesterday that "there is
a mathematical exactness to it. With a
limited market, an extra effort for
undergraduates reduces space available
for graduate and foreign students. Their
worry is thoroughly justified; but not
every problem is soluble, and I don't
think that we can say now we can solve
this particular one."
Although Smith said yesterday that
no housing action would be placed
before the board of trustees at
tomorrow's meeting, Askinas made
public his plan for alleviating the
current space squeeze.
The Askinas plan calls for crash
construction by the University of low
rises in Escondido Village, with a Jan. 1,
1970 opening date. This would be
combined with leases on local motels
taken by the University to house these
students during the fall quarter.
An alternative plan would be the
erection of prefabricated, modular
housing next to Branner until adequate
permanent housing can be provided. He
added that the University could "easily
afford" the $100,000 a year cost for the
operation of the modular housing.
The crushing demand anticipated for
University student housing next fall will
be handled in several ways. A crash
building program is not one of them.
As outlined by Dean of Students Joel
Smith, the University intends to meet
the expected demand for dormitory
space by the following methods:
• A decrease in freshman enrollment
from this year's 1,450 to next year's
1,350.
• An increase in the occupancy ratio in
several dorms. This would extend the
current policy in Roble and Lagunita by
converting single into double and tripe
into quadruple rooms.
• The possible leasing of motels by the
University to accomodate any overflow.
• Investigation of the possibility of the
expansion of existing dormitory
structures. Smith said no specific
expansion or renovation plans have yet
been considered.
More Solutions
In addition, Smith indicated that the
administration is looking toward longef
term solutions to the recent housing
crisis by the expansion of Escondido
Village (alreadyl approved by the
trustees), the contruction of apartments
by a private developer, and the building
of new undergraduate dormitories. A
student-faculty committee headed by
Bill Leland, special services counselor, is
now investigating these long range
solutions.
The possibility of a crash program
for the construction of privately
developed apartments for 400 students
near Escondido Village fell through last
Thursday when it was decided that too
many barriers prevented immediate
construction of the apartments.
Smith explained that the decision
against immediate construction
stemmed from a lack of time to fully
consider and negotiate contracts which
would protect the long-term interests of
the University. Also, the required
installation of roads and utilities made
the project "unfeasible and impractical"
for next fall, he stated.
Site Opposed
There is also reported to be
significant faculty and administration
opposition to the construction at the
proposed site, near the Hacienda
apartments.
Despite the opposition to the
Escondido Village site, Smith made it
clear that plans for the eventual
consturction of the apartments have not
been abandoned. Negotiations are slated
to begin concerning the building of the
space for 400 students on a Willow
Road site on University land, behind the
hospital and near the golf course.
In commenting on the University's
housing plans, Smith stated that his
information shows "intensive demand"
for housing next fall, probably even
worse than this year.

However, even though the housing
squeeze will be "serious," he sees
another "aggressive, pull-out-all-the
stops effort" as sufficient to provide
relief for all students. And by the next
year, new permanent construction will
solve the current problems, according to
Smith.
Stopgap Measures
The University's decision to apply
stopgap measures for next year in place
of the crash building program drew
heavy fire from Barry Askinas, chairman
of the Graduate Student Association,
who has been active in recent housing
discussions.
According to Askinas, "What Joel
Smith is saying is that undergraduates
will be further overcrowded, and that
graduate and foreign students are to be
thrown into an even tighter and more
expensive local housing market than last
year."
"The so-called reduction of the size
of the freshman class for next year is a
myth," Askinas continued, "since this
year's class was abnormally large, and
next year's class is merely a return to
the normal size."
He feels that recent actions by the
administration demonstrates that it
"still refuses to do anything about the
plight of graduate and especially foreign
students. For three years they've
watched an incredibly tight housing
market and they've done nothing.
Administrators who make mistakes
don't pay the price. Students who are
here already at least have some place to
live. But it's the students who are
coming who have to pay t the price."
Business Office Concerns
Askinas also had few kind words
for the University Business Office,
which has also been involved in the
recent decisions. He claimed that the
business office thinks "only in terms of
dollars and cents, and not in terms of
human beings.
"I wonder if the time hasn't come
for new leadership in the business

office. We need people who are
concerned about students instead of
these accounting types who made basic
decisions that affect the quality of
student life at Stanford."
