## Violence Mars S.F. Rally 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO (AP)-A peace
march erupted into violence Sunday
after an estimated 10,000 marched
three miles to protest the Vietnam war
and the court martial of 27 Presidio
stockade prisoners.
Witnesses said the trouble started at
the end of a rally in front of the
Presidio Lombard street gate when some
demonstrators attempted to enter the
post. They were held off by Military
Police, who were bombarded with rocks
and bottles.
Seven MPs were treated for
"chemical conjuctivitis" after they were
sprayed with an unknown liquid. The
extent of damage to their eyes was
unknown, an Army spokesman said.
Three others were treated for
chemical skin burns, two were x-rayed
after being hit by tossed bottles, and
was treated for minor lacerations.
Four demonstrators were reported
arrested. One was released after being
cited by MPs for trespassing. Three
others reportedly were taken in by city
police who sent a unit of the tactical
squad to quell the disturbance.
The Presidio gate was open when
most of the marchers arrived. A line of
MPs blocked the entrance, and about
100 MPs stood nearby in reserve.
As the rally progressed 200 militants
baited the MPs. They ignored the
request of rally monitors to leave the
gate area.
The violence broke out about 4:45
p.m. when the MPs closed the gate after
the rally ended and a couple of hundred
people tried to force their way inside
the base.
Bottles, rocks and clods of dirt were
hurled at soldiers who strained to hold
the steel bar gate shut.

• March For King
ATLANTA, Ga. (AP)—More than
2,500 demonstrators, some garbed in
biblical robes and others with arms
lashed crucifixion-like to heavy beams,
marched in Atlanta Sunday, chanting
"peace now!" and singing "We Shall
Overcome."
The colorful, orderly parade,
climaxing with a street rally, was a
combination memorial to slain civil
rights leader Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.
and protest against the Vietnam War.

SAIGON (AP)—Nine thousand South
Vietnamese troops spent Easter Sunday
making an unprecedented sweep along
the southern rim of Saigon to block
Viet Cong infiltration into the capital.
While the big civil defense force
fanned across marsh and rice paddy,
half a dozen helicopters and light places
circled above dropping propaganda
leaflets.
The principal objective of the sweep
was to assure Saigon's jittery population
that it was being protected and to alert
citizens to the constant danger of
enemy infiltration.
"The war may soon end," the leaflets
said, "if we have the help of the people.
Help in the people's struggle by giving
information on the enemy. Your names
will not be revealed."
Saigon with a population of about
three million, has organized a defense
force of nearly 250,000 men, and its

commanders plan a series of sweeps like
the one conducted Sunday to try to
flush out Viet Cong units using
infiltration routes to the capital.
While the Vietnamese sought to
bolster the defenses of Saigon, the U.S.
Strategic Air Command shifted its 852
bombing campaign from the invasion
routes around the capital to the Ho Chi
Minh trail in Laos, informed sources
said.
Up to now, about 60 Stratofortresses
a day had been striking Viet Cong and
North Vietnamese troops threatening
Saigon from the north, leaving the
bombing of enemy supply lines in Laos
to about 400 Navy and Air Force
tactical fighter-bombers.

Witnesses said the trouble started at
the end of a rally in front of the
Presidio Lombard street gate when some
demonstrators attempted to enter the
post. They were held off by Military
Police, who were bombarded with rocks
and bottles.
Seven MPs were treated for
"chemical conjuctivitis" after they were
sprayed with an unknown liquid. The
extent of damage to their eyes was
unknown, an Army spokesman said.
Three others were treated for
chemical skin burns, two were x-rayed
after being hit by tossed bottles, and
was treated for minor lacerations.
Four demonstrators were reported
arrested. One was released after being
cited by MPs for trespassing. Three
others reportedly were taken in by city
police who sent a unit of the tactical
squad to quell the disturbance.
The Presidio gate was open when
most of the marchers arrived. A line of
MPs blocked the entrance, and about
100 MPs stood nearby in reserve.
As the rally progressed 200 militants
baited the MPs. They ignored the
request of rally monitors to leave the
gate area.
The violence broke out about 4:45
p.m. when the MPs closed the gate after
the rally ended and a couple of hundred
people tried to force their way inside
the base.
Bottles, rocks and clods of dirt were
hurled at soldiers who strained to hold
the steel bar gate shut.

ATLANTA, Ga. (AP)—More than
2,500 demonstrators, some garbed in
biblical robes and others with arms
lashed crucifixion-like to heavy beams,
marched in Atlanta Sunday, chanting
"peace now!" and singing "We Shall
Overcome."
The colorful, orderly parade,
climaxing with a street rally, was a
combination memorial to slain civil
rights leader Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.
and protest against the Vietnam War.

SAIGON (AP)—Nine thousand South
Vietnamese troops spent Easter Sunday
making an unprecedented sweep along
the southern rim of Saigon to block
Viet Cong infiltration into the capital.
While the big civil defense force
fanned across marsh and rice paddy,
half a dozen helicopters and light places
circled above dropping propaganda
leaflets.
The principal objective of the sweep
was to assure Saigon's jittery population
that it was being protected and to alert
citizens to the constant danger of
enemy infiltration.
"The war may soon end," the leaflets
said, "if we have the help of the people.
Help in the people's struggle by giving
information on the enemy. Your names
will not be revealed."
Saigon with a population of about
three million, has organized a defense
force of nearly 250,000 men, and its

commanders plan a series of sweeps like
the one conducted Sunday to try to
flush out Viet Cong units using
infiltration routes to the capital.
While the Vietnamese sought to
bolster the defenses of Saigon, the U.S.
Strategic Air Command shifted its 852
bombing campaign from the invasion
routes around the capital to the Ho Chi
Minh trail in Laos, informed sources
said.
Up to now, about 60 Stratofortresses
a day had been striking Viet Cong and
North Vietnamese troops threatening
Saigon from the north, leaving the
bombing of enemy supply lines in Laos
to about 400 Navy and Air Force
tactical fighter-bombers.
SAN FRANCISCO (AP)-A peace
march erupted into violence Sunday
after an estimated 10,000 marched
