# Academic Council Action
## ROTC To Face Mail Vote 
### JENNY MATTHEWS 
Stanford faculty members will cast
individual mailed ballots to decide
whether ROTC should receive academic
credit, the Academic Council decided
last Friday.
The Council, following an hour-long
debate, stipulated that each faculty
member will be asked to decide whether
credit should be dropped starting with
next year's freshman class, or whether
President Pitzer should be given up to a
year to negotiate with Defense
Department Officials to develop ROTC
programs "consistent with the academic
standards and objectives of the
University."
The Senate of the Academic Council
voted last February 13 to end academic
credit for ROTC. The following week,

however, students in a campus-wide
referendum maintained that ROTC
courses "of genuine academic interest"
should continue to receive credit.
On March 11, Stanford trustees
urged President Pitzer "to continue his
consultation with the Defense
Department, leading to actions which
will improve and vitalize" the ROTC
program. The board's action, however,
made no mention of academic credit.
Reconsideration Requested
A petition was recently presented to
the Council by about 50 faculty
members asking for a reconsideration of
the Senate's decision to abolish ROTC.
Proponents of such reconsideration
stated in a circulated report that "We
submit that no adequate discussion or
testing of opinion preceded the vote by
which . . .The Academic Senate took up
the Committee Reports on ROTC and
made sweeping decisions concerning
them after less than three hours of
debate."
The news letter also contended that
"the case against ROTC as presented by
the Majority appears to be founded
principally not on the argument that
abuses or degradations of standards
exist in the ROTC program as it now
operates, but that theoretically, such
abuses might develop at some unforseen
time."
It labeled the Senate's action as "a
compulsory act which deprives the
student minority of the present freedom
of students by compulsorily depriving
them of an option which they now
possess."
No Profcssoral Comment
Substantial comment on the
Council's decision to have a faculty vote
could not be obtained from the
professors primarily responsible for the
newsletter before press time.
Key supporters of the majority
report, Prof. Anne Kostelanetz, English,
and Professor Joseph Sneed,
philosophy, were also unobtainable for
comment.
Professor Thomas Connolly,
mechanically engineering, who assisted
in answering questions raised by the
pro-ROTC newsletter at the Council
meeting, stated that a vote of the
faculty is a "quite proper" procedure.
He stated, however, that if the second
alternative on the ballot were approved,
it would be a "serious default on the
part of the faculty" to delegate
responsibility for ROTC to President
Pitzer and the Defense Department.
Connolly feels that the voting will be
close but that the second alternative will
probably be adopted.
Pitzer Speaks
The agenda of Friday's meeting also
included a brief address delivered by
President Pitzer on the SES report on
"The Government and the University."
Regarding the section on the Board of

Trustees, Pitzer stated that "the
University Advisory Committee has
placed the subject at the top of its
agenda for its next meeting."
The President pointed out that "the
Trustees at their last meeting indicated
an interest in renewed consideration of
the structure and composition of the
Board."
Pitzer also reiterated to the Council
his statement made to the Student
Legislature last Thursday that a number
of both student and faculty groups have
already submitted lists of potential
candidates to the Nominating
Committee to select a successor to
David Packard on the Board.
There's a "relatively strong
consensus," said Pitzer on Thursday
that Packard's successor will be a
faculty member from another
institution of comparable stature.
Broader Cross Section
He also told LASSU that the
University Advisory Committee will give
"careful and thorough discussion to the
merits of having a somewhat larger
board" to include a broader
cross-section of society.
In accord with normal procedures,
however, it will probably take more
than a month to choose the new
member.
Provost Richard Lyman also
addressed the Council on the
University's minority group relations
stating that the progress Stanford has
made "brings tensions in direct
proportion to its success."
"It would be foolish," Lyman stated,
"to ignore the fact that generations of
repressed hostility have now reached the
surface and that we may expect that
hostility to be expressed in many
ways—most of them uncomfortable,
some of them unaccaptable— in the
years ahead.
During the past year, he added,
Stanford has had trouble, but "we are
not alone in that."
Minority Representation
In his remarks, which were delivered
on the first anniversary of Martin
Luther King's assassination, Lyman
pointed out that "on this day last year,
forces were set in motion which
accelerated the movement of this
University down a road along which it
had barely begun to walk."
Lyman reported this year's successes
in the acquisition of minority faculty
members. He also pointed out that next
year's freshman class is expected to have
a larger representation of minority
students than any before it."
"It is our hope that the freshman
class will contain about equal numbers
of black and Mexican-American
students," he said, praising the
recruiting efforts by the
Mexican• A m e r i can Student
Confederation organized by Luis
Nogales, assistant to the President.

a larger representation of minority
students than any before it."
"It is our hope that the freshman

Stanford faculty members will cast
individual mailed ballots to decide
whether ROTC should receive academic
credit, the Academic Council decided
last Friday.
The Council, following an hour-long
debate, stipulated that each faculty
member will be asked to decide whether
credit should be dropped starting with
next year's freshman class, or whether
President Pitzer should be given up to a
year to negotiate with Defense
Department Officials to develop ROTC
programs "consistent with the academic
standards and objectives of the
University."
The Senate of the Academic Council
voted last February 13 to end academic
credit for ROTC. The following week,

however, students in a campus-wide
referendum maintained that ROTC
courses "of genuine academic interest"
should continue to receive credit.
On March 11, Stanford trustees
urged President Pitzer "to continue his
consultation with the Defense
Department, leading to actions which
will improve and vitalize" the ROTC
program. The board's action, however,
made no mention of academic credit.
Reconsideration Requested
A petition was recently presented to
the Council by about 50 faculty
members asking for a reconsideration of
the Senate's decision to abolish ROTC.
Proponents of such reconsideration
stated in a circulated report that "We
submit that no adequate discussion or
testing of opinion preceded the vote by
which . . .The Academic Senate took up
the Committee Reports on ROTC and
made sweeping decisions concerning
them after less than three hours of
debate."
The news letter also contended that
"the case against ROTC as presented by
the Majority appears to be founded
principally not on the argument that
abuses or degradations of standards
exist in the ROTC program as it now
operates, but that theoretically, such
abuses might develop at some unforseen
time."
It labeled the Senate's action as "a
compulsory act which deprives the
student minority of the present freedom
of students by compulsorily depriving
them of an option which they now
possess."
No Profcssoral Comment
Substantial comment on the
Council's decision to have a faculty vote
could not be obtained from the
professors primarily responsible for the
newsletter before press time.
Key supporters of the majority
report, Prof. Anne Kostelanetz, English,
and Professor Joseph Sneed,
philosophy, were also unobtainable for
comment.
Professor Thomas Connolly,
mechanically engineering, who assisted
in answering questions raised by the
pro-ROTC newsletter at the Council
meeting, stated that a vote of the
faculty is a "quite proper" procedure.
He stated, however, that if the second
alternative on the ballot were approved,
it would be a "serious default on the
part of the faculty" to delegate
responsibility for ROTC to President
Pitzer and the Defense Department.
Connolly feels that the voting will be
close but that the second alternative will
probably be adopted.
Pitzer Speaks
The agenda of Friday's meeting also
included a brief address delivered by
President Pitzer on the SES report on
"The Government and the University."
Regarding the section on the Board of

Trustees, Pitzer stated that "the
University Advisory Committee has
placed the subject at the top of its
agenda for its next meeting."
The President pointed out that "the
Trustees at their last meeting indicated
an interest in renewed consideration of
the structure and composition of the
Board."
Pitzer also reiterated to the Council
his statement made to the Student
Legislature last Thursday that a number
of both student and faculty groups have
already submitted lists of potential
candidates to the Nominating
Committee to select a successor to
David Packard on the Board.
There's a "relatively strong
consensus," said Pitzer on Thursday
that Packard's successor will be a
faculty member from another
institution of comparable stature.
Broader Cross Section
He also told LASSU that the
University Advisory Committee will give
"careful and thorough discussion to the
merits of having a somewhat larger
board" to include a broader
cross-section of society.
In accord with normal procedures,
however, it will probably take more
than a month to choose the new
member.
Provost Richard Lyman also
addressed the Council on the
University's minority group relations
stating that the progress Stanford has
made "brings tensions in direct
proportion to its success."
"It would be foolish," Lyman stated,
"to ignore the fact that generations of
repressed hostility have now reached the
surface and that we may expect that
hostility to be expressed in many
ways—most of them uncomfortable,
some of them unaccaptable— in the
years ahead.
During the past year, he added,
Stanford has had trouble, but "we are
not alone in that."
Minority Representation
In his remarks, which were delivered
on the first anniversary of Martin
Luther King's assassination, Lyman
pointed out that "on this day last year,
forces were set in motion which
accelerated the movement of this
University down a road along which it
had barely begun to walk."
Lyman reported this year's successes
in the acquisition of minority faculty
members. He also pointed out that next
year's freshman class is expected to have
a larger representation of minority
students than any before it."

pointed out that "on this day last year,
forces were set in motion which
accelerated the movement of this
University down a road along which it
had barely begun to walk."
Lyman reported this year's successes
in the acquisition of minority faculty
members. He also pointed out that next
year's freshman class is expected to have
a larger representation of minority
students than any before it."
"It is our hope that the freshman
class will contain about equal numbers
of black and Mexican-American
students," he said, praising the
recruiting efforts by the
Mexican• A m e r i can Student
Confederation organized by Luis
Nogales, assistant to the President.
Stanford faculty members will cast
individual mailed ballots to decide
whether ROTC should receive academic
credit, the Academic Council decided
last Friday.
The Council, following an hour-long
debate, stipulated that each faculty
member will be asked to decide whether
credit should be dropped starting with
next year's freshman class, or whether
President Pitzer should be given up to a
year to negotiate with Defense
Department Officials to develop ROTC
programs "consistent with the academic
standards and objectives of the
University."
The Senate of the Academic Council
voted last February 13 to end academic
credit for ROTC. The following week,

however, students in a campus-wide
referendum maintained that ROTC
courses "of genuine academic interest"
should continue to receive credit.
On March 11, Stanford trustees
urged President Pitzer "to continue his
consultation with the Defense
Department, leading to actions which
will improve and vitalize" the ROTC
program. The board's action, however,
made no mention of academic credit.
Reconsideration Requested
A petition was recently presented to
the Council by about 50 faculty
members asking for a reconsideration of
the Senate's decision to abolish ROTC.
Proponents of such reconsideration
stated in a circulated report that "We
submit that no adequate discussion or
testing of opinion preceded the vote by
which . . .The Academic Senate took up
the Committee Reports on ROTC and
made sweeping decisions concerning
them after less than three hours of
debate."
The news letter also contended that
"the case against ROTC as presented by
the Majority appears to be founded
principally not on the argument that
abuses or degradations of standards
exist in the ROTC program as it now
operates, but that theoretically, such
abuses might develop at some unforseen
time."
It labeled the Senate's action as "a
compulsory act which deprives the
student minority of the present freedom
of students by compulsorily depriving
them of an option which they now
possess."
No Profcssoral Comment
Substantial comment on the
Council's decision to have a faculty vote
could not be obtained from the
professors primarily responsible for the
newsletter before press time.
Key supporters of the majority
report, Prof. Anne Kostelanetz, English,
and Professor Joseph Sneed,
philosophy, were also unobtainable for
comment.
Professor Thomas Connolly,
mechanically engineering, who assisted
in answering questions raised by the
pro-ROTC newsletter at the Council
meeting, stated that a vote of the
faculty is a "quite proper" procedure.
He stated, however, that if the second
alternative on the ballot were approved,
it would be a "serious default on the
part of the faculty" to delegate
responsibility for ROTC to President
Pitzer and the Defense Department.
Connolly feels that the voting will be
close but that the second alternative will
probably be adopted.
Pitzer Speaks
The agenda of Friday's meeting also
included a brief address delivered by
President Pitzer on the SES report on
"The Government and the University."
Regarding the section on the Board of

Trustees, Pitzer stated that "the
University Advisory Committee has
placed the subject at the top of its
agenda for its next meeting."
The President pointed out that "the
Trustees at their last meeting indicated
an interest in renewed consideration of
the structure and composition of the
Board."
Pitzer also reiterated to the Council
his statement made to the Student
Legislature last Thursday that a number
of both student and faculty groups have
already submitted lists of potential
candidates to the Nominating
Committee to select a successor to
David Packard on the Board.
There's a "relatively strong
consensus," said Pitzer on Thursday
that Packard's successor will be a
faculty member from another
institution of comparable stature.
Broader Cross Section
He also told LASSU that the
University Advisory Committee will give
"careful and thorough discussion to the
merits of having a somewhat larger
board" to include a broader
cross-section of society.
In accord with normal procedures,
however, it will probably take more
than a month to choose the new
member.
Provost Richard Lyman also
addressed the Council on the
University's minority group relations
stating that the progress Stanford has
made "brings tensions in direct
proportion to its success."
"It would be foolish," Lyman stated,
"to ignore the fact that generations of
repressed hostility have now reached the
surface and that we may expect that
hostility to be expressed in many
ways—most of them uncomfortable,
some of them unaccaptable— in the
years ahead.
During the past year, he added,
Stanford has had trouble, but "we are
not alone in that."
