of the farm began to have
confidence in the youth. Other
young shepherds there before him
were not noted for their judgment
or reliability, by and large.
The shepherd sent regular
reports on the sheep, and on his
isolated farm operations, over a
wire which led to the city. He had
little to say, except when the
sheep began to butt and bite at
each other. Those important
incidents he reported faithfully
and factually, just like the minor
ones.
One day, he sent an urgent
message for help over the wire
which began, "Wolf! Wolf!" His
story told in detail of a ferocious,
carniverous wolf of enormous size
that had appeared in the nearby
hills and threatened to devour the
sheep, the shepherd, and even his
big sheep dog.
When the chiefs in the city
read the message, some were
shocked. Others suggested that
perhaps the life had become too
tiresome for the boy and he
manufactured a tale to amuse
himself. Only when the chiefs saw
another message, immediately
following, urging immediate and
drastic action against the wolf, did
they set out for the shepherd's
terrain, all of them armed and
ready for anything. Even a wolf.
When they arrived at the
distant farm somewhat later, they
saw no wolf. No 'wolf droppings.
No wolf tracks. They heard no
wolf. They smelled no wolf. They
spent the night, trying to decide
whether this was a hoax or not.
The television crew even stayed
up all night trying to spot the
wolf, to no avail.
A Hoax
In the morning, the chiefs
decided that the wolf story was a
hoax, and, sure enough, the
shepherd boy eventually admitted
his prank, with undisguised glee
and pride.
Disillusioned, the chiefs
admonished him and returned
home. A few laughed, but some
were outraged, particularly the

numbers of sheep, their activities,
and changes in their environment.
They were faithful and factual,
just as before.
Credibility Gap
But he had established a
credibility gap.
One day, quite unexpectedly, a
wolf of enormous size did
materialize near the shepherd's
flock, and before the youth could
even react, he devoured three
sheep, terrified the rest, bared his
fangs villainously, and withdrew
into a nearby glen which would
serve him well in stalking his
quarry over the coming days.
The boy sent his message
frantically over the wire, "Wolf!
Wolf!" He described the wolf,
estimated his measurements,
recounted his attack, and even
described the exact location of his
lair. As a final flourish, he took
photos of the wolf and had his
faithful sheep dog run the films
back to the chiefs in the city.
All Laughed
The chiefs read the reports,
and they looked at the photos,
and they all laughed. "Boys will
be boys," they chuckled. And not
one of them went out to
investigate.
After that day, none of them
even bothered to read the
shepherd's reports. Life was busy
enough for everybody, and there
were many more important
matters to worry about.
They left the shepherd at his
post for the rest of the season,
although they never checked to
see whether a wolf had devoured
him or not. The chiefs were more
concerned about finding a
responsible young shepherd to
take the post the following
season, but wihtout much
optimism. Responsible young
shepherds were very difficult to
find. There was even some talk of
severing the communication link
with the shepherd altogether, such
that the shepherd would sent
daily reports as before, thinking
that his reports were being read
and digested. A placebo system, as
it were.
And some chiefs thought that
to be a splendid idea. After all,
there was no telling what
cock-and-bull story might turn up
next.
