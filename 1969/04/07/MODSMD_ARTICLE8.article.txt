This surprisingly virile, but
always fragile, power of public
community is raising its fist
against bureaucracy, wealth and
"national interest."
The "outside world" of course
includes the present governance of
Stanford University by the
Stanford Board of Trustees. This
startling new public institution
must face that "outside world."
It is not obvious that a
Stanford Community Forum and
the Stanford Board of Trustees
would share a common

understanding and unbiased
rationality.
From the evidence of the
March 11 open meeting it would
seem that a certain gap remains to
be bridged before that common
understanding could be realized.
(!)
Powerful Feeling
I think the Trustees may be
even more surprised than those
April 3rd 700 at the feeling of
power that has been infused into
the Stanford political community.
It is just that of course —a feeling;
but the trustees might not be able
to avoid a tangible show of that
"feeling" this quarter.
The secret is out. Stanford has j
discovered that its members can
come together and share a
common understanding while
dealing rationally with their
differences.
What have we here? No
committees. No sjt,raw votes. No
public opinion polls. We
have—people. People have risen
from their atomization into a
(temporarily) viable political
community and they have had a
taste of the power that comes
from such community.
When they overcome their own
surprise they will demand to be
dealt with. Indeed, they might
even want to be in on the dealing.
