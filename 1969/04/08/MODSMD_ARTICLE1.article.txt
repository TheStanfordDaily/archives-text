# Awareness Grows For Latin Revolts
## 
### DIARMUID McGUIRE 
The first step in the development of
a revolutionary personality is awareness,
Father Blaise Bonpane told a small
audience in Cubberly Auditorium last
night.
In Latin America this might consist
of teaching a slum-dweller how to spell
the word "favela," which means slum.
In the United States, awareness seems to
have begun with "the scandal of
Vietnam," said Bonpane.
"Alienation is when you have
chemical-biological warfare purifying
the atmosphere at Stanford," he
continued.
For Bonpane, the revolution started
during the years he spent in Guatemala
as a missionary priest. He worked with
the Cursilloij de Capacitacion Social, a
group that successfully organized
peasants to work for land reform and
political rights.
Greatest Mope
But Bonpane, along with fellow
Maryknoll missionaries Thomas and
Arthur Melville, came to the conclusion
that the greatest hope for change lay
with guerilla bands in the hills. In 1967
all of them were expelled from
Guatemala for "plotting an armed
revolution."
Progress in Guatemala, as in most of
Latin America, is prevented by a
powerful oligarchy, which is supported
by a U.S. trained and equipped military,
Bonpane said. The ruling class allows
North American corporations to use
cheap labor to drain the land of
resources.
As an example of this situation,
Bonpane pointed to the Guatemalan
"revolution" of 1954, when a CIA
backed coup ousted a land-reform
minded government headed by Jacobo
Arbenz. Troops involved in the coup
were trained at Fort Leavenworth,
Kansas, Bonpane said.
Returns Land
The first act of the new military
dictatorship was to return to the United
Fruit Company land that had been given
to peasant cooperatives by the Arbenz
government, said the former missionary.
United Fruit has traditionally been close
to the old Boston families, that also
provide leadership to the CIA.
Bonpane noted that recently
appointed Under-Secretary of State
Charles Meyer is a director of both Sears
Roebuck and United Fruit, or El Pulpo
(The Octopus), as Central Americans
call it. This continues a tradition of
close rapport between the Department
of State and the producers of Chiquita
bananas, Bonpane said. Several Cabots

and Lodges have also served on the
United Fruit board.
This information probably comes as
a considerable shock to most
Americans. But, in Bonpane's opinion,
"no one is more mythologized than one
who lives in a sophisticated culture, like
the United States."
Foreign Aid
For instance, most Americans are
convinced that their country gives
foreign aid to Latin America. But "the
U.S. has never given aid to Latin
America and has no intention of doing
so," said Bonpane.
He pointed out that Latin American
nations show a consistantly negative
balance of payments with their large
neighbor to the North. And the aid that
does reach countries like Guatemala
goes directly to some American
Corporation, like General Motors, which
will then send a manufactured product
to the recipient country.
The recipient pays back this "aid,"
with interest. It does not matter that a
comparable product might be available
from France of Czeschlovakia at half
the price.
De-my thologizing
Explaining this situation is part of
the process of de-mythologizing the
American public, said Bonpane. The
same process is taking place in Latin
America.
Bonpane recalled asking a Latin
American peasant why he was poor and
being told that "I am poor because God
is angry with me." But by asking the
man more questions, like why the
landowner was not also poor, it was
possible to lead him to the realization
that things could be different, said the
revolutionary priest.
De-mythologization may be even
more difficult in the United States than
in Guatemala, Bonpane said. He
displayed a copy of the San Francisco
Examiner. A prominant headline
blamed campus unrest on "Reds."
In Bonpane's view, this represented at
serious confusion between cause and
effect. "It's like saying that guerillas are
responsible for unrest in Latin
America,"he said. Exploitation and
institutionalized violence are ignored by
the men who write the Examiner.
Bonpane predicted "many
Vietnams." There are already Green
Berets in Northern Argentina, he said.
But the United States cannot even
defeat half of Vietnam. They may send
marines into Nicaragua and Argentina
and Laos and Thailand, but in the end
the revolutions will break their back.

as a missionary priest. He worked with
the Cursilloij de Capacitacion Social, a
group that successfully organized
peasants to work for land reform and
political rights.
Greatest Mope
But Bonpane, along with fellow
Maryknoll missionaries Thomas and
Arthur Melville, came to the conclusion
that the greatest hope for change lay
with guerilla bands in the hills. In 1967
all of them were expelled from
Guatemala for "plotting an armed
revolution."
Progress in Guatemala, as in most of
Latin America, is prevented by a
powerful oligarchy, which is supported
by a U.S. trained and equipped military,
Bonpane said. The ruling class allows
North American corporations to use
cheap labor to drain the land of
resources.
As an example of this situation,
Bonpane pointed to the Guatemalan
"revolution" of 1954, when a CIA
backed coup ousted a land-reform
minded government headed by Jacobo
Arbenz. Troops involved in the coup
were trained at Fort Leavenworth,
Kansas, Bonpane said.
Returns Land
The first act of the new military
dictatorship was to return to the United
Fruit Company land that had been given
to peasant cooperatives by the Arbenz
government, said the former missionary.
United Fruit has traditionally been close
to the old Boston families, that also
provide leadership to the CIA.
Bonpane noted that recently
appointed Under-Secretary of State
Charles Meyer is a director of both Sears
Roebuck and United Fruit, or El Pulpo
(The Octopus), as Central Americans
call it. This continues a tradition of
close rapport between the Department
of State and the producers of Chiquita
bananas, Bonpane said. Several Cabots

and Lodges have also served on the
United Fruit board.
This information probably comes as
a considerable shock to most
Americans. But, in Bonpane's opinion,
"no one is more mythologized than one
who lives in a sophisticated culture, like
the United States."
Foreign Aid
For instance, most Americans are
convinced that their country gives
foreign aid to Latin America. But "the
U.S. has never given aid to Latin
America and has no intention of doing
so," said Bonpane.
He pointed out that Latin American
nations show a consistantly negative
balance of payments with their large
neighbor to the North. And the aid that
does reach countries like Guatemala
goes directly to some American
Corporation, like General Motors, which
will then send a manufactured product
to the recipient country.
The recipient pays back this "aid,"
with interest. It does not matter that a
comparable product might be available
from France of Czeschlovakia at half
the price.
De-my thologizing
Explaining this situation is part of
the process of de-mythologizing the
American public, said Bonpane. The
same process is taking place in Latin
America.
Bonpane recalled asking a Latin
American peasant why he was poor and
being told that "I am poor because God
is angry with me." But by asking the
man more questions, like why the
landowner was not also poor, it was
possible to lead him to the realization
that things could be different, said the
revolutionary priest.
De-mythologization may be even
more difficult in the United States than
in Guatemala, Bonpane said. He
displayed a copy of the San Francisco
Examiner. A prominant headline
blamed campus unrest on "Reds."
In Bonpane's view, this represented at
serious confusion between cause and
effect. "It's like saying that guerillas are
responsible for unrest in Latin
America,"he said. Exploitation and
institutionalized violence are ignored by
the men who write the Examiner.
Bonpane predicted "many
Vietnams." There are already Green
Berets in Northern Argentina, he said.
But the United States cannot even
defeat half of Vietnam. They may send
marines into Nicaragua and Argentina
and Laos and Thailand, but in the end
the revolutions will break their back.
The first step in the development of
a revolutionary personality is awareness,
Father Blaise Bonpane told a small
audience in Cubberly Auditorium last
night.
In Latin America this might consist
of teaching a slum-dweller how to spell
the word "favela," which means slum.
In the United States, awareness seems to
have begun with "the scandal of
Vietnam," said Bonpane.
"Alienation is when you have
chemical-biological warfare purifying
the atmosphere at Stanford," he
continued.
For Bonpane, the revolution started
during the years he spent in Guatemala
as a missionary priest. He worked with
the Cursilloij de Capacitacion Social, a
group that successfully organized
peasants to work for land reform and
political rights.
