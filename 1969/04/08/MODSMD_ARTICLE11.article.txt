# Hoover Institution Scholar-Theorist To Give View Of Modern Philosophy
## 
### 
Dr. Eric Voegelin, an
internationally prominent
philosopher and political theorist,
will speak on ''The
Transformation of Philosophy in
Our Time" today at 7:45 p.m. in
Bishop Auditorium of the
Graduate School of Business.
Prof. Voegelin recently began
an extended period in residence as
Henry Salvatori Distinguished
Scholar at Stanford's Hoover
Institution. In 1958 he succeeded
to the professorship once held by
the eminent sociologist, Max
Weber, at the University of
Munich, Germany, and will retain
that title during his appointment
here.
Born in Cologne and educated
at Vienna, Oxford, Berlin, the
Sorbonne and Harvard, among
other universities, Dr. Voegelin in
1936 was dismissed by the Nazi
government from teaching
positions in his native country.
Shortly after, he began a 20-year
period of study, teaching and
writing in the United States.
Some of his most important
work was published during his
tenure at Louisiana State

University (1942-58), where he
became Boyd Professor of
Government in 1952. This
includes The New Science of
Politics and Order and History, a
continuing study now in three
volumes.
Dr. Voegelin's lecture is
sponsored by the University
Lectures Committee, through the
Office of Public Events.
The New Science of Politics
(19 5 2) constituted an
English-language beginning for
Voegelin's continuing attempt to
change the nature and direction of
modern political inquiry. As one
colleague has put it, the
German-born scholar seeks "to
restore" the ancient Greek
tradition "of political theory as an
experimental science of right
order."
To Voegelin, most present-day
reading and teaching of, for
example, Plato and Aristotle, is
stripped of any real understanding
of the reflective processes by
which these political philosophers
used myth, symbol and analogy.
"We have," he says, "no

meditative practice today." If
political philosophy is to be
restored to its original
importance, Voegelin believes, it
will happen because of vast
improvements in the quantity and
quality of historical,
anthropological and archeological
research.
Such considerations definitely
have great contemporary
significance for Voegelin. Of
today's rebellious students he
says:
"They desperately want
spiritual information and
guidance. But they are alienated
from the churches and they don't
find help in the universities."
Voegelin goes so far as to call
most American and European
higher education "an iron
curtain" between the students and
the essentially spiritual life many
of them seek.
Without taking sides on the
issue, Voegelin suggests that one
reason the Papal encyclical on
birth control has drawn such
heavy fire is the "philosophical

illiteracy" of the Roman Curia,
the principal governing body of
the Catholic Church.
By this Voegelin means that
the "natural law" theology by
which the Church rulers seek to
explain their disapproval of
artificial contraception has
become, in their hands, merely
dogmatic rather than
philosophically intelligible.
Voegelin himself is a Lutheran.
His Anamnesis
( 1966 )—-meaning literally, in
Plato's Greek, ''against
forgetful ness"—moves toward a
theory of history and politics by
an examination of the recollected
experiences of his own childhood.

that title during his appointment
here.
Born in Cologne and educated
at Vienna, Oxford, Berlin, the
Sorbonne and Harvard, among
other universities, Dr. Voegelin in
1936 was dismissed by the Nazi
government from teaching
positions in his native country.
Shortly after, he began a 20-year
period of study, teaching and
writing in the United States.
Some of his most important
work was published during his
tenure at Louisiana State

University (1942-58), where he
became Boyd Professor of
Government in 1952. This
includes The New Science of
Politics and Order and History, a
continuing study now in three
volumes.
Dr. Voegelin's lecture is
sponsored by the University
Lectures Committee, through the
Office of Public Events.
The New Science of Politics
(19 5 2) constituted an
English-language beginning for
Voegelin's continuing attempt to
change the nature and direction of
modern political inquiry. As one
colleague has put it, the
German-born scholar seeks "to
restore" the ancient Greek
tradition "of political theory as an
experimental science of right
order."
To Voegelin, most present-day
reading and teaching of, for
example, Plato and Aristotle, is
stripped of any real understanding
of the reflective processes by
which these political philosophers
used myth, symbol and analogy.
"We have," he says, "no

meditative practice today." If
political philosophy is to be
restored to its original
importance, Voegelin believes, it
will happen because of vast
improvements in the quantity and
quality of historical,
anthropological and archeological
research.
Such considerations definitely
have great contemporary
significance for Voegelin. Of
today's rebellious students he
says:
"They desperately want
spiritual information and
guidance. But they are alienated
from the churches and they don't
find help in the universities."
Voegelin goes so far as to call
most American and European
higher education "an iron
curtain" between the students and
the essentially spiritual life many
of them seek.
Without taking sides on the
issue, Voegelin suggests that one
reason the Papal encyclical on
birth control has drawn such
heavy fire is the "philosophical

illiteracy" of the Roman Curia,
the principal governing body of
the Catholic Church.
By this Voegelin means that
the "natural law" theology by
which the Church rulers seek to
explain their disapproval of
artificial contraception has
become, in their hands, merely
dogmatic rather than
philosophically intelligible.
Voegelin himself is a Lutheran.
His Anamnesis
( 1966 )—-meaning literally, in
Plato's Greek, ''against
forgetful ness"—moves toward a
theory of history and politics by
an examination of the recollected
experiences of his own childhood.
Dr. Eric Voegelin, an
internationally prominent
philosopher and political theorist,
will speak on ''The
Transformation of Philosophy in
Our Time" today at 7:45 p.m. in
Bishop Auditorium of the
Graduate School of Business.
Prof. Voegelin recently began
an extended period in residence as
Henry Salvatori Distinguished
Scholar at Stanford's Hoover
Institution. In 1958 he succeeded
to the professorship once held by
the eminent sociologist, Max
Weber, at the University of
Munich, Germany, and will retain
that title during his appointment
here.
