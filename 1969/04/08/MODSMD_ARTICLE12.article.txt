# Panelists Discuss Auto Air Pollution Controls
## 
### BETTY NISHIOKA 
Air pollution caused by
automobile exhaust was the topic
of the panel discussion sponsored
by the Population and
Environment Forum Wednesday
night.
; The three panelists who
represented the legal, mechanical,
jand physiological aspects of air
pollution were John Maga, the
executive head of the California
•Air Resources Board, Professor
JErnest S. Starkman from the
Department of Mechanical
•Engineering at the University of
at Berkeley, and Dr.
JJohn Goldsmith, the chief in the
Environmental Epidemiology Unit
of the California Department of
Public Health.
Prof. Starkman initiated the
discussion by describing the
undesirable chemical components

resulting from fuel burning in
internal combustion engines.
Pollution problems are
centered around the three
compounds that inevitably result
from fuel combustion, carbon
monoxide, unburned fuel (mainly
unburned hydrocarbons), and
nitrogen oxides.
In addition to these are the
three materials that can be
eliminated if necessary, sulfur,
lead, and particulates. The
problem with lowering the lead
content is the problem of the
accompanying lowering of the
octane number.
Prof. Starkman's introduction
was indicative of the trend of the
evening's discussion —the
complexity of the auto exhaust
problem is such that the solution
of one problem almost always
leads to the creation of another.

The major ingredient in auto
exhaust that is injurious to health,
Dr. Goldsmith explained, is
ozone, which produces eye and
respiratory tract irritation,
damage to vegetation, and defects
in visibility. An auto can produce
the same percentage of carbon
monoxide as cigarette smoke and
cam encourage the disease
emphysema through the
production of nitrogen oxide.
Maga cited dated for the
institution of recent California
legislation for the three main
sources of auto pollution. The
crankcase control system was
effected in 1961 and the exhaust
control system in 1966. All 1970
models will have evaporative
control systems. Maga advocated
the legislation of progressively
stricter standards for automobile
manufacturers.
On the question of battery
powered cars, Prof. Starkman
explained their impracticality as a
vehicle today. To build and sell a
battery operated car at about the
same price as an average auto
today, the battery car would have
a "25-mile maximum speed and a
4 0-mile range or a 45-mile
maximum speed and a 20-mile
range."
The panel expressed general
agreement on a more efficient
traffic control and transportation
system that would necessitate
fewer cars entering metropolitan
areas.
Dr. Goldsmith summarized the
panel's sentiments with his
statement, "We want a vehicle
that's convenient and economical,
but we want one that doesn't
produce any health problems and
doesn't affect your visibility and
lets you grow lettuce if you
want."
Maga believed that through
stricter auto emission standards,
by 1980 to 1983, the "motor
vehicle won't be the main source
of air pollution in California."
Then there will be the question of
which pollution source needs to
be controlled next.
