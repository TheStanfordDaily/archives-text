# Raffle Planned For Victim's Fund
## 
### 
This week, the Stanford
chapter of Alpha Phi Omega,
National Service Fraternity, will
begin selling tickets to the
Bay-Area-wide Susan Bartolomei
Foundation Raffle.
In August of 1967, Susan
Bartolomei and her boyfriend,
Tim Luce, were picked up by two
young men wanted for armed
robbery. They killed Tim and
raped and shot Susan. The details
of the crime are well-known since
the assailants were tried and
convicted in San Jose last fall.
What is less well-known is that the
incident left Susan voiceless and
almost totally paralyzed. The
extent of her recovery is unknown
and prospects not too hopeful.
The tremendous cost of hospital

carc has resulted in bills far too
high for Susan's parents to meet.
the Susan Bartolomei Fund
was started by a student group at
Santa Clara University. Its goal is
to raise money for a large trust
fund so that Susan may live off
the interest for the rest of her life.
The Raffle is one of many
fund-raising projects.
The grand raffle prize for all
participating campuses is a 1969
Ford Mustang. For the Stanford
campus, first prize is a new colour
TV; second prize, a stereo; third, a
case of wine; and fourth, free
dinner for two at a local
restaurant.
Tickets, at $1 each or 12 for
$10, will be on sale on White
Plaza throughout the week.
