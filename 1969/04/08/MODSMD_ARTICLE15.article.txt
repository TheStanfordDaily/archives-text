## I-Center Offers Jobs 
### DOUG ANDERSON 
Some afternoon when you
have nothing to do, you might
walk over to the I-Center and find
yourself upstairs rumaging
through some international travel
propaganda. Perhaps you will be
pleasantly surprised to suddenly
wake up and find that the
brochure in your hand is offering
you a summer study program in
Europe for free!
Or maybe you're interested in
doing two years for the Peace
Corps after you get your scroll
and you want to spend a summer
working in some foreign land to
find out whether or not that's
your thing.
If either of these situations
apply to you, or if you are one of
the dissatisfied students who
wants to study abroad, but you

can't get excited about the
Stanford-Abroad program, you
have unwittingly come to the
right place.
Surprisingly enough, most
people who avail themselves of
the I-Center's file for jobs and
study programs abroad have either
stumbled into it or found out
about it word-of-mouth.
Yet every afternoon between 2
and 4 p.m., Russ Spidel and Gwen
Dukes are on hand to help you
find a job or a study program
somewhere — almost
anywhere—you want.
So far there hasn't been much
response to the I-Center's file.
Only ten students have come in
this quarter to search through the
huge group of pamphlets, leaflets,
university brochures, handbooks,

and source books.
Versatility is the mark of the
file. Programs sponsored by
American corporations, foreign
and American universities,
non-profit service organizations,
and the United Nations offer a
variety of summer or full year
experiences in lands from Asia to
Latin America.
But, according to Mrs. Dukes,
time is running out for people
interested in a summer program
this year. Many of the programs
have deadlines which are rapidly
approaching.
So, if you're interested, drop in
on the Bechtel people—they are
there, happy to help, and it costs
you nothing—except, maybe, an
afternoon when you have nothing
to do.
