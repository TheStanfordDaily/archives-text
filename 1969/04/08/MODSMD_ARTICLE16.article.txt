## Indians Keep Winning 
### 
The Stanford volleyball team
continues to make a strong bid for
national honors. The squad, which
had already beaten all comers in
the Napa Invitational Open added
triumphs in the Santa Barbara
Tournament to their record
recently.
The netters placed second in
the Santa Barbara affair, the
biggest college tourney so far this
year. Every top college squad in
the state, and that means the best
in the country, participated.
Favorites in the 20 team, three
day event were UCLA, USC,
UCSB (the hosts), and Santa
Monica City College. The teams
.were divided into four pools of
five teams each. Every pool
played a round-robin with each
squad playing everyone else in
their division twice.
On the basis of composite
scores, the two top teams from
each pool entered the playoffs for
best two-out-of-three sets to 15
points.
Stanford won their moderately
tough division by beating the
Trojans 15-3, 15-4; UCLA "2"
15-5, 15-1; LA State 15-11, 15-6;
and splitting with Long Beach
State 15-10, 11-15.

The Indans then moved into
the playoffs where they met and
defeated Santa Monica (15-3,
15-9) and Santa Ana (15-9, 15-8).
These victorl?s moved the Tribe
into the finals against the top
UCLA contingent. Stanford
started off strongly winning the
first game 15-13, but faltered in
the second, losing 15-10.
In the third and deciding
contest, the Cards built up a 10-5
lead, but could not hold it, falling
15-13.

Jim Julan, one of Stanford's
star spikers was one of six players
selected on the All-Tourney team.
The Indians 1 showing in the
Santa Barbara tourney
undoubtedly places them among
the top three teams in the nation.
Last year, they ranked fifth.
Top seated UCLA has a much
stronger foundation on which to
build impressive volleyball teams.
Volleyball scholarships are
available in Westwood.

KING OF THE MOUNTAlN—Stanford's number one singles player, senior Dean
Schlobohm, will lead the Indians in three matches this week. Tomorrow they
face Seattle University at home at 2:30 p.m., before meeting Redlands on
Thursday and traveling to Berkeley on Saturday.

tough division by beating the
Trojans 15-3, 15-4; UCLA "2"
15-5, 15-1; LA State 15-11, 15-6;
and splitting with Long Beach
State 15-10, 11-15.

The Indans then moved into
the playoffs where they met and
defeated Santa Monica (15-3,
15-9) and Santa Ana (15-9, 15-8).
These victorl?s moved the Tribe
into the finals against the top
UCLA contingent. Stanford
started off strongly winning the
first game 15-13, but faltered in
the second, losing 15-10.
In the third and deciding
contest, the Cards built up a 10-5
lead, but could not hold it, falling
15-13.

Jim Julan, one of Stanford's
star spikers was one of six players
selected on the All-Tourney team.
The Indians 1 showing in the
Santa Barbara tourney
undoubtedly places them among
the top three teams in the nation.
Last year, they ranked fifth.
Top seated UCLA has a much
stronger foundation on which to
build impressive volleyball teams.
Volleyball scholarships are
available in Westwood.

MISSED CONNECTION—Chuck Williams swings for a pitch against I,A
State. Williams roams the left side of the Stanlord infield as well as seeing duty
in the outfield on occasion. Tribe meets Cal State Hay ward at 3:00 p.m. today
at the Sunken Diamond.


KING OF THE MOUNTAlN—Stanford's number one singles player, senior Dean
Schlobohm, will lead the Indians in three matches this week. Tomorrow they
face Seattle University at home at 2:30 p.m., before meeting Redlands on
Thursday and traveling to Berkeley on Saturday.
The Stanford volleyball team
continues to make a strong bid for
national honors. The squad, which
had already beaten all comers in
the Napa Invitational Open added
triumphs in the Santa Barbara
Tournament to their record
recently.
The netters placed second in
the Santa Barbara affair, the
biggest college tourney so far this
year. Every top college squad in
the state, and that means the best
in the country, participated.
Favorites in the 20 team, three
day event were UCLA, USC,
UCSB (the hosts), and Santa
Monica City College. The teams
.were divided into four pools of
five teams each. Every pool
played a round-robin with each
squad playing everyone else in
their division twice.
On the basis of composite
scores, the two top teams from
each pool entered the playoffs for
best two-out-of-three sets to 15
points.
Stanford won their moderately
tough division by beating the
Trojans 15-3, 15-4; UCLA "2"
15-5, 15-1; LA State 15-11, 15-6;
and splitting with Long Beach
State 15-10, 11-15.
