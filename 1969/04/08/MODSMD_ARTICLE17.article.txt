# Golf Team Prepares
## 
### 
Coach Bud Finger's Stanford
golf team, currently relaxing from
their impressive Fresno Classic
victory, will return to the links on
Friday to face the talented
California golfers.
The match will be held on Cal's
home Mfra Vista course, starting
at 1:00 p.m. The Stanford frosh
take on the Cal freshmen at the
same time.
The Bears face a fine San Jose
State team earlier in the week. Cal
defeated the Spartans 29-25 in the
first match of the year. Friday's
encounter will mark the opening
of Pacific-8 play for both the
Stanford and California teams.
At Fresno, the Indians were
unbelievable. Sophomore Tom
Watson, two-time Missouri State
champion, captured the individual
honors with a two under par 214.
Stanford seniors Greg Pitzer and
Sandy Adelman captured second
and third respectively. Pitzer had
a 216, and Adelman checked in
with 222.
The team victory came over
defending champs, Arizona State.
The Sun Devils are considered
co-favorites with Houston for the
NCAA title this spring.
