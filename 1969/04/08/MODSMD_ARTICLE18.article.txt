# Lacrosse Win
## Duck Hunting 
### 
Paced by George Muser's seven goals and three assists, and Chip
Loveman's lour goals and three assists, the Stanford lacrosse team
romped to an 18-1 smothering of the University of Oregon Ducks
Saturday at Eugene.
The Indians have outscored their opponents in the opening two
games of the season by a 33-2 count.
Muser got the offense-minded Indians off to an early start with an
unassisted tally with only twenty-seven seconds gone in the game.
Muser took the ball from the midfield, tested his defenseman for a
few seconds in the Oregon mud, found that he would have no
problems, and left his man behind, sweeping past the front of the cage
untouched for an easy goal.
The rest of Muser's goals came in clusters of three, three straight in
the middle of the first quarter and the last three goals of the game.
The Indians got goals methodicaly for the next ten minutes, with
strikes from Chris Rafferty, Loveman, and Muser. Then, in the last
two minutes of the quarter, the tribe put on a spectacular display with
four quick goals for an eight point advantage at the quarter break.
Muser provided two, Loveman one, and Dirk Speas one with assists
onthe last three from Stu Childs, Tod Suen, and Loveman.
The Stanford coaches quickly invoked a three-pass rule on the
offense before a shot could be taken to slow the pace of the game and
practice fundamentals.
Paced in this fashion, the Indians scored three goals in the second
quarter. Muser fed Loveman for the first two and Rafferty drove one
home unassisted. With fifteen seconds left in the half Oregon got their
lone tally, as Gary Young, a defenseman somewhat inexplicably in the
offensive zone of the field, found a loose ball on the crease and batted
it past Stanford goalie Jay Morse.
Stanford continued at the same pace in the second half and
substituted freely, scoring four in the third period and three in the
fourth. Ben Smith scored twice and Larry Beard and Tom Kidde got
into the scoring columns while Muser poured in three more to wrap
up the melee.
The game was a rough and tumble affair. The inept Oregon team
found body contact in the mud much to their liking, and the
Stanford team surprisingly survived without injury.
