Utah, killed by another nerve
poison—a strange and, I believe,
still unexplained accident, since
the nearest testing seems to have
been thirty mles away.
Remember khe Sanh!
"As for Vietnam, the
expenditure of firepower there
has been frightening. Some of you
may still remember Khe Sanh, a
hamlet just south of the
Demilitarized Zone, where a force
of United States Marines was
beleaguered for a time. During
that period, we dropped on the
perimeter of the Khe Sanh more
explosives that fell on Japan
throughout World War 11, and
more than fell on the whole of
Europe during the years of 1942
and 1943.
"One of the officers there was
quoted as having said afterward,
'It looks like the world caught
smallpox and died.'
"The only point of government
is to safeguard and foster life. Our
government has become
preoccupied with death, with the
business of killing and beig
killed. So-called defense now
absorbs sixty per cent of the
national budget, and about twelve
per cent of the Gross National
Product.
ABM Debates
"A lively debate is beginnng
again on whether or not we
should deploy an tiball istic
missiles, the ABM. I don't have to
talk about this—everyone else
here is doing that. But I should
like to mention a curious
circumstance. In September,
1967, or about a year and a half
ago, we had a meeting of M.I.T.
and Harvard people, including
experts on these matters, to talk
about whether anything could be
done to block the Sentinel
system—the deployment of ABMs.
Everyone present thought them
undesirable, but a few of the most
knowledgeable persons took what
seemed to bo the practical view:
'Why fight about a dead issue? If
has been decided, the funds have
been appropriated. Let's go from
there.'
"Well, fortunately, it's not a
dead issue.
"An ABM is a nuclear weapon.
It takes a nuclear weapon to stop
a nuclear weapon. And our
concern must be with the whole
issue of nuclear weapons.
ARM Semantics
"There is an entire semantics
ready to deal with the sort of
thing I am about to sav. It

involves such phrases as 'Those are
the facts of life.' No—these are the
facts of death. I don't accept
them, and I advise you not to
accept them. We are under
repeated pressure to accept things
that are presented to us as
settled—decisions that have been
made. Always there is the
thought: Let's go on from there.
But this time we don't see how to
go on. We will have to stick with
these issues.
"We are told that the United
States and Russia, between them,
by now have stockpiled nuclear
weapons of approximately the
explosive power of fifteen tons of
TNT for every man, woman, and
child on earth. And now it is
suggested that we must make
more. All very regrettable, of
course, but 'those are the facts of
life.' We really would liko to
disarm, but our new Secretary of
Defense has made the ingenious
proposal that now is the time to
greatly increase our nuclear
armaments, so that we can disarm
from a position of strength.
No Nuclear Defense
"I think all of you know there
is no adequate defense against
massive nuclear attack. It is both
easier and cheaper to circumvent
any known nuclear-defense
system than to provide it. It's all
pretty crazy. At the very moment
we talk of deploying ABMs, we
are also building the MIRV, the
weapon to circumvent ABMs.
"As far as I know, the most
conservative estimates of the
nmber of Americans who would
be killed in a major nuclear
attack, with everything working as
well as can be hoped and all
foreseeable precautions taken, run
to about fifty million. We have
become callous to gruesome
statistics, and this seems at first to
be only another gruesome
statistic. You think, Bang!—and
next morning, if you're still there,
you read in the newspapers that
fifty million people were killed.
"But that isn't the way it
happens. When we killed close to
two hundred thousand people
with those first, little,
old-fashioned uranium bombs that
we dropped on Hiroshima and
Nagasaki, about the same number
of persons were maimed, blinded,
burned, poisoned, and otherwise
doomed. A lot of them took a
long time to die.
"That's the way it would be.
Not a bang and a certain number
of corpses to bury but a nation
filled with millions of helnless.

maimed, tortured, and doomed
persons, and the survivors huddled
with their families in shelters,
with guns ready to fight off their
neighbors trying to get some
uncontaminated food and water.
Patriot?
"A few months ago, Senator
Richard Russell, of Georgia,
ended a speech in he Senate with
the words 'If we have to start over
again with another Adam and Eve,
I want them to be Americans; and
I want them on this continent and
not in Europe.' That was a United
States senator making a patriotic
speech. Well, here is a Nobel
laureate who thinks that those
words are criminally insane.
"How real is the threat of
full-scale nuclear war? I have my
own very inexpert idea, but,
realizing how little I know, and
fearful that I may be a little
paranoid on this subject, I take
every opportunity to ask reputed
experts. I asked that question of a
distinguished professor of
government at Harvard about a
month ago. I asked him what sort
of odds he would lay on the
possibility of full-scale nuclear
war within the foreseeable future.
'Oh,' he said comfortably, 'I
think I can give you a pretty good
answer to that question. I
estimate the probability of
full-scale nuclear war, provided
that the situation remains about
as it is now, at two per cent per
year.' Anybody can do the sinple
calculation that shows that two
per cent per year means that the
chance of having that full-scale
nuclear war by 1990 is about one
in three, and by 2000 it is about
fifty-fifty.
No uture
"I think I know what is
bothering the students. I think
that what we are up agaist is a
generation that is by no means
sure that it has a future.
"I am growing old, and my
future, so to speak, is already
behind me. But there are those
students of mine, who are in my
mnd always; and there are my
children, the youngest of them
now seven and nine, whose future
is infinitely more precious to me
than my own. So it isn't just their
generation; it's mine too. We're all
in it together.
"Are we to have a chance to
live? We don't ask for prosperity,
or security. Only for a reasonable
chance to live, to work out our
destiny in peace and decency. Not

to go down in history as the
apocalyptic generation.
"And it isn't only nuclear war.
Another overwhelming threat is in
the population explosion. That
has not yet even begun to come
under control. There is every
indication that the world
population will double before the
year 2000, and there is a
widespread expectation of famine
on an unprecedented scale in
many parts of the world. The
experts tend to differ only in their
estimates of when those famines
will begin. Some think by 1980;
others think they can be staved
off until 1990; very few expect
that they will not occur by the
year 2000.
Existence Unsure
"That is the problem. Unless
we can be surer than we are that
this generation has a future,
nothing else matters. It's not good
enough to give it tender, loving
care, to supply it with breakfast
foods, to buy it expensive
educations. Those things don't
mean anything unless this
generation has a future. And we're
not sure that it does.
"I don't think that there are
problems of youth, or student
problems. All the real problems I
know about are grown-up
problems.
"Perhaps you will think me
altogether absurd, or 'academic,'
or hopelessly innocent—that is,
until you think of the
alternatives—if I say, as I do to
you now: We have to get rid of
those nuclear weapons. There is
nothing worth having that can be
obtained by nuclear war—nothing
material or ideological—no
tradition that it can defend. It is
utterly self-defeating. Those
atomic bombs represent an
unusable weapon. The only use
for an atomic bomb is to keep
somebody else from using one. It
can give us no protection—only
the doubtful satisfaction of
retaliation. Nuclear weapons offer
us noLhing but a balance of terror,
and a balance of terror is still
terror.
"We have to get rid of those
atomic weapons, here and
everywhere. We cannot live with
them.
The Time lias Come
"I think we've reached point of
great decision, not just for our
nation, not only for all humanity,
hut for life upon the earth. I tell
my students, with a feeling of

pride that I hope they will share,
that the carbon, nitrogen, and
oxygen that make up ninety-nine
per cent of our living substance
were cooked in the deep interiors
of earlier generations of dying
stars. Gathered up from the ends
of the universe, over billions of
years, eventually they came to
form, in part, the substance of our
sun, its planets, and ourselves.
Three billion years ago, life arose
upon the earth. It is the only life
in the solar system.
"About two million years ago,
man appeared. He has become the
dominant species on the earth. All
o the Jiving things, animal and
plant, live by his sufferance. He is
the custodian of life on earth, and
in the solar system. It's a big
responsibility.
"The thought that we're in
competition with Russians or with
Chinese is all a mistake, and
trivial. We are one species, with a
world to win. There's life all over
this universe, but the only life in
the solar system is on earth, and
in the whole universe we are the
only men.
"Our business is with life, not
death. Our challenge is to give
what account we can of what
becomes of life in the solar
system, this corner of the universe
that is our home; and, most of all,
what becomes of men—all men, of
all nations, colors, and creeds.
This has become one world, a
world for all men. It is only such a
world that can now offer us life,
and the chance to go on."
