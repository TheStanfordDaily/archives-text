# Key McCarthy Backer Here On Two-Day Visit
## 
### 
Allard K. Lowenstein, who was
instrumental in persuading Sen. Eugene
J. McCarthy to seek the Democratic
presidential nomination and who
subsequently led the "dump Johnson"
movement last year, will be on campus
today and tomorrow.
Lowenstein will be the
Inter-Fraternity Council (IFC) Spring
Quarter Guest-in-Residence.
Now a U.S. Representative from
Nassau County, New York, Lowenstein
was head of the Coalition for an Open
Democratic Convention last November.
For years a strong critic of the
Vietnam War, he began advocating his
"dump Johnson" cause as early as
Spring of 1967, when the prospect of
convincing the President not to seek a
second term seemed futile.
IFC President Doug Chandler
announced that Lowenstein will arrive
this afternoon and participate in a
Journalism Seminar in room C-3 of
Cyprus Hall at 4:15.
The public in invited to meet with
Rep. Lowenstein in an after-dinner
reception at the Phi Delta Theta

fraternity house this evening beginning
at 6:45.
Tomorrow morning Lowenstein will
participate in an open discussion with
the Stanford Biafran Committee at
11:00 in Serra Hall. Later in the day he
will be interviewed by the press, radio,
and television at a 2:00 p.m. news
conference in TMU.
There will be another open
discussion and presentation tomorrow
at 4:15 in TMU Large Lounge. The IFC
has also scheduled a Wednesday evening
discussion with Lowenstein at Grove
House, starting at 6:45.
Although Mr. Lowenstein's Stanford
schedule will be tight, further meetings
with campus organizations and living
groups will be arranged as time permits.
Interested individuals should contact
IFC Programming Chairman Ray
Hermann, at Kappa Sigma.
