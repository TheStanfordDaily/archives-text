# Politics In China
## Mao Contrasted With Stalin, Lenin 
### WILLIAM L. RIVERS 
While finding that sometimes
Mao Tse-tung "makes Stalin look
like a modest man," Dr. Stuart R.
Schram found this aspect of
modern China rather
"depressing." So in his talk last
Thursday evening, Dr. Schram
chose to focus on the reciprocal
relationship in Maoist political
thought between cultural
revolution, which changes minds,
and social revolution, which
changes lives.
Dr. Schram found that though
he did not espouse the Maoist
prescription for organizing
societies, he did think that the
Chinese communists were dealing,
in their cultural revolution against
technicians and bureaucrats, with

matters which Westerners have in
common with the Chinese as
matters ol concern.
Before a half-filled Bishop
Auditorium, Schram rejected as
an absurdism the claim that
Maoism is orthodox
Marxism-Leninism. But he felt
this lact in no way diminished its
value as a system of thought. Mao
has retained the moral criteria of
Marxism only. Throughout his
forty-five minute lecture, Schram
contrasted political positions of
Soviet leaders Lenin and Stalin
with those of Mao.
Marx had written that the
solution for Asia was
Europeanization—the adoption of
the methods of the industrial
revolution. The British in India

were said to be "laying the
material foundations of Western
civilization in Asia." On the other
hand, Maoist communists have
continued the ancient Chinese
belief that their culture is superior
to others. Technicians in China
have, according to Dr. Schram,
appeared as bearers of foreign
knowledge, an insult to cultural
dignity. In Schram's opinion, the
communists saw Marxism as the
way to modernize China, but
decided that this vehicle for
modernization had first to be
Sinified.
"Spontaneity was the dirtiest
of dirty words for Lenin,"
according to Dr. Schram. Stalin
had viewed egalitarianism as
reactionary. Mao, in contrast, has
relied heavily on the strength and
wisdom of the Chinese peasant.
Though Maoist spontaneity is a
"controlled spontaneity, guided
by the helmsman of the Chinese
revolution," the Long March and
Yenan period's values of
egalitarianism, austerity, and mass
participation are primary values in
Maoist China.
Mao believes, Dr. Schram told
his audience, that if you can
change men's thinking, you
change their objective nature.
Within the Marxian tradition, the
belief that ideas determine reality
and the emphasis on inner
transformation and human will
are something peculiar to Mao's
thought.
Whereas Lenin could write in
"What Is to be Done" that
"talented men are not born by
hundreds," and Stalin could hold

technicians as a group in high
favor, Mao has viewed with
suspicion, according to Dr.
Schram, anyone claiming greater
expertise than that possessed by
the masses.
Because of China's peculiar
nature, Mao felt, in Dr. Schram's
words, that "social transformation
would come faster than technical
transformation." Since much of
the Chinese communist party was
committed to the Soviet model of
hierarchical authority for

bureaucrats, exports, and party
members and of transformation
through mechanization, Mao
sought during the cultural
revolution to smash the party
apparatus and discredit it.
Dr. Schram pointed out that in
tlu> arrangements' being approved
at the ninth pariy congress, now
in progress, the communist party
is no longer in a permanently
privileged position, but is placed
"under the supervision of the
masses."

Dr. Schram found that though
he did not espouse the Maoist
prescription for organizing
societies, he did think that the
Chinese communists were dealing,
in their cultural revolution against
technicians and bureaucrats, with

matters which Westerners have in
common with the Chinese as
matters ol concern.
Before a half-filled Bishop
Auditorium, Schram rejected as
an absurdism the claim that
Maoism is orthodox
Marxism-Leninism. But he felt
this lact in no way diminished its
value as a system of thought. Mao
has retained the moral criteria of
Marxism only. Throughout his
forty-five minute lecture, Schram
contrasted political positions of
Soviet leaders Lenin and Stalin
with those of Mao.
Marx had written that the
solution for Asia was
Europeanization—the adoption of
the methods of the industrial
revolution. The British in India

were said to be "laying the
material foundations of Western
civilization in Asia." On the other
hand, Maoist communists have
continued the ancient Chinese
belief that their culture is superior
to others. Technicians in China
have, according to Dr. Schram,
appeared as bearers of foreign
knowledge, an insult to cultural
dignity. In Schram's opinion, the
communists saw Marxism as the
way to modernize China, but
decided that this vehicle for
modernization had first to be
Sinified.
"Spontaneity was the dirtiest
of dirty words for Lenin,"
according to Dr. Schram. Stalin
had viewed egalitarianism as
reactionary. Mao, in contrast, has
relied heavily on the strength and
wisdom of the Chinese peasant.
Though Maoist spontaneity is a
"controlled spontaneity, guided
by the helmsman of the Chinese
revolution," the Long March and
Yenan period's values of
egalitarianism, austerity, and mass
participation are primary values in
Maoist China.
Mao believes, Dr. Schram told
his audience, that if you can
change men's thinking, you
change their objective nature.
Within the Marxian tradition, the
belief that ideas determine reality
and the emphasis on inner
transformation and human will
are something peculiar to Mao's
thought.
Whereas Lenin could write in
"What Is to be Done" that
"talented men are not born by
hundreds," and Stalin could hold

technicians as a group in high
favor, Mao has viewed with
suspicion, according to Dr.
Schram, anyone claiming greater
expertise than that possessed by
the masses.
Because of China's peculiar
nature, Mao felt, in Dr. Schram's
words, that "social transformation
would come faster than technical
transformation." Since much of
the Chinese communist party was
committed to the Soviet model of
hierarchical authority for

bureaucrats, exports, and party
members and of transformation
through mechanization, Mao
sought during the cultural
revolution to smash the party
apparatus and discredit it.
Dr. Schram pointed out that in
tlu> arrangements' being approved
at the ninth pariy congress, now
in progress, the communist party
is no longer in a permanently
privileged position, but is placed
"under the supervision of the
masses."
While finding that sometimes
Mao Tse-tung "makes Stalin look
like a modest man," Dr. Stuart R.
Schram found this aspect of
modern China rather
"depressing." So in his talk last
Thursday evening, Dr. Schram
chose to focus on the reciprocal
relationship in Maoist political
thought between cultural
revolution, which changes minds,
and social revolution, which
changes lives.
