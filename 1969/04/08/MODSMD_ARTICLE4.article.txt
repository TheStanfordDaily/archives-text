# Two Vigils Set To Mark Trustees' Meeting Today
## 
### CRAIG WILSON 
Two student vigils will mark what is
possibly the most important meeting in
the history of Stanford's Board of
Trustees.
Members of the SRI Coalition will
demonstrate both at the Board meeting
itself in San Francisco and in the Old
Union courtyard.
Both vigils, which were planned at
last Thursday's Coalition meeting in
Dinkelspiel Auditorium, will begin at
noon.
The purpose of the peaceful protests,
according to Coalition literature, is to
demonstrate to the trustees the degree
of community concern over the future

of Stanford Research Institute, and in
recognition of the fact "that many lives
are lost with each day that the war
continues, and the consequent urgency
of the Trustees' decision."
The Stanford vigil, according to the
Coalition, will consist of short speeches,
songs and open discussion groups.
A car pool will then leave for the
city. Picketing will be held outside the
Board's San Francisco office at 600
California St., where the Trustees will
be meeting.
Community Meeting
It was also announced that a
community meeting of the Coalition is
planned for Wednesday at 7:30 in
Dinkelspiel Auditorium.
The closed trustee meeting in San
Francisco will consider the demands
made last April 3 by the Coalition. The
demands call for "the immediate
cessation and future non-acceptance of
research at both Stanford and SRI in
the areas of chemical-biological warfare,
and counterinsurgency at home and
abroad." Demands also include
cessation and future non-acceptance of
"other research in support of the wars
against the peoples of Vietnam,
Thailand and Laos, classified research,
especially classified military research."
According to a sheet issued by the
coalition yesterday"the trustees may
well try to beat a tactical retreat by
instituting a moratorium on new CBW
(and possibly counterinsurgency)
research at their Tuesday meeting. A
moratorium on acceptance of new
contracts in these areas could pacify an
unaware University community. Yet the
war research goes on. In addition, a
moratorium might allow the trustees to
put off a final decision until Mid-May or
June, at which time they would be able
to operate in the normal Stanford
political vacuum.
Stop Research
"We feel simply that if the Stanford

trustees wish to join us in taking a first
step toward directing Stanford's
research to socially constructive work,
they must make a statement of moral
and political principle by stopping war
research immediately in the four areas
listed above. A moratorium does not
involve a moral stand of any sort.
The April 3 Coalition also included a
position paper on opposing severance or
sale of SRI. The Daily reported
yesterday that "informed sources
indicated that the SRI Committee's
report would urge severing ties between
the University and its affiliate."
In part the paper stated "Sale of SRI
would leave Stanford without legal
responsibility for the work performed at
the Institute, yet would not remove the
University's moral responsibility for
creating SRI, for accepting SRl's
war-related research over the years, and
for allowing SRI to continue this
research in the future.
A group calling itself the Concerned
Faculty on SRI also made itself known
Sunday night saying that "in the face of
growing campus concern and actions, a
group of concerned faculty met
informally last night to discuss the
implications of severance of SRI,
without enforceable restrictions, from
Stanford University.
"The concensus of the group was to
unite as an ad hoc committee to urge
faculty concern and involvement with
the ongoing SRI-related issues and
events."
According to the flyer a second
meeting of the Concerned Faculty on
SRI will be held Thursday evening at 8
p.m. in Tresidder Room 270. The
purpose of the meeting is the mutual
exchange of information and ideas
about the faculty role in the coming
weeks. It is hoped that faculty and
student representatives of the
President's SRI Committee will be
present.
