## Court OK's Home Smut 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP)-The Supreme
Court guaranteed Americans Monday
the right to read dirty books or look at
dirty movies in the privacy of their
homes.
"A state has no business telling a
man, sitting alone in his own house,
what books he may read or what films

he may watch," said Justice Thurgood
Marshall for the court.
The ruling, an important extension
of freedom of thought, forbids states to
make mere possession of obscene
material a crime—but leaves them free
to restrict public distribution.
Marshall said an Atlanta bachelor,
Robert Eli Stanley, sentenced to a year
in prison because he had three "stag"
films at home, was "asserting the right
to read or observe what he pleases—the
right to satisfy his intellectual and
emotional needs in the privacy of his
own home."
"Whatever may be the justifications
for other statutes regulating obscenity,"
Marshall said, "we do not think they
reach into the privacy of one's own
home."
• Political Repression
BERKELEY (AP)—The academic
senate of the University of California
approved Monday a motion charging the
Board of Regents, governor's office and
members of the legislature with
"political repression against the
university."
History professor Charles L.
Schwartz, who introduced the motion,
said it was the first step in defense of
academic freedom in the face of
political repression.
The motion was approved by 100
members of the Berkeley Division of the
University of California Academic
Senate as they met for the first time in
the spring quarter, which began last
week.
The motion stated: "Recent actions
by the Board of Regents, the governor's
office and some members of the State
Legslature . . . give clear evidence of
political repression against the
unversity."
• Artificial Heart Replaced
HOUSTON, Tex. (AP)—A human
heart was implanted Monday into the
chest of Haskell Karp after he had
survived 65 hours with a mechanical
device.
The 47-year-old Skokie, 111., printing
estimator was reported in satisfactory
condition after receiving the heart of a
Massachusetts woman in a 2%-hour
operation at St. Luke's Episcopal
Hospital.
"I'm confident he will respond," said
Dr. Denton A. Cooley, who had just
completed his 19th human heart
transplant.
The donor, Mrs. Barbara Ewan, 40,
died minutes after arriving on a
dramatic jet ambulance flight from
Lawrence, Mass.
Cooley said the eight-ounce plastic
and fabric device he implanted in Karp's
chest on an emergency and temporary
basis last Friday will allow persons to
live until a human donor is available.
"Now we can support the life of a
recipient until a donor can be
available," he told a news conference.
"It is available to temporize—to buy
time—until a transplant can be
performed."

• Hope For ithdraival
WASHINGTON (AP) —Secretary of
State William P. Rogers voiced hope
Monday for mutual U.S.-North
Vietnamese troop withdrawal this year
but ruled out a one-sided American
pullout now.
"We do have a plan which we think is
a fair and reasonable one for ending this
conflict," Rogers added. But again, he
avoided naming any peace date and
acknowledged "there isn't any magic
formula" for ending the war.
As to whether he had any realistic
hope of starting to bring Gls home in
1969 from the 540,000-man force in
Vietnam, Rogers said, "I would
certainly hope that there would be some
chance of mutual withdrawal of troops
this year."
But "we don't anticipate any
immediate withdrawal of troops"
without North Vietnamese agreement to
do likewise, he said. This still left open
the possibility for future U.S.
withdrawals based on a greater South
Vietnamese takeover of the fighting.
• Lindsay Criticizes War
NEW YORK (AP) —Mayor John V.
Lindsay, in his first public criticism of
the Nixon administration since the
President took office, said Monday that
too much is being spent on war and
weapons and not enough on the
problems of the cities.
He said the administration was
spending "billions in pursuit of dubious
ends, while urgent needs go unmet."
"It is time to ask," said Lindsay, a
Republican, "whether we should really
spend $6 billion on an antiballistic
missile system when the security of the
cities really depends on the chance for
safety and decency and dignity in their
neighborhoods.
"It is time to ask whether we must
continue to spent $30 billion every year
on a war in Vietnam which all sides
want to end."
He urged all Americans to begin to
speak out in support of a "new set of
priorities, which mobilizes our energies
behind the urgent work to be done."
•"I'ifrs Off Campus"
EAST LANSING, Mich. (AP)-A
small group of young people
demonstrated Monday at the Michigan
State University student services
building to protest campus recruiting by
the Oakland police department.
The demonstrators, mostly white,
numbered about 70 at one time, then
dwindled to around 30, witnesses said.
Shouts of "Oakland Pigs" and "No
More Brothers in Jail" apparently
protested the shooting death about a
year ago of Bobby Hutton, a member of
the militant Oakland Black Panthers.
Oakland police recruiters stopped
interviews when the demonstration
developed, but it was not immediately
known if they planned to resume.

•"I'ifrs Off Campus"
EAST LANSING, Mich. (AP)-A
small group of young people
demonstrated Monday at the Michigan
State University student services
building to protest campus recruiting by
the Oakland police department.
The demonstrators, mostly white,
numbered about 70 at one time, then
dwindled to around 30, witnesses said.
Shouts of "Oakland Pigs" and "No
More Brothers in Jail" apparently
protested the shooting death about a
year ago of Bobby Hutton, a member of
the militant Oakland Black Panthers.
Oakland police recruiters stopped
interviews when the demonstration
developed, but it was not immediately
known if they planned to resume.
WASHINGTON (AP)-The Supreme
Court guaranteed Americans Monday
the right to read dirty books or look at
dirty movies in the privacy of their
homes.
"A state has no business telling a
man, sitting alone in his own house,
what books he may read or what films

he may watch," said Justice Thurgood
Marshall for the court.
The ruling, an important extension
of freedom of thought, forbids states to
make mere possession of obscene
material a crime—but leaves them free
to restrict public distribution.
Marshall said an Atlanta bachelor,
Robert Eli Stanley, sentenced to a year
in prison because he had three "stag"
films at home, was "asserting the right
to read or observe what he pleases—the
right to satisfy his intellectual and
emotional needs in the privacy of his
own home."
"Whatever may be the justifications
for other statutes regulating obscenity,"
Marshall said, "we do not think they
reach into the privacy of one's own
home."
• Political Repression
BERKELEY (AP)—The academic
senate of the University of California
approved Monday a motion charging the
Board of Regents, governor's office and
members of the legislature with
"political repression against the
university."
History professor Charles L.
Schwartz, who introduced the motion,
said it was the first step in defense of
academic freedom in the face of
political repression.
The motion was approved by 100
members of the Berkeley Division of the
University of California Academic
Senate as they met for the first time in
the spring quarter, which began last
week.
The motion stated: "Recent actions
by the Board of Regents, the governor's
office and some members of the State
Legslature . . . give clear evidence of
political repression against the
unversity."
• Artificial Heart Replaced
HOUSTON, Tex. (AP)—A human
heart was implanted Monday into the
chest of Haskell Karp after he had
survived 65 hours with a mechanical
device.
The 47-year-old Skokie, 111., printing
estimator was reported in satisfactory
condition after receiving the heart of a
Massachusetts woman in a 2%-hour
operation at St. Luke's Episcopal
Hospital.
"I'm confident he will respond," said
Dr. Denton A. Cooley, who had just
completed his 19th human heart
transplant.
The donor, Mrs. Barbara Ewan, 40,
died minutes after arriving on a
dramatic jet ambulance flight from
Lawrence, Mass.
Cooley said the eight-ounce plastic
and fabric device he implanted in Karp's
chest on an emergency and temporary
basis last Friday will allow persons to
live until a human donor is available.
"Now we can support the life of a
recipient until a donor can be
available," he told a news conference.
"It is available to temporize—to buy
time—until a transplant can be
performed."

• Hope For ithdraival
WASHINGTON (AP) —Secretary of
State William P. Rogers voiced hope
Monday for mutual U.S.-North
Vietnamese troop withdrawal this year
but ruled out a one-sided American
pullout now.
"We do have a plan which we think is
a fair and reasonable one for ending this
conflict," Rogers added. But again, he
avoided naming any peace date and
acknowledged "there isn't any magic
formula" for ending the war.
As to whether he had any realistic
hope of starting to bring Gls home in
1969 from the 540,000-man force in
Vietnam, Rogers said, "I would
certainly hope that there would be some
chance of mutual withdrawal of troops
this year."
But "we don't anticipate any
immediate withdrawal of troops"
without North Vietnamese agreement to
do likewise, he said. This still left open
the possibility for future U.S.
withdrawals based on a greater South
Vietnamese takeover of the fighting.
• Lindsay Criticizes War
NEW YORK (AP) —Mayor John V.
Lindsay, in his first public criticism of
the Nixon administration since the
President took office, said Monday that
too much is being spent on war and
weapons and not enough on the
problems of the cities.
He said the administration was
spending "billions in pursuit of dubious
ends, while urgent needs go unmet."
"It is time to ask," said Lindsay, a
Republican, "whether we should really
spend $6 billion on an antiballistic
missile system when the security of the
cities really depends on the chance for
safety and decency and dignity in their
neighborhoods.
"It is time to ask whether we must
continue to spent $30 billion every year
on a war in Vietnam which all sides
want to end."
He urged all Americans to begin to

Lindsay, in his first public criticism of
the Nixon administration since the
President took office, said Monday that
too much is being spent on war and
weapons and not enough on the
problems of the cities.
He said the administration was
spending "billions in pursuit of dubious
ends, while urgent needs go unmet."
"It is time to ask," said Lindsay, a
Republican, "whether we should really
spend $6 billion on an antiballistic
missile system when the security of the
cities really depends on the chance for
safety and decency and dignity in their
neighborhoods.
"It is time to ask whether we must
continue to spent $30 billion every year
on a war in Vietnam which all sides
want to end."
He urged all Americans to begin to
speak out in support of a "new set of
priorities, which mobilizes our energies
behind the urgent work to be done."
•"I'ifrs Off Campus"
EAST LANSING, Mich. (AP)-A
small group of young people
demonstrated Monday at the Michigan
State University student services
building to protest campus recruiting by
the Oakland police department.
The demonstrators, mostly white,
numbered about 70 at one time, then
dwindled to around 30, witnesses said.
Shouts of "Oakland Pigs" and "No
More Brothers in Jail" apparently
protested the shooting death about a
year ago of Bobby Hutton, a member of
the militant Oakland Black Panthers.
Oakland police recruiters stopped
interviews when the demonstration
developed, but it was not immediately
known if they planned to resume.
WASHINGTON (AP)-The Supreme
Court guaranteed Americans Monday
the right to read dirty books or look at
dirty movies in the privacy of their
homes.
"A state has no business telling a
man, sitting alone in his own house,
what books he may read or what films

he may watch," said Justice Thurgood
Marshall for the court.
The ruling, an important extension
of freedom of thought, forbids states to
make mere possession of obscene
material a crime—but leaves them free
to restrict public distribution.
Marshall said an Atlanta bachelor,
Robert Eli Stanley, sentenced to a year
in prison because he had three "stag"
films at home, was "asserting the right
to read or observe what he pleases—the
right to satisfy his intellectual and
emotional needs in the privacy of his
own home."
"Whatever may be the justifications
for other statutes regulating obscenity,"
Marshall said, "we do not think they
reach into the privacy of one's own
home."
• Political Repression
BERKELEY (AP)—The academic
senate of the University of California
approved Monday a motion charging the
Board of Regents, governor's office and
members of the legislature with
"political repression against the
university."
History professor Charles L.
Schwartz, who introduced the motion,
said it was the first step in defense of
academic freedom in the face of
political repression.
The motion was approved by 100
members of the Berkeley Division of the
University of California Academic
Senate as they met for the first time in
the spring quarter, which began last
week.
The motion stated: "Recent actions
by the Board of Regents, the governor's
office and some members of the State
Legslature . . . give clear evidence of
political repression against the
unversity."
• Artificial Heart Replaced
HOUSTON, Tex. (AP)—A human
heart was implanted Monday into the
chest of Haskell Karp after he had
survived 65 hours with a mechanical
device.
The 47-year-old Skokie, 111., printing
estimator was reported in satisfactory
condition after receiving the heart of a
Massachusetts woman in a 2%-hour
operation at St. Luke's Episcopal
Hospital.
"I'm confident he will respond," said
Dr. Denton A. Cooley, who had just
completed his 19th human heart
transplant.
The donor, Mrs. Barbara Ewan, 40,
died minutes after arriving on a
dramatic jet ambulance flight from
Lawrence, Mass.
Cooley said the eight-ounce plastic
and fabric device he implanted in Karp's
chest on an emergency and temporary
basis last Friday will allow persons to
live until a human donor is available.
"Now we can support the life of a
recipient until a donor can be
available," he told a news conference.
"It is available to temporize—to buy
time—until a transplant can be
performed."

• Hope For ithdraival
WASHINGTON (AP) —Secretary of
State William P. Rogers voiced hope
Monday for mutual U.S.-North
Vietnamese troop withdrawal this year
but ruled out a one-sided American
pullout now.
"We do have a plan which we think is
a fair and reasonable one for ending this
conflict," Rogers added. But again, he
avoided naming any peace date and
acknowledged "there isn't any magic
formula" for ending the war.
As to whether he had any realistic
hope of starting to bring Gls home in
1969 from the 540,000-man force in
Vietnam, Rogers said, "I would
certainly hope that there would be some
chance of mutual withdrawal of troops
this year."
But "we don't anticipate any
immediate withdrawal of troops"
without North Vietnamese agreement to
do likewise, he said. This still left open
the possibility for future U.S.
withdrawals based on a greater South
Vietnamese takeover of the fighting.
