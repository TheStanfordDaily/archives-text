# More Housing

### 
In a classic display of slothfulness and
irresponsibility, the University
administration made it clear last week just
where its priorities lie.
We're referring to the decision made last
week that a short time limit and a number of
details that should have been foreseen make
it impossible for any new student housing to
be constructed for next year. The
administration staff had within its grasp a
plan that would provide space for 400
students, both undergraduates and graduates
by early next school year. But even though
the plan was being readied for presentation
to the trustees at their meeting today,
President Pitzer suddenly ruled last
Thursday that the plan was unworkable and
was to be shelved. The reasons: a few
contractual problems and some tie-ups over
University land usage.
This action seriously calls into question
Stanford's pretensions in advertising itself as
a residence university. It can be labeled
nothing short of a blatant display of bad
faith. The University staff took no action all
year, and then threw up its hands in defeat
as deadlines approached.
Administrators know as well as any
student that the dormitory system is already
overcrowded and uncomfortable. And, they
know that the student who decides to reject
the undesirable campus housing, instead
faces local landlords waiting eagerly to gouge

students with high rent for poor
accomodations. Yet, the only solution
offered for next year is additional squeezing
of the residence system to provide 200
additional undergraduate spaces. We
sincerely wonder if President Pitzer has
every stepped into the world of a Lagunita
or Roble single room inhabited by two
Stanford sardine-undergraduates.
While the adminstration promises to
crowd the additional 200 undergraduates
into the dormitories, it leaves graduate
students out in the cold. The just-arrived
graduate student, and especially the foreign
student, are thrust into an unfamiliar
environment and left almost alone to fend
for themselves. It is almost inconceivable
that the University can allow this situation
to continue another year with only a shrug
of its bureaucratic shoulders.
If the adminstration takes no further
action beyond the current non-solution, it
may as well publicly renounce its residence
university concept. It may as well also admit
that effective decision making for Stanford
has shifted to the cost analysts and amoral
accountants ahead of students' needs. A
crash building program is the only solution
to the mess that long inactivity has
produced. Stanford claims to be a residence
university; why doesn't it put its money
where its mouth is?

to the trustees at their meeting today,
President Pitzer suddenly ruled last
Thursday that the plan was unworkable and
was to be shelved. The reasons: a few
contractual problems and some tie-ups over
University land usage.
This action seriously calls into question
Stanford's pretensions in advertising itself as
a residence university. It can be labeled
nothing short of a blatant display of bad
faith. The University staff took no action all
year, and then threw up its hands in defeat
as deadlines approached.
Administrators know as well as any
student that the dormitory system is already
overcrowded and uncomfortable. And, they
know that the student who decides to reject
the undesirable campus housing, instead
faces local landlords waiting eagerly to gouge

students with high rent for poor
accomodations. Yet, the only solution
offered for next year is additional squeezing
of the residence system to provide 200
additional undergraduate spaces. We
sincerely wonder if President Pitzer has
every stepped into the world of a Lagunita
or Roble single room inhabited by two
Stanford sardine-undergraduates.
While the adminstration promises to
crowd the additional 200 undergraduates
into the dormitories, it leaves graduate
students out in the cold. The just-arrived
graduate student, and especially the foreign
student, are thrust into an unfamiliar
environment and left almost alone to fend
for themselves. It is almost inconceivable
that the University can allow this situation
to continue another year with only a shrug
of its bureaucratic shoulders.
If the adminstration takes no further
action beyond the current non-solution, it
may as well publicly renounce its residence
university concept. It may as well also admit
that effective decision making for Stanford
has shifted to the cost analysts and amoral
accountants ahead of students' needs. A
crash building program is the only solution
to the mess that long inactivity has
produced. Stanford claims to be a residence
university; why doesn't it put its money
where its mouth is?
