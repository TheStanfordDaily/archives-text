# Guest Column
## Generation In Search Of A Future 
### 
On Tuesday, March 4th, in the
Kresge Auditorium at the
Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, a group of scientists
assembled, with students and
others, to discuss the uses of
scientific knowledge.
There is nothing we might
print in these columns that could
be more urgent than the
extemporaneous speech, made
before that gathering by George
Wald, professor of biology at
Harvard and Novel Prize winner,
inder the title "A Generation in
Search of a Future." We therefore
quote from it here at length:
Wald's Speech
"All of you know that in the
last couple of years there has been
student unrest, breaking at times
into violence, in many parts of the
world: in England, Germany,
Italy, Spain, Mexico, Japan, and,
needless to say, many parts of this
country.
There has been a great deal of
discussion as to what it all means.
Perfectly clearly, it means
something different in Mexico
from what it does in France, and
something different in France
from what it does in Tokyo, and
something different in Tokyo
from what it does in this country.
Yet, unless we are to assume that
students have gone crazy all over
the world, or that they have just
decided that it's the thing to do, it
must have some common
meaning.
"I don't need to go so far
afield to look for that meaning. I
am a teacher, and at Harvard I
have a class of about three
hundred and fifty students—men
and women—most of them
freshmen and sophomores. Over
these past few years, I have felt
increasingly that something is
terribly wrong—and this year ever
so much more than last.
Something has gone sour, in
teaching and in learning. It's
almost as though there were a
widespread feeling that education
has become irrelevant.
"A lecture is much more of a
dialogue that many of you
probably realize. As you lecture,
you keep watching the faces, and
information keeps coming back to
you all the time. I begin to feel,
particularly this year, that I was
missing much of what was coming
back. I tried asking the students,
but they didn't or couldn't help
me very much.
Student Uneasiness
"But I think I know what's the
matter. I think that this whole
generation of students is beset
with a profound uneasiness, and I
don't think that they have yet
quite definedits source. I think I
understand the reasons for their
uneasiness even better than they
do. What is more, I share their
uneasiness.
"What's bothering those
students? Some of them tell you
it's the Vietnam war. I think the
Vietnam war is the most shameful
episode in the whole of American
history.

The concept of war crimes is
an American invention. We've
committed many war crimes in
Vietnam—but I'll tell you
something interesting about that.
We were committing war crimes in
World War 11, before the
Nuremberg trials were held and
the principle of war crimes was
stated.
The saturation bombing of
German cities was a war crime.
Dropping those atomic bombs on
Hiroshima and Nagasaki was a war
crime. If we had lost the war, it
might have been our leaders who
had to answer for such actions.
Gimmick To History
I've gone through all that
history lately, and I find that
there's a gimmick in it It isn't
written out, but I think we
established it be precedent. That
gimmick is that if one can allege
that one is repelling or retaliating
for an aggression, after that
everything goes.
"And, you see, we are living in
a world in which all wars and wars
of defense. All War Departments
are now Defense Departments.
This is all part of the double talk
of our time. The aggressor is
always on the other side. I
suppose this is why our Secretary
of State Dean Rusk went to such
pains to insist, as he still insists,
that in Vietnam we are repelling
an aggression. And if that's what
we are doing—so runs the
doctrine—everything goes. If the
concept of war crimes is ever to
mean anything, they will have to
be defined as categories of acts,
regardless of alleged provocation.
But that isn't so now.
"I think we've lost that war, as
a lot of other people think, too.
The Vietnamese have a secret
weapon. It's their willingness to
die beyond our willingness to kill.
In effect, they've been sayng,
You can kill us, but you'll have to
kill a lost of us; you may have to
kill all of us. And, thank heaven,
we are not yet ready to do that.
Symbols Gone Sour
"Yet we have come a long way
toward it—far enough to sicken
many Americans, far enough to
sicken even our fighting men. Far
enough so that our national
symbols have gone sour. How
many of you can sing about 'the
rockets' red glare, the bombs
bursting in air' without thinking,
Those are our bombs and our
rockets, bursting over South
Vietnamese villages? When those
words were written, we were a
people struggling for freedom
against oppression. Now we are
supporting open or thinly
disguised military dictatorships all
over the world, helping them to
control and repress peoples
struggling for their freedom.
"But that Vietnam war,
shameful and terrible as it is,
seems to me only an immediate
incident in a much larger and
more stubborn situation.
"Part of my trouble with
students is that almost all the

students I teach were born after
World War 11. Just after World
War 11, a series of new and
abnormal procedures came into
American life. We regarded them
at the time as temporary
aberrations. We thought we would
get back to normal American life
someday.
Procedures Remain
"But those procedures have
stayed with us now for more than
twenty years, and those students
of mine have never known
anything else. IXO
