## Open Letter To The Trustees 
### Denis Hayes 
Many people have urged me
not to attend this meeting. They
have no hope, and they want the
battle lines to be clean. 1 have not,
however, succumbed to a final
despair, and I have therefore
accepted your invitation. I must,
however, clearly explain my
purpose in attending.
I am not here today to analyze
with you the strategic
implications of alternative courses
of action. I have performed that
task at length these past two
weeks, with the University
Advisory Committee, with the
President of the University, with
the President of SRI, with the
Chairman of the SRI Board, and
with individual trustees. By now
you must all have a reasonably
clear sense of the probable
consequences of your actions.
Nor am I here today as a
delegate from a particular interest
group. For the past year I have
carefully avoided identification
with any organization whose
course of action I could not
determine.
Not As President
And I am not here as President
of the student body. I feel
confident that the statement I'm
about to make is indicative of the
feelings of the overwhelming
propo n d e r a nce of my
constituency. Nonetheless I am
not limiting myself to the hat of
"representative student leader,"
for the case I'm arguing is of
much broader concern than a
simple "student issue."
I am here as a young human
being, asking for a chance to live.
You read of the massive youth
mobilization against the Pentagon,
and of lesser battles in Oakland.
You watched with Walter
Cronkite as thousands of idealistic
youths marched with Kennedy
and McCarthy, and then pledged
themselves in Chicago to destroy
an unresponsive politcal system.
You have frequently heard me rail
against your legitimacy, and urge
you to seize the initiative with
regard to your own restructuring.
And last month several of you
witnessed more than a thousand
students roaring this same concern
from every corner of the largest
auditorium at Stanford.

You must have wondered what
it is all about.
Some people have been
offering you answers!
Degree-laden psychologists
have spun out half-baked theories
about castration sydromes and
Oedipai drives—but you sense,
correctly, that this cannot be the
whole answer.
You know that Vietnam is
undoubtedly a part of it, and the
draft, and the lack of a vote, and
the whole matter of generational
impotence—but again this does
not suffice to explain the total
phenomenon. What then is the
answer?
On March 4, in some
extemporaneous remarks at
M.1.T., George Wald (the Nobel
Prize-winning biologist from
Harvard) caught the real root of
the problem in a simple phrase.
"I think I know what is
bothering the students," Wald
said. "I think that what we are up
against is a generation that is by
no means sure that it has a
future . . . What is more, I share
their uneasiness."
Last week the prestigious
American Museum of Natural
Science launched a massive
multi-media examination of the

question: "Can Man Survive?"
The answer, needless to say, is
doubtful.
This is The Crux
This is the crux of the
problem That is why things are
wild, and even irrational. That is
why you are seen as YOU—not as
a part of US. That is why most of
the students in this university,
hope you will quash the death
work at SRI, and why we will act
to stop it ourselves if you refuse.
The motives of most of us are
not revolutionary; they are
traditional and simple: We want
to live. We want to have children,
and grandchildren. But we fear we
have no future.
"This is the way the world
ends, Not with a bang, but with a
whimper."
There is no need for me to
explain the crises of the world to
you. You steadfastly ignore them,
but you must know they're there.
Overpopulation, societal protein
deficiency, imminent famine and
plague. The twin spectors of
modern industrialism: ill-afforded
wastage and poisonous pollution.
The triple threat of our "defense
arsenal": chemical warfare,
biological warfare, and nuclear

warfare—any of which could wipe
out the species.
Over the past week we have
heard many quotations from the
twilight years of Dwight D.
Eisenhower's administration. I
should like, rather, to quote the
General shortly after his
assumption of office in 1953:
"This world in arms is not
spending money alone.
"It is spending the sweat of its
laborers, the genius of its
scientists, the hopes of its
children . . ."
That is my father's sweat you
are spending, my teachers' genius,
and my hope. A decision must be
made—right now —whether or not
to continue.
The stueients of Stanford, the
youth of the world, are asking
you to help us. IJelp us channel
the energies and resources of this
society in a different li'icction—a
constructive direction.
The decision is yours to make,
and you will be held accountable.
You can either entrench behind
your moat like a flock of 17th
century barons, or you can join
arms with us in the "societal
renewal" John Gardner has so
long advocated.
Join us!
