# Trustees Put Off CBW Research Other Demands Go Unanswered
## 
### CRAIG WILSON 
Stanford University Trustees
responded to one SRI Coalition demand
but made no decision on others at their
meeting in San Francisco yesterday.
The outcome sets the stage for
tonight's meeting in Dinkelspiel
Auditorium called by the Coalition for
7:30. Students are expected to decide
on tactical moves in light of demands
made last Thursday.
The Trustees asked the Board of
Directors of SRI not to make any new
contracts for research in Chemical and
Biological Warfare pending completion
of study of the relationship between the
two institutions.
The Trustees also voted to have
selected students representing divergent
opinion present their views to a
committee of the board for a hearing at
an unspecified date.
Original Demands
The original coalition demands called

for the "immediate cessation and future
non-acceptance of research at both
Stanford and SRI in the areas of
chemical-biological warfare, and
counterinsurgency at home and
abroad."
Demands also include cessation and
future non-acceptance of "other
research in support of the wars against
the people of Vietnam, Thailand and
Laos, classified research, especially
classified military research."
The action of the Trustees was
announced in a statement made to the
press by Chairman W. Parmer Fuller.
The statements said: "Pending
completion of study of the long term
relationship between Stanford
University and Stanford Research
Institute the Trustees request the Board
of Directors of SRI to direct its officers
not to make any new contracts for
research in Chemical or Biological
Warfare.
That this committee recommends to
the Board of Trustees that the Board
express its deep concern to arrive at a
fair and responsible resolution of the
issues placed before them by faculty
and students concerning the relationship
of the University and SRI, and further
that the Trustees, in their action, take
full account of the views of all
constituencies on technical and moral
issues involved and that the board take
vigorous actions to obtain those views.
That this committee recommends
that the SRI report, as a whole,
including any minority reports, should
be published and widely disseminated.
That selected representatives of
divergent positions should be invited to
present their views to a committee of

the Board. This session might be
published, broadcast, or televised on
closed circuit TV, but no votes should
be taken at this meeting. Further that
the hearing be held as soon as possible
after issuance of the SRI report."
Addresses Trustees
University President Kenneth S.
Pitzer opened yesterday's meeting
saying in part that "In a recent
memorandum I said that the SRI
question would constitute a 'once in a
decade' decision" (see complete
statement below).
"You are being asked through your

decision on SRI to say that our national
priorities are wrong—that we spend too
much on the military, on means to kill
people, and not enough on constructive
things, on helping ordinary people to
live.
"I hope that you will listen carefully
to student and faculty views on both
specific questions related to SRI and on
these general questions of confidence
and priorities. I think I am correct in
saying the great majority of the students
and faculty are concerned about the
points I have raised. I hope you can take

to student and faculty views on both
specific questions related to SRI and on
