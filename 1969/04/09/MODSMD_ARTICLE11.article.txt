The decree has come down from on
high. The Trustees have shown their token
appreciation of the concern of members of
the Stanford community about the
character of the University.
The Trustees have issued their press
release that will provide, for good or for ill,
the framework in which the University
must proceed in considering the fate of
Stanford Research Institute.
Whatever the elaborate governing
process of the University comes up with as
a solution to the SRI crisis and whatever
direct action people here at Stanford
engage in, it will be in the context
established by the Trustees' attitude
expressed yesterday.
The Trustees' public response to the
situation on campus was less than
satisfactory. The consideration given the
moral determination of a large group of
Stanford people was minimal. The
performance yesterday was a manifestation
of the Trustees' weak grasp of the issues at
stake and of the intensity of concern on
campus.
The news came in a press release and
Trustee President W. Parmer Fuller refused
to comment on the release to students
maintaining a vigil outside the San

Francisco meeting, except to say that press
release spoke for itself.
The existence of the press release
indicated that Stanford's government
continues to function in camera, behind
closed doors. Instead of free men whose
government is characterized by "open
covenants openly arrived at," we are
victims of closed, Star Chamber
procedures.
The Trustees' statement deliberately
ignored SRI counterinsurgency work,
Stanford projects relating to southeast
Asia, and Applied Electronics Laboratories
research. The focus of the statement was
on the highly emotional question of
chemical and biological warfare. Other
matters of political and moral relevance
were pushed out of the picture. We still
don't know publicly what the Trustees
think of counterinsurgency.
President Pitzer perceptively told the
Trustees: "You are being asked through
your decision on SRI to say that our
national priorities are wrongâ€”that we
spend too much on the military, on means
to kill people, and not enough on
constructive things, on helping ordinary
people to live."
The insufficiency of the Trustees'
answer makes us despair.
