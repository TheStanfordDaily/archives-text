# Letters To The Editor
## Coalition Has Done Homework, Too 
### 
Editor, THE DAILY:
This letter is in response to
Tom Dawson's column in the
Daily Monday, in which he
accuses some members of the SRI
Coalition of "reckless disregard
for due process." This phrase has
been applied to campus leftists on
many occasions, and I wish
to argue that its use has never
been justified. But I think that in
this case he is the one to "leap to
conclusions."
Tom says that "the (SRI
Study) Committee has worked
long and hard . . . studying the
problem intensely for six
months." That's nic?fe. Many SRI
Coalition members have been
studying the problem for several
years. He accuses the SRI
Coalition of wishing "to throw
away the report before it is out."
Out where? Several members of
the SRI Coalition sit on the
Committee, and have kept others
informed as to what is being
proposed. Furthermore, many of
us have read all the material which
has passed into the Committee's
hands, as it has been made public.
Has the Committee read our
research?
I think everybody should be
well aware that the SRI Coalition
is new only in name. For
sometime, a number of students
and faculty (as well as SRI
employees) have held strong
sympathies with the viewpoints
endorsed at the April 3d meeting.
In the process of forming a
coalition, these people seem to
have answered the main criticism
of their activities which the much
larger "liberal" segment has
advanced—that of tactics. But
these people, who number
considerably greater than twelve,
who have spent considerably
longer than six months studying
the problem, and who I suspect
have done considerably more
thorough research in certain areas,
have not had the benefit of being
officially deemed ''the
Committee." In short, power has
been withheld from them.
Thus the term "due process"
seems to be defined in terms of
who has the power. Because the
SRI Study Committee (and I do
not fault its efforts) has been
given this power, disagreement
with its decision is "disregard for
due process." (Of course, if the
Trustees override this decision,
this is not disregard for due
process. Check your definitions
and see if you can figure that
out.)
I close by pointing out that we
do not feel that we have found
"the ideal solution for SRI." It is
a messy problem, and many of us
in the SRI Coalition have
misgivings about the best way to
proceed. But Stanford played a
large role in the creation of SRI,
and we're not going to let the
University forget that.

• Oak Creek Apts.
Editor, THE DAILY:
I'm surprised that students
haven't commented—at least in
the Daily—on a new apartment
building opening soon on
Stanford land, the Oak Creek
Apts. at the south end of campus
near San Francisquito Creek. (It
ruins another lovely meadow and
creates new traffic problems on
Willow Road, but this might be
worthwhile if it were student
housing.) It began to be built
several months ago—some time
after last fall's hue and cry about
lack of housing for grad students.
But I understand it is very
high-priced housing (something
like $180-$300) and thus won't
help the shortage in student
housing. But it's odd that this has
occurred while we are told there
isn't room for more student
housing on campus at the
moment.
The other comment concerns
the lack of swimming facilities for
women staff members. Many
European countries are finding it
cuts down on illness and
absenteeism to provide facilities
which contribute to physical
fitness. Although the staff has
grown tremendously in recent
years, only one small pool at the
women's gym is available for all
the women on campus—students,
too. It's great except that it's so
crowded at the noon hour in nice
weather that it's rather like
Bayshore Freeway during rush
hour traffic. Any plans on the
drawing boards to meet this need?

• Break The Sod
Editor, THE DAILY:
In the report of President
Pitzer's discussion of issues, one
statement—there will be no
immediate housing because there
is no suitable land—seems to run
contrary to all common sense.
I realize that as a mere student
I am not expected to understand
the inner complexities of
administrative planning. The fact
remains, however, that in driving
from here to there around
campus, one is immediately struck
by one predominant feature—an
abundance of open green. We are
now told that long range
university plans will be violated if
any land is put to immediate use
for housing. The question left
unanswered is, what do these long
range plans propose?
Administrative values seem to
prefer cuts in the enrollment to
violation of those sacrosanct long
range plans. This philosophy of
conservation of grasslands is
reminiscent of one valiantly
opposed by Allan Ladd as Shane
in the classic, rancher vs
sodbuster, western of the same
name.
Perhaps the time has come to

bust some sod if "the Farm" isn't
to prove a misnomer afterall.

• Friedman Fallacy
Editor, THE DAILY:
Leo writes in The Arena of
April 4: "The situation is so bad
that a few years ago Milton
Friedman, on being invited to
come to Stanford as a visiting
professor, spent one evening with
the economics department and
decided not to come because he
felt that his ideas would not get a
fair hearing."
This is an old story with one
new twist. Previous versions did
not make the mistake of alleging
that Professor Friedman was
invited as a visitor. They reported

correctly that he was invited to
transfer from the University of
Chicago for keeps.
But the previous versions, like
this one, were wrong about
Professor Friedman's reasons for
declining our offer. Professor
Friedman put them to sleep with
his own explanation, which
appeared some years ago in the
Daily. It's there for you to read,

informed as to what is being
proposed. Furthermore, many of
us have read all the material which
has passed into the Committee's
hands, as it has been made public.
Has the Committee read our
research?
I think everybody should be
well aware that the SRI Coalition
is new only in name. For
sometime, a number of students
and faculty (as well as SRI
employees) have held strong
sympathies with the viewpoints
endorsed at the April 3d meeting.
In the process of forming a
coalition, these people seem to
have answered the main criticism
of their activities which the much
larger "liberal" segment has
advanced—that of tactics. But
these people, who number
considerably greater than twelve,
who have spent considerably
longer than six months studying
the problem, and who I suspect
have done considerably more
thorough research in certain areas,
have not had the benefit of being
officially deemed ''the
Committee." In short, power has
been withheld from them.
Thus the term "due process"
seems to be defined in terms of
who has the power. Because the
SRI Study Committee (and I do
not fault its efforts) has been
given this power, disagreement
with its decision is "disregard for
due process." (Of course, if the
Trustees override this decision,
this is not disregard for due
process. Check your definitions
and see if you can figure that
out.)
I close by pointing out that we
do not feel that we have found
"the ideal solution for SRI." It is
a messy problem, and many of us
in the SRI Coalition have
misgivings about the best way to
proceed. But Stanford played a
large role in the creation of SRI,

• Oak Creek Apts.
Editor, THE DAILY:
I'm surprised that students
haven't commented—at least in
the Daily—on a new apartment
building opening soon on
Stanford land, the Oak Creek
Apts. at the south end of campus
near San Francisquito Creek. (It
ruins another lovely meadow and
creates new traffic problems on
Willow Road, but this might be
worthwhile if it were student
housing.) It began to be built
several months ago—some time
after last fall's hue and cry about
lack of housing for grad students.
But I understand it is very
high-priced housing (something
like $180-$300) and thus won't
help the shortage in student
housing. But it's odd that this has
occurred while we are told there
isn't room for more student
housing on campus at the
moment.
The other comment concerns
the lack of swimming facilities for
women staff members. Many
European countries are finding it
cuts down on illness and
absenteeism to provide facilities
which contribute to physical
fitness. Although the staff has
grown tremendously in recent
years, only one small pool at the
women's gym is available for all
the women on campus—students,
too. It's great except that it's so
crowded at the noon hour in nice
weather that it's rather like
Bayshore Freeway during rush
hour traffic. Any plans on the
drawing boards to meet this need?

• Break The Sod
Editor, THE DAILY:
In the report of President
Pitzer's discussion of issues, one
statement—there will be no
immediate housing because there
is no suitable land—seems to run
contrary to all common sense.
I realize that as a mere student
I am not expected to understand
the inner complexities of
administrative planning. The fact
remains, however, that in driving
from here to there around
campus, one is immediately struck
by one predominant feature—an
abundance of open green. We are
now told that long range
university plans will be violated if
any land is put to immediate use
for housing. The question left
unanswered is, what do these long
range plans propose?
Administrative values seem to
prefer cuts in the enrollment to
violation of those sacrosanct long
range plans. This philosophy of
conservation of grasslands is
reminiscent of one valiantly
opposed by Allan Ladd as Shane
in the classic, rancher vs
sodbuster, western of the same
name.
Perhaps the time has come to

bust some sod if "the Farm" isn't

that a few years ago Milton

have not had the benefit of being
officially deemed ''the
Committee." In short, power has
been withheld from them.
Thus the term "due process"
seems to be defined in terms of
who has the power. Because the
SRI Study Committee (and I do
not fault its efforts) has been
given this power, disagreement
with its decision is "disregard for
due process." (Of course, if the
Trustees override this decision,
this is not disregard for due
process. Check your definitions
and see if you can figure that
out.)
I close by pointing out that we
do not feel that we have found
"the ideal solution for SRI." It is
a messy problem, and many of us
in the SRI Coalition have
misgivings about the best way to
proceed. But Stanford played a
large role in the creation of SRI,
and we're not going to let the
University forget that.

• Oak Creek Apts.
Editor, THE DAILY:
I'm surprised that students
haven't commented—at least in
the Daily—on a new apartment
building opening soon on
Stanford land, the Oak Creek
Apts. at the south end of campus
near San Francisquito Creek. (It
ruins another lovely meadow and
creates new traffic problems on
Willow Road, but this might be
worthwhile if it were student
housing.) It began to be built
several months ago—some time
after last fall's hue and cry about
lack of housing for grad students.
But I understand it is very
high-priced housing (something
like $180-$300) and thus won't
help the shortage in student
housing. But it's odd that this has
occurred while we are told there
isn't room for more student
housing on campus at the
moment.
The other comment concerns
the lack of swimming facilities for
women staff members. Many
European countries are finding it
cuts down on illness and
absenteeism to provide facilities
which contribute to physical
fitness. Although the staff has
grown tremendously in recent
years, only one small pool at the
women's gym is available for all
the women on campus—students,
too. It's great except that it's so
crowded at the noon hour in nice
weather that it's rather like
Bayshore Freeway during rush
hour traffic. Any plans on the
drawing boards to meet this need?

• Break The Sod
Editor, THE DAILY:
In the report of President
Pitzer's discussion of issues, one
statement—there will be no
immediate housing because there
is no suitable land—seems to run
contrary to all common sense.
I realize that as a mere student
I am not expected to understand
the inner complexities of
administrative planning. The fact
remains, however, that in driving
from here to there around
campus, one is immediately struck
by one predominant feature—an
abundance of open green. We are
now told that long range
university plans will be violated if
any land is put to immediate use
for housing. The question left
unanswered is, what do these long
range plans propose?
Administrative values seem to
prefer cuts in the enrollment to
violation of those sacrosanct long
range plans. This philosophy of
conservation of grasslands is
reminiscent of one valiantly
opposed by Allan Ladd as Shane
in the classic, rancher vs
sodbuster, western of the same
name.
Perhaps the time has come to

bust some sod if "the Farm" isn't
to prove a misnomer afterall.

• Friedman Fallacy
Editor, THE DAILY:
Leo writes in The Arena of
April 4: "The situation is so bad
that a few years ago Milton
Friedman, on being invited to
come to Stanford as a visiting
professor, spent one evening with
the economics department and
decided not to come because he
felt that his ideas would not get a
fair hearing."
This is an old story with one
new twist. Previous versions did
not make the mistake of alleging
that Professor Friedman was
invited as a visitor. They reported

correctly that he was invited to
transfer from the University of
Chicago for keeps.
But the previous versions, like
this one, were wrong about
Professor Friedman's reasons for
declining our offer. Professor
Friedman put them to sleep with
his own explanation, which
appeared some years ago in the
Daily. It's there for you to read,
Leo.
E.S. Shan
Professor of Economics
Editor, THE DAILY:
This letter is in response to
Tom Dawson's column in the
Daily Monday, in which he
accuses some members of the SRI
Coalition of "reckless disregard
for due process." This phrase has
been applied to campus leftists on
many occasions, and I wish
to argue that its use has never
been justified. But I think that in
this case he is the one to "leap to
conclusions."
Tom says that "the (SRI
Study) Committee has worked
long and hard . . . studying the
problem intensely for six
months." That's nic?fe. Many SRI
Coalition members have been
studying the problem for several
years. He accuses the SRI
Coalition of wishing "to throw
away the report before it is out."
Out where? Several members of
the SRI Coalition sit on the
Committee, and have kept others
informed as to what is being
proposed. Furthermore, many of
us have read all the material which
has passed into the Committee's
hands, as it has been made public.
Has the Committee read our
research?
I think everybody should be
well aware that the SRI Coalition
is new only in name. For
sometime, a number of students
and faculty (as well as SRI
employees) have held strong
sympathies with the viewpoints
endorsed at the April 3d meeting.
In the process of forming a
coalition, these people seem to
have answered the main criticism
of their activities which the much
larger "liberal" segment has
advanced—that of tactics. But
these people, who number
considerably greater than twelve,
who have spent considerably
longer than six months studying
the problem, and who I suspect
have done considerably more
thorough research in certain areas,
have not had the benefit of being
officially deemed ''the
Committee." In short, power has
been withheld from them.
Thus the term "due process"
