# Conspiracy Of One
## The 						Smothered Brothers 
### Daniel Snell 
In a telegram dated March 27
Columbia Broadcasting System's
president for television Robert
Wood told Tom Smothers,
"You are not free to use the
Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour
as a device to 'push for new
standards.' If you cannot comply
with our standards—whether or
not you approve of them—the
Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour
cannot appear on CBS."
And the executive cancelled
the moderately popular program
which in former weeks had tried
to air songstress Joan Baez
dedicating a song to her husband,
former Stanford student body
president David Harris, saying that
he was soon going to jail for his
resistance to the draft.
The CBS censors held the
show, however, and a rerun was
shown in its place.
This was the culmination of a
long series of censorships of the
program, which from time to time
have prompted Tom and Dick
Smothers to complain publicly
about it.
Questionable Practices
The tone of the show was far
from consistently leftist, but one
came to know after a couple of
shows that neither brother too
much liked the war in Vietnam

and feels that American society
perpetrates some questionable
practices on its citizens and the
rest of the world.
And of course there was
dancing and singing and humor
and other "American"
entertainment. But a scheduled
satire of "the sermonette"
religious lectures on television by
comedian David Steinberg
scheduled for April 13 was
scrapped, with the following
bluster from Wood:
"At the very least . . . a
monologue which in our opinion
would be considered to be
irreverent and offensive by a large
segment of our audience and,
therefore, unacceptable even if
this were not the week of the
Eisenhower funeral rites and even
if Sunday were not Easter
Sunday."
CBS complained of mixups in
getting tapes of the show for
censor review, but that is an
obvious begging of the question.
Earlier Tom Smothers had said
that he and his brother wished to
stay on the air and fight with the
censors in hopes of altering the
network's policies on what was
acceptable.
It is good to remember that in
this case we are not dealing with

anyone's exposing himself, and so
presumably we cannot look
forward to rallies in Miami
supporting CBS' action. And of
course that action was in the
context of the broadcasting
industry, surely one of the more
mediocre syndromes to have being
in our society.
But barring these
qualifications, the message seems
remarkably clear: that even if you
are brilliant and talented —even if
you are popular—political
oppression, whether exercised by
the government itself or the
corporate extensions of the ruling
structure, will get you in the end.
Even when you are trying
diligently to "work within the
system "
Many Stanford students see
their futures much as Tommie and
Dickie saw theirs. They are to be
the changers of standards, the
liberalizers and humanizers and
the spreaders of light where there
is darkness.
And one may idly still believe
that he can find a university or a
corporation or even—is it
possible?—a church that will
tolerate and support him, he will
find himself remarkably wrong.
Tommie and Dickie may be
picked up by another network.

But few Stanford graduates bent
on social change will be so
profitable as the brothers
Smothers to their employers.
Czech Vote
CBS' decision is not at all as
repressive as the recent vote of the
Czech parliament to support
whatever measures are needed to
insure "unconditional observance
of the law." The parliament in
effect has invited three Russian
divisions to take positions in
Czechoslovakia. And CBS has only
told the television comedians they
cannot have people on their show
dedicating songs to convicted
criminals who have broken the
laws of the state.
But let us now blindly believe
that the latter does not bespeak
the same attitude toward values
that differ from the values of the
society as the former.
The alternatives to melding
into the society and being forced
into conforming to its values are
only dimly sketched in most
Stanford students' minds. But if
one is to be honest about what
one thinks, one has got to work to
fill those sketches in, to give them
flesh.
