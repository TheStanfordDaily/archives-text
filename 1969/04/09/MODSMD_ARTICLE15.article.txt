# Frankly Speaking
## Separatism-Dignity Without Purpose 
### David Frank 
Black-white relationships have
now evolved or regressed to the
point where classes in a course
whose alleged purpose was to
foster interracial understanding
are now totally segregated, where
many whites now uncritically
accept the analysis offered by the
Panthers and like groups.
The days of reasonable
dialogue and give and take, of
recognizing the legitimacy and
sincerity of the other fellow's

viewpoint are now passe.
Alienation, heroic and profound
isolation, have replaced
cooperation and mutual respect.
A good, if frightening example of
the depths to which we have
plummeted is discovered in Leßoi
Jones' response to a Village Voice
query as to his feelings regarding
civil rights' martyrs Andy
Goodman and Mickey Schwerner,
"Those boys were just
artifacts ... If they want to
assuage their leaking consciences,
that's their business. I won't
mourn them. I have my own dead
to mourn for."
No act of will, not even the
ultimate sacrifice of giving one's
life, is sufficient to remove a
white man from the Inferno to
which Jones has consigned us all.
Many people would say I
should not write this column. The
view that only black people can
adequately talk to and about
black people now being in vogue,
my ideas will undoubtedly be
dismissed by some as sheer
nonsense. But I feel that to sit
back and acquiesce in the
perpetration of myths by black
and white radicals is to hasten and
render inevitable the process that
seems to be making of America
two totally separate and unequal
societies.
Radical Contradictions
Many serious contradictions
crop up in the radical attitudes
toward the race crisis. One acute
irony in New Left dogma is the
castigation of liberals for being
elitist-oriented and fearing the
"unbridled masses," while holding
to the position that the races are
irreconcilably split.
For this pessimism (this
attitude that separatism is
desirable because whites cannot
be educated and lack the potential
to act intelligently), which is
inbred in many radicals, is
considered an indication of
decadence and contempt when
found among those of the
Establishment.
Liberals will work for a Carl
Stokes or a Tom Bradley with the
hope (perhaps wishful thinking)
that such men, dedicated to social
justice for all and abundantly
qualified to carry the public trust,
can, by disproving white
stereotypes, make living together a
little easier. This is not to
overstate the impact of one man
(though one man with conscience
and courage can indeed be an
enlightening majority) nor is it to
underestimate the power and
brutality to übiquitous white
racism It is however the question
the dubious New Left
generalization that radicals place
more faith in the people than do
liberals.
Blacks Know Best
A more blatant and fascinating
hypocrisy is the blanket
statement, designed to end once
and for all the disturbing
hindrances of logic, discourse, and
criticism, that only blacks know
what's good for blacks. This
statement deserves the utmost
scrutiny; it is an understandable
indulgence after years of
frustration, guinea-pig duty and
inhumane co-optation. The
hypocrisy involved is in coupling
this statement with the further
one that the Black Panther Party
program should be advocated and
enacted, intact, by all thinking
people.
The radicals cannot have it
both ways. If the Panthers are to
be regarded as the true saviors
then the overwhelming majority
of the black community is to be
written off as misguided.
Conversely, if one seeks answers
from the community, he winds up

with suggestions strangely
dissimilar from those offered with
monotonous consistency in White
Plaza.
Leftists are able to foster these
two inharmonious theories in
concert by presenting the
university as a microcosm of
society—by representing the
voices of irresponsibility
saturating the air here as the
unified voice of a united people.
The retort to my line of
reasoning would probably be that
since most blacks have been
co-opted and whitened (in
outlook if not in physical
characteristics) some blacks (i.e.
those who have withstood the
alluring pressures of assimilation)
should be presumed to speak for
all blacks.
I do not doubt for a minute
the tragic extent to which an
insufferable white majority has
inflicted its values on the
minority, has caused, knowingly
and unknowingly, black people to
be ashamed rather than proud of
their heritage, and consequently
to often act against their own best
interests. Malcolm X, Cleaver, and
others have poignantly related the
physic toll which living in an alien
environment inflicts on one's
person
Yet can it be believed that the
smothering effects of white
society have been felt by only
some blacks? I think not. Just as
some have been co-opted and
intimidated, others have been
rendered nihilistic and irrational.
As the former meekly go along to
get along, so do the latter seek to
thwart progress at every turn. This
is a touchy subject and I do not
relish describing it. Yet I object to
the claim of militants that the
tentacles of this monster white
society have strangled others
while leaving them strangely
sensible.
King's Death
A further inconsistency is, like
many others, understandable but
nevertheless regrettable. The
initial looting and burning
following Dr. King's death must
be put in perspective. The sense of
loss and rootlessness, of the
futility of placing'any confidence
whatsoever in America I can only
imagine. A voice of love and
reason had been stilled by hate
and irrationality.
That in the anger over his
murder many would resort to
rioting should not be surprising.
One could at the same time
however realize that Dr. King
would have been distraught by
such developments, taken more or
less in his behalf.
What I find impossible to
condone is the thesis, increasingly
promulgated by prophets of
despair that King's death signalled
the symbolic end to non-violence,
that this mindless act should
convince those true believers who
clung to foolish dreams. Yet if Dr.
King's death has significant
meaning, it is because his life has
significant meaning. And it is
undeniably true that his life
exemplified, above all else,
non-violence and the divine spark
in man. Those distressed by his
death (and this should include all
decent people) can hardly find his
beautiful philosophy so
comfortably disposable because of
the act of a sick man.
It seems more reasonable to
conclude that persons now using
the murder as a rationale for
nihilism, for individual and group
behavior unbounded by any
standards except self-expression,
never felt much compassion for
Dr. King in the first place.
Indeed during his life King was
denounced by many militants as a

naive visionary. They could not
stomach his appeals for spiritual
and material benefits—to them he
was begging, being a "good
nigger." Many see the militants as
having more guts—their distaste
for compromise as being
tantamount to unswerving
devotion.
But a more realistic appraisal
of black extremists is put forth by
Irving Howe. Describing Malcolm
X (an inaccurate portrayal of the
Malcolm emerging after his
African pilgrimage, but a perfect
assessment of a Cleaver or a
Leßoi Jones), he says,
"intransigent in words and
nihilistic in reality, (he) never
invoked the possibility or
temptations of immediate
struggle; he never posed the
problems, confusions, and risks of
maneuver, compromise, retreat.
Brilliantly (he) spoke for a
rejection so complete it
transformed him into an apolitical
spectator, or in the language of his
admirers a cop-out."
It is less painfully aggravating
to be a Cleaver discipie than a
King disciple or a Julian Bond or
Carl Stokes supporter. Those
favoring programmatic approaches
are deemed to be humble
recipients of piecemeal,
camouflage solutions, of handouts
which only scratch the surface.
The nonrevolutionary road of
legislation and incrementalism, of
dealing in moral relatives rather
than absolutes is not a very
satisfying one. One must possess
the patience to realize that
something is better than nothing,
that a great journey begins with a
single step.
The prospects for a coalition
between blacks and liberals
achieving immediate substantive
gains on a national scale are bleak.
Organizations like the Urban
Coalition are making a noble
attempt to educate whites plagued
by animosity or indifferences.
Yet life in the ghettoes remains
hell. To fight for men and
programs which will make life
more bearable is not to achieve
paradise, but it is to grapple with
a sorry reality.
The role of the militants seems
to be to engage in categorical
denunciations of the "Power
Structure" (monolithically
conceived), while being curiously
freed from the responsibility to
suggest viable solutions. Howe is
right. Jones et. al. form a unique
bond with the status quo. They
give vent to rage, while, much to
the delight of a do-nothing
m i d d 1 e-class, conveniently
ignoring political and social
reality.
The light at the end of the
tunnel is equitable conditions for
blacks; perhaps some day
harmonious race relations, but
more crucially equality of
opportunity to develop as free
people right now.
This light is perceived dimly if
at all, and the temptation to blow
up the tunnel is great. Those who
resist this urge are not necessarily
sell-outs; rather, many of them are
decent people who have braved a
climate of hate to follow a road
which can lead to justice. The
detours on this road are numerous
and discouraging, but they
needn't be fatal. Unhappily the
only alternative is a blind alley of
hostility and destruction. Racial
pride and solidarity may be gained
on both roads—but dignity with a
purpose is available only on the
first.
"They think their way is the
only way," said Gene Washington.
Perhaps it is not even the best
way.
