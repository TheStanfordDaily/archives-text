# A-Phi-0 Announces Spring Rush Plans
## 
### 
Alpha Phi Omega, Stanford's
National Service Fraternity,
announces its spring quarter rush
meeting for this Sunday, April 13,
at three in the afternoon in
Tresidder Small Lounge. All
Stanford men are welcome, and
the dress will be quad clothes.
The purpose of the meeting is
for interested men to learn more
about the goals and service
program of A-Phi-O, and to meet

the brothers in the fraternity.
Alpha Phi Omega has been
serving the Stanford community
for more than forty years, which
is something of a record for
campus groups. It is the only
service fraternity on campus.
There are no residence restrictions
for membership: members live in
social fratenities, in campus
residences, or off campus. A-Phi-0
does not have a house, but instead
they work from an office in the
old Alvarado House.
The goals of Alpha Phi Omega
are leadership, friendship, and
service. The fraternity believes
that the best possible service can
be achieved by these ideals and
strives to have a diverse and
flexible service program.
Every quarter it holds a book
exchange, providing a means for
students to buy and sell used
books at reasonable prices. Also it
holds a quarterly bicycle
registration, which the Stanford
Police are unable to do due to a
manpower shortage. Much of its
service program is connected with
the scouting movement, including
the sponsorship of a scout troop
at the Stanford Children's
Convalescent Home.
