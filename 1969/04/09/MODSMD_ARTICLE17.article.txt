# 'Battle Of Algiers' Follows Ugly, Beautiful Struggle
## 
### ARTHUR RISENSEN 
Dr. Norman Bethune is the
only caucasian whose grave Mao
Tse Tung visits. Bethune was a
Canadian doctor who visited the
Soviet Union in the twenties,
fought in Spain, and died of blood
poisoning treating Chinese
revolutionary troops.
Bethune wrote to a friend
about post-revolutionary Russia
and said that like birth, revolution
is very ugly and very beautiful.
Revolution is also very violent and
very grand.
The Battle of Algiers recreates
the early stages of the Algerian
liberation movement, and it is a
terrifying film. It is also a
magnificant film. Even amonst the
works of and Pudovkin
there is nothing like it, for The
Battle of Algiers convinces you
that it's a documentary. The
quality of the photography fools
you. Director Gillo Pontecorvo
used fast film and available light
whenever possible, and there are
only a few scenes that show that
they were lit. The editing follows
the content, and does not seem to
shape the film, the way
commercial or good documentary

editing juxtaposes scenes of ideas.
But there isn't a foot of
documentary film in it. There are
no really big name actors, and the
film doesn't even concentrate on
any of the major historical figures
of the movement.
Petty Thief
It is the story of a movement,
but significantly, follows one
man, a petty thief named Ali la
Pointe from recruitment in a
French prison in Algiers through
the FLN to his extermination by
French paratroopers. Pontecorvo
doesn't show every step of his life
or even all the changes he goes
through. At one time Ali la Pointe
is at one place, later in the film he
is at another. It is almost like
watching one of Fanon's case
studies in The Wretched of the
Earth.
To us, in our well brought-up
tradition, Ali is not a hero. His
special talent is for terrorism, that
least sanctionable. and often most
attractive kind of political act.
While the real Ali became
important in the FLN, he didn't
play a central role. Yet he is the
center of the film, and it is still
not a film about individuals.

Pontecorvo understands a mass
movement and what a movement
means to those in it.
Paratroops
An American director, Mark
Robeson, did a film about the
Algerian revolt called The Lost
Command, taken from Jean
Larteguy's novels of the French
Tenth Colonial Paratrooper
Regiment, The Centurions and
The Praetorians. These novels, and
the film based on them, denied
the importance of the movement
to emphasize individuals.
Larleguy, an "Algerie-Francaise"
journalist who loved the
paratroopers as if he were one of
them, didn't understand the
Vietnamese who kicked the
French out of Indo-China or the
Arabs who dislodged them from
Algeria.
To Larteguy, the enemies of
Western colonialism were ants,
strong by virtue of numbers, and
perhaps with some justice on their
side due to French inefficiency.
Pontecorvo, an Italian leftist,
knew what made the revolution
succeed. He saw it as the popular
movement it was, and filmed it
that way.

the importance of the movement
to emphasize individuals.
Larleguy, an "Algerie-Francaise"
journalist who loved the
paratroopers as if he were one of
them, didn't understand the
Vietnamese who kicked the
French out of Indo-China or the
Arabs who dislodged them from
Algeria.
To Larteguy, the enemies of
Western colonialism were ants,
strong by virtue of numbers, and
perhaps with some justice on their
side due to French inefficiency.
Pontecorvo, an Italian leftist,
knew what made the revolution
succeed. He saw it as the popular
movement it was, and filmed it
that way.
Dr. Norman Bethune is the
only caucasian whose grave Mao
Tse Tung visits. Bethune was a
Canadian doctor who visited the
Soviet Union in the twenties,
fought in Spain, and died of blood
poisoning treating Chinese
revolutionary troops.
Bethune wrote to a friend
about post-revolutionary Russia
and said that like birth, revolution
is very ugly and very beautiful.
Revolution is also very violent and
very grand.
The Battle of Algiers recreates
the early stages of the Algerian
liberation movement, and it is a
terrifying film. It is also a
magnificant film. Even amonst the
works of and Pudovkin
there is nothing like it, for The
Battle of Algiers convinces you
that it's a documentary. The
quality of the photography fools
you. Director Gillo Pontecorvo
used fast film and available light
whenever possible, and there are
only a few scenes that show that
they were lit. The editing follows
the content, and does not seem to
shape the film, the way
commercial or good documentary

editing juxtaposes scenes of ideas.
But there isn't a foot of
documentary film in it. There are
no really big name actors, and the
film doesn't even concentrate on
any of the major historical figures
of the movement.
Petty Thief
It is the story of a movement,
but significantly, follows one
man, a petty thief named Ali la
Pointe from recruitment in a
French prison in Algiers through
the FLN to his extermination by
French paratroopers. Pontecorvo
doesn't show every step of his life
or even all the changes he goes
through. At one time Ali la Pointe
is at one place, later in the film he
is at another. It is almost like
watching one of Fanon's case
studies in The Wretched of the
Earth.
To us, in our well brought-up
tradition, Ali is not a hero. His
special talent is for terrorism, that
least sanctionable. and often most
attractive kind of political act.
While the real Ali became
important in the FLN, he didn't
play a central role. Yet he is the
center of the film, and it is still
not a film about individuals.

Pontecorvo understands a mass
movement and what a movement
means to those in it.
Paratroops
An American director, Mark
Robeson, did a film about the
Algerian revolt called The Lost
Command, taken from Jean
Larteguy's novels of the French
Tenth Colonial Paratrooper
Regiment, The Centurions and
The Praetorians. These novels, and
the film based on them, denied
the importance of the movement
to emphasize individuals.
