## Metcalf To Speak 
### 
Senator Lee Metcalf, Montana
Democrat, will deliver the 1969
Distinguished Alumnus Lecture at
Stanford today.
His talk on "Conservation in a
Dynamic and Evolving Society" is
scheduled for 7:45 p.m. in Bishop
Auditorium of the Graduate
School of Business. It is open to
the public free of charge.
A 1936 Stanford graduate, he
has been cited for "distinguished
service to conservation" by five
national groupsâ€”the National
Wildlife Federation, National
Parks Association, Izaac Walton
League of America, Wilderness
Society, and the Wildlife
Management Institute.
A director of the U.S.
Migratory Bird Conservation
Commission, Sen. Metcalf serves
on the Interior and Insular Affairs
and Government Operations
Committees.
He co-sponsored the Wilderness
Act, which protects by law areas

that previously were covered only
by administrative order, and has
worked for significant additions
to the National Park system.
He also has co-sponsored
legislation to inventory outdoor
recreation resources and needs,
step up the federally-aided drive
for clean water, start cooperative
federal-state programs for clean
air, to expand water resources
research, and provide federal aid
for comprehensive water resources
planning.
He helped write the National
Defense Education Act and
proposed legislation which later
led to formation of the Job Corps.
In 1965, he backed the efforts of
the Stanford chapter of Sigma Chi
to combat alleged discriminatory
practices by the national
fraternity.
