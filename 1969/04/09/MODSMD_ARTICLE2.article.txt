# Separate Vigils Attract Small Student Turnouts
## 
### BARBARA HYLAND 
Businessmen responded with stares
and occasionally arguments as they
passed by the 40 Stanford students
peacefully demonstrating outside the
Pacific Mutual Building in San Francisco
where the Trustees were meeting.
Attracted by a bright flag and picket
signs, curious onlookers often stopped
on the street corner while students
circled the front doors. The activity of
news media also attracted attention.
There was some singing and a bullhorn
was used to explain the vigil.
As onlookers read the placards like
"Get Stanford Out of S.E. Asia" and
"Nerve Gas Stinks," students
approached them and tried to present
the issues concerning Stanford and the
Stanford Research Institute (SRI).
The responses were varied and often
not encouraging. One businessman
asked about SDS and muttered
something about destruction of the
United States and passed on. Others
commented on the beards and bare feet.
One man laughed when he read
"Stop Stanford's Germ Warfare" on a
picket sign. A student replied that
biochemical warfare was not a laughing
matter. The man grinned and said, "I
was not laughing at that. I was referring
to the unbathed circumstances."
Some of the more concerned
businesmen treated students with a

paternal, "what's a nice kid like you
doing here" attitude. One believed that
students were being misled by
Communists.
It seemed that the elderly people
were very interested in the students.
However sympathetic they were to
student goals, they nevertheless felt that
their time for involvement had passed.
One man agreed fervently that "money
rules everything," but said that this had
always been the case and that it was
impossible to change the world.
One shaky, old man with a cane and
a German accent confided that he was
more than 100 years old. His view of
the world was that "crime is the biggest
problem today." On being questioned if
the criminal was the student or the
trustee, he explained, with a knowing
nod, "It's all one in the same soup in
the same pancake."
The junior executive-secretary
contingent of bystanders seemed
bemused by the demonstration. One girl
said that it was "groovy" having
something exciting going on down in
the financial district.
Morale was bolstered when any
supporters passed by. When a bus of
draftees drove past and a few gave the
victory sign, spirits rose. Since there was
no contact with the Trustees who sat
upstairs, the predominant mood of the
picketers was that of frustration. To
many the vigil seemed futile.
At the campus vigil in the old union
courtyard about 100 students gathered
for singing, speeches and discussion
under sunny skies and freshcut grass.
Students began drifting away shortly
after car pools left for San Francisco.
After that less than 20 students
remained until the conclusion of the
vigil.
The meeting seemed low key but

much of what was said was summed up
in a short song which opened the
proceedings. The lyrics went:
It isn't nice to block the doorway
It isn't nice to go to jail
There are nicer ways to do it
But the nice ways always fail . . .
