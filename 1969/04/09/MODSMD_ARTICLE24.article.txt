# Computerized Languages?
## 
### 
Under the direction of
Professor Joseph Van Campen,
the Department of Slavic
Languages has developed a
pioneering program in teaching
Russian by computer.
The experiment has aroused
wide interest, and there are
questions as to its validity both
pedagogically and economically.
Is it feasible and desirable to
apply computer techniques to the
teaching of other foreign
languages?
In order to discuss this
problem, the Committee on
Foreign Languages at Stanford has
organized a symposium which will
be held at Ventura Hall on
Wednesday, April 9 at 4:lft p.m.
The members of the panel are
Professors Van Campen, Hilgard
(Psychology), Juilland (French),
Kao (Asian Languages), Lohnes

(German) and Pulitzer (Education
and Romance Linguistics), and
Peterson (Spanish and Port).
After initial statements by the
panel members, general
participation in the discussion is
invited. The meeting is open to
faculty members and graduate
students.
Those wishing to see the
laboratory in operation are
welcome from 3:00 p.m. to 4:00
p.m. They will have an
opportunity to see students using
the machines. Those wishing to
try them out personally may do
so after the symposium.
The aim of the meetings which
the Committee on Foreign
Languages at Stanford plans to
sponsor is not to promote any
particular viewpoint but to
provide a forum at which broad
questions covering the whole
range of foreign language
instruction and research may be
discussed.
The meetings will concern
themselves not only with language
study per se, but with the vast
field of interests which should
properly characterize "language"
departments.
