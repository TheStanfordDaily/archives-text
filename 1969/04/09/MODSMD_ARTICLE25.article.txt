The second block of

Undergraduate Education of the
Study of Education at Stanford
(SES) will be presented to a joint

on Thursday, April 17.
These recommendations, which

and academic bookkeeping, have
been drafted into legislative form
by the Floor Management
Committee.
The committee is anxious to

community members represented.
Professor Ronald J. Mellor,
Classics, made the following
statement:
"Persons who would like to
present their views before the
Senate and Education Council
should forward a summary of
their positions to Professor
Mellor, Department of Classics,
extension 4658.
"These summaries should be
about one page in length. They
will be duplicated and distributed

Council.
"Anyone wishing to propose
amendments to any of these

them in writing to Professor
Mellor as soon as possible."

Summaries and amendments
are due no latter than Monday,

The recommendations to be
considered include the possibility
of adopting one of three proposed
calendar modifications.
The first plan calls for an
academic year of two semesters
and a summer session. The
autumn semester would begin
after Labor Day; the spring
semester would begin in early
February. Each term would be
approximately fourteen weeks in
length.
If the first recommendation is
rejected then the following plan
would be considered:
An academic year of two
semesters and a summer session.
The autumn semester would begin
in late August and would be
completed before the Christmas
recess; the spring semester would
begin in early January.
If the first two proposals are
rejected a third and final proposal
would be submitted. This calls for
an academic year of three quarters
and a summer session. The
autumn quarter would begin in
late September; the winter quarter
would begin in early January; the
spring quarter would commence
about April 1.
