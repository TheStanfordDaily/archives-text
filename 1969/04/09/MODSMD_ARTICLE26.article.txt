# Experts Publish In-Depth Study
## Mass Media's Role Examined 
### 
Despite the fact that black
faces have been appearing with
increasing frequency in
advertisements, news programs
and TV dramas, little attention is
being given to the everyday world

of the Negro by the mass media,
say two communications experts
from Stanford University, William
L. Rivers and Wilbur Schramm.
"It is paradoxial, but true that
at a time when civil rights is front

page language, the Negro has not
arrived. Only the superstars in
entertainment, athletics, and civil
rights, like Sammy Davis, Jr.,
Willie Mays, and Martin Luther
King, really matter. Only a few of
the most enlightened newspapers
give space to the three landmarks
of Negro existence: birth,
marriage, and death," they state.
They examine the relationship
of mass media to the Negro in a
lengthy section of their book,
''Responsibility in Mass
Communication," to be published
today.
Although the Negro has a full
opportunity to observe the white
world through the mass media,
few whites see Negroes except
when the black community is
inflamed, they state.
Cataclysmic Period
This country might not now be
experiencing such a cataclysmic
period had the news media made
the nation aware of the pitiful
conditions of Negro life decades
ago, they believe. At the very
least, journalistic explorations of
ghetto existence would have
created an understanding of the
violence that accompanies the
modern demand for civil rights.
Such reportage might have helped
make the Negro American an
integral part of his society "rather

than an unhappy graft upon it,"
they state.
It is not necessary to illustrate
the point by analyzing a
sensationalist newspaper or
television station in the bigotry
belt. Some of the Negro's firmest
friends in the mass media quite
unconsciously distort the public
view of his life, say Professors
Rivers and Schramm.
Life magazine, which is
editorially so devoted to
integration that legions of
segregationists have cancelled
their subscriptions, has
emphasized the violent aspect of
Negro life.
Violence Shown
A study of all the
integration-crisis photographs
which appeared in Life during
1962 and 1963—a period when
most integration protests were
characterized by passive
resistance—revealed that more
than half showed violence rather
than passive resistance.
In contrast, only 20 percent of
the integration-crisis photographs
published during the same period
in Ebony pictured violence.
Moreover, nearly 10% of all the
photographs of Negroes which
appeared in Life during this
period were of Black Muslims,
whereas only 1% of the pictures in
Ebony were of the Muslims.
"When whites attempt to
bridge the gulf of
misunderstanding, they usually
communicate ineptly. Those with
the best will may use the most
wounding words, largely because
they know so little of the context
of Negro life that they do not
know which are the words that
wound," write Professors Rivers
and Schramm.
Duty of Media
Discussing the duty of the
media to the public, and the
responsibility of the public to the
communications industry,
Professors Rivers and Schramm
make specific recommendations in
their book as to how each can
fulfill its obligations with the goal
of upgrading communications and
attaining a maximum of integrity
in content.

misunderstanding, they usually
communicate ineptly. Those with
the best will may use the most
wounding words, largely because
they know so little of the context
of Negro life that they do not
know which are the words that
wound," write Professors Rivers
and Schramm.
Duty of Media
Discussing the duty of the
media to the public, and the
responsibility of the public to the
communications industry,
Professors Rivers and Schramm
make specific recommendations in
their book as to how each can
fulfill its obligations with the goal
of upgrading communications and
attaining a maximum of integrity
in content.
Despite the fact that black
faces have been appearing with
increasing frequency in
advertisements, news programs
and TV dramas, little attention is
being given to the everyday world

of the Negro by the mass media,
say two communications experts
from Stanford University, William
L. Rivers and Wilbur Schramm.
"It is paradoxial, but true that
at a time when civil rights is front

page language, the Negro has not
arrived. Only the superstars in
entertainment, athletics, and civil
rights, like Sammy Davis, Jr.,
Willie Mays, and Martin Luther
King, really matter. Only a few of
the most enlightened newspapers
give space to the three landmarks
of Negro existence: birth,
marriage, and death," they state.
They examine the relationship
of mass media to the Negro in a
lengthy section of their book,
''Responsibility in Mass
Communication," to be published
today.
Although the Negro has a full
opportunity to observe the white
world through the mass media,
few whites see Negroes except
when the black community is
inflamed, they state.
Cataclysmic Period
This country might not now be
experiencing such a cataclysmic
period had the news media made
the nation aware of the pitiful
conditions of Negro life decades
ago, they believe. At the very
least, journalistic explorations of
ghetto existence would have
created an understanding of the
violence that accompanies the
modern demand for civil rights.
Such reportage might have helped
make the Negro American an
integral part of his society "rather

than an unhappy graft upon it,"
they state.
It is not necessary to illustrate
the point by analyzing a
sensationalist newspaper or
television station in the bigotry
belt. Some of the Negro's firmest
friends in the mass media quite
unconsciously distort the public
view of his life, say Professors
Rivers and Schramm.
Life magazine, which is
editorially so devoted to
integration that legions of
segregationists have cancelled
their subscriptions, has
emphasized the violent aspect of
Negro life.
Violence Shown
A study of all the
integration-crisis photographs
which appeared in Life during
1962 and 1963—a period when
most integration protests were
characterized by passive
resistance—revealed that more
than half showed violence rather
than passive resistance.
In contrast, only 20 percent of
the integration-crisis photographs
published during the same period
in Ebony pictured violence.
Moreover, nearly 10% of all the
photographs of Negroes which
appeared in Life during this
period were of Black Muslims,
whereas only 1% of the pictures in
Ebony were of the Muslims.
"When whites attempt to
bridge the gulf of
misunderstanding, they usually
communicate ineptly. Those with
the best will may use the most
wounding words, largely because
they know so little of the context
of Negro life that they do not
know which are the words that
wound," write Professors Rivers
