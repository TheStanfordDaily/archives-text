# Pac-8 Baseball
## Indians Tune For League 
### JOHN ARTHUR 
Pitching, Connie Mack once
said, is 75% of baseball. Later,
another baseball man, whose
name escapes me but who is
currently managing the
Washington entry in the American
League, added that hitting a
pitched ball is the single most
difficult act in all of sport. To
these honored maxims was added
a third yesterday by Stanford's
assistant baseball coach Tom
Dunton. Spoke the coach: "We're
hitting like we're in a fish tank."
No fans, the Stanford offense,
as currently displayed, is not
going to frighten too many Pac-8
coaches. Except, perhaps, Ray
Young, who, being closer to the
situation than others, has a better
view. The Tribe breezed past Cal
State at Hay ward by the

apparently impressive margin of
6-0 at the Sunken Diamond
yesterday, but don't be misled by
the score.
Although Stanford managed
seven hits off three State pitchers,
only one, a windblown fly in the
eighth off the bat of Dick
Borchers, went for extra bases.
Borchers slid into second after the
ball fell to the ground five feet in
front of the thoroughly confused
right fielder.
The Tribe scored two runs in
the fifth on no hits and three Cal
State errors. Two innings later,
however, some clutch hitting was
used to build the margin. With
two outs, catcher Bob Edie and
pitcher Phil Keller drew walks.
Then first baseman Mark
Marquess lined a shot which went
off the pitcher's glove and
continued up the middle. With the
bases loaded, left fielder Jack
Hodges singled to right to knock
in two runs. Then third baseman

Bob Boone singled up the middle
for two more, and the Tribe led
6-0.
Meanwhile, the Indians were
getting some fine pitching. Rod
Poteete started and hurled five
hitless innings, striking out six and
walking three in the process. Phil
Keller came in for the final four
frames and was again strong.
Keller gave up just one hit, a
leadoff single in the seventh,
struck out five and walked one.
