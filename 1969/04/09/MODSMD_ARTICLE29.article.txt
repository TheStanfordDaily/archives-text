# Sailors Get New Boats
## 
### 
The Stanford Sailing
Association has been given two
new SHIELDS-class 30' sailboats
by Cory Shields, New York yacht
racer and financier. This gives
Stanford a fleet of five of these
boats on San Francisco Bay.
The two newcomers will be
christened late this month. Dr.
Kenneth Pitzer, a sailor himself,
will attend the ceremony while
his wife smashes the traditional
bottle of champagne on the
boats bows.
The Sailing Association also
runs sailing operations on Lake
Lagunita throughout Spring
Quarter, offering both instruction
and recreational sailing.
Membership is available to
students, faculty and staff.
A general meeting will be held
tomorrow at 7:30 p.m. in Room
300 to explain the Bay and Lake
Lag sailing programs. The Red
Cross "Basic Sailing" instruction
film will be shown, so all those
interested in learning to sail
should attend. The meeting is
open to all.
