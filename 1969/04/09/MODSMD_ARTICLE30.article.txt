The University of Seattle
invades the Farm this afternoon
to take on Coach Dick Gould's
varsity tennismen. First service is
scheduled for 2:30 p.m.
At the same time, the Stanford
JV's meet Santa Clara.
In their last outings, the varsity
met with disaster in Southern
California. The Indians, playing
with injuries, missing players, and
out-of-shape latecomers dropped
matches to both USC and UCLA,
the two top teams in the nation.
The Trojans clobbered the
Tribe 7-2, and the Bruins followed
it up with a rain-shortened 6-0
triumph.
Sophomore Paul Marienthal
and senior Bill Atkins (returning
to competitive tennis after a
two-year absence) were the only

bright spots for Stanford. The
Cards gained their two points
against USC when John Shepard,
playing sixth singles, won his
match, and then Southern Cal
forfeited the third doubles.
Stanford's number two player,
John Spiegel, took the weekend
off to run for student body
president, and Stan Pasarell, who
moved up to the number two spot
for the two days, suffered from a
strep throat. He was not at his
best.
Doubles man Rob Rippner,
just back from Europe, was
disadvantaged by lack of practice
and a bad knee.
Even a healthy Indian
contingent would have had
trouble winning down South.
Hopefully Seattle will be kinder
to the wounded Tribe.
