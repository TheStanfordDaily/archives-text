# Actions On SRI
## Board Creates Confidence Crisis 
### MARSHALL E. SCHWARTZ News Analysis 
Stanford has entered what may
possibly be the most crucial week in its
history, and the Board of Trustees may
have already started out on the wrong
foot.
President Kenneth S. Pitzer
presented to the Board the set of
demands on Stanford Research Institute
(SRI) drawn up by the April 3 Coalition
and given to him last Friday. Instead of
taking firm action on the
demands —either acceptance or
rejection—the Board sidestepped most
of the issues and completely ignored
others, adding to the current crisis of
confidence.
Requests included suspension of all
current chemical-biological warfare
(CBW) and counterinsurgency research,
as well as all other war-related work, no
future acceptance of contracts in these
areas, and . increased University control
of the research institute.
Response Anticipated
The actual response was predicted
several days ago in a letter sent by the
Coalition to all faculty members. The
letter reads in part:
"Faced with a morally aroused
University community, the Trustees
may well try to beat a tactical retreat by
instituting a moratorium on new CBW
(and possibly counterinsurgency)
research at their Tuesday meeting. A
moratorium on acceptance of new
contracts in these areas could pacify an
unaware University community.
"In addition, a moratorium might
allow the Trustees to put off a final
decision until mid-May or June, at
which time they would be allowed to
operate in the normal Stanford political
vacuum . . .
"Furthermore, it is very likely that
the Trustees will attempt to ignore the
April 3 Coalition's demand that, a
special meeting of the Stanford Trustees
be held during Lhe week of April 21, at
which time a final decision on Stanford

and SRl's war-related research and the
University's relationship to SRI would
be made."
Uncanny Accuracy
The accuracy of these predictions is
uncanny.
Pitzer urged the Trustees to "listen
carefully to student and faculty views
on both specific questions related to
SRI and on these general questions of
confidence and priorities."
Whether they did listen carefully,
only the Trustees themselves can say.
But they were unable to follow another
admonition from the President:
"Regardless of the errors of others I hope
you can take a step toward renewed
confidence."
Instead of renewing the students'
faith in the Board, what little remained
was probably shattered by yesterday's
actions.
Although many do not support the
Coalition's proposal for closer
Stanford-SRI ties and would rather see
SRI sold, the Board's decision was the
type of tactic that most members of this
community would consider typical of
stalling and indecision and inspired little
if any confidence in the Trustees'
actions.
Moved Away
Whatever may now become of the
SRI question, the Board has moved
further away from th£ rest of the
community.
What is even more dangerous, the
University is now faced with a situation
potentially more explosive than the one
that existed last spring and gave rise to
the Old Union sit-in.
The Coalition will meet tonight in
Dinkelspicl Auditorium to decide on
what action to take in resoonse to the
Board.
Last year's sit-in caught University
administrators off guard. This year, they
have been warned enough to be ready,
but they will be lucky to escape with
only a sit-in. Another Columbia is
possible, although not likely.

The level of violence may be
inversely proportional to the level of the
Board's response to the demands. Out
of all concessions possible, the Trustees
gave in the least they could.
They did not ask for a moratorium
on present CBW contracts, but only on
future ones, and did not even consider
suspending counterinsurgency work.
They did not opt for an open
meeting, but merely established a
committee to investigate SRI
further—and even the committee's
meetings will not be open during voting.
Each decision, however well
intended, will only further extend the
present crisis of confidence.
Sit-in or not, the Board is likely to
follow the recommendations of the

student-faculty SRI Committee, which
will almost definitely ask for sale of
SRI, as reported in Monday's Daily.
Another Question
This gives rise to another question:
what happens to the millions of dollars
the University will realize from the sale
of SRI? Almost all areas of the school
will want a cut of the pie.
The possibilities are all varied and
exciting: a major increase in minority
admissions, faculty, and programs; a
new research institute, dedicated solely
to peaceful research; or a massive
low-cost housing project for students,
junior faculty, and staff. What happens
to the money gained from the sale of
SRI may be a more important question
than what happens to SRI itself.
