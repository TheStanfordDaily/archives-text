# Pitzer’s Statement
## 
### 
The following is the statement of
President Pitzer to the Stanford
Trustees in opening discussion of the
future relationship of Stanford Research
Institute to the University.
In a recent memorandum I said that
the SRI question would constitute a
"once in a decade" decision. That is
certainly true, but I want to add, in
opening the discussion, that you face a
set of decisions which are really
symbolic of a major national and
international crisis.
This crisis is the lack of confidence
of many students in the controlling
elements of our society. You are in a
very real sense symbolic of the President
of the United States, of his Cabinet, and
of the majority coalition in the
Congress. You are being held

responsible for the war in Vietnam, for
the draft, for oi r failure to find a way
to stop the nuclear arms race, for the oil
leak in the Santa Barbara channel. Since
young people have known only
prosperity, you get little credit for
continued economic growth. Mistakes
are made in any decade, but I share the
view that our recent record is
exceptionally dismal.
The Ford Motor Company blundered
in the Edsel but had the courage to
admit the error and stop production.
The war in Vietnam is an equally
obvious and infinitely greater blunder,
but we haven't the courage to admit it
and get out. And in my view it is clearly
a violation of human rights to draft a
young man to fight a war which he
regards as grossly immoral and about
which the nation is unsure.
Wald Speech
I am tempted to call this a generation
gap, but Walter Lippmann, nearly 80,
recognized what was wrong. The recent
speech entitled, "a generation in search
of a future," by George Wald, age 63, is
an excellent statement of these
problems which I hope you read in last
Sunday's San Francisco Chronicle or
elsewhere. It is possible for our
generation to see what is wrong.
You are being asked through your
decision on SRI to say that our national
priorities are wrong—that we spend too
much on the military, on means to kill
people, and not enough on constructive
things, on helping ordinary people to
live.
I hope that you will listen carefully
to student and faculty views on both
specific questions related to SRI and on
these general questions of confidence
and priorities. I think I am correct in

live.
I hope that you will listen carefully
to student and faculty views on both
specific questions related to SRI and on
these general questions of confidence
and priorities. I think I am correct in
saying the great majority of the
students and faculty are
concerned about the points I have
raised. I hope you can take some
action today that will indicate
your concern—that will symbolize
your recognition of these
problems.
You can criticize inappropriate
student behavior, of course. Some
of you faced an unfair inquisition
a month ago. In yesterday's Daily,
Tom Dawson properly objected to
the current effort of some
students to judge the SRI
questions before instead of after
the study committee report is
published.
Also the university should not
take official positions on matters
which are not its concern—to do
otherwise would jeopardize
academic freedom. Thus vou

should not pass formal resolutions
on national policy questions even
if you were inclined to do so.
But there are appropriate ways
in which you can indicate a desire
to recognize and consider campus
viewpoints. One would be a clear
step toward adding Trustees who
would personally hold typical
student and faculty viewpoints.
Another would be a
decision-making procedure
concerning SRI which indicated a
clear desire to learn and to
consider seriously campus
viewpoints. I am sure other
suggestions will be
forthcoming—some will be
unacceptable but I hope you can
find others which you can adopt.
Regardless of the errors of others
I hope you can take a step toward
renewed confidence.

if you were inclined to do so.
But there are appropriate ways
in which you can indicate a desire
to recognize and consider campus
viewpoints. One would be a clear
step toward adding Trustees who
would personally hold typical
student and faculty viewpoints.
Another would be a
decision-making procedure
concerning SRI which indicated a
clear desire to learn and to
consider seriously campus
viewpoints. I am sure other
suggestions will be
forthcoming—some will be
unacceptable but I hope you can
find others which you can adopt.
Regardless of the errors of others
I hope you can take a step toward
renewed confidence.
The following is the statement of
President Pitzer to the Stanford
Trustees in opening discussion of the
future relationship of Stanford Research
Institute to the University.
In a recent memorandum I said that
the SRI question would constitute a
"once in a decade" decision. That is
certainly true, but I want to add, in
opening the discussion, that you face a
set of decisions which are really
symbolic of a major national and
international crisis.
This crisis is the lack of confidence
of many students in the controlling
elements of our society. You are in a
very real sense symbolic of the President
of the United States, of his Cabinet, and
of the majority coalition in the
Congress. You are being held

responsible for the war in Vietnam, for
the draft, for oi r failure to find a way
to stop the nuclear arms race, for the oil
leak in the Santa Barbara channel. Since
young people have known only
prosperity, you get little credit for
continued economic growth. Mistakes
are made in any decade, but I share the
view that our recent record is
exceptionally dismal.
The Ford Motor Company blundered
in the Edsel but had the courage to
admit the error and stop production.
The war in Vietnam is an equally
obvious and infinitely greater blunder,
but we haven't the courage to admit it
and get out. And in my view it is clearly
a violation of human rights to draft a
young man to fight a war which he
regards as grossly immoral and about
which the nation is unsure.
Wald Speech
I am tempted to call this a generation
gap, but Walter Lippmann, nearly 80,
recognized what was wrong. The recent
speech entitled, "a generation in search
of a future," by George Wald, age 63, is
an excellent statement of these
problems which I hope you read in last
Sunday's San Francisco Chronicle or
elsewhere. It is possible for our
generation to see what is wrong.
You are being asked through your
decision on SRI to say that our national
priorities are wrong—that we spend too
much on the military, on means to kill
people, and not enough on constructive
things, on helping ordinary people to
live.
I hope that you will listen carefully
to student and faculty views on both
specific questions related to SRI and on
these general questions of confidence
and priorities. I think I am correct in
saying the great majority of the
students and faculty are
concerned about the points I have
raised. I hope you can take some
action today that will indicate
your concern—that will symbolize
your recognition of these
problems.
You can criticize inappropriate
student behavior, of course. Some
of you faced an unfair inquisition
a month ago. In yesterday's Daily,
Tom Dawson properly objected to
the current effort of some
students to judge the SRI
questions before instead of after
the study committee report is
published.
Also the university should not
take official positions on matters
which are not its concern—to do
otherwise would jeopardize
academic freedom. Thus vou

should not pass formal resolutions
on national policy questions even
if you were inclined to do so.
