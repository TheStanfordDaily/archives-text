# Jury Verdict: Not Guilty
## Electoral Wake Defendants Freed 
### EILEEN HALEY 
The trial of six persons, arrested for
failure to disperse during the
post-Electoral Wake gathering on
November 5 in Palo Alto, ended
yesterday with acquittal of all six
defendants. Members of the Stanford
community are among those found not
guilty by the jury after a three and a
half week trial in Palo Alto-Mountain
View Municipal Court.
The case is seen by the defense as a
test of constitutional rights. Defense
Attorney James Wolpman feels that the
jury based its decision "on the moral
and constitutional issues" involved in
the trial. As Peter Tamases, another
defense lawyer pointed out, this trial
was an attempt to preserve the rights
guaranteed under the First Amendment
that "the streets belong to the people"
so they can "walk and talk here without
fear."
Political Arrests
Another issue raised by the case was
the question of political arrests. As
James Johnson, one of the defendants
pointed out: "all of the people arrested
had something to do with radicalism at
Stanford." Larry Christiani, another

defendant, feels that "they did try to
make political arrests, for most of us
were known to be organizers."
Arrested and accused of failure to
disperse were: H. Bruce Franklin, Marc
Sapir, Fred Cohen, James Johnson,
Larry Christiani, Jan Singer. Earlier
charges were dismissed against two
others arrested the same night, Don
Stewart and Paul Beach. Cohen and
Christiani were also charged with
resisting arrest and Johnson was accused
of disturbing the peace.
The arrests were the result of a
gathering following a peaceful
candlelight procession from Stanford to
Lytton Plaza on election night. Several
of those arrested were taken into
custody on the Stanford campus three
days after the incident.
Intimidation
Both defendants and defense
attorneys feel the acquittal is, in the
words of Fred Cohen, "an important
victory . . . whch shows Palo Alto and
the police that "they can't use bullshit
arrests to intimidate people." However,
as Tamases remarked, he and Franklin

felt that to a certain extent,
"harassment by police trying to limit
peoples' use of an area, succeeds
because defendants have to put in time,
even if they are acquitted."
Tamases stated that the people who
demonstrate are not people "who own
television stations and can express
opinions through mass media, but those
who need public protest to express their
opinions." If these people are denied
their right to protest, it "would limit
the information available to the
American people."

American people."
The trial of six persons, arrested for
failure to disperse during the
post-Electoral Wake gathering on
November 5 in Palo Alto, ended
yesterday with acquittal of all six
defendants. Members of the Stanford
community are among those found not
guilty by the jury after a three and a
half week trial in Palo Alto-Mountain
View Municipal Court.
The case is seen by the defense as a
test of constitutional rights. Defense
Attorney James Wolpman feels that the
jury based its decision "on the moral
and constitutional issues" involved in
the trial. As Peter Tamases, another
defense lawyer pointed out, this trial
was an attempt to preserve the rights
guaranteed under the First Amendment
that "the streets belong to the people"
so they can "walk and talk here without
fear."
Political Arrests
Another issue raised by the case was
the question of political arrests. As
James Johnson, one of the defendants
pointed out: "all of the people arrested
had something to do with radicalism at
Stanford." Larry Christiani, another

defendant, feels that "they did try to
make political arrests, for most of us
were known to be organizers."
Arrested and accused of failure to
disperse were: H. Bruce Franklin, Marc
Sapir, Fred Cohen, James Johnson,
Larry Christiani, Jan Singer. Earlier
charges were dismissed against two
others arrested the same night, Don
Stewart and Paul Beach. Cohen and
Christiani were also charged with
resisting arrest and Johnson was accused
of disturbing the peace.
The arrests were the result of a
gathering following a peaceful
candlelight procession from Stanford to
Lytton Plaza on election night. Several
of those arrested were taken into
custody on the Stanford campus three
days after the incident.
Intimidation
Both defendants and defense
attorneys feel the acquittal is, in the
words of Fred Cohen, "an important
victory . . . whch shows Palo Alto and
the police that "they can't use bullshit
arrests to intimidate people." However,
as Tamases remarked, he and Franklin

felt that to a certain extent,
"harassment by police trying to limit
peoples' use of an area, succeeds
because defendants have to put in time,
even if they are acquitted."
Tamases stated that the people who
demonstrate are not people "who own
television stations and can express
opinions through mass media, but those
who need public protest to express their
opinions." If these people are denied
their right to protest, it "would limit
the information available to the
American people."
