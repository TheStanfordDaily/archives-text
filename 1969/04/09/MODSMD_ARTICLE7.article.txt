# ‘Dump Johnson' Head Arrives, IFC Guest
## 
### 
Allard K. Lowenstein strolled into
the Phi Delt house yesterday afternoon
wearing a sports shirt and a light green
windbreaker. He looked like neither a
freshman congressman—which he is—or
an assistant dean of students at
Stanford—which he was seven years ago.
Lowenstein, the prime mover in the
"Dump Johnson" campaign last year,
won an upset victory in November over
a Conservative party candidate running
with Republican support in New York's
Fifth Congressional District.
Although he may not have the
appearance of a member of the House
of Representatives, Lowenstein seems to
be well prepared for his new job.
"The first question the press always
asks is if you are 'frustrated' as a
freshman congressman," he said. "The
answer is no. Being a dean at Stanford is
very good training for not being
frustrated in Congress."

Lowenstein was a major McCarthy
supporter, and received much publicity
during the Democratic Convention. Al
though unhappy with the immediate
results of the Convention, he feels the
struggle has wrought important changes
within the Democratic party.
Direction Altered
"It's totally altered the direction of
the party, and opened the party up in a
way unprecedented in its history," he
said. "You can measure this change my
the fact that there never has been an
outgoing president who has had less
influence on the direction of his party."
In Congress, the problems are
greater. No major legislation can be
enacted, Lowenstein declared, without
both direction from President Nixon
and procedural reforms in the House.
While the Congress has so far granted
the new president a period of grace,
Lowenstein noted that Nixon is in
danger of going from a period where
people are waiting to find out what he
will do "to a period where people think
he can't do anything."
Well-intentioned
"My feeling is that Nixon wants to
do the right things, so I don't yet want
to make an across-the-board indictment,
especially because the problems we are
facing are so great."
Lowenstein called Nixon's
anti-ballistic missile (ABM) decision "a
totally absurd decision. It comes close
to putting the Administration into a
position where everything they do is
suspect."
He noted that the Congressional
opposition to the ABM has a good
chance to stop its passage. There is
"much latent opposition," but pressure
must be applied to "borderline"
congressmen.
But he predicts success. "The ABM
will be 1969's New Hampshire,"
Lowenstein said.

will do "to a period where people think
he can't do anything."
Well-intentioned
"My feeling is that Nixon wants to
do the right things, so I don't yet want
to make an across-the-board indictment,
especially because the problems we are
facing are so great."
Lowenstein called Nixon's
anti-ballistic missile (ABM) decision "a
totally absurd decision. It comes close
to putting the Administration into a
position where everything they do is
suspect."
He noted that the Congressional
opposition to the ABM has a good
chance to stop its passage. There is
"much latent opposition," but pressure
must be applied to "borderline"
congressmen.
But he predicts success. "The ABM
will be 1969's New Hampshire,"
Lowenstein said.
Allard K. Lowenstein strolled into
the Phi Delt house yesterday afternoon
wearing a sports shirt and a light green
windbreaker. He looked like neither a
freshman congressman—which he is—or
an assistant dean of students at
Stanford—which he was seven years ago.
Lowenstein, the prime mover in the
"Dump Johnson" campaign last year,
won an upset victory in November over
a Conservative party candidate running
with Republican support in New York's
Fifth Congressional District.
Although he may not have the
appearance of a member of the House
of Representatives, Lowenstein seems to
be well prepared for his new job.
"The first question the press always
asks is if you are 'frustrated' as a
freshman congressman," he said. "The
answer is no. Being a dean at Stanford is
very good training for not being
frustrated in Congress."

Lowenstein was a major McCarthy
supporter, and received much publicity
during the Democratic Convention. Al
though unhappy with the immediate
results of the Convention, he feels the
struggle has wrought important changes
within the Democratic party.
Direction Altered
"It's totally altered the direction of
the party, and opened the party up in a
way unprecedented in its history," he
said. "You can measure this change my
the fact that there never has been an
outgoing president who has had less
influence on the direction of his party."
In Congress, the problems are
greater. No major legislation can be
enacted, Lowenstein declared, without
both direction from President Nixon
and procedural reforms in the House.
While the Congress has so far granted
the new president a period of grace,
Lowenstein noted that Nixon is in
danger of going from a period where
people are waiting to find out what he
will do "to a period where people think
he can't do anything."
