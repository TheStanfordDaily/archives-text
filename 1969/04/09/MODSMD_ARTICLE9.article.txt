SCLC Petitions
One petition was turned in for
the Student Conduct Legislative
Council. It was submitted by Yale
Braunstein, a graduate student in
economics. Petitions for the one
vacancy on that Council are due
in the ASSU office at 4:30 this
afternoon.
The petition deadline for the ASSU
presidency closed yesterday with 13
slates of candidates in the race.
Several unusual tickets are included
in the contest: two co-presidential
candidates, a four-man presidential
slate, and a ticket with 31 candidates
for the office.
There may be constitutional
questions on the tickets which have
multiple presidential candidates and no
vice-presidential offering.
Tentative Placing
Election Commissioner Bob Debs
announced yesterday that all thirteen
slates would temporarily be placed on
the ballot pending a meeting of the
Elections Violations Committee.
The Committee is to meet this
evening and will invite ASSU President
Denis Hayes and LASSU Speaker Yale
Braunstein for consultation. A final
determination will be made at that time

on the constitutionality of the tickets
with more than one presidential
candidate and no vice-president.
The 13 ASSU presidential tickets
include:
A four man ticket with Barry
Askinas, graduate student in sociology;
John Grube, senior in political science;
Joyce Kobayashi, junior in philosophy;
and Pat Shea, junior in political science.
A co-presidential slate with Tom
Coburn, graduate student in genetics,
and Jeff Kane, a senior majoring in
physiological psychology.
Bob Cory, a junior in political
science with his running mate Eckhard
Shulz, a graduate student in electrical
engineering.
Paul Floto, a senior in economics
with his running mate Mike Roake (who
wishes his name to appear on the ballot
as "The Olde Scribe"), a senior in
English.

Andrew Gould, a sophomore in math
with his vice-presidential candidate Marc
Heller, a sophomore who has not yet
declared a major.
Charles B. Kitsman, a sophomore in
psychology running with Neil Heller, a
junior in sociology.
Philip Laird, a junior in history with
John Thomas, a junior in psychology.
Hughie Macdonald, a senior in

Jim Schnieder, a junior in

John Spiegel, a senior in history with
Brad Cornell, a senior with an
interdepartmental major including
philosophy, psychology, and physics.
Allan Wernick, a freshmen n
general studies running with
Lawrence Gamble, a freshman in
general studies.
The final slate consists of 31
students. Briefly, the justification
for the ticket is that with 31 days
in a month, one student would
head the Presidential Commission
each day.
The 31 students are: David K.
Keefer, John L. King, Richard H.
Kokemoor, Thomas R. Stibolt,
