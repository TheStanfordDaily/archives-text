Works All Day Plays All Night
After a hard day's dictating to your Sony 124-CS stereo
Cassette-Corder", you get a rest. But your faithful Sony is
still on duty — standing by to bring you your favorite selec
tions at home, hotel room, plane, or car. And the beauty of
this new Sony cassette stereo system is that it fits into a
briefcase-size carrying case, external speakers and all.
Push-button operation, pop-in-and-out cassettes, and Sony
matic Recording Control make the 124-CS simple and fun
to use. A regulated-speed DC motor ensures constant tape
speed. There's never a power-supply worry with the 124-CS
—use it on AC, car battery, four flashlight batteries, or Sony
rechargeable battery pack. Come in today, and let us show
you the one that plays all night. It's the playful one! Under
$199.50.
