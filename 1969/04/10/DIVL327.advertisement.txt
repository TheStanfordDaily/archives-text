JEWISH STUDENTS
Adam Clayton Powell, Walter Reuther, Roy Wilkins, Martin
Luther King, Bertrand Russell, and other notable men have all
had something very important in common. They have all rec
ognized and spoken out against the oppression of Soviet
Jewry.
The U.S.S R. IS sensitive to world opinion, especially from
left-of-center and youth groups. It is particularly sensitive at
present since it has been violating its own constitution with
respect to Jewish national and religious rights.
Passover, the commemoration of our liberation from bond
age, will be drawing to a close this evening. Join us tonight
at 7:00 PM in the Old Union Courtyard in protesting this new
enslavement and keeping alive the hope for freedom in the
Soviet Union. The Jews there are waiting for your support. The
time tos how it is now! Can you remain silent?
