# Students Sit In At AEL in Protest; Two-Thirds OK Action At Mass Meeting
## 
### 
More than 100 people entered the
Applied Electronics Laboratory (AEL)
last night to demonstrate against the
continuation of $2 million in classified
research work there.
The take over came after a
community meeting in Dinkelspiel
Auditorium in which an overflow crowd
of 900 students voted by a two-to-one
margin to "occupy the Applied
Electronics Laboratory such that the
research cannot go on."
Students moved from Dinkelspiel
immediately following the meeting and
began the sit-in.
There will be a noon rally today in
White Plaza to explain the issues that
led to the sit-in. Following the rally,
there will be a 1 p.m. community
meeting in the courtyard outside AEL.
The Concerned F'aculty committee will
meet tonight at 8 p.m. in Tresidder 270.
The Academic Senate will meet in the
Graduate School of Business at 3:15.
Reject Hoard Response
The students voted overwhelmingly
to reject the response of the Stanford
Board of Trustees at their Tuesday
meeting. The demands included closer
supervision of Stanford Research
Institute and end t j classified research,
and stopping all chemical and biological
warfare and counterinsurgency studies,
mainly at SRI.
Tuesday the Trustees asked the
Board of Directors of SRI not to make
any new contracts for research in
Chemical and Biological Warfare
pending completion of study of the
relationship between the two
institutions.
The Trustees also voted to have
selected students representing divergent
opinions present their views to a
committee.
Doors to the laboratory originally
were locked. At about 10:45, a group of

2 0 students arrived, one student
jimmied open the door. Minutes later
hundreds of students streamed inside.
Inside most doors were locked and
people swarmed over the three story
building entering every open room. No
damage or attempt to break into locked
rooms was apparent.
When the students arrived one
Stanford police car was there but it left
moments later. Later, two Stanford
policemen entered the building and
checked the doors that were locked, but
left soon after.
Later in the evening Stanford Police
Chief Thomas Bell stationed five
uniformed officers inside the building to
"maintain order." They were to remain
there throughout the night.
After the occupiers milled in the
building for a short time, a meeting
began in the AEL courtyard. After
organizing a series of committees, they
broke into several small group
discussions with faculty members.
Among the committees organized
were a coordinating committee, along
with rally, leaflet, campus coordinating,
community education, press, food, legal
aid, and medical aid committees.
Academic Senate
Those at the meeting decided that
the Academic Senate would be asked at
its meeting today to set aside class time
for the next few days for the discussion
of the SRI issues.
Also, it was announced that 2,000
extra copies of The Daily were to be
printed this morning at The Daily's
expense for distribution off campus.
Mimeographed statements on what
to do in case of arrest were distributed.
Law student Doron Weinberg advised
people entering the building that they
were subject to arrest under federal
statutes, but could most likely not be
convicted under those statutes.
When The Daily went to press at 3

a.m., over 200 students remained. The
corridors were Tilled with students in
sleeping bags, with knots of students
talking and singing in the stairwells. In
the basement, a group of students were
busy publishing a makeshift newspaper,
with a press office located on the
second floor.
A FT Meeting
The American Federation of
Teachers Local 1816 announced that it
would meet today at noon in the
courtyard of AEL to consider possible
strike plans.
Earlier in the evening an overflow
crowd jammed Dinkelspiel for nearly
three-and-a-half hours of discussion.
Students vigorously moved through a
prepared agenda covering reactions to
the Board of Trustees meeting Tuesday,
and open discussion qj" strategy and its
implementation.
Student Body President Denis
and several faculty leaders questioned
the effectiveness of the sit-in tactic.
The students voted to set up a
committee (o survey other buildings
they might occupy and said they would
set up picket lines at SRI, Stanford
Industrial Park companies, and other
war-related research sites.
They said they would not tamper
with any classified files at the
laboratory, which is engaged in
electronics research funded by the
Defense Department.
Pitzer Speech
President Kenneth S. Pitzer
addressed the meeting at the outset
saying in part "having spoken rather
bluntly with the board about the crisis
of confidence among many students in
the governance of all our social
institutions, I would now urge you to
consider the most constructive means of
achieving the changes you seek.
"Much of the influence of you last
meeting here stemmed from the
methods you employed. I hope your
commitment to peace extends to this
campus."
Early in the meeting Pat Shea, who
was present at the Trustee's meeting
told of the presentation students made
to the Trustees at the Tuesday meeting.
"We presented five things," said
Shea. "We asked for a specific decision
on SRI, we asked for the moratorium,
restructuring of the board, a date for
the April hearing, and a committee of
whole to come on the week of April 21.
Rupert Interpretation
Paul Rupert spoke saying he had
quite another interpretation of the
Trustee meeting from what President
Pitzer described.
"I was very pleased to read his
statement to the Board of Trustees. But
1 don't think we are talking about the
same world.
"What this meeting is talking about is
that this research is going on everyday
in SRI and in the Stanford Industrial
Park.
"The end result of this is that bombs
are coming down on the heads, backs,
and bowels of Vietnamese everyday.
"This does not stop on the
deliberation of Trustees. This will not
stop while we wait for the next three,
four, five, or six months while we wait
for rational consideration.
Shut Down University
"It seems to me this university could
be shut down for a few days while we
have the rational evaluation going on 24
hours a day.
SDS member David Pugh said that
"the Trustees did not act on any of the
demands. The Trustees don't need the
SRI report to come out and do
anything. This is not a technical issue;
it's a moral issue.
"I don't think that the Trustees are
ever going to come out and oppose
counterinsurgency. I think that if we act
