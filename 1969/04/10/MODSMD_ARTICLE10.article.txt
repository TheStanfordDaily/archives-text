## Birth Control For Better Life 
### Craig Laughton 
In listening to the rhetoric of
the far left and right concerning
individual freedoms, governmental
control, loss of identity,
immorality, and monotony,
among other "in" things, it occurs
to me 'hat such cries are in vain,
so long as our population keeps
expanding at such a prodigious
rate (currently it will double in 65
years).
It's inevitable that an
expanding populace will make
greater demands on our society,
environment, and sanity. Until we
face the fact that a creative,
quality existence for all people in
this country will be a practical
impossibility until we have a
stable population to work with,
the "American Dream" will
re i;ain just that.
Stop-gap means of dealing with
our social and environmental crisis
(such as building more highways
to accomodate more cars, which
accomodate more people) attack
only the effect, not the cause -too
many people.
Population control can and
should be accomplished now.
Sending our excess people to
distant planets is a good plot for a
Rod Serling special, but can
hardly suffice as a realistic
sollution to the problem. War,
famine, or disease is very real—but
not very pretty.
Tax reforms, financial

incentive programs, legalized
abortion, and family planning are
steps in the right direction but
their effectiveness is hardly
guaranteed on a national level.
As I mentioned in a previous
column, 1 believe a
go ve r n mentally controlled
mandatory sterilization program
should be instituted, involving all
persons regardless of race or
financial situation after they have
produced two children.
Absurd?
Absurd? I don't think so.
Sterilization not only sounds bad
to a lot of people, but due to their
religious or moral upbringing it is
considered sinful, dirty, or
immoral.
Sterilization, I think, is none of
these. It is a medical procedure
that will prevent conception.
Presenting conception prevents
babies, and that's the idea if we
want to stabilize the population.
It is certainly a form of
regimentation, but if such a
program were implemented now it
would help to guarantee that the
totalitarian regimentation of
Huxley's Brave New World would
be prevented, for more and more
people require greater controls.
In the long run there would be
a vast net gain of individual
freedoms. I can hardly see how
one could call a move to improve
the quality of human life instead

of emphasizing the quantity of it
immoral.
Acceptable
Could such a program be
accepted by the American public?
Why not—if the American people
can accept an organization which
they are forced to join and are
ordered to kill or be killed for
something they might not know
about or flatly don't believe in,
then I would hope that the same
American public would support a
program aimed at improving the
quality of humanity instead of
trying to destroy it.
Mandatory sterilization is not a
communist or fascist plot—it is a
human plan designed to get
humane results. The price in
personal freedom that one gives
up is indeed high but we must
face the fact that our current
social and environmental
dilemmas are forcing us to pay the
price of personal sacrifice if we
wish to end our race to oblivion.
I think we should ask ourselves
whether it is more important to
have more than two children or to
be able to live in a wholesome,
creative, sane society and drink
pure water, breathe clean air, have
decent uncrowded shelter and
enjoy natural beauty, among
other supposedly inherent rights.
