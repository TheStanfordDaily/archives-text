## Mourn For Sunday Flicks 
### Dave Noland 
Remember the good old days
of the Sunday flicks? Back when
men were men and women were
banned from the b ilcrnv?
I remember them, and mourn
their passing with misty eye.
Where is that rousing spirit with
which Flicks crowds of yesterday
turned the showing of a dismal
movie into the most eagerly
anticipated event of the week? If
the past few months are any
indicator, that old Flicks spirit is
as dead as a—well, as a doornail.
The creative capacity for
irrelevant obscenity seems to have
vanished entirely from the
balcony this year. No longer is
every pause in the screen dialogue
met with a succinct comment of
shining erudition and relevancy.
No longer do helium-filled
prophylactics waft across the
screen, eventually to settle in a
flustered coed's lap. No longer do
smuggled-in Diesel horns bellow at
particular appropriate moments.
Where are the creative geniuses
of old? The guy who could sustain
a Tarzan yell for 43 seconds? The
talented artist who could belch
with a volume approaching the
pain threshold of the eardrum?
The revered master of animal
impersonations whose specialty
was a female cat in heat? The true
Flicks connoisseur reverently
mourns the passing of these giant
talents.
Spirit Plum meted
With the departure of these
and other inspirational leaders,
group spirit in the balcony has
plummeted. No longer do the
traditional obscene chants ring
out with crispness and clarity.
(Even when they do occasionally
muster up something as tepid as
"O-o-o-o-o-o-o SHIT!," it
invariably comes out with almost
incoherent enunciation.)
No longer does the balcony
leap to its feet as one in a standing
ovation to show its appreciation
of a particularly clever moment.
And, worst of all, no longer is the
entrance of a female into the
hallowed confines of the balcony
greeted with a withering torrent
of hoots asd jeers. They actually
allow girls to sit up there these
days!
There is, to be sure, a
semblance of the old Flicks spirit
remaining, but it is merely a wan
shadow of its former robust self.
An occasional paper airplane (how
daring!) still drifts forlornly into

guy who does a passable Road
Runner imitation. But these
pathetic performances have
become trite and haggard, and
they elicit only token response
from a Ie th a r g i c and
unappreciative audience.
W h y ?
Why this inexorable decline of
the Flicks? Certainly not because
of administrative crackdowns or
increased deployment of student
pigs. Such action only intensifies
the pleasure of a particular clever
antic. A good obscenity is
enjoyed; a good obscenity in

defiance of authority is truly
savored.
The main reason for the
decline of the Flicks is simply that
they've been showing too many
good movies. This sinister trend
began as early as last year with
"Hard Day's Night" and "Hud,"
and has continued this year with
"La Dolce Vita," "The
Graduate," and several others.
People are actually coming to the
Flicks to watch the movie, for
irist's sake!
My faint hopes that spring
quarter might see a Flicks revival

were rudely shattered upon
perusal of the schedule. The old
Flicks spirit, now badly tottering,
will simply not survive the final
coup de grace of "How I Won the
War," "The Taming of the
Shrew," "The Great Escape,"
"Endless Summer," and "A Man
and a Woman" on consecutive
weekends. Oh, how I long for the
good old days of "Hush, Hush,
Sweet Charlotte" and "Flight of
the Phoenix."

talented artist who could belch
with a volume approaching the
pain threshold of the eardrum?
The revered master of animal
impersonations whose specialty
was a female cat in heat? The true
Flicks connoisseur reverently
mourns the passing of these giant
talents.
Spirit Plum meted
With the departure of these
and other inspirational leaders,
group spirit in the balcony has
plummeted. No longer do the
traditional obscene chants ring
out with crispness and clarity.
(Even when they do occasionally
muster up something as tepid as
"O-o-o-o-o-o-o SHIT!," it
invariably comes out with almost
incoherent enunciation.)
No longer does the balcony
leap to its feet as one in a standing
ovation to show its appreciation
of a particularly clever moment.
And, worst of all, no longer is the
entrance of a female into the
hallowed confines of the balcony
greeted with a withering torrent
of hoots asd jeers. They actually
allow girls to sit up there these
days!
There is, to be sure, a
semblance of the old Flicks spirit
remaining, but it is merely a wan
shadow of its former robust self.
An occasional paper airplane (how
daring!) still drifts forlornly into

guy who does a passable Road
Runner imitation. But these
pathetic performances have
become trite and haggard, and
they elicit only token response
from a Ie th a r g i c and
unappreciative audience.
W h y ?
Why this inexorable decline of
the Flicks? Certainly not because
of administrative crackdowns or
increased deployment of student
pigs. Such action only intensifies
the pleasure of a particular clever
antic. A good obscenity is
enjoyed; a good obscenity in

defiance of authority is truly
savored.
The main reason for the
decline of the Flicks is simply that
they've been showing too many
good movies. This sinister trend
began as early as last year with
"Hard Day's Night" and "Hud,"
and has continued this year with
"La Dolce Vita," "The
Graduate," and several others.
People are actually coming to the
Flicks to watch the movie, for
irist's sake!
My faint hopes that spring
quarter might see a Flicks revival

were rudely shattered upon
perusal of the schedule. The old
Flicks spirit, now badly tottering,
will simply not survive the final
coup de grace of "How I Won the
War," "The Taming of the
Shrew," "The Great Escape,"
"Endless Summer," and "A Man
and a Woman" on consecutive
weekends. Oh, how I long for the
good old days of "Hush, Hush,
Sweet Charlotte" and "Flight of
the Phoenix."
(Dave Noland is a graduate
student in com 111 unications-td.)
Remember the good old days
of the Sunday flicks? Back when
men were men and women were
banned from the b ilcrnv?
I remember them, and mourn
their passing with misty eye.
Where is that rousing spirit with
which Flicks crowds of yesterday
turned the showing of a dismal
movie into the most eagerly
anticipated event of the week? If
the past few months are any
indicator, that old Flicks spirit is
as dead as a—well, as a doornail.
The creative capacity for
irrelevant obscenity seems to have
vanished entirely from the
balcony this year. No longer is
every pause in the screen dialogue
met with a succinct comment of
shining erudition and relevancy.
No longer do helium-filled
prophylactics waft across the
screen, eventually to settle in a
flustered coed's lap. No longer do
smuggled-in Diesel horns bellow at
particular appropriate moments.
Where are the creative geniuses
of old? The guy who could sustain
a Tarzan yell for 43 seconds? The
talented artist who could belch
with a volume approaching the
pain threshold of the eardrum?
The revered master of animal
impersonations whose specialty
was a female cat in heat? The true
Flicks connoisseur reverently
mourns the passing of these giant
