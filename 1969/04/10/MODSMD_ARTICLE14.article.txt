## Apathy Sets Campus Tone 
### John Wilson 
The primary challenge facing
the Stanford Freshman is the
formation of a suitable attitude
towards life. In four years, he
must learn to become part of a
rapidly changing world and, at the
same time, to find the stability
necessary to live in it. He must
find a direction and a set of values
in order to escape a frustrated and
apathetic existence.
Stanford cannot give him these
things: the atmosphere and
attitudes prevalent in this
university afford little more than
increased anxiety. They merely
stimulate the type of extreme
approaches evident in both the
apathetic and revolutionary
students rather than help him
attain the moderate outlook
necessary for successful
participation in the present
American society.
On the personal level, Stanford
totally fails to give direction and
stability to undergraduates.
Considering herself an
"enlightened" university, she
encourages encouter groups,
group therapy, mystical
experiences, discussions of
dreams, etc. in an effort to remain
abreast of the rapid changes in
university living.
Almost blindly, she adopts
experiment after experiment in
modern techniques while totally
disregarding the need for students
to master the "classical" and
proven techniques of self-control
and moderation. Students are
constantly encouraged to share
their problems rather than to
come to terms with them.
Instead of providing an
environment in which the
undergraduate may successfully
form his or her personality,
Stanford denies the validity of all
structures and makes every effort
to duplicate the instability and
lack of direction in the society at
large. The type of faculty
assistants in dorms who can do no
more than emphasize to students
that they are too repressed and
timid ought to join the
psychological branch of the
medical school rather than spend
time kindly convincing every
student that cynicism and

instability is the mark of the
"normal undergraduate."
Under the barrage of irrelevant
and poorly considered programs
and teachers, it is no wonder that,
weighted down with uncertainties,
the student turns for moral
support to cliques and boy-girl
relationships and, adopting the
usual Stanford apathy and lack of
motivation, soon becomes content
to live out his Stanford days
discussing absurd ideas, going to
parties, and getting drunk.
On the social level, Stanford
succeeds no better. The stress
upon relevant involvement as an
alternative to apathy usually only
leads to frustrated and cynical
students. The social-minded
undergraduate is encouraged to
help minority groups through
tutorial programs and work
projects. However, aside from
helping several Negroes and
Mexican-Americans, he achieves
almost nothing. He is given a taste
of poverty and the urban
problems but no hints as to how
they can be solved.
In fact, his courses are
conducted as if the problems did
not even exist. Without "outside
help," he will be destined to four
years of frustration and cynicism
during which he is aware of social
problems yet does not even begin
to see how to cure them but is
positive that the professors don't
even care one way or the other.
Stanford seems to have totally
forgotten that a major purpose of
the university is to provide each
student with the understanding
and the attitudes which will
enable him, when given the
chance, to later initiate reforms in
his own field. The student should
not have to tutor in East Palo
Alto in order to feel he can do
something constructive.
Changes in this situation will
only come about with a change in
the attitudes of the entire
Stanford community. At present,
all eyes are turned inward at
educational problems or off into
the distance at the ARM program
and the Viet Nam war. Little can
be done about Viet Nam
regardless of how many spend
their lunch hour in the plaza. As

regards education, the general
theory seems to be that since the
present requirements are not
relevant to the present world, the
student should be left free to
form his own curriculum.
It never seems to occur to
anyone that the courses
themselves, and not the
requirements, are irrelevant and
that no matter how one shuffles
irrelevant courses and
irrelevant-minded professors
about, one still ends up with
irrelevancy.
The only solution to these
problems is for the Stanford
students to come to terms with
the real difficulty: the general
unwillingness of people to
concern themselves with tangible
and important issues of
community concern.
Instead of constantly
protesting the war, the SDS would
do well to also protest student
apathy and, along with the BSU,
call for conferences on social
problems, a large increase in the
enrollment of minority and poor
students, and the introduction of
courses more relevant to the
contemporary world. The faculty
should be "stimulated" into
action and forced to recognize
community and academic
problems.
As long as the Stanford
community retains its
non-commital attitudes towards
the surrounding community and
towards itself, the stage will be
left to the SDS and other radical
student groups who, although
well-meaning, have little in the
way of realistic and constructive
suggestions to offer.
The responsibility for change
here as in other universities rests
primarily on the shoulders of the
faculty. But, since they have
constantly shown themselves
unwilling to act, it is now up to
the students to make an effort to
rid this campus of its apathy. The
type of lethargy which Stanford
exhibits is nothing less than
irresponsible and must be stopped
for the good of the students and
of the entire university.

left to the SDS and other radical
student groups who, although
well-meaning, have little in the
way of realistic and constructive
suggestions to offer.
The responsibility for change
here as in other universities rests
primarily on the shoulders of the
faculty. But, since they have
constantly shown themselves
unwilling to act, it is now up to
the students to make an effort to
rid this campus of its apathy. The
type of lethargy which Stanford
exhibits is nothing less than
irresponsible and must be stopped
for the good of the students and
of the entire university.
(John Wilson is a senior-Ed.)
The primary challenge facing
the Stanford Freshman is the
formation of a suitable attitude
towards life. In four years, he
must learn to become part of a
rapidly changing world and, at the
same time, to find the stability
necessary to live in it. He must
find a direction and a set of values
in order to escape a frustrated and
apathetic existence.
Stanford cannot give him these
things: the atmosphere and
attitudes prevalent in this
university afford little more than
increased anxiety. They merely
stimulate the type of extreme
approaches evident in both the
apathetic and revolutionary
students rather than help him
attain the moderate outlook
necessary for successful
participation in the present
American society.
On the personal level, Stanford
totally fails to give direction and
stability to undergraduates.
Considering herself an
"enlightened" university, she
encourages encouter groups,
group therapy, mystical
experiences, discussions of
dreams, etc. in an effort to remain
abreast of the rapid changes in
university living.
Almost blindly, she adopts
experiment after experiment in
modern techniques while totally
disregarding the need for students
to master the "classical" and
proven techniques of self-control
and moderation. Students are
constantly encouraged to share
their problems rather than to
come to terms with them.
Instead of providing an
environment in which the
undergraduate may successfully
form his or her personality,
Stanford denies the validity of all
structures and makes every effort
to duplicate the instability and
lack of direction in the society at
large. The type of faculty
assistants in dorms who can do no
more than emphasize to students
that they are too repressed and
timid ought to join the
psychological branch of the
medical school rather than spend
time kindly convincing every
student that cynicism and

instability is the mark of the
"normal undergraduate."
Under the barrage of irrelevant
and poorly considered programs
and teachers, it is no wonder that,
weighted down with uncertainties,
the student turns for moral
support to cliques and boy-girl
relationships and, adopting the
usual Stanford apathy and lack of
motivation, soon becomes content
to live out his Stanford days
discussing absurd ideas, going to
parties, and getting drunk.
On the social level, Stanford
succeeds no better. The stress
upon relevant involvement as an
alternative to apathy usually only
leads to frustrated and cynical
students. The social-minded
undergraduate is encouraged to
help minority groups through
tutorial programs and work
projects. However, aside from
helping several Negroes and
Mexican-Americans, he achieves
almost nothing. He is given a taste
of poverty and the urban
problems but no hints as to how
they can be solved.
In fact, his courses are
conducted as if the problems did
not even exist. Without "outside
help," he will be destined to four
years of frustration and cynicism
during which he is aware of social
problems yet does not even begin
to see how to cure them but is
positive that the professors don't
even care one way or the other.
Stanford seems to have totally
forgotten that a major purpose of
the university is to provide each
student with the understanding
and the attitudes which will
enable him, when given the
chance, to later initiate reforms in
his own field. The student should
not have to tutor in East Palo
Alto in order to feel he can do
something constructive.
Changes in this situation will
only come about with a change in
the attitudes of the entire
Stanford community. At present,
all eyes are turned inward at
educational problems or off into
the distance at the ARM program
and the Viet Nam war. Little can
be done about Viet Nam
regardless of how many spend
their lunch hour in the plaza. As

regards education, the general
theory seems to be that since the
present requirements are not
relevant to the present world, the
student should be left free to
form his own curriculum.
It never seems to occur to
anyone that the courses
themselves, and not the
requirements, are irrelevant and
that no matter how one shuffles
irrelevant courses and
irrelevant-minded professors
about, one still ends up with
irrelevancy.
The only solution to these
problems is for the Stanford
students to come to terms with
the real difficulty: the general
unwillingness of people to
concern themselves with tangible
and important issues of
community concern.
Instead of constantly
protesting the war, the SDS would
do well to also protest student
apathy and, along with the BSU,
call for conferences on social
problems, a large increase in the
enrollment of minority and poor
students, and the introduction of
courses more relevant to the
contemporary world. The faculty
should be "stimulated" into
action and forced to recognize
community and academic
problems.
As long as the Stanford
community retains its
non-commital attitudes towards
the surrounding community and
towards itself, the stage will be

and important issues of
community concern.
Instead of constantly
protesting the war, the SDS would
do well to also protest student
apathy and, along with the BSU,
call for conferences on social
problems, a large increase in the
enrollment of minority and poor
students, and the introduction of
courses more relevant to the
contemporary world. The faculty
should be "stimulated" into
action and forced to recognize
community and academic
problems.
As long as the Stanford
community retains its
non-commital attitudes towards
the surrounding community and
towards itself, the stage will be
left to the SDS and other radical
student groups who, although
well-meaning, have little in the
way of realistic and constructive
suggestions to offer.
The responsibility for change
here as in other universities rests
primarily on the shoulders of the
faculty. But, since they have
constantly shown themselves
unwilling to act, it is now up to
the students to make an effort to
rid this campus of its apathy. The
type of lethargy which Stanford
exhibits is nothing less than
irresponsible and must be stopped
for the good of the students and
of the entire university.
(John Wilson is a senior-Ed.)
The primary challenge facing
the Stanford Freshman is the
formation of a suitable attitude
towards life. In four years, he
must learn to become part of a
rapidly changing world and, at the
same time, to find the stability
necessary to live in it. He must
find a direction and a set of values
in order to escape a frustrated and
apathetic existence.
Stanford cannot give him these
things: the atmosphere and
attitudes prevalent in this
university afford little more than
increased anxiety. They merely
stimulate the type of extreme
approaches evident in both the
apathetic and revolutionary
students rather than help him
attain the moderate outlook
necessary for successful
participation in the present
American society.
On the personal level, Stanford
totally fails to give direction and
stability to undergraduates.
Considering herself an
"enlightened" university, she
encourages encouter groups,
group therapy, mystical
experiences, discussions of
dreams, etc. in an effort to remain
abreast of the rapid changes in
university living.
Almost blindly, she adopts
experiment after experiment in
modern techniques while totally
disregarding the need for students
to master the "classical" and
proven techniques of self-control
and moderation. Students are
constantly encouraged to share
their problems rather than to
come to terms with them.
Instead of providing an
environment in which the
undergraduate may successfully
form his or her personality,
Stanford denies the validity of all
structures and makes every effort
to duplicate the instability and
lack of direction in the society at
large. The type of faculty
assistants in dorms who can do no
more than emphasize to students
that they are too repressed and
timid ought to join the
psychological branch of the
medical school rather than spend
time kindly convincing every
student that cynicism and

instability is the mark of the
"normal undergraduate."
Under the barrage of irrelevant
and poorly considered programs
and teachers, it is no wonder that,
weighted down with uncertainties,
the student turns for moral
support to cliques and boy-girl
relationships and, adopting the
usual Stanford apathy and lack of
motivation, soon becomes content
to live out his Stanford days
discussing absurd ideas, going to
parties, and getting drunk.
On the social level, Stanford
succeeds no better. The stress
upon relevant involvement as an
alternative to apathy usually only
leads to frustrated and cynical
students. The social-minded
undergraduate is encouraged to
help minority groups through
tutorial programs and work
projects. However, aside from
helping several Negroes and
Mexican-Americans, he achieves
almost nothing. He is given a taste
of poverty and the urban
problems but no hints as to how
they can be solved.
In fact, his courses are
conducted as if the problems did
not even exist. Without "outside
help," he will be destined to four
years of frustration and cynicism
during which he is aware of social
problems yet does not even begin
to see how to cure them but is
positive that the professors don't
even care one way or the other.
Stanford seems to have totally
forgotten that a major purpose of
the university is to provide each
student with the understanding
and the attitudes which will
enable him, when given the
chance, to later initiate reforms in
his own field. The student should
not have to tutor in East Palo
Alto in order to feel he can do
something constructive.
Changes in this situation will
only come about with a change in
the attitudes of the entire
Stanford community. At present,
all eyes are turned inward at
educational problems or off into
the distance at the ARM program
and the Viet Nam war. Little can
be done about Viet Nam
regardless of how many spend
their lunch hour in the plaza. As

regards education, the general
theory seems to be that since the
present requirements are not
relevant to the present world, the
student should be left free to
form his own curriculum.
It never seems to occur to
anyone that the courses
themselves, and not the
requirements, are irrelevant and
that no matter how one shuffles
irrelevant courses and
irrelevant-minded professors
about, one still ends up with
irrelevancy.
The only solution to these
problems is for the Stanford
students to come to terms with
the real difficulty: the general
unwillingness of people to
concern themselves with tangible
and important issues of
community concern.
