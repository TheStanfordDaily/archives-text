# From The Ivory Tower
## Do White And Black IQ's Differ? 
### Joshua Lederberg 
"How Much Can We Boost IQ
and Scholastic Achievement?" is a
thoughtful review by Berkeley
psychologist Arthur R. Jensen
that should be read and discussed
by a far larger audience than is
likely to see it in the Winter issue
of the Harvard Educational
Review.
It will be much talked about,
but unfortunately only
secondhand in response to several
popular commentaries that have
emphasized a few controversial
(and I would say incautious)
remarks at the expense of a great
deal of Dr. Jensen's wisdom and
scholarly reserve.
The meat of his discussion
concerns the effort to bridge the
IQ gap between the white and
Negro communities in the United
States. There can be no evasion of
the raw statistics; which are
witnessed by an average reading
retardation of one to three years.
The question is whether we can
design educational programs to
erase that painful statistic.
Focus On Individual
DR. JENSEN is careful to
insist that we focus on individual
capability: genius is neither
lacking among Negroes nor
universal among whites. He does
point out, wearily, that we cannot
overlook the social demand for
programs that concentrate on
compensation for group
handicaps.
His most provocative statement
is his first sentence:
"Compensatory education has
been tried and it apparently has
failed." Unfortunately such a
remark may deter many
proponents of the principle of
compensatory education from
reading the substance of his
criticism.

There is little doubt that many
programs could not begin to meet
the unrealistic expectations of
their enthusiasts. In this sense, we
could argue that every educational
program has failed, and note that
many brilliant men have achieved
their successful place in life in
spite of wholly inappropriate
educational regimes. Many critics
believe that compensatory
education has hardly ever been
tried, and within our present
social framework it may be
impossible to implement with the
rigor needed to achieve prompt
returns. Compensatory education
programs are experiments, and we
will never find out the ingredients
of practical success unless we
apply the kind of harsh criticism
of actual results rather than prior
hopes that Dr. Jensen demands
and illustrates.
Central Issue
Unfortunately Dr. Jensen says
almost nothing about the brutal
fact that, in my view, is the
central issue in the educational
gap —the increasingly bitter
alienation of the races; the
growing disvergence of cultural
loyalties. Taking this into
account, I would have to say that
'intelligence" undoubtedly does
have a very large and relatively
simple fenetic component. In fact,
the genes are all too visible: they
control the color of the skin. In
our present milieu, these genes
may lead a student with the
highest intellectual potential to
turn his back on the hard work of
learning physics, chemistry and
mathematics (which will measure
out as intelligence by middle class
standards) in favor of black
studies that he hoped may meet
his more urgent needs in other
spheres.

The same principle must
operate right back to birth, and
before. At the moment we have
neither the means to measure its
influence on, say, reading skills,
and even less to know how to
cancel it, or even whether we
should try.
JENSEN'S REMARKS on the
heritability of intelligence have
misled some commentators. Much
of his paper is an informatve
restatement of the allocation of
heredity versus environment as
sources of variation in intelligence
within white cultures. He
concludes (and I agree) that
environmental differences in the
groups so far studied account for
less than half the variability,
which is to say that the genes
account for more
We would both stress the
complexities of such a judgement
and how difficult it is to separate
genes from prenatal environment
and disentangle specific
interactions of genes and later
environments. For sake of
hypothesis, we could imagine that
there are different genes that
condition how easily a child can
learn pictograms on the one hand
or alphabetic syllables on the
other. If so it will be quite
important for the actual
intelligence of a particular child
whether he happens to be reared
in Japan or in Sweden though
each country has an excellent
educational system
Jensen correctly criticizes the
exaggerated environmentalist bent
of many psychologists and
educationalists who tend to
minmize such information. He
also cautions that "all the major
heritability studies reported in the
literature are based on samples of
white European and North
American populations, and our
knowledge of the heritability of
intelligence in different racial and
cultural groups within these
populations is nil. For example
no adequate heritability studies
have been based on samples of the
Negro population of the United
States."
THE GENETIC hypothesis is
almost irrelevant to Jensen's most
cogent point Our educational
systems often neglect a child's
strongest capabilities and hold

him back while focusing on his
weaknesses He reports very
encouraging results in teachng
deprived children how to read by
role learning, leaving more
complicated abstractions to a later
stage of their schooling If the
6-year old has a deficit in abstract
thinking, it is relatively
unimportant for educational
policy whether this is the fault of
his genes or a cultural
maladaptation. In many
situations a genetic defect might
be the easier to repair: certainly
we are better equipped to deal
with diabetes or deafness than
with overt racial hostility
Social Crime
The social crime would be to
characterize a child by his coLor
rather than by his individually
tested capabilities, and Jensen
may be doing a great service by
insisting on this kind of
defferentiation
The genetic hypothesis does
matter if it discourages educators
and scientists from probing more
deeply into the crucial early years
of child development The period
from one to three years of age is.
in fact, almost a blank page of
scientific observation although it
is the crucial period of
socialization and language
development. This is no accident:
children of that age are hidden in
the bosom of their families; in
many states it is even legally
forbidden to establish "schools"
for them on the theory that
maternal deprivation would be
fatal to their proper development
The most crucial level in
compensatory education may be
an effort to reach and teach the
mothers of these young children
Teach what? We have no scientific
guidelines yet and there are
pitifully few programs along these
lines.
FOR THIS interval of life
physical factors of development
must not be overlooked: we will
return time and again to
malnutrition; not overt hunger
but dietary imbalance whose
importance Jensen has not
overlooked though he fails to
incorporate it in his general
outlook.
Help of Nutrition
' At least one study shows that

some undermined proportion of
the urban population in the
United States might benefit
substantially with respect to
intellectual development by
improved nutrition. In New York
City, women of low
socio-economic status were given
vitamin and mineral supplements
during pregnancy. These women
gave birth to children who, at 4
years of age, averaged eight points
higher in IQ than a control group
of children whose mothers have
been given placebos during
pregnancy."
With effects like that, why are
we discussing anything else?
WE MUST ADD many other
aspects of the urban environment,
much of it poorly defined but
remediable with ordinary medical
care. An astonishing number of
kids from old slums still turn up
with classical lead poisoning brain
damage from eating flakes of
ancient paint. We do not ease
their problem with lead and
carbon monoxide fumes from
auto exhausts.
Sickle Cell
Finally some specific genes are
related to diseased known to be
more prevalent among Negroes.
Sickle cell trait in Africa is a
defense against death from
malaria, which balances the
impact of the much rarer
fullblown disease, sickle cell
anemia. About 8 per cent of
American Negroes are genetic
carriers of this trait (discovered
by a Negro medical student who
examined his own blood). These
genetic carriers are not anemic or
otherwise clinically ill.
Nevertheless, we need and do not
have the kinds of studies that
would show subtler effects on the
carrier individual under stress. For
example, we do not know
whether carrier children are more
or less intelligent than their
normal siblings. When we have
studies like these, which needless
to say, will involve various genes
distributed among all the races,
we can claim to have made some
tangible headway on the genetics
of intelligence,
