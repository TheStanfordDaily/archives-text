## The 						Chart Gap 
### Art Buchwald 
WASHINGTON-Whenever the
Defense Department has to
convince our lawmakers that the
vital interests of the United States
are in danger, they resort to
elaborate displays of charts. The
development, stockpiling and
delivery of charts is one of the
most critical activities the
Pentagon is involved in.
Through a close friend in the
Pentagon, I was permitted to visit
a top-secret Defense Department
Chart Testing Center where all
charts are tested before they are
sent up to Capitol Hill.
The general in charge of the
center said, "We've been working
day and night on charts for the
ABM congressional hearings. It's
probably the biggest job we've
had, but one misfired chart, and
the whole system could go up n
smoke."
"Is this why the center is
located so far from population
centers?"
"Exactly. We don't want the
taxpayers to know what we're
doing. Also we have to watch
security. The Senate Foreign
Relations Committee has built a
chart system of its own. We
believe our charts are still more
reliable than theirs, but we have
to be ready with a second-strike
capability in case they launch a
damaging first-strike chart
offensive."
"How did the charts the Senate
Foreign Relations sub-committee
unveiled at the ABM hearings last
week differ from yours?"
The general smiled. "They
were very prmitive-what we
could call 'first generation' charts.
You probably noticed their charts
were so large that Sen. Gore was
unable to reach the top of them
with his pointer. Now, we've been
in the chart business a lot longer

than the Senate, so we've
managed to take advantage of the
great strides in miniaturization,
and our smaller charts can be
launched from any easel with the
same impact as their large ones.
We can launch four charts to their
one; or, if you want to put it
another way, one Pentagon chart
represents an overkill of 13 Senate
charts."
"What are those men doing
over there?"
"They're training for chart
turning."
"I beg your pardon?::
"The military has its own chart
turners, who have to know when
to turn a chart to the exact
second.
"It must require a great deal of
skill," I said.
"All of our chart turners have
been to the National War College
and have been personally
interviewed by Adm. Tickover. If
you recall, a few weeks ago when
Sen. Gore's subcommittee
produced its charts against the
ABM system, they had to press
their chief counsel and his
assistant into service as chart
turners. It was a disaster."
"What is that building over
there with the machine guns on it
and all the MPs around it?"
"That's where we're developing
a new top-secret automatic
chart-turning machine. One it is
deployed, no Senate committee
will dare to attack a Defense
Department budget."
"But won't this spiral the chart
race and force the subcommittee
to develop its own automatic
chart turner?"
The general said, "When the
security of the Pentagon is at
stake, we are not interested in
chart parity."
