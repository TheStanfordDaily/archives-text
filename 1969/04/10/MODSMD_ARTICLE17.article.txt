## Student Exchanges Growing 
### Vishist K. Vaid-Raizada 
The international exchange of
students is one of the most
ancient traditions of the
scholarship.
The oldest known historical
record of this tradition is found in
Taxila, India (now Pakistan)
which was a well known
education centre in "secular
studies," as early as six centuries
before christian era. It had
attracted students from Iran and
Mesopotamia.
A century later, the great
reputation of Academy in Athens
had drawn students from far off
lands to study under eminent
philosophers such as Plato and
Aristotle. But a truly international
exchange of students had not
existed until the emergence of
Moslem civilization in Middle
East, when there grew up a series
of universities at Alexandria,
Damascus, Cairo, Bagdad, etc."
The light of these universities
shone far beyond the Moslem
world, and drew students to them
from east and west; there were a
great number of christian
students."
During the colonial period
Europe became the world center
of learning and education.
Industrial revolution and

development of science and
technology brought to the
Western shores students from
almost every continent. Even to
this day this trend remains
unchanged.
Because of American
isolationism, the history of
foreign students in the United
States is barely a few decades old.
The partial destruction of Europe
during the second world war and
emergence of United States as a
great world power and a symbol
of scientific and technological
advancement, brought to this
country a large number of foreign
students. A much larger number
than ever was attracted to any
country anywhere in the world, at
any time in the history of
mankind. The generous financial
aid provided by American
universities and several
foundations was also very helpful
in creating a foreign student
boom.
Although the number of
foreign students in United States
is larger than in any other
country, it is less than two
percent of the total college and
university enrollment, compared
to 10 percent in Britain and 48
percent in Switzerland.

Out of the nearly 110,000
foreign students in United States,
46 percent are Asians, 20 percent
from Latin America, 14 percent
from Europe, 6 percent Africans
and the rest from North America.
Canadians, with more than
12,000 students make up the
largest number of students from a
single foreign country. India with
more than 8,000 students sent the
second largest number. During the
last fifteen years there has been a
seven-fold increase in African
students, the Asian students
increased by four times, the
students from Latin America
trippled and the European
students doubled their number.
California attracts the largest
number of foreign students, 17
percent of the national total. The
reason is obvious. Besides
furnishing excellent education
facilities, California also provides
a matchless climate.
Among the prestigeous
universities, MIT has the highest
proportion of foreign students.
Stanford ranks tenth.
The foreign scholar is a very
desirable component of any
educational institution; he has in
fact become the measure of a
university's international prestige.
