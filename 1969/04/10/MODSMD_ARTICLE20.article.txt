# Mail ROTC Vote Awaited
## 
### FRANK MILLER 
Supporters of both the majority and
minority reports of the recent ad hoc
committee on ROTC seemed satisfied to
submit the decision to a mail
referendum of all faculty members.
This decision was reached at last
Friday's Academic Council meeting.
The meeting was attended by 400 of the
1000 faculty members and no one could
argue that it would be harmful to
contact the entire faculty regarding such
an important issue as the academic
credit of ROTC courses.
According to Academic Secretary
Donald Winbigler, the actual decision of
the April 4 meeting was to send a mail
referendum to all faculty members of
the Academic Council. The faculty
would vote whether they approved or
disapproved of the Academic Senate's
decision to deny academic credit for
ROTC. Approval would require
President Pitfcer to negotiate with the
Department of Defense to work out an
ROTC program that would not include
credit for ROTC classes.
Disapproval of the Academic
Senate's decision has been interpreted
to give President Pitzer one year to
negotiate with the Department of
Defense to work out an acceptable
ROTC program with only broad
guidelines restricting him. When a
program has been decided upon,
President Pitzer would report back to
the Academic Senate for subsequent
approval or disapproval. This decision
could then be appealed to the entire
Academic for subsequent approval or

disapproval. This decision could then be
appealed to the entire Academic
Council.
Details Not Set
Winbingler indicated that the details
for the referendum will be worked out
at the Academic Senate's meeting
tomorrow, but that the ballots will
probably be mailed out early next week
and that there will be a deadline for
return of April 30.
This late deadline would allow for
further discussion of the issues through
publication in the Daily and Campus
Report, a weekly newsletter published
for the university's faculty and staff. It
would also give faculty members who
are at great distances from Stanford
time to return their ballots.
The Palo Alto Times called the
Council's decision "a setback to a group
of primarily young professors who have
been agitating for a hard immediate
anti-ROTC position by the Academic
Council."
Disagreement
However, members of the Council
disagreed with that analysis. Joseph D.
Sneed, associate professor of philosophy
and a supporter of the Senate's approval
of the majority report, said, "I don't
think that it was a defeat at all. I think
it is a good idea for the entire faculty to
vote on something as important as
ROTC."
Prof. Sneed indicated that he felt
that the "crucual issue is whether the
faculty is going to assert itself and tell
the president" what to do about ROTC.
"It would be irresponsible to delegate

power to President Pitzer," as the
disapproval of the Senate's action would
require. The faculty has control over
academic credit. For that reason, he
opposed the delegation of the authority
to Pitzer.
David M. Mason, professor of
chemical engineering, also felt that the
mail referendum was a good idea.
However, Prof. Mason, one of the 14
faculty members who purchased an
advertisement in last Friday's Daily to
ask for further consideration of the
ROTC issue, disagreed, "I don't see how
we are passing responsibility. The
President is in a position to negotiate
and work out an acceptable program."
Pro-ROTC Encouraged
Although the decision by the Council
was not a vote to retain credit for
ROTC courses, pro-ROTC faculty
members were pleased with the
decision. It was their proposal and a
delaying in the final decision regarding
ROTC. Ever since the original
committee report and its approval by
the Senate, the supporters of
have been on the defensive and have
been stalling for more time and
discussion.
Any decision that was not an
approval of the Senate's decision to
deny credit for ROTC courses, even if it
was no decision, must be considered a
very limited victory for the supporters
of ROTC.
Faculty members have been very
reluctant to speculate on the outcome
of the referendum.
