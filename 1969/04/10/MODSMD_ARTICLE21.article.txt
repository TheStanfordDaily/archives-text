# Program 'Best Yet'
## Producer Discusses Summer Festival 
### 
'"Given this year's late start,"
commented Stephen Baffrey on
his preparation for 1969's
Stanford Summer Festival, "we
don't have any right to have
obtained' as good a season as is
now lined up."
With the major negotiations for
the coming festival now
completed, Baffrey added, "we
should all look heavenward and
breathe a sigh of relief."
Baffrey, who has produced the
Summer Festival since its start in
1964, believes that this year's
season is "the best one yet."
"Each season has seen an
expansion of the concept of the
summer festival," Baffrey stated,
"and each year, we've been able
to pull together a uniquely
different season with its own
inherent excitement."
Off-Broadway
This season, for example,
marks the first time that
Off-Broadway hits will be
presented at Stanford with the
original casts.
This theatrical portion is
'really a festival within a
festival," Baffrey remarked.
The six Off-Broadway
productions include two musicals,
two comedies, and two "very

serious dramas—neither of which
is really a play."
One of the dramas, "To Be
Young, Gifted, and Black," by
Lorraine Hansberry, has been
described by Wall Street Journal
as "a beautiful and moving piece
of theater ... an affecting portrait
of an exceptionally intelligent and
sensitive human being."
Drug Addiction
The story surrounds drug
addiction and is performed by
eight former drug addicts and is a
look at the world and the life
style of the blacks, according to
Baffrey.
The other theatrical
productions will consist of
"Jacques Brel is Alive and Well in
Paris," "In Circles," "An Evening
With Merlin Finch," "The
Concept," and two performances
by the Bil Baird Marionette
Theater.
"These six productions,"
stated Baffrey, "in many ways
represent the current
Off-Broadway movement."
"No theater season anywhere
in America,"he added, "is as
exciting or as varied as Stanford's
summer season promises to be.
"We're offering six fresh new
approaches to the theater . . . and

we're not only dealing with
experts but also with hits."
Music
A second "festival within the
festival" is created by the musical
portion of this summer's program.
"We're expecting to present
here," remarked Baffrey, "the
best talent from the international
music field."
Returning after several
previous summer successes at
Stanford, for example, will be the
New York Pro Musica. "This year,
however," explained Baffrey, "the
Pro Musica will be presenting a
whole new view of themselves."
Their program, ''An
Entertainment for Elizabeth," a
recreation of an Elizabethan
Court Masque, will represent their
first appearance on the West Coast
in such a full-length production.
"This is an example of one of the
challenges that confronts us in
planning out a summer
festival . . . how to make returning
talent into an exciting, new, and
different attraction," commented
Baffrey.
The return of the Joffrey
Ballet, which will be performing
seven new ballets never presented
before on the West Coast, seems
to embody another of Mr.
Baffrey's successes in rendering
"new out of the old."
'Astarte'
One of Joffrey's ballets to be
presented is the controversial
"Astarte," which was recently
written up in Life magazine.
"Astarte," has been called
Joffrey's own "wild, mod, rock,
psychedelic and 'total theater'
masterpiece," and Baffrey added
that it is perhaps the "greatest
ballet of the decade."
The Preservation Hall Jazz
Band, which represents the "ice
cream of the season," has also
been rescheduled in response to
over 2000 requests for its return.
One of the most significant
innovations of this year's festival
will be a joint concert by the New
York Rock and Roll Ensemble
and the New York Chamber
Soloists, entitled "Roch/Bach
"Rock/Italian."

The two groups will be
comparing and performing
classical and rock music forms in
an attempt to show that "great
musical forms didn't die out"
with the advent of rock and roll
music, "but their shape has just
been changed somewhat," Baffrey
explained.
''The Stanford Summer
Festival," Baffrey commented in
retrospect, "has acquired the
prestige and the reputation of
being both innovative and
excitingly programmed. The fact
that it is one of the distinguished
international festivals of the world
is what is attractive to our
performers."
Baffrey also discussed the
possibility of having a third
"internal festival" in the form of a
series of major film premieres.
"We've been negotiating with
producers such as
Cassavetes . . . and Pausolini,"
explained Baffrey in the
organization of a series of
premieres at Stanford of their
1969 films.
Definite scheduling, however,
probably will not be completed
before May.
Discussions
One aspect of the Summer
Festival Program that audiences
are not usually aware of is that
the performers usually double as
teachers or guest lecturers at
Stanford. Most of the
English-speaking performers, in
addition, lead audience
discussions or briefing sessions as
part of their program
Organist Catharine Crozier, for
example, will not only be giving
two concerts in Dinkelspiel but
will also instruct a master class in
piano while at the University.
The Pro Musica Company will
also be involved in teaching during
the summer academic session.
Although most of the season
performances have already been
arranged, Baffrey admits that a lot
of preparatory work remains to be
tackled. Although he only needs

five and perhaps no more than
eight movie premieres in order to
initiate a film series, Baffrey
admts that "even if we were
Hooded with forty offers, I'd find
a way of producing them if it
looked like the right thing to
do- and we'd have a whale of a
time doing it!"
In essence, stated Baffrey, "a
lot of what we produce may not
represent any academic
landmarks, but we're all going to
have a lot of good fun. '

completed, Baffrey added, "we
should all look heavenward and
breathe a sigh of relief."
Baffrey, who has produced the
Summer Festival since its start in
1964, believes that this year's
season is "the best one yet."
"Each season has seen an
expansion of the concept of the
summer festival," Baffrey stated,
"and each year, we've been able
to pull together a uniquely
different season with its own
inherent excitement."
Off-Broadway
This season, for example,
marks the first time that
Off-Broadway hits will be
presented at Stanford with the
original casts.
This theatrical portion is
'really a festival within a
festival," Baffrey remarked.
The six Off-Broadway
productions include two musicals,
two comedies, and two "very

serious dramas—neither of which
is really a play."
One of the dramas, "To Be
Young, Gifted, and Black," by
Lorraine Hansberry, has been
described by Wall Street Journal
as "a beautiful and moving piece
of theater ... an affecting portrait
of an exceptionally intelligent and
sensitive human being."
Drug Addiction
The story surrounds drug
addiction and is performed by
eight former drug addicts and is a
look at the world and the life
style of the blacks, according to
Baffrey.
The other theatrical
productions will consist of
"Jacques Brel is Alive and Well in
Paris," "In Circles," "An Evening
With Merlin Finch," "The
Concept," and two performances
by the Bil Baird Marionette
Theater.
"These six productions,"
stated Baffrey, "in many ways
represent the current
Off-Broadway movement."
"No theater season anywhere
in America,"he added, "is as
exciting or as varied as Stanford's
summer season promises to be.
"We're offering six fresh new
approaches to the theater . . . and

we're not only dealing with
experts but also with hits."
Music
A second "festival within the
festival" is created by the musical
portion of this summer's program.
"We're expecting to present
here," remarked Baffrey, "the
best talent from the international
music field."
Returning after several
previous summer successes at
Stanford, for example, will be the
New York Pro Musica. "This year,
however," explained Baffrey, "the
Pro Musica will be presenting a
whole new view of themselves."
Their program, ''An
Entertainment for Elizabeth," a
recreation of an Elizabethan
Court Masque, will represent their
first appearance on the West Coast
in such a full-length production.
"This is an example of one of the
challenges that confronts us in
planning out a summer
festival . . . how to make returning
talent into an exciting, new, and
different attraction," commented
Baffrey.
The return of the Joffrey
Ballet, which will be performing
seven new ballets never presented
before on the West Coast, seems
to embody another of Mr.
Baffrey's successes in rendering
"new out of the old."
'Astarte'
One of Joffrey's ballets to be
presented is the controversial
"Astarte," which was recently
written up in Life magazine.
"Astarte," has been called
Joffrey's own "wild, mod, rock,
psychedelic and 'total theater'
masterpiece," and Baffrey added
that it is perhaps the "greatest
ballet of the decade."
The Preservation Hall Jazz
Band, which represents the "ice
cream of the season," has also
been rescheduled in response to
over 2000 requests for its return.
One of the most significant
innovations of this year's festival
will be a joint concert by the New
York Rock and Roll Ensemble
and the New York Chamber
Soloists, entitled "Roch/Bach
"Rock/Italian."

The two groups will be
comparing and performing
classical and rock music forms in
an attempt to show that "great
musical forms didn't die out"
with the advent of rock and roll
music, "but their shape has just
been changed somewhat," Baffrey
explained.
''The Stanford Summer
Festival," Baffrey commented in
retrospect, "has acquired the
prestige and the reputation of
being both innovative and
excitingly programmed. The fact
that it is one of the distinguished
international festivals of the world
is what is attractive to our
performers."
Baffrey also discussed the
possibility of having a third
"internal festival" in the form of a
series of major film premieres.
"We've been negotiating with
producers such as
Cassavetes . . . and Pausolini,"
explained Baffrey in the
organization of a series of
premieres at Stanford of their
1969 films.
Definite scheduling, however,
probably will not be completed
before May.
Discussions
One aspect of the Summer
Festival Program that audiences
are not usually aware of is that
the performers usually double as
teachers or guest lecturers at
Stanford. Most of the
English-speaking performers, in
addition, lead audience
discussions or briefing sessions as
part of their program
Organist Catharine Crozier, for
example, will not only be giving
two concerts in Dinkelspiel but
will also instruct a master class in
piano while at the University.
The Pro Musica Company will
also be involved in teaching during
the summer academic session.
Although most of the season
performances have already been
arranged, Baffrey admits that a lot
of preparatory work remains to be
tackled. Although he only needs

five and perhaps no more than
eight movie premieres in order to
initiate a film series, Baffrey
admts that "even if we were
Hooded with forty offers, I'd find
a way of producing them if it
looked like the right thing to
do- and we'd have a whale of a
time doing it!"
In essence, stated Baffrey, "a
lot of what we produce may not
represent any academic
landmarks, but we're all going to
have a lot of good fun. '
'"Given this year's late start,"
commented Stephen Baffrey on
his preparation for 1969's
Stanford Summer Festival, "we
don't have any right to have

"and each year, we've been able
to pull together a uniquely
different season with its own
inherent excitement."
Off-Broadway
This season, for example,
marks the first time that
Off-Broadway hits will be
presented at Stanford with the
original casts.
This theatrical portion is
'really a festival within a
festival," Baffrey remarked.
The six Off-Broadway
productions include two musicals,
two comedies, and two "very

serious dramas—neither of which
is really a play."
One of the dramas, "To Be
Young, Gifted, and Black," by
Lorraine Hansberry, has been
described by Wall Street Journal
as "a beautiful and moving piece
of theater ... an affecting portrait
of an exceptionally intelligent and
sensitive human being."
Drug Addiction
The story surrounds drug
addiction and is performed by
eight former drug addicts and is a
look at the world and the life
style of the blacks, according to
Baffrey.
The other theatrical
productions will consist of
"Jacques Brel is Alive and Well in
Paris," "In Circles," "An Evening
With Merlin Finch," "The
Concept," and two performances
by the Bil Baird Marionette
Theater.
"These six productions,"
stated Baffrey, "in many ways
represent the current
Off-Broadway movement."
"No theater season anywhere
in America,"he added, "is as
exciting or as varied as Stanford's
summer season promises to be.
"We're offering six fresh new
approaches to the theater . . . and

we're not only dealing with
experts but also with hits."
Music
A second "festival within the
festival" is created by the musical
portion of this summer's program.
"We're expecting to present
here," remarked Baffrey, "the
best talent from the international
music field."
Returning after several
previous summer successes at
Stanford, for example, will be the
New York Pro Musica. "This year,
however," explained Baffrey, "the
Pro Musica will be presenting a
whole new view of themselves."
Their program, ''An
Entertainment for Elizabeth," a
recreation of an Elizabethan
Court Masque, will represent their
first appearance on the West Coast
in such a full-length production.
"This is an example of one of the
challenges that confronts us in
planning out a summer
festival . . . how to make returning
talent into an exciting, new, and
different attraction," commented
Baffrey.
The return of the Joffrey
Ballet, which will be performing
seven new ballets never presented
before on the West Coast, seems
to embody another of Mr.
Baffrey's successes in rendering
"new out of the old."
'Astarte'
One of Joffrey's ballets to be
presented is the controversial
"Astarte," which was recently
written up in Life magazine.
"Astarte," has been called
Joffrey's own "wild, mod, rock,
psychedelic and 'total theater'
masterpiece," and Baffrey added
that it is perhaps the "greatest
ballet of the decade."
The Preservation Hall Jazz
Band, which represents the "ice
cream of the season," has also
been rescheduled in response to
over 2000 requests for its return.
One of the most significant
innovations of this year's festival
will be a joint concert by the New
York Rock and Roll Ensemble
and the New York Chamber
Soloists, entitled "Roch/Bach
"Rock/Italian."

The two groups will be
comparing and performing
classical and rock music forms in
an attempt to show that "great
musical forms didn't die out"
with the advent of rock and roll
music, "but their shape has just
been changed somewhat," Baffrey
explained.
''The Stanford Summer
Festival," Baffrey commented in
retrospect, "has acquired the
prestige and the reputation of
being both innovative and
excitingly programmed. The fact
that it is one of the distinguished
international festivals of the world
is what is attractive to our
performers."
Baffrey also discussed the
possibility of having a third
"internal festival" in the form of a
series of major film premieres.
"We've been negotiating with
producers such as
Cassavetes . . . and Pausolini,"
explained Baffrey in the
organization of a series of
premieres at Stanford of their
1969 films.
Definite scheduling, however,
probably will not be completed
before May.
Discussions
One aspect of the Summer
Festival Program that audiences
are not usually aware of is that
the performers usually double as
teachers or guest lecturers at
Stanford. Most of the
English-speaking performers, in
addition, lead audience
discussions or briefing sessions as
part of their program
Organist Catharine Crozier, for
example, will not only be giving
two concerts in Dinkelspiel but
will also instruct a master class in
piano while at the University.
The Pro Musica Company will
also be involved in teaching during
the summer academic session.
Although most of the season
performances have already been
arranged, Baffrey admits that a lot
of preparatory work remains to be
tackled. Although he only needs

five and perhaps no more than
eight movie premieres in order to
initiate a film series, Baffrey
admts that "even if we were
Hooded with forty offers, I'd find
a way of producing them if it
looked like the right thing to
do- and we'd have a whale of a
time doing it!"
In essence, stated Baffrey, "a
lot of what we produce may not
represent any academic
landmarks, but we're all going to
have a lot of good fun. '
'"Given this year's late start,"
commented Stephen Baffrey on
his preparation for 1969's
Stanford Summer Festival, "we
don't have any right to have
obtained' as good a season as is
now lined up."
With the major negotiations for
the coming festival now
completed, Baffrey added, "we
should all look heavenward and
breathe a sigh of relief."
Baffrey, who has produced the
Summer Festival since its start in
1964, believes that this year's
season is "the best one yet."
"Each season has seen an
expansion of the concept of the
summer festival," Baffrey stated,
"and each year, we've been able
to pull together a uniquely
different season with its own
inherent excitement."
