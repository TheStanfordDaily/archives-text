# Science Fair Set On Nerve Gases
## 
### 
''How do nerve gases work?"
"Why are viruses so deadly?"
"What are the effects of massive
defoliation programs on human,
plant and animal life?'
These and related questions
will be discussed today at a
science fair organized by a group
of graduate students "to
dramatize the perils and
implications of chemical and
biological warfare research on
living things."
Exhibits ranging from how to
grow deadly bacteria to delivery
systems of lethal gases and other
chemical and biological warfare
weapons will be open for the.
public at 7:30 p.m. in Tresidder.
Memorial Union, and will be
followed by informal discussions
led by students.
The event, organized by Andy
Smith, a graduate student in
neurological sciences and a
member of the Chemical-Biolog
ical Warfare Study Group, is
sponsored by the Stanford
Research Institute Coalition, a
group of students and faculty
members favoring stricter
University control of SRI
programs.
Smith said there is a need to
educate the layman about the
nature of research done on
chemical and biological warfare.
At the same time, Smith added,
actual demonstrations of such
work would allow students to
understand chemical and
biological warfare research far
better than if they merely listened
to lectures on the subject.
Another purpose of the fair is
to bring closer to home SRl's role
in classified research.
"Basically we feel that SRI, as
a University-related institution,
should not be allowed to conduct
research designed to harm
people," Smith, a member of the
SRI Coalition, explained. "At

present, most of this research is
classified.
"We feel that if SRI were made
a more official part of Stanford
University, it would be possible to
insure that no classified projects
be undertaken by the Institute.
' Then, with full knowledge of
what was being studied, the
Stanford-SRI community could
judge whether such research were
in line with the statement from
the SRI charter, 'for peace and
prosperity of mankind."
