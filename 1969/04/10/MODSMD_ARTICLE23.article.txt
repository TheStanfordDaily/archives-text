## Housing Query On Ballot 
### 
On April 15 and 16, the
following Housing Referendum
will appear on the ballot along
with the ASSU candidates. The
Referendum poses questions

housing is especially hard on
foreign students, many of whom

foreign students, many of whom
return home when unable to find
a place to live.
