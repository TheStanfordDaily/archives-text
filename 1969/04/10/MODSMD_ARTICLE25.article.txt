Based on their Committee of
15 experience, Bob Cory and
Eckhard Shulz are campaigning
for "change induced by direct
negotiations with the
administration."
Cory, a junior in political
science, and Shulz, a graduate
student in electrical engineering,
have teamed up for the ASSU
executive race because they are
"in agreement on the basic
philosophy of what student
government at Stanford should
be."
They have worked together on
the Committee of 15, Stanford's
highest negotiating body, this year

and are convinced that they can
work together effectively as ASSU
president and vice-president.
In addition to his Committee
of 15 work, Bob Cory, from
Chicago, Illinois, has been a
member of the student legislature
(LASSU). His running mate,
Eckhard Shulz, has also served on
C-15 and has been a LASSU
representative. Shulz has been
doing graduate work at Stanford
for several years and is now a
Ph.D. candidate.
Three Primary Issues
When asked to summarize the
thrust of their platform, Cory
listed three primary issues:
representative government,
increasing the options for the
individual at Stanford, and
encouraging the creation of an
"open forum" on White Plaza.
Cory maintains that student
government has ceased to serve a
representative function. Three
times in the last 11 months
LASSU and student body
referendums have repudiated
tactics of violence and
intimidation. Yet the ASSU
officers remain silent on the issue.
Cory suggests that ASSU officers
must heed the voice of the
student body when it is reflected
through LASSU or referendums.
"Increasing the options of the
individual at Stanford," includes
two of Cory's more creative
programs: creation of a
Department of Urban Affairs and
the elimination of specific course
requirements for graduation
