"I'm Hughie Mac Donald. I hate
you," says the most apolitical of
the candidates for ASSU
President. Hughie Mac Donald and
Bobby Weisenberg are "hate
candidates."
"Don't vote for me," says
Mac Donald. "Tell everybody not
to vote for me. If you vote for
me, I'll hate you. If you hate me,
vote for me."
Their platform is "equal hate

lor all and that which pleases,
teaches." They are aiming at the
general apathy on the Stanford
campus. "Apathy in general
signifies a tremendous amount of
hate and repressed energies,"
Mac Donald explains.
"When people can start
expressing their hate to all things,
they will free up that repression,"
he says. "To the degree that you
can express hate, you can express.
To hate is to give something. That
is why I want a strong losing."
Mac Donald, a senior majoring
in Psychology, has spent his years
at Stanford learning how to learn.
As he puts it, he has been "using
college as a tool to learn what
education isn't." He believes that
people learn what they are
interested in, not what they are
forced to absorb.
Mac Donald spent his first three
years at Stanford in Engineering.
Last year he took a variety of
courses which interested him, and
this year he hopes to finish up in
psychology. He feels that the
University "represses you and
forces you to learn elsewhere."
When asked for the story of his
life, he told the Daily in his
predictably unpredictable style:
"I was born in a manger. I was
preserved by my parents in a
bottle of Charlemagne. I went to
school for 12 years, then I got
educated." "How?," you ask, and
he tells you, "When I started
talking to a yogi."
