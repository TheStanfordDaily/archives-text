Eliminating the alienation the
majority of students feel toward
their elected government is the
primary objective of the
candidacy of Jim Schneider and
Al Dulan.
Schneider, a member of the
Committee of 1 5 and LASSU, and
Dulan, presently state-wide
correspondent for the Black
Student Union (BSU), joined
together for the election "because
of a similarity of background and
because to a large extent our two
minds seem to be going on the
same track."
Schneider declared, "We are
two individuals primarily
concerned with getting more
involvement in student
government from minority groups
and the middle of the political
spectrum."
Schneider, a 26 year old
psychology major, and Dulan, a
27 year old junior in biology, are
both veterans (Dulan won the
purple heart in Vietnam).
The two friends originally
teamed together to form the
Stanford Veterans on Campus.
The organization, explained
Schneider, worked out well and
demonstrated that the two can
work efficiently together.
No Communication
Dulan criticized previous

student government at Stanford
declaring, "a majority of students
have never had a speaking
relationship with ASSU officers."
He commented that minorities
particularly feel left out of
student politics and
decision-making processes because
there has been little effort to
involve them.
Schneider and Dulan plan to
rectify the situation by keeping
open communication channels to
all segments of the student
community and by increasing the
variety of students participating
on committees.
Schneider attributed the
alienation he sees among a
majority of students to either the
feeling that student government is
"mickey mouse" or distaste for
governments that seem to be "too
far to the left and too interested
in national issues."
