"Some people say that my
candidacy is a joke. I believe that
student government is a joke now.
I am not running for president of
the ASSU, but for dictator. I
intend to be a benovolent
despot," says Allan Wernick,
candidate for the office of ASSU
president. He and his running mate
Lawrence Gamble maintain that
they are running to protest the
"super—achievers" that are on
the ballot.
Rather than talk about changes
and form committees, Gamble
and Wernick plan to abolish all
committees and to initiate
immediate changes when
necessary.
The main focus of the
Wernick-Gamble campaign is a
liberated student body and the
promise of "a good time for
everyone."
Above Influence
Politically, the two say that
they are above influence by either
left or right wing groups. They
profess to have God on their side.
They also say that they will not
condemn any spontaneous
campus "expression."
Although they will not
kow-tow to the Administration,
Wernick and Gamble gave
assurances that they will be open
for any communication from any
group.
"We will by-pass the Trustees
and take what we want," says
Wernick, who maintains that
Trustees are too old, and would
not listen anyway.
More Girls
Besides promising good times
to everyone, Wernick and Gamble
promise that there will be "more
girls on this campus."
The two running mates who
are both freshmen living in Cedro,
stated that it is not the issues that
are important, but the whole
philosophy of student
government. ''Student
government as it now stands
cannot be effective," says
Wernick, and"the most effective
change comes from the students
themselves if they can get
themselves together."
