Julius Epstein, a Hoover
Institution research associate at
Stanford, has lost the first round
in his court fight to get the Army
to declassify a 20-year-old report
on the forced repatriation of
nearly one million anti-communist
Russian prisoners after World War
11.
Called "Operational Keelhaul,"
the U.S.-backed repatriation
resulted in the deaths of many
thousands of Russians who had
sought political asylum after
taking up arms with the Germans
to fight Stalin in the closing days
of the war, Epstein maintains.
His efforts to obtain pertinent
government documents through
action as a private citizen are
believed to be the first to seek
declassification under the
Administrative Procedure Act of
1966 amendments.
Rejected Feb *19 by Judge
Oliver J. Carter of the U.S.
District Court in San Francisco,
the case will be appealed,
according to Epstein.
The Act provides that "each
agency, on request for identifiable
records . . . shall make the records
available to any person. On
complaint, the District
Court . . . has jurisdiction to
enjoin the agency from
withholding any records and to
order the production of any
agency records improperly
held . . .
"In such a case, the court shall
determine the matter de novo and
the burden is on the agency to
sustain its action . . . (except) to
matters that are specifically
required by Executive Order to be
kept secret in the interest of
national defense or foreign
policy."
