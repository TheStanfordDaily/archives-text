# Metcalf Warns
## 'Destroying Environment' 
### EILEEN HALEY 
"We are destroying our environment
much faster than we are taking steps to
preserve it" warned Senator Lee Metcalf
in a speech last night in Stanford's
Bishop Auditorium.
While some federal departments are
pushing "too little and too late"
conservation programs, he said, "not
enough has been done in this area,
where the real culprit is the Federal
government and the state road
commissions."
"If we keep on poisoning the water
we drink, destroying the soil on which
we depend, contaminating the air we
breathe, destroying our natural
habitat . . .we will fade out as a race of
men." the Montana Democrat
continued.
Metcalf delivered the annual
Distinguished Alumnus Lecture entitled
"Conservation in a Dynamic and
Evolving Society."
No Place For Violence
"I believe in campus unrest and
confrontations.. .but violence and
coercion have no place on campus,"
Metcalf declared during an afternoon
press conference with the Daily.
"Academic freedom is not enhanced by
violence, especially when the national
Guard is called in" he pointed out.
Metcalf endorsed his senior colleague
Mike Mansfield's suggestion that the
U.S. withdraw 50,000 troops from
Vietnam immediately, during an earlier
press conference at S.F. International
airport. "We need to withdraw more
than that, actually," the Senator said,
"we made a big mistake going into
Vietnam in the first place."
Commenting on the Paris peace talks,
he stated that "Nixon's administration
is in a position to do many things the
old administration couldn't" so "I have
hopes" about the outcome of the talks.
Offshore Drilling
Referring to the Santa Barbard oil
leak, the ardent conservationist
remarked that "offshore oil drilling
should be prohibited until we can
explore what precautions need to be
taken." He scoffed at the recent
Washington pronouncement by

Secretary of the Interior Hickel
concerning "stringent" new off-shore
drilling regulations: "Certainly they are
stringent because up til now there were
none whatsoever. Our need for oil is less
serious than our need for saving the
coastal ecology and the wildlife."
Declaring that President Nixon is
"desperate" for votes on de-escalation
of the war in exchange for support on
the ABM system, Metcalf explained that
he didn't mean that a "political deal"
would be made, but rather a
"non-public commitment" by the
President. However, he stressed he is
opposed to the ABM system in toto, as
are both the senators from North
Dakota, the nly other proposed ABM
site.
Senator Metcalf said that filling the
San Francisco Bay is "a great tragedy"
and that he hoped "we can get some
sort of relief before it is destroyed."
Fond Memories
He said he had many fond memories
of the Bay as it used to be in the middle
30's when he was a Stanford student

and although it is too late in some
respects it's "not too late to stop
further destruction."
The junior senator from Montana, a
1936 Stanford graduate, introduced the
first wildlife preservation bill in
Congress. Five national groups have
cited the Senator for distinguished
service to conservation.
In his speech, Metcalf noted a dismal
roster of destructive things man is doing
to himself: water pollution, rash use of
insecticides, smog, diminishment of
recreation areas.
Forest Service
The Forest Service, probably the
most respected and best organized
administrators of soil conservation
policy in America, has turned to clear
cut lumbering practices which have
resulted in watershed erosion on a scale
that has not been equalled since the
closing days of the last century when
the lumber barons stripped the forests
of the Middle West," Sen. Metcalf
charged.
