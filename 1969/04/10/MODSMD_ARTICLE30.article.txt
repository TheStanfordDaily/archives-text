# Quake Seminar
## 
### 
While Hashbury hippies
prepare to flee San Francisco on
the strength of an earthquake
prediction for April 19, more
responsible members of the region
will gather at Stanford University
Thursday for a seminar on
"Geologic Jeopardy in the Bay
Area."
Dean Richard H. Jahns of
Stanford's School of Earth
Sciences will be the opening
keynote speaker at 9 a.m.
Builders, bankers, government
officials and others concerned
with the future of the Bay Area
environment have signed up to
attend the two-day gathering.
Other speakers are Prof. Arvid
M. Johnson: "Expansive and
Creeping Soils"; Prof. William R.
Dickinson: "Faulting and
Earthquakes"; Prof. Arthur D.
Howard: "Shoreline Stability";
and Prof. George Tchobanoglous:
"Waste Disposal."
Lloyd S. Cluff, an Oakland
geologist, will discuss
' 4 L andslides—Their Causes,
Effects, Prevention and
Correction." George Mader, town
planner for Portola Valley and
Los Altos Hills, will speak on
44 City Planning and Geologic
Problems—The Portola Valley
Experience."
On the F'riday seminar
attendees will board chartered
buses for a look at the San
Andreas Fault in the Silver Lakes
and Daly City areas, and conclude
with a visit to the filled-land
community of Foster.
The course is designed to
provide a "sampling of the
principal geology-based problems
that face all residents of the San
Francisco Bay Region," the
sponsors state.
"It is particularly designed to
improve the acquaintance of those
decision-making agencies,
financial institutions, and
insurance firms with problems of
the physical environment that
exists in the Bay region, and to
summarize the kinds of measures
that can be taken to minimize
losses from instability of the
ground.
