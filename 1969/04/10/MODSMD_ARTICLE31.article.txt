# Regatta Opens Tribe Crew Season
## 
### 
The Stanford Crew opens its 1969 season this
Saturday against Oregon State, (JSC, and Santa
Clara in the annual Conn Findlay Regatta. The race,
Stanford's only home race this year, will be held at
Redwood City starting at 9:00 a.m., and will feature
a special race between the 1949 alumni and the
second frosh, as well as the varsity, JV, and first
frosh races.
The race figures to be between Oregon State, a
strong winner over Long Beach last week, and the as
yet untested Stanford team, with USC and Santa
Clara as also-rans. Preseason time trials have
indicated that the Stanford eight could be as good
or better than the boats of the past four years,
which have all been in the top three on the coast.
Last year, the varsity boat led a sweep of all
three races in the Regatta, beating OSU by three
lengths, with USC and Santa Clara far behind. This
was the beginning of a 10-1 season that included
victories over arch-rivals Washington and Cal and a
second-place tie in the Western Sprint
Championships with UCLA. A strong win on
Saturday could be the spark to an undefeated

season and the elusive Sprints Championship.
The special race for the 1949 alumni celebrates
the twentieth anniversary of their participation in
the Intercollegiate Rowing Association Regatta in
Poughkeepsie, New York, the first time a Stanford
boat had been entered in this regatta since 1915.
The IRA represents the national championship of
sorts (because Harvard is never entered in it), and
participation of the '49 crew in it marked the return
of Stanford to national ranking.

SENIORS RULE-The senior boat (white shirts) pulls away from the juniors in the luterclass Race held two weeks ago
at Redwood City. The seniors, who hold six of the eight varsity positions, won by three-quarters of a length over the
sophomores, with the juniors third. Stanford will be out to repeat its three-length win over OSU last year in Saturday's
season-opener.
The Stanford Crew opens its 1969 season this
Saturday against Oregon State, (JSC, and Santa
Clara in the annual Conn Findlay Regatta. The race,
Stanford's only home race this year, will be held at
Redwood City starting at 9:00 a.m., and will feature
a special race between the 1949 alumni and the
second frosh, as well as the varsity, JV, and first
frosh races.
The race figures to be between Oregon State, a
strong winner over Long Beach last week, and the as
yet untested Stanford team, with USC and Santa
Clara as also-rans. Preseason time trials have
indicated that the Stanford eight could be as good
or better than the boats of the past four years,
which have all been in the top three on the coast.
Last year, the varsity boat led a sweep of all
three races in the Regatta, beating OSU by three
lengths, with USC and Santa Clara far behind. This
was the beginning of a 10-1 season that included
victories over arch-rivals Washington and Cal and a
second-place tie in the Western Sprint
Championships with UCLA. A strong win on
Saturday could be the spark to an undefeated

season and the elusive Sprints Championship.
The special race for the 1949 alumni celebrates
the twentieth anniversary of their participation in
the Intercollegiate Rowing Association Regatta in
Poughkeepsie, New York, the first time a Stanford
boat had been entered in this regatta since 1915.
The IRA represents the national championship of
sorts (because Harvard is never entered in it), and
participation of the '49 crew in it marked the return
of Stanford to national ranking.
Boatings for the race will be: varsity—Mike
Yoshimura, coxwain; Bernie Thurber, stroke; Steve
Crossland, 7; Captain Bob Thomas, 6; Don
Connolly, 5; Doug Livermore, 4; Gaynor Dawson, 3;
Wally Millar, 2; and Mike Huffington, bow. Junior
Varsity—Bruce Williams, coxwain; Don Steele,
stroke; Jon Clapp, 7; Dave Lee, 6; Rob Creighton, 5;
John Raines, 4; Pete Sapin, 3; Dennis Morrow, 2;
and Volney Ford Van Dalsem 111 at bow.
Freshman boatings are: Bob Slattery, coxwain;
Jim Topic, stroke; Bob Belden, 7; Captain Jim
Troxell, 6; Larry Granader, 5; Paul Preissler, 4; Bob
Kasper, 3; Bill Dudley, 2; Pete Wagstaff, bow.
