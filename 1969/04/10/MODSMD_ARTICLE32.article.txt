# Minority Scholarships
## King Fund Drive Scheduled 
### 
A total Stanford community
drive for the Martin Luther King
Junior Memorial Fund is
scheduled to begin in the next few
weeks, according to Senior
Christopher Murlas, chairman of
the drive. The money collected
will be used for scholarships and
aid for disadvantaged minority
students.
In consultation with other r
students and administrators, I
Murlas, who is also president of
the Student Alumni Association,
decided to permanently combine
the Senior Class Fund with the
King Drive.
The Senior Class Fund, started
at Stanford two years ago, j
consisted of seniors soliciting
money solely from other seniors.
The money was given to Stanford
in the form of an unrestricted gift, j
This type of fund is a strong
tradition in many Eastern schools
where seniors are expected to
become contributors and active in
alumni affairs before they
graduate.
Funds Combined
Last year this fund drive
coincided with the assassination
of Dr. King. The King Memorial
Fund was started in response to
his death. The suggestion was
made to combine the two funds j
resulting in the transfer of the
money already collected for the
Senior Fund into the King Fund.
This year the drive will no
longer be restricted to seniors but
will be directed toward all classes,
faculty, staff, and administrators.
Uses Of Money
Unlike the Senior Class Fund,
the King Fund will place j
stipulations on its use. A
committee is in the process of
more clearly defining the goals
and uses of the fund. Members of
the committee are Murlas, Luis
Nogales, Assistant to the President
in Mexican-American Affairs, and
James Simmons, Assistant to the
Provost for Minority Relations.
Some of the questions they are ;
debating include: How much |
L

money do we expect from the
drive, how many scholarships do
we want to fund, what type of
students would qualify for aid.
"Top Priority"
"The fund will now be
restricted to a specific area which
is top priority as far as the
university's thinking goes,"

explains Muralas. "I hope the
whole community will support a
program which is crucial as far as
Stanford's relation to reeducation
and society."
More information on the King
Fund drive will be available as
soon as the fund's committee
decides upon final details.
