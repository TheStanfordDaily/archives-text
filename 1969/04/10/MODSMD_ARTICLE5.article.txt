# Trustees Dismissed Coalition's Demands

### MARSHALL SCHWARTZ 
Although the only SRI Coalition
demand voted on at Tuesday's Trustee
meeting was for a moratorium on new
chemical-biological warfare (CBW)
contracts, most other demands were
discussed and dismissed.
The Daily learned yesterday that the
Board discussed extending the
moratorium on new contracts to
counterinsurgency and other war-related
research, but this move was rejected by
a consensus of the group without a vote
being taken.
The only time a major division
existed on the Board was when they
decided to ask for a moratorium on new
CBW contracts at SRI. Although the

motion reportedly passed by a sizeable
majority, the number of Trustees
opposed to the idea was significant.
A reliable source noted that neither
the proponents nor the opponents of
the motion had one particular trustee as
a leader during the debate.
Two of the trustees supported
stronger action in response to the
Coalition demands. John Gardner,
former Secretary of Health, Education,
and Welfare, stressed the need for better
communication between the trustees
and the rest of the Stanford
community.
Mrs. Allan E. Charles was the one
consistent supporter of student views.
She urged that the Board make "a
dramatic move," according to one
source, to restore the community's faith
in the Trustees.
After the meeting concluded, the
Board held a press conference to
announce their decisions. Some SDS
members, including Fred Cohen,
attempted to gain entry to the
conference, but were not admitted.
Later, as the Board members were
leaving the conference, Cohen and other
demonstrators tried to approach them,
but were rebuffed. The general
comment he received, Cohen said, was
"We don't have time to talk now."
Cohen, managed to get on an
elevator with several trustees, but with
no significant gain in communication.
President Kenneth S. Pitzer noted
last nijiht that the Board members took
his statement "well," but added that the
on-cam pus reception has been
"excellent."
He reiterated his position of refusing
to comment on the SHI issues until he
hn s read the report of I lie
student-faculty committee on SRI That
group will officially issue its report
Tuesday, April I f>.
