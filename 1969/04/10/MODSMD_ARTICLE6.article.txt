## 
### DAVID DAVENPORT 
Throe changes on the ASSU ballot
for next week's election were
announced yesterday: two presidential
tickets must be trimmed in size, the
Hayes constitution will be added, and
eight new candidates will be running for
the Student Conduct Legislative Council
(SCLC).
Election Commissioner Bob Debs
declared last night that multiple
presidential candidates on the same
ticket will not be allowed. The
Constitution calls for one name for the
office of president and one name for the
vice-presidential post.
"Ol course," Debs noted, "we
cannot attempt to control any
delegations of authority which may take
place after the election." However, only
one candidate for each office will be
permitted on the April 15 16 ballot.
This ruling directly affects three

slates of candidates. Tim Coburn and
Jeff Kane, who were billed as
co-presidential candidates, will now run
as a Coburn-Kane ticket for the
presidency and v i c e - p r e s i d e n c y
respectively.
The 31 presidential candidates who
were known as "The Daily Machine,"
will now have John King as a
presidential candidate and William
Ellsworth as his running mate.

Askinas, John Grube, Joyce Kobayashi
and Pat Shea, could not lie reached for
comment last night.

submitted yesterday to place Denis
Hayes' proposed constitution on the
ballot. It had been tabled by the student
legislature (LASSII) and could only
have been placed on the ballot by that
body with an emergency meeting.

Throe changes on the ASSU ballot
for next week's election were
announced yesterday: two presidential
tickets must be trimmed in size, the
Hayes constitution will be added, and
eight new candidates will be running for
the Student Conduct Legislative Council
(SCLC).
Election Commissioner Bob Debs
declared last night that multiple
presidential candidates on the same
ticket will not be allowed. The
Constitution calls for one name for the
office of president and one name for the
vice-presidential post.
"Ol course," Debs noted, "we
cannot attempt to control any
delegations of authority which may take
place after the election." However, only
one candidate for each office will be
permitted on the April 15 16 ballot.
This ruling directly affects three

slates of candidates. Tim Coburn and
Jeff Kane, who were billed as
co-presidential candidates, will now run
as a Coburn-Kane ticket for the
presidency and v i c e - p r e s i d e n c y
respectively.
The 31 presidential candidates who
were known as "The Daily Machine,"
will now have John King as a
presidential candidate and William
Ellsworth as his running mate.
The four-man coalition of Barry
Askinas, John Grube, Joyce Kobayashi
and Pat Shea, could not lie reached for
comment last night.
A petition with 728 signatures was
submitted yesterday to place Denis
Hayes' proposed constitution on the
ballot. It had been tabled by the student
legislature (LASSII) and could only
have been placed on the ballot by that
body with an emergency meeting.
With the prosper! I >r an emergency

LASSU mooting very slight, Jim
Schnieder, assisted by Jackson Booth
and Hans Dankers, circulated a petition
to place the document before the
student body. The petition exceeded
the 5% of the student body minimum
by slightly more than 100 signatures.
