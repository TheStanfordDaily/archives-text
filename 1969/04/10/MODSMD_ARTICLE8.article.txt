# Sit-In
## 
### 
We record this morning a significant
moment in Stanford's progress toward
morality.
The awareness has been long growing
that Stanford and SRI are intimately
involved in the development of America's
death-dealing machinery. The conviction
has been growing that this must be
stopped.
Last night a meeting of a thousand
people voted to express this conviction in
direct action. At this moment several
hundred of them occupy the Applied
Electronics Laboratory.
In the debate that preceded this action,
it was suggested that other members of the
community might be alienated by a sit-in.
We hope that this is not the case.
There are many who oppose the war in
Vietnam, who deplore our manipulation of
Third World nations, who condemn the
selective slavery that forced young men to
die in an evil causeâ€”but who reject direct
action as "coercive." It is desperately
important that these people consider with
an open mind the meaning of the ALL
occupation.
It is important to note that the meeting
voted specifically and unanimously to
prevent any harm to individuals or
destruction of property during the action.
These people do not want to be part of the
kind of coercion that their country is using
to enforce its will at home and abroad.
But it is much important to understand
that the people in ALL are experimenting
in a radically new kind of politics. They are
trying to live their morality.
They rejected both the tactics and the
political assumptions suggested by William
McAffee Brown, Leonard Schiff and
Sanford Dornbusch during the meeting.

Work within the system, said these men. Be
careful not to make the Trustees mad at
you.
In a very real way, the community is
saying that the traditional liberal response
is not adequate. They are saying that both
the Trustees and the decision-making
process that these men dominate are
illegitimate.
They have excellent reasons lor taking
this position. Very fresh in their memory is
the Trustees refusal to abide by the popular
will, as expressed in the mass meeting of
April 3.
They also remember a war no one had a
chance to vote against and a deadly
"protective" missile system that no one can
do anything except pay for.
The will of - those who are concerned
with the direction of this society must be
expressed, and it must be expressed
quickly. People are dying. More citizens
must be led to share the urgency that is
being expressed at ALL.
Despite the urgency, it must be
remembered that the ALL occupation is an
experiment. No one there is sure that they
have found the most effective way to bring
about the changes they see as so vital.
Some of those who share their concerns
declined to participate in this action. The
only thing that everyone seems to agree on
is that the present situation is intolerable.
The sit-in is not a threat to the less
concerned or less active members of this
community, it is an invitation. Go to the
lab. Find out why those people are there.
Find out why they felt that their concerns
could not be expressed through more
traditional channels.
Maybe you will join them.
