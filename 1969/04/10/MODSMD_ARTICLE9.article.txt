# Letters To The Editor
## Dreams Won't Bring Peace 
### 
Editor, THE DAILY:
Your guest column, "A
Generation in Search of a
Future," was a very interesting
and well written article that
undoubtedly reflects the opinions
of this university's students.
However, I am sorry to see that
even our country's Nobel Prize
winners are beginning to believe in
our youthful fantasies. We have
grown up without hardships or
responsibilities and so have
renewed faith in human nature.
We live in a dream-world cut off
from the suffering of the outside
world by our geographic position
and from the realities of our own
world by a gigantic complex of
organizations.
As students, I suppose we can
afford to feel great pangs of
brotherly love, detest the support
of dictators and the use of
napalm, and call for a new world
order. Dr. Wald, who has already
seen a nation engaged in a

righteous policy of race
extermination and world conquest
and two vicious and expensive
wars in Southeast Asia,* cannot
afford such dreams. He ought to
be aware of the sources of war
and not let his situation here in
the United States distort his
outlook.
I endorse and honor every idea
put forth by Dr. Wald but fear the
results of their acceptance by
America. Peace will not come
with simple hopes and
dreams—they are the beggeters of
war—but with moderation and
realism.
To rid ourselves, or even to
think of ridding ourselves, of our
massive military complex and
responsibilities in the world would
be to court disaster. To lessen
them without extremely careful
and painstaking planning taking
years, if not decades, is to invite
war.
Up until now, we have always

watched wars from the sidelines
and helped the players only when
absolutely necessary. We now are
on the field and, although we do
not like it, are engaged in the
same game with the same rules as
before.
We must not make the
mistake of thinking that, because
of the technological advanc&s that
make life appear to be so
different here in the # United
States, wars will be discouraged
elsewhere. Warfare Is the most
insane and totally destructive
activity known to man—yet, at
times, there seems no alternative
to it. Nuclear war may be
somewhat more insane, but can
we dare to recognize degrees of
insanity?
I respect the right of each man
to dream, even that of a Noble
Prize winner. I only hope that the
majority of students here at
Stanford realize that, were anyone
to act on Dr. Wald's suggestions,

the title of his speech would not
be "A Generation in Search of a
Future," but "A Generation in
Search of Oblivion."

Editor, THE DAILY:
I challenge you and your staff
to show cause that you should not
be accused of news suppression.
The fact is, Congressman
Allard K. Lowenstein, spring
quarter Guest-in-Residence of the
Inter-Fraternity Council, visited
Nigeria and Biafra, February
1969, that is, this year. But you
have chosen not to tell the
Stanford community that. You
seem to forget that you and
members of your staff did much
to ask the same Stanford
community to donate five
thousand dollars to aid the
Biafran victims of the Nigerian
civil war.
It seems only right, if you are
not to be charged with been (sic)
of disservice to the community
that foots the bill that keeps you
going, that you give the
community the chance to ask how
their hard earned pennies are
being, or have been spent.
Please, do not answer me in
writing this time. I am addressing
this letter to you and your staff,
and, through you, to the public.

To rid ourselves, or even to
think of ridding ourselves, of our
massive military complex and
responsibilities in the world would
be to court disaster. To lessen
them without extremely careful
and painstaking planning taking
years, if not decades, is to invite
war.
Up until now, we have always

watched wars from the sidelines
and helped the players only when
absolutely necessary. We now are
on the field and, although we do
not like it, are engaged in the
same game with the same rules as
before.
We must not make the
mistake of thinking that, because
of the technological advanc&s that
make life appear to be so
different here in the # United
States, wars will be discouraged
elsewhere. Warfare Is the most
insane and totally destructive
activity known to man—yet, at
times, there seems no alternative
to it. Nuclear war may be
somewhat more insane, but can
we dare to recognize degrees of
insanity?
I respect the right of each man
to dream, even that of a Noble
Prize winner. I only hope that the
majority of students here at
Stanford realize that, were anyone
to act on Dr. Wald's suggestions,

the title of his speech would not
be "A Generation in Search of a
Future," but "A Generation in
Search of Oblivion."

I challenge you and your staff
to show cause that you should not
be accused of news suppression.
The fact is, Congressman
Allard K. Lowenstein, spring
quarter Guest-in-Residence of the
Inter-Fraternity Council, visited
Nigeria and Biafra, February
1969, that is, this year. But you
have chosen not to tell the
Stanford community that. You
seem to forget that you and
members of your staff did much
to ask the same Stanford
community to donate five
thousand dollars to aid the
Biafran victims of the Nigerian
civil war.
It seems only right, if you are
not to be charged with been (sic)
of disservice to the community
that foots the bill that keeps you
going, that you give the
community the chance to ask how
their hard earned pennies are
being, or have been spent.
Please, do not answer me in
writing this time. I am addressing
this letter to you and your staff,
and, through you, to the public.

Your guest column, "A
Generation in Search of a
Future," was a very interesting
and well written article that
undoubtedly reflects the opinions
of this university's students.
However, I am sorry to see that
even our country's Nobel Prize
winners are beginning to believe in
our youthful fantasies. We have
grown up without hardships or
responsibilities and so have
renewed faith in human nature.
We live in a dream-world cut off
from the suffering of the outside
world by our geographic position
and from the realities of our own
world by a gigantic complex of
organizations.
As students, I suppose we can
afford to feel great pangs of
brotherly love, detest the support
of dictators and the use of
napalm, and call for a new world
order. Dr. Wald, who has already
seen a nation engaged in a

righteous policy of race
extermination and world conquest
and two vicious and expensive
wars in Southeast Asia,* cannot
afford such dreams. He ought to
be aware of the sources of war
and not let his situation here in
the United States distort his
outlook.
I endorse and honor every idea
put forth by Dr. Wald but fear the
results of their acceptance by
America. Peace will not come
with simple hopes and
dreams—they are the beggeters of
war—but with moderation and
realism.
