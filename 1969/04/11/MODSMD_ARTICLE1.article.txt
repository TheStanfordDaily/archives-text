# 1500 Vote For Indefinite Sit-In At AEL, Ask Trustees To Take Action By Monday
## 
### MARSHALL E. SCHWARTZ 
About 1500 students at a mass
meeting at the Applied Electronics
Laboratory (AFX) voted last night to
continue the sit-in at ALL until they
received an acceptable response to their
demands.
The move came at the end of the
first full day of the sit-in during which
President Kenneth S. Pitzer, at the
recommendation of his advisory group
on campus disruptions, informed the
dissidents that their sit-in was ir«
violation of the University Policy on
Campus Disruptions.
About 4 00 students remained at
AEL throughout the night.
At the mass meeting, the group
overwhelmingly passed a resolution
proposed by ASSU Vice-President
Victor von Schlegell, stating, "We are
profoundly opposed to the war-related
research which is done at Stanford and
at SRI, and also at the moral
irresponsibility which the Trustees
exhibited so clearly in their inaction at
their meetings.
"We have shown our opposition and

outrage —and we are committed to the
demands we presented more deeply
than ever before. We therefore reaffirm
our demands of April 3, and further
demand that the trustees act decisively
to meet these demands by Monday.
Not Pacified
"We are not pacified by the
rhetorical posture assumed by the Board
in their statement on Chemical and
Biological Warfare, and we will not be
pacified until our demands are met.'
The original demands included closer
University control of SRI, an end to
chemical-biological warfare (CBW),
counterinsurgency, and other
war-related research, and end to all
classified research both at SRI and on
campus, and an open Board meeting
later this month to decide on these
questions.
No Com men I
Contacted late last night, Pitzer
declined to speculate on future actions
regarding either the demands or the
violation of the disruption policy.
He noted that the continuation of
the sit-in "certainly will not help

communications." He added that he
'will undoubtedly be in contact with
the trustees, but I will not speculate at
this time as to future actions."
Trustee Ben C. Duniway, also
contacted after the decision to continue
the sit-in had been made, referred to
resolutions passed by the students and
faculty condemning coercive tactics,
saying he agreed with those resolutions.
The demands are ''an
oversimplification of a complex
problem. They can't be evaluated in
those terms," he added.
Disruption Violation
Pitzer's letter informing the students
that the sit-in violated the disruption
policy was read at a noon White Plaza
rally, which about 500 attended.
Pitzer said, "I want to make it clear
that in preventing the normal conduct
of University business in University
offices and laboratories your occupation
of the Applied Electronics Laboratory is
a violation of the University Policy on
Campus Disruptions.
' While I understand your deep
commitment to bring change for the

better at this University and in this
country, you are still not exempt from
the ordinary obligations of all members
of the Stanford community. 1 am
informing you that your occupation of
this building is a violation of a
University Policy so that each of you
may consider all the implication of your
acts. I ask you to leave the AEL and
join me and other members of the
community in working to resolve,
through established and peaceful
channels, the profoundly important
issues which motivate this
demonstration of your concern."
During the morning, about 150 of
those sitting in spoke with AEL staff
members in their offices and
surrounding areas.
In an informal news conference late
in the morning, Dean William Rambo,
director of Stanford Electronics
Laboratory (which includes AEL) said
employees had been told they could go
home, but many stayed to talk to the
protestors.
"It was a rare opportunity to talk
with students," Rambo said. "We've
been trying for years to get people to
come here to find out what we do."
No Arrests
There were no arrests or incidents
throughout the day.
Various campus groups issued
statements on the sit-in and the
demands during the day.
A group of about 75 faculty, calling
themselves the Committee of Concerned
Faculty on SRI, agreed to initiate a
resolution to call a general emergency
meeting of the Academic Council to

discuss the resolutions passed
yesterday by the Academic Senate
(see story below) on the crisis.
Sit-In Support
In a separate action, a decisive
majority of those attending the
meeting voted in favor of a
motion supporting both the
sentiment behind the sit-in and
the sit-in itself.
The remainder of the
group-about one-third—accepted
the resolution without the
support of the sit-in.
The resolution's three main
points are:

1. That the Stanford
community is "indebted to those
many concerned students" who
have "raised, clarified, and
sustained interest in the critical
question of the ethnical basis of
individual and institutional
research and scholarship. '
2. That it is "dismayed" by
the indirect and indecisive
response of the Board of Trustees.
3. That it recognizes the
validity of pacific occupation of a
university building and supports
the aim of that action—the
suspension of war-related
research.
YR Statement
Another statement was issued
Thursday night by the Young
Republicans. It reads as follows:
The seizure of the Applied
Electronics Laboratory is a grave
offense against the students and
faculty of Stanford University,
and against the most fundamental

ideals of the academic
community.
The issue of SRI has been
simmering on campus for months
but those who voted for an
immediate sit-in refused to wait
for even a few days for the release
of the report of the SRI
Committee. Could it be that the
leaders of this movement are
afraid of the report?
The tactics meeting of April 9,
refused to delay action in order to
determine the results of the
forthcoming student referendum
on SRI. This movement hopes to
effect a change in the relationship
between SRI and the Stanford
community, including all
students, yet it refuses to wait for
a broad expression of student
opinion. Is it possible that the
movement is afraid of the very
students whose best interests they
claim to represent?
An even more disagreeable

reason for the precipate and
emotional action of April 9, was
the desire of some members of the
movement to radicalize the
student body by whatever means
possible. It may very well be that
the alleged ends of this movement
conceal the true goal, which is
confrontation for confrotation's
sake. This would be a perversion
of even the best goals.
Therefore we both as
individuals and representatives of
the Stanford Young Republicans
condemn the sit-in at AEL and
urge all members of the Stanford
community to make their views
known to the administration and
to demonstrators themselves,
1. They have blantently
denied and obstructed the
academic freedom of those
members of the university
community who refuse to accept
their values, their beliefs or their
instructions. They have arrogantly

disregarded the repeated
repudiations by the student body
of coersion and disruption as
acceptable tactics for the
achievement of policy change in
the university.
2. We urge that the unviversity
take whatever appropriate action
necessary to implement existing
university relations on campus
disruptions.
3. We plead with the
University to protect the rights of
those members of the community
who, not self-righteous enough to
claim arbitrary authority, not
ready to discard education for
disruption, choose to carry on
academic pursuits in a peaceful
way rather than use the University
as a tool for the acquisition of
political power.
Committee For March 4
The Committee for March 4,
which organized the "Science and
Society" convocation on CBW,
the anti-ballistic missile system,
and other topics, sent a letter to
Pitzer. They supported all the
April 3 Coalition's demands,
saying, 'We regard the trustees'
response of April 8 as a complete

failure to recognize the mandate
for reordering scientific
priorities."
The decision to continue the
sit-in was made at 10 p.m.,
two-and-a-half hours after the
start of a mass meeting in the
courtyard of AEL.
The motion was passed by a
three-to-two majority. The
minority supported ending the
sit-in at 5 p.m. today with the
understanding that the building
would be reoccupied if necessary.
The meeting was chaired by
law student Doron Weinberg.
Discussion On Senate*
Before the vote, much
discussion was given over to the
Academic Senate meeting. ASSU
President Denis Hayes reported
the Senate asked the trustees to
hold open hearings on the
demands on campus, and to issue
a report by mid-May.
John Ehrenberg, one of the
April 3 Coalition who attended a
portion of the Senate meeting,
declared his opinion that the
Senate had "refused to make a
moral statement or commitment.
It was a disappointment. We have

to stay (at AEL)."
Ehrenberg, a graduate student
in political science, advised the
group, however, not to write the
faculty off immediately as the
enemy.
Jon Freedman, associate
professor of psychology and
member of the Academic Senate,
said the Senate faced two major
issues: whether a stand should be
taken immediately on the SRI
issue, and what is going to be
done about the report of the SRI
Committee once it has been
issued.
Freedman said that there was a
strong sentiment among the
members of the Senate that no
decision on SRI should be made
before the report was issued, but
that they should focus on the
Trustees' contact with the
community after the report's
issuance.
About 1500 students at a mass
meeting at the Applied Electronics

continue the sit-in at ALL until they

The original demands included closer
University control of SRI, an end to
chemical-biological warfare (CBW),
counterinsurgency, and other
war-related research, and end to all
classified research both at SRI and on
campus, and an open Board meeting
later this month to decide on these
questions.

Contacted late last night, Pitzer
declined to speculate on future actions
regarding either the demands or the
violation of the disruption policy.
He noted that the continuation of
the sit-in "certainly will not help

communications." He added that he
'will undoubtedly be in contact with
the trustees, but I will not speculate at
this time as to future actions."
Trustee Ben C. Duniway, also
contacted after the decision to continue
the sit-in had been made, referred to
resolutions passed by the students and
faculty condemning coercive tactics,
saying he agreed with those resolutions.
The demands are ''an
oversimplification of a complex
problem. They can't be evaluated in
those terms," he added.
Disruption Violation
Pitzer's letter informing the students
that the sit-in violated the disruption
policy was read at a noon White Plaza
rally, which about 500 attended.
Pitzer said, "I want to make it clear
that in preventing the normal conduct
of University business in University
offices and laboratories your occupation
of the Applied Electronics Laboratory is
a violation of the University Policy on
Campus Disruptions.
' While I understand your deep
commitment to bring change for the

better at this University and in this
country, you are still not exempt from
the ordinary obligations of all members
of the Stanford community. 1 am
informing you that your occupation of
this building is a violation of a
University Policy so that each of you
may consider all the implication of your
acts. I ask you to leave the AEL and
join me and other members of the
community in working to resolve,
through established and peaceful
channels, the profoundly important
issues which motivate this
demonstration of your concern."
During the morning, about 150 of
those sitting in spoke with AEL staff
members in their offices and
surrounding areas.
In an informal news conference late
in the morning, Dean William Rambo,
director of Stanford Electronics
Laboratory (which includes AEL) said
employees had been told they could go
home, but many stayed to talk to the
protestors.
"It was a rare opportunity to talk
with students," Rambo said. "We've
been trying for years to get people to
come here to find out what we do."
No Arrests
There were no arrests or incidents
throughout the day.
Various campus groups issued
statements on the sit-in and the
demands during the day.
A group of about 75 faculty, calling
themselves the Committee of Concerned
Faculty on SRI, agreed to initiate a
resolution to call a general emergency
meeting of the Academic Council to

discuss the resolutions passed
yesterday by the Academic Senate
(see story below) on the crisis.
Sit-In Support
In a separate action, a decisive
majority of those attending the
meeting voted in favor of a
motion supporting both the
sentiment behind the sit-in and
the sit-in itself.
The remainder of the
group-about one-third—accepted
the resolution without the
support of the sit-in.
The resolution's three main
points are:

1. That the Stanford
community is "indebted to those
many concerned students" who
have "raised, clarified, and
sustained interest in the critical
question of the ethnical basis of
individual and institutional
research and scholarship. '
2. That it is "dismayed" by
the indirect and indecisive
response of the Board of Trustees.
3. That it recognizes the
validity of pacific occupation of a
university building and supports
the aim of that action—the
suspension of war-related
research.
YR Statement
Another statement was issued
Thursday night by the Young
Republicans. It reads as follows:
The seizure of the Applied
Electronics Laboratory is a grave
offense against the students and
faculty of Stanford University,
and against the most fundamental

ideals of the academic
community.
The issue of SRI has been
simmering on campus for months
but those who voted for an
immediate sit-in refused to wait
for even a few days for the release
of the report of the SRI
Committee. Could it be that the
leaders of this movement are
afraid of the report?
The tactics meeting of April 9,
refused to delay action in order to
determine the results of the
forthcoming student referendum
on SRI. This movement hopes to
effect a change in the relationship
between SRI and the Stanford
community, including all
students, yet it refuses to wait for
a broad expression of student
opinion. Is it possible that the
movement is afraid of the very
students whose best interests they
claim to represent?
An even more disagreeable

reason for the precipate and
emotional action of April 9, was
the desire of some members of the
movement to radicalize the
student body by whatever means
possible. It may very well be that
the alleged ends of this movement
conceal the true goal, which is
confrontation for confrotation's
sake. This would be a perversion
of even the best goals.
Therefore we both as
individuals and representatives of
the Stanford Young Republicans
condemn the sit-in at AEL and
urge all members of the Stanford
community to make their views
known to the administration and
to demonstrators themselves,
1. They have blantently
denied and obstructed the
academic freedom of those
members of the university
community who refuse to accept
their values, their beliefs or their
instructions. They have arrogantly

disregarded the repeated
repudiations by the student body
of coersion and disruption as
acceptable tactics for the
achievement of policy change in
the university.
2. We urge that the unviversity
take whatever appropriate action
necessary to implement existing
university relations on campus
disruptions.
3. We plead with the
University to protect the rights of
those members of the community
who, not self-righteous enough to
claim arbitrary authority, not
ready to discard education for
disruption, choose to carry on
academic pursuits in a peaceful
way rather than use the University
as a tool for the acquisition of
political power.
Committee For March 4
The Committee for March 4,
which organized the "Science and
Society" convocation on CBW,
the anti-ballistic missile system,
and other topics, sent a letter to
Pitzer. They supported all the
April 3 Coalition's demands,
saying, 'We regard the trustees'
response of April 8 as a complete

failure to recognize the mandate
for reordering scientific
priorities."
The decision to continue the
sit-in was made at 10 p.m.,
two-and-a-half hours after the
start of a mass meeting in the
courtyard of AEL.
The motion was passed by a
three-to-two majority. The
minority supported ending the
sit-in at 5 p.m. today with the
understanding that the building
would be reoccupied if necessary.
The meeting was chaired by
law student Doron Weinberg.
Discussion On Senate*
Before the vote, much
discussion was given over to the
Academic Senate meeting. ASSU
President Denis Hayes reported
the Senate asked the trustees to
hold open hearings on the
demands on campus, and to issue
a report by mid-May.
John Ehrenberg, one of the
April 3 Coalition who attended a
portion of the Senate meeting,
declared his opinion that the
Senate had "refused to make a
moral statement or commitment.
It was a disappointment. We have

to stay (at AEL)."
Ehrenberg, a graduate student
in political science, advised the
group, however, not to write the
faculty off immediately as the
enemy.
Jon Freedman, associate
professor of psychology and
member of the Academic Senate,
said the Senate faced two major
issues: whether a stand should be
taken immediately on the SRI
issue, and what is going to be
done about the report of the SRI
Committee once it has been
issued.
Freedman said that there was a
strong sentiment among the
members of the Senate that no
decision on SRI should be made
before the report was issued, but
that they should focus on the
Trustees' contact with the
community after the report's
issuance.
About 1500 students at a mass
meeting at the Applied Electronics
Laboratory (AFX) voted last night to
continue the sit-in at ALL until they
received an acceptable response to their
demands.
The move came at the end of the
first full day of the sit-in during which
President Kenneth S. Pitzer, at the
recommendation of his advisory group
on campus disruptions, informed the
dissidents that their sit-in was ir«
violation of the University Policy on
Campus Disruptions.
About 4 00 students remained at
AEL throughout the night.
At the mass meeting, the group
overwhelmingly passed a resolution
proposed by ASSU Vice-President
Victor von Schlegell, stating, "We are
profoundly opposed to the war-related
research which is done at Stanford and
at SRI, and also at the moral
irresponsibility which the Trustees
exhibited so clearly in their inaction at
their meetings.
"We have shown our opposition and

outrage —and we are committed to the
demands we presented more deeply
than ever before. We therefore reaffirm
our demands of April 3, and further
demand that the trustees act decisively
to meet these demands by Monday.
Not Pacified
"We are not pacified by the
rhetorical posture assumed by the Board
in their statement on Chemical and
Biological Warfare, and we will not be
pacified until our demands are met.'
The original demands included closer
University control of SRI, an end to
chemical-biological warfare (CBW),
counterinsurgency, and other
war-related research, and end to all
classified research both at SRI and on

' While I understand your deep
commitment to bring change for the

better at this University and in this
country, you are still not exempt from
the ordinary obligations of all members
of the Stanford community. 1 am
informing you that your occupation of
this building is a violation of a
University Policy so that each of you
may consider all the implication of your
acts. I ask you to leave the AEL and
join me and other members of the
community in working to resolve,
through established and peaceful
channels, the profoundly important
issues which motivate this
demonstration of your concern."
During the morning, about 150 of
those sitting in spoke with AEL staff
members in their offices and
surrounding areas.
In an informal news conference late
in the morning, Dean William Rambo,
director of Stanford Electronics
Laboratory (which includes AEL) said
employees had been told they could go
home, but many stayed to talk to the
protestors.
"It was a rare opportunity to talk
with students," Rambo said. "We've
been trying for years to get people to
come here to find out what we do."
No Arrests
There were no arrests or incidents
throughout the day.
Various campus groups issued
statements on the sit-in and the
demands during the day.
A group of about 75 faculty, calling
themselves the Committee of Concerned
Faculty on SRI, agreed to initiate a
resolution to call a general emergency
meeting of the Academic Council to

discuss the resolutions passed
yesterday by the Academic Senate
(see story below) on the crisis.
Sit-In Support
In a separate action, a decisive
majority of those attending the
meeting voted in favor of a
motion supporting both the
sentiment behind the sit-in and
the sit-in itself.
The remainder of the
group-about one-third—accepted
the resolution without the
support of the sit-in.
The resolution's three main
points are:

1. That the Stanford
community is "indebted to those
many concerned students" who
have "raised, clarified, and
sustained interest in the critical
question of the ethnical basis of
individual and institutional
research and scholarship. '
2. That it is "dismayed" by
the indirect and indecisive
response of the Board of Trustees.
3. That it recognizes the
validity of pacific occupation of a
university building and supports
the aim of that action—the
suspension of war-related
research.
YR Statement
Another statement was issued
Thursday night by the Young
Republicans. It reads as follows:
The seizure of the Applied
Electronics Laboratory is a grave
offense against the students and
faculty of Stanford University,
and against the most fundamental

ideals of the academic
community.
The issue of SRI has been
simmering on campus for months
but those who voted for an
immediate sit-in refused to wait
for even a few days for the release
of the report of the SRI
Committee. Could it be that the
leaders of this movement are
afraid of the report?
The tactics meeting of April 9,
refused to delay action in order to
determine the results of the
forthcoming student referendum
on SRI. This movement hopes to
effect a change in the relationship
between SRI and the Stanford
community, including all
students, yet it refuses to wait for
a broad expression of student
opinion. Is it possible that the
movement is afraid of the very
students whose best interests they
claim to represent?
An even more disagreeable

reason for the precipate and
emotional action of April 9, was
the desire of some members of the
movement to radicalize the
student body by whatever means
possible. It may very well be that
the alleged ends of this movement
conceal the true goal, which is
confrontation for confrotation's
sake. This would be a perversion
of even the best goals.
Therefore we both as
individuals and representatives of
the Stanford Young Republicans
condemn the sit-in at AEL and
urge all members of the Stanford
community to make their views
known to the administration and
to demonstrators themselves,
1. They have blantently
denied and obstructed the
academic freedom of those
members of the university
community who refuse to accept
their values, their beliefs or their
instructions. They have arrogantly

disregarded the repeated
repudiations by the student body
of coersion and disruption as
acceptable tactics for the
achievement of policy change in
the university.
2. We urge that the unviversity
take whatever appropriate action
necessary to implement existing
university relations on campus
disruptions.
3. We plead with the
University to protect the rights of
those members of the community
who, not self-righteous enough to
claim arbitrary authority, not
ready to discard education for
disruption, choose to carry on
academic pursuits in a peaceful
way rather than use the University
as a tool for the acquisition of
political power.
Committee For March 4
The Committee for March 4,
which organized the "Science and
Society" convocation on CBW,
the anti-ballistic missile system,
and other topics, sent a letter to
Pitzer. They supported all the
April 3 Coalition's demands,
saying, 'We regard the trustees'
response of April 8 as a complete

failure to recognize the mandate
for reordering scientific
priorities."
The decision to continue the
sit-in was made at 10 p.m.,
two-and-a-half hours after the
start of a mass meeting in the
courtyard of AEL.
The motion was passed by a
three-to-two majority. The
minority supported ending the
sit-in at 5 p.m. today with the
understanding that the building
would be reoccupied if necessary.
The meeting was chaired by
law student Doron Weinberg.
Discussion On Senate*
Before the vote, much
discussion was given over to the
Academic Senate meeting. ASSU
President Denis Hayes reported
the Senate asked the trustees to
hold open hearings on the
demands on campus, and to issue
a report by mid-May.
John Ehrenberg, one of the
April 3 Coalition who attended a
portion of the Senate meeting,
declared his opinion that the
Senate had "refused to make a
moral statement or commitment.
It was a disappointment. We have

to stay (at AEL)."
Ehrenberg, a graduate student
in political science, advised the
group, however, not to write the
faculty off immediately as the
enemy.
Jon Freedman, associate
professor of psychology and
member of the Academic Senate,
said the Senate faced two major
issues: whether a stand should be
taken immediately on the SRI
issue, and what is going to be
done about the report of the SRI
Committee once it has been
issued.
Freedman said that there was a
strong sentiment among the
members of the Senate that no
decision on SRI should be made
before the report was issued, but
that they should focus on the
Trustees' contact with the
community after the report's
issuance.
About 1500 students at a mass
meeting at the Applied Electronics
Laboratory (AFX) voted last night to
continue the sit-in at ALL until they
received an acceptable response to their
demands.
The move came at the end of the
first full day of the sit-in during which
President Kenneth S. Pitzer, at the
recommendation of his advisory group
on campus disruptions, informed the
dissidents that their sit-in was ir«
violation of the University Policy on
Campus Disruptions.
About 4 00 students remained at
AEL throughout the night.
At the mass meeting, the group
overwhelmingly passed a resolution
proposed by ASSU Vice-President
Victor von Schlegell, stating, "We are
profoundly opposed to the war-related
research which is done at Stanford and
at SRI, and also at the moral
irresponsibility which the Trustees
exhibited so clearly in their inaction at
their meetings.
"We have shown our opposition and

outrage —and we are committed to the
demands we presented more deeply
than ever before. We therefore reaffirm
our demands of April 3, and further
demand that the trustees act decisively
to meet these demands by Monday.
Not Pacified
"We are not pacified by the
rhetorical posture assumed by the Board
in their statement on Chemical and
Biological Warfare, and we will not be
pacified until our demands are met.'
The original demands included closer
University control of SRI, an end to
chemical-biological warfare (CBW),
counterinsurgency, and other
war-related research, and end to all
classified research both at SRI and on
campus, and an open Board meeting
later this month to decide on these
questions.
No Com men I
Contacted late last night, Pitzer
declined to speculate on future actions
regarding either the demands or the
violation of the disruption policy.
He noted that the continuation of
the sit-in "certainly will not help

communications." He added that he
'will undoubtedly be in contact with
the trustees, but I will not speculate at
this time as to future actions."
Trustee Ben C. Duniway, also
contacted after the decision to continue
the sit-in had been made, referred to
resolutions passed by the students and
faculty condemning coercive tactics,
saying he agreed with those resolutions.
The demands are ''an
oversimplification of a complex
problem. They can't be evaluated in
those terms," he added.
Disruption Violation
Pitzer's letter informing the students
that the sit-in violated the disruption
policy was read at a noon White Plaza
rally, which about 500 attended.
Pitzer said, "I want to make it clear
that in preventing the normal conduct
of University business in University
offices and laboratories your occupation
of the Applied Electronics Laboratory is
a violation of the University Policy on
Campus Disruptions.
' While I understand your deep
commitment to bring change for the

better at this University and in this
country, you are still not exempt from
the ordinary obligations of all members
of the Stanford community. 1 am

discuss the resolutions passed
yesterday by the Academic Senate
(see story below) on the crisis.
Sit-In Support
In a separate action, a decisive
majority of those attending the
meeting voted in favor of a
motion supporting both the
sentiment behind the sit-in and
the sit-in itself.
The remainder of the
group-about one-third—accepted
the resolution without the
support of the sit-in.
The resolution's three main
points are:

1. That the Stanford
community is "indebted to those
many concerned students" who
have "raised, clarified, and
sustained interest in the critical
question of the ethnical basis of
individual and institutional
research and scholarship. '
2. That it is "dismayed" by
the indirect and indecisive
response of the Board of Trustees.
3. That it recognizes the
validity of pacific occupation of a
university building and supports
the aim of that action—the
suspension of war-related
research.
YR Statement
Another statement was issued
Thursday night by the Young
Republicans. It reads as follows:
The seizure of the Applied
Electronics Laboratory is a grave
offense against the students and
faculty of Stanford University,
and against the most fundamental

ideals of the academic
community.
The issue of SRI has been
simmering on campus for months
but those who voted for an
immediate sit-in refused to wait
for even a few days for the release
of the report of the SRI
Committee. Could it be that the
leaders of this movement are
afraid of the report?
The tactics meeting of April 9,
refused to delay action in order to
determine the results of the
forthcoming student referendum
on SRI. This movement hopes to
effect a change in the relationship
between SRI and the Stanford
community, including all
students, yet it refuses to wait for
a broad expression of student
opinion. Is it possible that the
movement is afraid of the very
students whose best interests they
claim to represent?
An even more disagreeable

reason for the precipate and
emotional action of April 9, was
the desire of some members of the
movement to radicalize the
student body by whatever means
possible. It may very well be that
the alleged ends of this movement
conceal the true goal, which is
confrontation for confrotation's
sake. This would be a perversion
of even the best goals.
Therefore we both as
individuals and representatives of
the Stanford Young Republicans
condemn the sit-in at AEL and
urge all members of the Stanford
community to make their views
known to the administration and
to demonstrators themselves,
1. They have blantently
denied and obstructed the
academic freedom of those
members of the university
community who refuse to accept
their values, their beliefs or their
instructions. They have arrogantly

disregarded the repeated
repudiations by the student body
of coersion and disruption as
acceptable tactics for the
achievement of policy change in
the university.
2. We urge that the unviversity
take whatever appropriate action
necessary to implement existing
university relations on campus
disruptions.
3. We plead with the
University to protect the rights of
those members of the community
who, not self-righteous enough to
claim arbitrary authority, not
ready to discard education for
disruption, choose to carry on
academic pursuits in a peaceful
way rather than use the University
as a tool for the acquisition of
political power.
Committee For March 4
The Committee for March 4,
which organized the "Science and
Society" convocation on CBW,
the anti-ballistic missile system,
and other topics, sent a letter to
Pitzer. They supported all the
April 3 Coalition's demands,
saying, 'We regard the trustees'
response of April 8 as a complete

failure to recognize the mandate
for reordering scientific
priorities."
The decision to continue the
sit-in was made at 10 p.m.,
two-and-a-half hours after the
start of a mass meeting in the
courtyard of AEL.
The motion was passed by a
three-to-two majority. The
minority supported ending the
sit-in at 5 p.m. today with the
understanding that the building
would be reoccupied if necessary.
The meeting was chaired by
law student Doron Weinberg.
Discussion On Senate*
Before the vote, much
discussion was given over to the
Academic Senate meeting. ASSU
President Denis Hayes reported
the Senate asked the trustees to
hold open hearings on the
demands on campus, and to issue
a report by mid-May.
John Ehrenberg, one of the
April 3 Coalition who attended a
portion of the Senate meeting,
declared his opinion that the
Senate had "refused to make a
moral statement or commitment.
It was a disappointment. We have

to stay (at AEL)."
Ehrenberg, a graduate student
in political science, advised the
group, however, not to write the
faculty off immediately as the
enemy.
Jon Freedman, associate
professor of psychology and
member of the Academic Senate,
said the Senate faced two major
issues: whether a stand should be
taken immediately on the SRI
issue, and what is going to be
done about the report of the SRI
Committee once it has been
issued.
Freedman said that there was a
strong sentiment among the
members of the Senate that no
decision on SRI should be made
before the report was issued, but
that they should focus on the
Trustees' contact with the
community after the report's
issuance.
About 1500 students at a mass
meeting at the Applied Electronics
Laboratory (AFX) voted last night to
continue the sit-in at ALL until they
received an acceptable response to their
demands.
The move came at the end of the
first full day of the sit-in during which
President Kenneth S. Pitzer, at the
recommendation of his advisory group
on campus disruptions, informed the
dissidents that their sit-in was ir«
violation of the University Policy on
Campus Disruptions.
About 4 00 students remained at
AEL throughout the night.
At the mass meeting, the group
overwhelmingly passed a resolution
proposed by ASSU Vice-President
Victor von Schlegell, stating, "We are
profoundly opposed to the war-related
research which is done at Stanford and
at SRI, and also at the moral
irresponsibility which the Trustees
exhibited so clearly in their inaction at
their meetings.
"We have shown our opposition and

outrage —and we are committed to the
demands we presented more deeply
than ever before. We therefore reaffirm
our demands of April 3, and further
demand that the trustees act decisively
to meet these demands by Monday.
Not Pacified
"We are not pacified by the
rhetorical posture assumed by the Board
in their statement on Chemical and
Biological Warfare, and we will not be
pacified until our demands are met.'
The original demands included closer
University control of SRI, an end to
chemical-biological warfare (CBW),
counterinsurgency, and other
war-related research, and end to all
classified research both at SRI and on
campus, and an open Board meeting
later this month to decide on these
questions.
No Com men I
Contacted late last night, Pitzer
declined to speculate on future actions
regarding either the demands or the
violation of the disruption policy.
He noted that the continuation of
the sit-in "certainly will not help

communications." He added that he
'will undoubtedly be in contact with
the trustees, but I will not speculate at
this time as to future actions."
Trustee Ben C. Duniway, also
contacted after the decision to continue
the sit-in had been made, referred to
resolutions passed by the students and
faculty condemning coercive tactics,
saying he agreed with those resolutions.
The demands are ''an
oversimplification of a complex
problem. They can't be evaluated in
those terms," he added.
Disruption Violation
Pitzer's letter informing the students
that the sit-in violated the disruption
policy was read at a noon White Plaza
rally, which about 500 attended.
Pitzer said, "I want to make it clear
that in preventing the normal conduct
of University business in University
offices and laboratories your occupation
of the Applied Electronics Laboratory is
a violation of the University Policy on
Campus Disruptions.
' While I understand your deep
commitment to bring change for the

better at this University and in this
country, you are still not exempt from
the ordinary obligations of all members
of the Stanford community. 1 am
informing you that your occupation of
this building is a violation of a
University Policy so that each of you
may consider all the implication of your
acts. I ask you to leave the AEL and
join me and other members of the
community in working to resolve,
through established and peaceful
channels, the profoundly important
issues which motivate this
demonstration of your concern."
During the morning, about 150 of
those sitting in spoke with AEL staff
members in their offices and
surrounding areas.
In an informal news conference late
in the morning, Dean William Rambo,
director of Stanford Electronics
Laboratory (which includes AEL) said
employees had been told they could go
home, but many stayed to talk to the
protestors.
"It was a rare opportunity to talk
with students," Rambo said. "We've
been trying for years to get people to
come here to find out what we do."
No Arrests
There were no arrests or incidents
throughout the day.
Various campus groups issued
statements on the sit-in and the
demands during the day.
A group of about 75 faculty, calling
themselves the Committee of Concerned
Faculty on SRI, agreed to initiate a
resolution to call a general emergency
meeting of the Academic Council to

Another statement was issued
Thursday night by the Young
Republicans. It reads as follows:
The seizure of the Applied
Electronics Laboratory is a grave
offense against the students and
faculty of Stanford University,
and against the most fundamental

ideals of the academic
community.
The issue of SRI has been
simmering on campus for months
but those who voted for an
immediate sit-in refused to wait
for even a few days for the release
of the report of the SRI
Committee. Could it be that the
leaders of this movement are
afraid of the report?
The tactics meeting of April 9,
refused to delay action in order to
determine the results of the
forthcoming student referendum
on SRI. This movement hopes to
effect a change in the relationship
between SRI and the Stanford
community, including all
students, yet it refuses to wait for
a broad expression of student
opinion. Is it possible that the
movement is afraid of the very
students whose best interests they
claim to represent?
An even more disagreeable

reason for the precipate and
emotional action of April 9, was
the desire of some members of the
movement to radicalize the
student body by whatever means
possible. It may very well be that
the alleged ends of this movement
conceal the true goal, which is
confrontation for confrotation's
sake. This would be a perversion
of even the best goals.
Therefore we both as
individuals and representatives of
the Stanford Young Republicans
condemn the sit-in at AEL and
urge all members of the Stanford
community to make their views
known to the administration and
to demonstrators themselves,
1. They have blantently
denied and obstructed the
academic freedom of those
members of the university
community who refuse to accept
their values, their beliefs or their
instructions. They have arrogantly

disregarded the repeated
repudiations by the student body
of coersion and disruption as
acceptable tactics for the
achievement of policy change in
the university.
2. We urge that the unviversity
take whatever appropriate action
necessary to implement existing
university relations on campus
disruptions.
3. We plead with the
University to protect the rights of
those members of the community
who, not self-righteous enough to
claim arbitrary authority, not
ready to discard education for
disruption, choose to carry on
academic pursuits in a peaceful
way rather than use the University
as a tool for the acquisition of
political power.
Committee For March 4
The Committee for March 4,
which organized the "Science and
Society" convocation on CBW,
the anti-ballistic missile system,
and other topics, sent a letter to
Pitzer. They supported all the
April 3 Coalition's demands,
saying, 'We regard the trustees'
response of April 8 as a complete

failure to recognize the mandate
for reordering scientific
priorities."
The decision to continue the
sit-in was made at 10 p.m.,
two-and-a-half hours after the
start of a mass meeting in the
courtyard of AEL.
The motion was passed by a
three-to-two majority. The
minority supported ending the
sit-in at 5 p.m. today with the
understanding that the building
would be reoccupied if necessary.
The meeting was chaired by
law student Doron Weinberg.
Discussion On Senate*
Before the vote, much
discussion was given over to the
Academic Senate meeting. ASSU
President Denis Hayes reported
the Senate asked the trustees to
hold open hearings on the
demands on campus, and to issue
a report by mid-May.
John Ehrenberg, one of the
April 3 Coalition who attended a
portion of the Senate meeting,
declared his opinion that the
Senate had "refused to make a
moral statement or commitment.
It was a disappointment. We have

to stay (at AEL)."
Ehrenberg, a graduate student
in political science, advised the
group, however, not to write the
faculty off immediately as the
enemy.
Jon Freedman, associate
professor of psychology and
member of the Academic Senate,
said the Senate faced two major
issues: whether a stand should be
taken immediately on the SRI
issue, and what is going to be
done about the report of the SRI
Committee once it has been
issued.
Freedman said that there was a
strong sentiment among the
members of the Senate that no
decision on SRI should be made
before the report was issued, but
that they should focus on the
Trustees' contact with the
community after the report's
issuance.
About 1500 students at a mass
meeting at the Applied Electronics
Laboratory (AFX) voted last night to
continue the sit-in at ALL until they
received an acceptable response to their
demands.
The move came at the end of the
first full day of the sit-in during which
President Kenneth S. Pitzer, at the
recommendation of his advisory group
on campus disruptions, informed the
dissidents that their sit-in was ir«
violation of the University Policy on
Campus Disruptions.
About 4 00 students remained at
AEL throughout the night.
At the mass meeting, the group
overwhelmingly passed a resolution
proposed by ASSU Vice-President
Victor von Schlegell, stating, "We are
profoundly opposed to the war-related
research which is done at Stanford and
at SRI, and also at the moral
irresponsibility which the Trustees
exhibited so clearly in their inaction at
their meetings.
"We have shown our opposition and

outrage —and we are committed to the
demands we presented more deeply
than ever before. We therefore reaffirm
our demands of April 3, and further
demand that the trustees act decisively
to meet these demands by Monday.
Not Pacified
"We are not pacified by the
rhetorical posture assumed by the Board
in their statement on Chemical and
Biological Warfare, and we will not be
pacified until our demands are met.'
The original demands included closer
University control of SRI, an end to
chemical-biological warfare (CBW),
counterinsurgency, and other
war-related research, and end to all
classified research both at SRI and on
campus, and an open Board meeting
later this month to decide on these
questions.
No Com men I
Contacted late last night, Pitzer
declined to speculate on future actions
regarding either the demands or the
violation of the disruption policy.
He noted that the continuation of
the sit-in "certainly will not help

communications." He added that he
'will undoubtedly be in contact with
the trustees, but I will not speculate at
this time as to future actions."
Trustee Ben C. Duniway, also
contacted after the decision to continue
the sit-in had been made, referred to
resolutions passed by the students and
faculty condemning coercive tactics,
saying he agreed with those resolutions.
The demands are ''an
oversimplification of a complex
problem. They can't be evaluated in
those terms," he added.
Disruption Violation
Pitzer's letter informing the students
that the sit-in violated the disruption
policy was read at a noon White Plaza
rally, which about 500 attended.
Pitzer said, "I want to make it clear
that in preventing the normal conduct
of University business in University
offices and laboratories your occupation
of the Applied Electronics Laboratory is
a violation of the University Policy on
Campus Disruptions.
' While I understand your deep
commitment to bring change for the

better at this University and in this
country, you are still not exempt from
the ordinary obligations of all members
of the Stanford community. 1 am
informing you that your occupation of
this building is a violation of a
University Policy so that each of you
may consider all the implication of your
acts. I ask you to leave the AEL and
join me and other members of the
community in working to resolve,
through established and peaceful
channels, the profoundly important
issues which motivate this
demonstration of your concern."
During the morning, about 150 of
those sitting in spoke with AEL staff
members in their offices and
surrounding areas.
In an informal news conference late
in the morning, Dean William Rambo,
director of Stanford Electronics
Laboratory (which includes AEL) said
employees had been told they could go
home, but many stayed to talk to the
protestors.
"It was a rare opportunity to talk
with students," Rambo said. "We've
been trying for years to get people to
come here to find out what we do."
No Arrests
There were no arrests or incidents
throughout the day.
Various campus groups issued
statements on the sit-in and the
demands during the day.
A group of about 75 faculty, calling
themselves the Committee of Concerned
Faculty on SRI, agreed to initiate a
resolution to call a general emergency
meeting of the Academic Council to

discuss the resolutions passed
yesterday by the Academic Senate
(see story below) on the crisis.
Sit-In Support
In a separate action, a decisive
majority of those attending the
meeting voted in favor of a
motion supporting both the
sentiment behind the sit-in and
the sit-in itself.
The remainder of the
group-about one-third—accepted
the resolution without the
support of the sit-in.
The resolution's three main
points are:

1. That the Stanford
community is "indebted to those
many concerned students" who
have "raised, clarified, and
sustained interest in the critical
question of the ethnical basis of
individual and institutional
research and scholarship. '
2. That it is "dismayed" by
the indirect and indecisive
response of the Board of Trustees.
3. That it recognizes the
validity of pacific occupation of a
university building and supports
the aim of that action—the
suspension of war-related
research.
