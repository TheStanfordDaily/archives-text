# 1500 Vote For Indefinite Sit-In At AEL, Ask Trustees To Take Action By Monday
## 
### MARSHALL E. SCHWARTZ 
About 1500 students at a mass
meeting at the Applied Electronics
Laboratory (AFX) voted last night to
continue the sit-in at ALL until they
received an acceptable response to their
demands.
The move came at the end of the
first full day of the sit-in during which
President Kenneth S. Pitzer, at the
recommendation of his advisory group
on campus disruptions, informed the
dissidents that their sit-in was ir«
violation of the University Policy on
Campus Disruptions.
About 4 00 students remained at
AEL throughout the night.
At the mass meeting, the group
overwhelmingly passed a resolution
proposed by ASSU Vice-President
Victor von Schlegell, stating, "We are
profoundly opposed to the war-related
research which is done at Stanford and
at SRI, and also at the moral
irresponsibility which the Trustees
exhibited so clearly in their inaction at
their meetings.
"We have shown our opposition and

outrage —and we are committed to the
demands we presented more deeply
than ever before. We therefore reaffirm
our demands of April 3, and further
demand that the trustees act decisively
to meet these demands by Monday.
Not Pacified
"We are not pacified by the
rhetorical posture assumed by the Board
in their statement on Chemical and
Biological Warfare, and we will not be
pacified until our demands are met.'
The original demands included closer
University control of SRI, an end to
chemical-biological warfare (CBW),
counterinsurgency, and other
war-related research, and end to all
classified research both at SRI and on
campus, and an open Board meeting
later this month to decide on these
questions.
No Com men I
Contacted late last night, Pitzer
declined to speculate on future actions
regarding either the demands or the
violation of the disruption policy.
He noted that the continuation of
the sit-in "certainly will not help

communications." He added that he
'will undoubtedly be in contact with
the trustees, but I will not speculate at
this time as to future actions."
Trustee Ben C. Duniway, also
contacted after the decision to continue
the sit-in had been made, referred to
resolutions passed by the students and
faculty condemning coercive tactics,
saying he agreed with those resolutions.
The demands are ''an
oversimplification of a complex
problem. They can't be evaluated in
those terms," he added.
Disruption Violation
Pitzer's letter informing the students
that the sit-in violated the disruption
policy was read at a noon White Plaza
rally, which about 500 attended.
Pitzer said, "I want to make it clear
that in preventing the normal conduct
of University business in University
offices and laboratories your occupation
of the Applied Electronics Laboratory is
a violation of the University Policy on
Campus Disruptions.
' While I understand your deep
commitment to bring change for the

better at this University and in this
country, you are still not exempt from
the ordinary obligations of all members
of the Stanford community. 1 am
informing you that your occupation of
this building is a violation of a
University Policy so that each of you
may consider all the implication of your
acts. I ask you to leave the AEL and
join me and other members of the
community in working to resolve,
through established and peaceful
channels, the profoundly important
issues which motivate this
demonstration of your concern."
During the morning, about 150 of
those sitting in spoke with AEL staff
members in their offices and
surrounding areas.
In an informal news conference late
in the morning, Dean William Rambo,
director of Stanford Electronics
Laboratory (which includes AEL) said
employees had been told they could go
home, but many stayed to talk to the
protestors.
"It was a rare opportunity to talk
with students," Rambo said. "We've
been trying for years to get people to
come here to find out what we do."
No Arrests
There were no arrests or incidents
throughout the day.
Various campus groups issued
statements on the sit-in and the
demands during the day.
A group of about 75 faculty, calling
themselves the Committee of Concerned
Faculty on SRI, agreed to initiate a
resolution to call a general emergency
meeting of the Academic Council to
