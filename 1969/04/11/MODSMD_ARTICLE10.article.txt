# Caught In The Middle
## Ends, Means, AEL 
### Thomas C. Dawson 
Classified research is contrary
to the free exchange of
knowledge, one of the
cornerstones of higher education.
Chemical-biological warfare is one
of the most obscene creations of
al 1-too-o 112 ten obscene Man.
Counterinsurgency warfare is used
against movements of people
concerned with self-determination
for their country.
Cessation of such work, at
Stanford and elsewhere, is, I
think, the major goal of the sit-in
at AEL. I wholeheartedly agree
with this goal of the sit-inners. I
oppose their tactics.
At yesterday's noon rally some
reasons for immediate action were
advanced. It was argued that a
referendum on the issues was not
acceptable for three reasons: the
sit-inners might lose, the Trustees
wouldn't listen even if the
sit-inners did win and finally that
a referendum is illegitimate
because the Vietnamese people
are not allowed to vote.
It is certainly understandable
that some might oppose a vote if
they feared they might lose.
However, such an attitude is
alarmingly anti-democratic. Some
Coalition members are not afraid
of taking votes in meetings they
are fairly sure they have the
feeling of, yet they shy away from
voting when the group is too large
for them to have any confidence
of controlling.
Voting A Tactic
In short, voting is a tactic to be
used only when convenient. What
kind of a democracy is this?
The argument that the Trustees
would ignore the referendum of
students, if true, is certainly a
strong argument for direct action.
I do not think it is entirely true,
however. A student vote alone
probably would not force the
Trustees to take any action. This I
concede. If a campaign is
undertaken to convince the
faculty to take a stance similar to
the Coalition's, in regard to war
research on and off-campus; the
goals can be met. Particularly with
regard to AEL, the faculty, not
the Trustees, hold the key.
If the students are to make any
headway, they must educate the
faculty. This is why the sit-in last

year succeeded. Certainly the
students occupying the Old Union
were impetus, but it was the
faculty that carried the day. The
Trustees will not be able to ignore
the faculty. If the faculty is not
on the students' side the
Coalition's demands will never be
met.
Vietnamese Not Registered
Finally we come to the third
reason for not having a
referendum, the Vietnamese are
not registered to vote at Stanford.
The point raised is a good one:
work undertaken at Stanford may
have deadly consequences
elsewhere. Sadly this is true, but
this is not the only point to be
made. Key to this argument is the
contention that the Coalition
somehow knows exactly what the
people of the world want and that
the people support the Coalition's
actions. It seems to me a
staggering leap of faith to accept
both halves of this proposition.
Such a proposition also raises
an intriguing question of
governance. Can this community
make any decisions? Must it
accept the contentions of the
Coalition about their
divinely-inspired voice or must the
community be condemned to
inaction because the outside
world does not have a voice?
Entire Community
I believe the community, the
entire community, must be
allowed to make its own
decisions, taking into account as it
best can the feelings of those
affected by its decisions.
In any case, much of this is
beside the point. The sit-in
continues (at least as these words
are written). The Coalition
demands must be met. I do not
think the continued occupancy of
the building will help this cause.
Faculty do not want to be
coerced by either students or
Trustees.
The continued occupancy of
the building will jeopardize the
future creation of a true
student-faculty coalition to end
war research at Stanford. The
present Coalition is dreaming if it
thinks they will ever be able to
walk out of the building in
exchange for an end to war
research at Stanford.
It is sad but true that the
Trustees have failed to show any
evidence of being able to
comprehend the moral and
political issues behind the
Coalition. The only way I see the
goals of the Coalition being
accomplished is by a true
community movement. I do not
think the movement can gain any
momentum while AEL is
occupied.
