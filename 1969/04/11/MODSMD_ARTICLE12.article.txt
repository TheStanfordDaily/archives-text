## Foreign Student Housing 
### Wm. BUCKLAND W.M. Buckland 
This afternoon at the
International Center a meeting has
been arranged to discuss those
critical problems which face the
foreign students who come to
Stanford.

The present and perspective
members of the Stanford Student
Assembly LASSU will be present
along with members of the
International Association policy
board. It is hoped that a large
group of foreign students will
attend and present their views of
the problem to the people who
have the best chance of initiating
positive action to improve the
present situation.
In many cases the brochures
sent out by the administration to
perspective foreign students are
misleading or are so vague as to be
of little value. Cost estimates are
usually not realistic given the
present housing situation.
Even if the statements of the
administration presented a true
picture, this would not prevent
many foreign students coming but
it would at least enable those
people who are supported by
foreign bodies to have their
allowances increased.
The prime consideration of a
student when seeking
accomodation is usually to find a
place which gives him privacy
while living in a community
atmosphere. This means it is
desir»He to have a bedroom for
eacn person. Yet here on campus
many graduate as well as
undergraduate students are living

two to a room, usually with
people not of their own choice.
The local apartment blocks do
not cater to the needs of students
any better than many of the
campus accomodations.
The apartments available are
usually more luxurious than
expected or desired by most
foreign students.
Should the university arrange
housing for all foreign students,
many would be satisfied, while
others would prefer to hunt out
places for themselves if the
market were not so tight. It is
obvious that there is no
competition between landlords in
an area expanding so fast and
where all new developments are
usually designed for the employed
person who is reasonably well off.
The only alternative is for the
university to act.
In a situation where foreign
students are generally only here
for a short time, they are only
really organized to present their
views when they are leaving. The
result is that the voice of the
foreign student does not have the
force it should.
A start must be made now to
change this. I urge all interested
students to attend the meeting
and make sure all the problems
are made known and some
positive action is initiated.

foreign students.
Should the university arrange
housing for all foreign students,
many would be satisfied, while
others would prefer to hunt out
places for themselves if the
market were not so tight. It is
obvious that there is no
competition between landlords in
an area expanding so fast and
where all new developments are
usually designed for the employed
person who is reasonably well off.
The only alternative is for the
university to act.
In a situation where foreign
students are generally only here
for a short time, they are only
really organized to present their
views when they are leaving. The
result is that the voice of the
foreign student does not have the
force it should.
A start must be made now to
change this. I urge all interested
students to attend the meeting
and make sure all the problems
are made known and some
positive action is initiated.
