Dear Mom,
What do you think about all
those people sleeping over at the
A.E.L. building?
Questioning
Dear Questioning,
I think it is an unsatisfactory
solution to the housing problem.
Love,
Mom
Dear Mom,
I had not heard from my
boyfriend in seven months, and
since I love him above anything in
life, I sent him a birthday card. I
received the following letter with
my birthday card unopened:
"I am returning your card
unopened as I have no interest
whatsoever in its contents. I just
want to be free of you. If you
contact me in any way, I shall
have to take legal steps."
Do you think he still cares?
Heartsick
Dear Heartsick,
Of course he still cares. Notice
that he did not say he doesn't love
you. I think it is very encouraging
that he is still corresponding. Just
think positively, dear, and change
your deodorant. Remember, love

is perennial as the grass (and
L.S.D.)
Lovingly,
Mom
Dear Mom,
We are the fortunate parents of
identical twin boys and everyone
is giving us advice on how to dress
them. Do you think it is wise to
dress them alike?

Dear Proud Parents,
Congratulations on your lovely
family! The conventional wisdom
at this time is that dressing the
twins alike may cause
psychological damage to them. I
suggest that you dress one of the
boys as a girl to avoid damaging
his feeling of identity. You did
not mention if the twins are
Siamese twins in your letter. If
they are, of course, this
complicates the clothes problem. I
have friends who are Siamese
twins joined at the head which
fortunately eliminates the
clothing problem although they
do wear a large hat. But then
"two heads are better than one."
Double love to you all.
