## Varied Response To Sit-In 
### 
\r ditor. Till DAI 1. Y :
Last Wednesday night 900
students met in Dinkelspiel; of
these, less that 700 (5% of the
students at S.U.) voted to take
over A.E.L. The thing that got me
the maddest was that they did it
in the name of "Democracy", and
because they were "right''.
There were comments such as
the meeting is a referendum, or
democracy isn't talking;
democracy is acting. Clearly,
either their definitions of
democracy and referendum are
wrong or my definitions are
wrong.
How in the world can 5% of
the students be a referendum
when in fact 5% is a very small
minority. If a democracy is acting,
how can the actions of less than
25% of the students be
represented as the actions of the
majority. This type of
'democracy", the rule of the
minority, is the same type of
democracy that allows the rule of
dictators, tyrants, and most of the
people who oppress the "third
world" politically.
The people at this meeting say
because they are "right" they are
justified in their actions. Since
social values change from society
to society and even in a single
society, and with changing social
values what is right also changes.
Therefore, how can they say
what is absolutely right for the
U.S. let alone the whole world, I
don't know, but maybe they've
been talking to God lately.
Anyways, these "students" are
putting themselves above the law,
because they "know?" they are
right. By doing this, they are
giving the right to transcend the
law to everyone who thinks he is
right, thus threatening society, the
world, and everyone in it with
chaos, murder, oppression, and
the loss of freedom- this is what
I'm afraid of.

• I'll Sue!
Editor, THE DAILY:
As I write this the AEL has
been occupied over night, about 8
hours too long.
I write to inform you that I am
a student, and as such you have a
contractual obligation to instruct
me as per my registration cards. If
you, through inaction or
inappropriate action, as judged by
its results with respect to those
who would occupy and/or
otherwise disrupt at Stanford, fail
to meet your obligation, I intend
to sue you and -the university for
breach of contract.

• Hurrah!
Editor, THE DAILY:
I would like to take a brief
moment to express one person's
approval of the actions of the
April 3 Coalition. In this case I
feel that one is obliged not only
to endorse the goals but the
means the Coalition is using to
date to achieve its ends.
The lack of a dialogue is the

most characteristic element of
establishment myopia and student
radicalism. Even if you do not feel
that the "occupation" of the AEL
was legal, history has shown us
that such actions are often
necessary. The action of April 9
and 10 stand in marked contrast
to simultaneous student protests
at Harvard. At leas one radio
station, KFRC, has noted the
difference.
Whether this letter is printed or
not, I think that it might not be a
bad idea for you to note how
your letters are running
concerning the sit-in. The protest,
obviously with substantial student
sympathy, was orderly and
designed to promote rational
discussion instead of rhetoric. I
am sure that Senator Lee Metcalf,
who was here as this year's
distinguished alumnus and a
speaker in TMU's "State of the
Union" series, will be obliged to
carry this feeling back to
Washington with him.

• Keep Unity
Editor, THE DAILY:
The meeting of the Coalition
on SRI gave evidence of the
intense feeling of moral outrage
shared by a large majority of the
Stanford community against
many research activities on the
campus and at SRI.
That meeting's decision to
occupy the Applied Electronics
Laboratory (AEL) represents the
sincere conviction that direct and
immediate action is needed to
convince the Trustees of the
seriousness and immediacy of the
issues and of the necessity to act
now.
There is an honest difference
of opinion concerning tactics for
inplementing the Coalition's
demands. However, it is
imperative that the discussion not
center around these tactics, but
that the original issues remain the
basis of our concern. To focus on
our tactical differences of opinion
at this time would be to lose the
substantive solidarity that has
emerged.

• School Election
Editor, THE DAILY:
Next Tuesday, Santa Clara and
San Mateo County Voters will go
to the polls to elect their school
board representatives for the next
two years.
In two of these races, highly
qualified minority candidates are
seeking election—in East Palo Alto
and Mountain View. They are
running an uphill battle because
election day turnout for school
board races is a dismally low 20
per cent of the voter registration
and lower still among black and
chicano voters.
As a result, a small number of
conservative white voters have
dictated the board composition of
the predominantly black
Ravenswood School District. The

large Mexican-American
population of Mountain View has
yet to be represented on the
unified district's board.
The result, obviously, is a crisis
of confidence and legitimacy in
the minority community, not
unlike the situation we face with
the Trustees of this university.
Black and Mexican-American
candidates have asked Stanford
students for their help. Through
selective precinct coverage and a
massive get-out-and-vote effort we

can be of help. Our challenge is to
make sure that there is a large
turnout and that this year it does
not come from the backlash voter.
If you are willing to give an
afternoon of your time, or if you
want more information on the
candidacies of Delia Ybarra, Herb
Rhodes, Walter Randall and Larry
Fewell, come to the ASSU office
this Saturday at 10:30 a.m.
