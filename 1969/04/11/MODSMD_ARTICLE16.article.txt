Andrew Gould and Mark Heller
plan to be at AEL all day and will
talk with any interested students
there.
The following is a series of
profiles in alphabetical order
about the candidates. Profiles of
the other four candidates
appeared yesterday.
(Editor's note: The candidates
are reminded that their position
statements of 250-500 words are
due by 2:00 this afternoon.
These statements will be
published in Monday's Daily.)
Coburn
Tim Coburn and Jeff Kane,
co-presidential candidates in the
ASSU elections, believe that
students today are in a "peculiarly
apt position to effect change."
Recognizing "the power of the
university on the national scene,"
they want to lead Stanford
students in the assumption of a
responsibility for this power.
They feel, for example, that
students have access to national
policy makers through the
eminent faculty of the university,
and that the student body, by
showing its will to the Faculty
Senate, can move them to put
pressure on these national policy
makers in Washington.
Students can effect a change in
the general orientation of
research, from the military to the
more pressing problems of
society: pollution, population
control, and the urban crises.
Coburn and Kane believe that
student power to effect change
extends equally to concerns
within the University. Coburn is a
graduate student with one year to
go in the genetics department of
the Stanford Medical School.
Kane, a senior in physiological
psychology, is a member of the
Student Conduct Legislative
Council, the Student Education
Council and the ASSU Professor
Commission.
Coburn and Kane feel that
they have a knowledge of the
University and a sphere of
influence to lead an effective
Student Body government. Their
policy statements for proposed
changes within the University
have been informed and extensive,
ranging from ROTC and housing,
to community spirit and
organization of ASSU.
Coburn was head of the
chemical-biological warfare panel
for the Convocation of the
Stanford Area Scientific and
Technological Community on
March 4. He has been urging the
faculty of the Medical School to
become involved in the issue of
Stanford Research Institute, and
organized a rally at the Medical
School yesterday afternoon to
discuss the sit-in.

Floto
In a campaign that seems
increasingly irrelevant, Paul Floto
is surely one of the more
irrelevant candidates.
"Getting elected is not an
issue," he says. "Given the nature
of student government here at
Stanford, it doesn't make that
much difference."
So Floto is not concerned
about getting elected in an
election that very few people care
about anyway. It may be double
nihilism, but it is consistent with
Floto's philosophy of "social
anarchism."
Conveniently for Floto, he
does not believe that election to a
student office should have
anything to do with popularity.
"The 'cult of personality' which is
cultivated at Stanford during
presidential campaigns is
destructive of democratic
government of the University," he
says. The anarchist candidate has
built this position into a platform
which calls for the ASSU
president to delegate authority in
almost all areas.
If elected, Floto promises to
make ASSU voluntary, reform
Trustees election procedures,
institute a student referendum on
courses, prohibit classified
research at SRI, and keep
motorcycles off White Plaza.
But Floto will not run an
ingratiating campaign. "I refuse to
campaign or solicit campaign
workers or funds at any time," he
says. "I have distributed a
position paper on seven important
issues; if you are willing to
participate, find one, read it, and
tell someone what you think. If
you aren't willing, vote for any of
the other candidates. They are all
eager to govern in the vacuum you
create. I am not willing to govern
you, or govern for you. I am
willing to participate only to the
degree that you will also
participate."
Gould
As he relaxed in an office on
the second floor of the Applied
Electronics Laboratory, Andrew
Gould related many issues of his
campaign for ASSU president to
the present occupation of the
building.
He proposes that students,
faculty, and staff select the
trustees. "If you're going to have
a board, you might as well have
one that represents the people it
theoretically represents," he said.
Gould critized the trustees for
"not being at all responsive to
community needs." He cited the
delay in coed housing and their
misdevelopment of Palo Alto land
as evidence of their
irresponsibility to the community.
"People who work at Stanford
can't afford to live in Palo Alto,"
he said indignantly.
Feeling that students demands
about research are completely
justified, he supports the sit-in
although he commented that the
action was "not militant enough.
We should take over another
building."
"The more buildings we*have,
the more power we have," he
stressed. If elected, he would use a
similar tactic to force the trustees
to relinquish some of their power.
Gould said he recognized that
"the president has no power. The
only power he has is the power of
leadership and to act as a focal
point for student dissatisfaction."
Besides the question of the
trustees' power, Gould's platform
rests on his grievance with SES.
He stated that Stanford needs a
"real study of education."

He believed that the present
reports study "procedural reform
and academic bullshit" and ignore
the more essential problems.
Faculty control of courses
content and the hierarchical
structure in class were two areas
he felt were not covered. His view
of classes today at Stanford was
that the "professor emanates great
rays of knowledge and students sit
there and absorb them."
King
Despite seeing their original
"Daily Machine" ticket of 31
candidates trimmed to two, John
King and Bill Ellsworth are
continuing their campaign and
hope to "experiment with the
idea of participatory democracy
at the top."
The first minimum objective of
their campaign, according to King
who organized the slate of 31, was
to force an official ruling on
plural candidacy. "There were
others (plural candidacies)," King
reported, "and I was not sure if
any decision was being made
about it."
Since a ruling has now been
made, plural candidates on the
same ticket are not permissible,
King considers that he has been
"successful even at this point in
the campaign."
Although this is King's first
year at Stanford, he has had
considerable experience in both
student and national politics. At
Bakersfield College, he was
freshman class president and Chief
Justice of the Student Court. A
junior in political science, he has
been involved with both the
Young Democrats and Students
for McCarthy.
Bill Ellsworth, the
vice-presidential candidate, is a
junior physics major. King
selected him for his "very good
knowledge of the issues here at
Stanford."
The King-Ellsworth platform,
with 13 specific proposals, speaks
very clearly on the issues. "I am
able to do this," King noted,
"because I am not a major
personality in the campaign. I
don't have the ego attachments
that some of the other 'campus
personalities' have. I can speak my
mind."
Kitsman
Chuck Kitsman believes in
"keeping the channels of
communication always open."
"I don't want to label myself
politically," he added, "because
labels usually tend to alienate
people."
"I want to be able to talk to
anybody," Kitsman concluded.
Interested in psychology and
linguistics, Kitsman originates
from Texas but has lived in
Australia, Canada, and Kuwait,
and has attended schools in
Switzerland and the eastern
United States.
He also hesitates to comment
about the events that are
"currently flaring up" because
they are "constantly changing."
His vice-presidential candidate,
Neil Heller is a "shy sociology !
major."

Laird
"There's not a dime's worth of
difference between most of the
other candidates," Phil Laird said
yesterday, giving this as one of his
primary reasons for filing to run
for president of the Stanford
student body.
"I'm disappointed that some of
the more active individuals on this
campus didn't run," Laird told
the Daily yesterday. "The major
views of most of the candidates
running now are pretty much the
same."
Laird, a junior history major,
and John Thomas, a junior in
Psychology, filed their petition
for candidacy only five minutes
before the filing deadline. Laird
describes himself as a "farm boy,"
from the outskirts of Fresno.
Laird has expressed "emphatic
support" for the sit-in now in
progress at the Applied
Electronics Laboratories. "The
trustees failed to meet the issue,"
he declared. "There was no other
action that they the students
could take." Laird regards the
redirection of the Stanford
Research Institute as the central
issue in the conflict.
"I guess I'm pretty much of a
dark horse," Laird said, reflecting
on his own candidacy. "I'm a
member of the silent majority

that people are talking about, 1
feel I can represent this group,"
he added.
Laird expressed support for the
idea of increasing the number of
housing co-ops at Stanford, and
also supports decreasing the
number of requirements neede'
to complete a major here.
Mattson
"It is programs rather than
ideas that are important in
effecting better student
government," says Bob Mattson,
candidate for ASSU president. He
and his running-mate Dick Walker
offer a number of programs which
they hope will make the student
government an effective channel
of expression and action.
Mattson proposes a twenty one
member, residence centered
senate. He says that this will be
more effective than the sixty one
member body outlined by the
Hayes constitution. Being
residence-centered, each living
group would have an individual
means of communication with the
student government. Proportional
representation for graduate and
off-campus students is included in
the proposal.
Included in the Mattson-Walker
platform are suggestions for
experimental dorms which would
involve a cross section of the
university community. While
easing the housing shortage faced
by the university, the
experimental dorms will also
initiate an educational
in the living groups.
Along with the smaller senate,
Mattson and Walker advocate the
formation of a Student-Faculty-
Administration Council which will
insure that certain of the more
urgent issues facing the university
are acted upon promptly, rather
than being tabled for indefinite
lengths of time.
According to Mattson, the
present sit-in shows that the
present student government is not
effective. "A group of concerned
students therefore had to step
outside the normal channels of
action, but we hope to make the
student government an effective
channel."
Spiegal
Of the team of Spiegel and
Cornell, Brad Cornell says he's
more philosophically-oriented,
'but John s our spokesman."
"Brad has been a tremendous
influence on my philosophical
beliefs," admitted presidential
candidate, John Spiegel, "and if
we're elected, we'll both make

every attempt to act on these
beliefs."
"We strongly believe in a
unification of thought and
action, both of them agreed.
' This is perhaps the theme of our
political campaign and of our
political views."
Spiegel hails from Berkeley but
appears to have become involved
in politics after several years at
Stanford.
' I spent my first two years
here trying to get good grades and
playing tennis," explained Spiegel.
' But the role I had always
envisioned for myself in society
somehow didn't quite fit.
"I soon found myself talking
to people about what I felt should
be changed in the University and
society. It looked as if the human
race was going to vanish from the
face of the earth in our life time.
'A few isolated students,"
Spiegel stated, "began to unite
and become involved in an
attempt to save America and the
human race.
"I'd like to see the entire
student government united
toward these ends."
"I'm discouraged," stated
Cornell, ' that students have not
been confronted with the current
pressing questions that face our
entire society. Nor have they been
confronted with the real failure of
student government to deal with
these issues.
"We have to impress upon the
students the urgency of making a
moral commitment to the
question 'Does man have the right
to kill others?" And by taking the
fruits of a murdering society," he
stressed, "we are all indirect
murderers."
Regarding a moral
commitment to the US, Spiegel
explained, ' Getting SRI to stop
taking contracts dealing with
counterinsurgency is a much more
important task than fighting the
Viet Cong.'
Shea
In the eighth grade Pat Shea's
history teacher suggested that Pat
should read some Marx. The next
year Shea went to the Soviet
Union and discovered that the
Russians were human beings

afterall. So when he graduated
from a high school in Salt Lake
City, Shea came to Stanford with
1 a different background than
most freshmen. '
Shea is presently running for
ASSU President as one member of
a four-man ticket that also
includes John Grube, Joyce
Kobayashi and Barry Askinas.
The group originally planned
to appear as a four-man ticket on
the election ballot, but because of
an election violation ruling, Shea
will be listed as Presidential
candidate on the ballot and John
Grube as Vice Presidential
candidate.
This year Shea is a sponsor in
Wilbur. He has been central in the
student evaluation of the Study ol
Education at Stanford (SES). He
was one of the prime movers
behind the Coalition, the student
group which initially asked for a
student voice in the consideration
of SES proposals.
More recently, Shea has given a
lot of his time to contacting
Trustees on an individual basis
about the Stanford Research
Institute issue. He has written
letters to individual Board
members and has "attempted to
make personal contact with
several members at every
opportunity." Personal contact is
a better method of appeal than
letter writing, Shea maintains.
"The Board should be
expanded by 10 members," Shea
observed. Four of these new
members should be faculty- two
of them from Stanford and two
from other institutions. Four
should be students- two of them
students or recent graduates of
Stanford and two from other
institutions. The final two
members should be selected on
the basis of race or occupation
not presently represented on the
Board.
Shea feels it is important to
emphasize why he is running on a
four-man ticket.
"The executive office of ASSU
has so many tasks that to expect
one individual to perform them all
is impossible. Mainly because of
the exhaustion of the last three
presidents, the students haven't
been adequately represented by
the person they elected," he said.
Today, Bob Cory will be at
Roth House for lunch and his
running mate, Eckhard Schulz will
be at Phi Sigma Kappa. For the
remainder of the weekend, they
will make appearances at Stern,
Wilbur, Florence Moore, Lagunita,
and the Fraternities.
Jim Schnieder and A1 Dulan
will be at Florence Moore for
lunch and will speak in the

Tonight they will both be eating

The following is a series of
profiles in alphabetical order
about the candidates. Profiles of
the other four candidates
appeared yesterday.
(Editor's note: The candidates
are reminded that their position
statements of 250-500 words are
due by 2:00 this afternoon.
These statements will be
published in Monday's Daily.)
Coburn
Tim Coburn and Jeff Kane,
co-presidential candidates in the
ASSU elections, believe that
students today are in a "peculiarly
apt position to effect change."
Recognizing "the power of the
university on the national scene,"
they want to lead Stanford
students in the assumption of a
responsibility for this power.
They feel, for example, that
students have access to national
policy makers through the
eminent faculty of the university,
and that the student body, by
showing its will to the Faculty
Senate, can move them to put
pressure on these national policy
makers in Washington.
Students can effect a change in
the general orientation of
research, from the military to the
more pressing problems of
society: pollution, population
control, and the urban crises.
Coburn and Kane believe that
student power to effect change
extends equally to concerns
within the University. Coburn is a
graduate student with one year to
go in the genetics department of
the Stanford Medical School.
Kane, a senior in physiological
psychology, is a member of the
Student Conduct Legislative
Council, the Student Education
Council and the ASSU Professor
Commission.
Coburn and Kane feel that
they have a knowledge of the
University and a sphere of
influence to lead an effective
Student Body government. Their
policy statements for proposed
changes within the University
have been informed and extensive,
ranging from ROTC and housing,
to community spirit and
organization of ASSU.
Coburn was head of the
chemical-biological warfare panel
for the Convocation of the
Stanford Area Scientific and
Technological Community on
March 4. He has been urging the
faculty of the Medical School to
become involved in the issue of
Stanford Research Institute, and
organized a rally at the Medical
School yesterday afternoon to
discuss the sit-in.

Floto
In a campaign that seems
increasingly irrelevant, Paul Floto
is surely one of the more
irrelevant candidates.
"Getting elected is not an
issue," he says. "Given the nature
of student government here at
Stanford, it doesn't make that
much difference."
So Floto is not concerned
about getting elected in an
election that very few people care
about anyway. It may be double
nihilism, but it is consistent with
Floto's philosophy of "social
anarchism."
Conveniently for Floto, he
does not believe that election to a
student office should have
anything to do with popularity.
"The 'cult of personality' which is
cultivated at Stanford during
presidential campaigns is
destructive of democratic
government of the University," he
says. The anarchist candidate has
built this position into a platform
which calls for the ASSU
president to delegate authority in
almost all areas.
If elected, Floto promises to
make ASSU voluntary, reform
Trustees election procedures,
institute a student referendum on
courses, prohibit classified
research at SRI, and keep
motorcycles off White Plaza.
But Floto will not run an
ingratiating campaign. "I refuse to
campaign or solicit campaign
workers or funds at any time," he
says. "I have distributed a
position paper on seven important
issues; if you are willing to
participate, find one, read it, and
tell someone what you think. If
you aren't willing, vote for any of
the other candidates. They are all
eager to govern in the vacuum you
create. I am not willing to govern
you, or govern for you. I am
willing to participate only to the
degree that you will also
participate."
Gould
As he relaxed in an office on
the second floor of the Applied
Electronics Laboratory, Andrew
Gould related many issues of his
campaign for ASSU president to
the present occupation of the
building.
He proposes that students,
faculty, and staff select the
trustees. "If you're going to have
a board, you might as well have
one that represents the people it
theoretically represents," he said.
Gould critized the trustees for
"not being at all responsive to
community needs." He cited the
delay in coed housing and their
misdevelopment of Palo Alto land
as evidence of their
irresponsibility to the community.
"People who work at Stanford
can't afford to live in Palo Alto,"
he said indignantly.
Feeling that students demands
about research are completely
justified, he supports the sit-in
although he commented that the
action was "not militant enough.
We should take over another
building."
"The more buildings we*have,
the more power we have," he
stressed. If elected, he would use a
similar tactic to force the trustees
to relinquish some of their power.
Gould said he recognized that
"the president has no power. The
only power he has is the power of
leadership and to act as a focal
point for student dissatisfaction."
Besides the question of the
trustees' power, Gould's platform
rests on his grievance with SES.
He stated that Stanford needs a
"real study of education."

He believed that the present
reports study "procedural reform
and academic bullshit" and ignore
the more essential problems.
Faculty control of courses
content and the hierarchical
structure in class were two areas
he felt were not covered. His view
of classes today at Stanford was
that the "professor emanates great
rays of knowledge and students sit
there and absorb them."
King
Despite seeing their original
"Daily Machine" ticket of 31
candidates trimmed to two, John
King and Bill Ellsworth are
continuing their campaign and
hope to "experiment with the
idea of participatory democracy
at the top."
The first minimum objective of
their campaign, according to King
who organized the slate of 31, was
to force an official ruling on
plural candidacy. "There were
others (plural candidacies)," King
reported, "and I was not sure if
any decision was being made
about it."
Since a ruling has now been
made, plural candidates on the
same ticket are not permissible,
King considers that he has been
"successful even at this point in
the campaign."
Although this is King's first
year at Stanford, he has had
considerable experience in both
student and national politics. At
Bakersfield College, he was
freshman class president and Chief
Justice of the Student Court. A
junior in political science, he has
been involved with both the
Young Democrats and Students
for McCarthy.
Bill Ellsworth, the
vice-presidential candidate, is a
junior physics major. King
selected him for his "very good
knowledge of the issues here at
Stanford."
The King-Ellsworth platform,
with 13 specific proposals, speaks
very clearly on the issues. "I am
able to do this," King noted,
"because I am not a major
personality in the campaign. I
don't have the ego attachments
that some of the other 'campus
personalities' have. I can speak my
mind."
Kitsman
Chuck Kitsman believes in
"keeping the channels of
communication always open."
"I don't want to label myself
politically," he added, "because
labels usually tend to alienate
people."
"I want to be able to talk to
anybody," Kitsman concluded.
Interested in psychology and
linguistics, Kitsman originates
from Texas but has lived in
Australia, Canada, and Kuwait,
and has attended schools in
Switzerland and the eastern
United States.
He also hesitates to comment
about the events that are
"currently flaring up" because
they are "constantly changing."
His vice-presidential candidate,
Neil Heller is a "shy sociology !
major."

Laird
"There's not a dime's worth of
difference between most of the
other candidates," Phil Laird said
yesterday, giving this as one of his
primary reasons for filing to run
for president of the Stanford
student body.
"I'm disappointed that some of
the more active individuals on this
campus didn't run," Laird told
the Daily yesterday. "The major
views of most of the candidates
running now are pretty much the
same."
Laird, a junior history major,
and John Thomas, a junior in
Psychology, filed their petition
for candidacy only five minutes
before the filing deadline. Laird
describes himself as a "farm boy,"
from the outskirts of Fresno.
Laird has expressed "emphatic
support" for the sit-in now in
progress at the Applied
Electronics Laboratories. "The
trustees failed to meet the issue,"
he declared. "There was no other
action that they the students
could take." Laird regards the
redirection of the Stanford
Research Institute as the central
issue in the conflict.
"I guess I'm pretty much of a
dark horse," Laird said, reflecting
on his own candidacy. "I'm a
member of the silent majority

that people are talking about, 1
feel I can represent this group,"
he added.
Laird expressed support for the
idea of increasing the number of
housing co-ops at Stanford, and
also supports decreasing the
number of requirements neede'
to complete a major here.
Mattson
"It is programs rather than
ideas that are important in
effecting better student
government," says Bob Mattson,
candidate for ASSU president. He
and his running-mate Dick Walker
offer a number of programs which
they hope will make the student
government an effective channel
of expression and action.
Mattson proposes a twenty one
member, residence centered
senate. He says that this will be
more effective than the sixty one
member body outlined by the
Hayes constitution. Being
residence-centered, each living
group would have an individual
means of communication with the
student government. Proportional
representation for graduate and
off-campus students is included in
the proposal.
Included in the Mattson-Walker
platform are suggestions for
experimental dorms which would
involve a cross section of the
university community. While
easing the housing shortage faced
by the university, the
experimental dorms will also
initiate an educational
in the living groups.
Along with the smaller senate,
Mattson and Walker advocate the
formation of a Student-Faculty-
Administration Council which will
insure that certain of the more
urgent issues facing the university
are acted upon promptly, rather
than being tabled for indefinite
lengths of time.
According to Mattson, the
present sit-in shows that the
present student government is not
effective. "A group of concerned
students therefore had to step
outside the normal channels of
action, but we hope to make the
student government an effective
channel."
Spiegal
Of the team of Spiegel and
Cornell, Brad Cornell says he's
more philosophically-oriented,
'but John s our spokesman."
"Brad has been a tremendous
influence on my philosophical
beliefs," admitted presidential
candidate, John Spiegel, "and if
we're elected, we'll both make

every attempt to act on these
beliefs."
"We strongly believe in a
unification of thought and
action, both of them agreed.
' This is perhaps the theme of our
political campaign and of our
political views."
Spiegel hails from Berkeley but
appears to have become involved
in politics after several years at
Stanford.
' I spent my first two years
here trying to get good grades and
playing tennis," explained Spiegel.
' But the role I had always
envisioned for myself in society
somehow didn't quite fit.
"I soon found myself talking
to people about what I felt should
be changed in the University and
society. It looked as if the human
race was going to vanish from the
face of the earth in our life time.
'A few isolated students,"
Spiegel stated, "began to unite
and become involved in an
attempt to save America and the
human race.
"I'd like to see the entire
student government united
toward these ends."
"I'm discouraged," stated
Cornell, ' that students have not
been confronted with the current
pressing questions that face our
entire society. Nor have they been
confronted with the real failure of
student government to deal with
these issues.
"We have to impress upon the
students the urgency of making a
moral commitment to the
question 'Does man have the right
to kill others?" And by taking the
fruits of a murdering society," he
stressed, "we are all indirect
murderers."
Regarding a moral
commitment to the US, Spiegel
explained, ' Getting SRI to stop
taking contracts dealing with
counterinsurgency is a much more
important task than fighting the
Viet Cong.'
Shea
In the eighth grade Pat Shea's
history teacher suggested that Pat
should read some Marx. The next
year Shea went to the Soviet
Union and discovered that the
Russians were human beings

afterall. So when he graduated
from a high school in Salt Lake
City, Shea came to Stanford with
1 a different background than
most freshmen. '
Shea is presently running for
ASSU President as one member of
a four-man ticket that also
includes John Grube, Joyce
Kobayashi and Barry Askinas.
The group originally planned
to appear as a four-man ticket on
the election ballot, but because of
an election violation ruling, Shea
will be listed as Presidential
candidate on the ballot and John
Grube as Vice Presidential
candidate.
This year Shea is a sponsor in
Wilbur. He has been central in the
student evaluation of the Study ol
Education at Stanford (SES). He
was one of the prime movers
behind the Coalition, the student
group which initially asked for a
student voice in the consideration
of SES proposals.
More recently, Shea has given a
lot of his time to contacting
Trustees on an individual basis
about the Stanford Research
Institute issue. He has written
letters to individual Board
members and has "attempted to
make personal contact with
several members at every
opportunity." Personal contact is
a better method of appeal than
letter writing, Shea maintains.
"The Board should be
expanded by 10 members," Shea
observed. Four of these new
members should be faculty- two
of them from Stanford and two
from other institutions. Four
should be students- two of them
students or recent graduates of
Stanford and two from other
institutions. The final two
members should be selected on
the basis of race or occupation
not presently represented on the
Board.
Shea feels it is important to
emphasize why he is running on a
four-man ticket.
"The executive office of ASSU
has so many tasks that to expect
one individual to perform them all
is impossible. Mainly because of
the exhaustion of the last three
presidents, the students haven't
been adequately represented by
the person they elected," he said.
Today, Bob Cory will be at
Roth House for lunch and his
running mate, Eckhard Schulz will
be at Phi Sigma Kappa. For the
remainder of the weekend, they
will make appearances at Stern,
Wilbur, Florence Moore, Lagunita,
and the Fraternities.
Jim Schnieder and A1 Dulan
will be at Florence Moore for
lunch and will speak in the
Alondra lounge afterwards.
Tonight they will both be eating
dinner with their wives at

Tim Coburn and Jeff Kane will
meet with students during lunch
and dinner at Soto.
Andrew Gould and Mark Heller
plan to be at AEL all day and will
talk with any interested students
there.
The following is a series of
profiles in alphabetical order
about the candidates. Profiles of
the other four candidates
appeared yesterday.
(Editor's note: The candidates
are reminded that their position
statements of 250-500 words are
due by 2:00 this afternoon.
These statements will be
published in Monday's Daily.)
Coburn
Tim Coburn and Jeff Kane,
co-presidential candidates in the
ASSU elections, believe that
students today are in a "peculiarly
apt position to effect change."
Recognizing "the power of the
university on the national scene,"
they want to lead Stanford
students in the assumption of a
responsibility for this power.
They feel, for example, that
students have access to national
policy makers through the
eminent faculty of the university,
and that the student body, by
showing its will to the Faculty
Senate, can move them to put
pressure on these national policy
makers in Washington.
Students can effect a change in
the general orientation of
research, from the military to the
more pressing problems of
society: pollution, population
control, and the urban crises.
Coburn and Kane believe that
student power to effect change
extends equally to concerns
within the University. Coburn is a
graduate student with one year to
go in the genetics department of
the Stanford Medical School.
Kane, a senior in physiological
psychology, is a member of the
Student Conduct Legislative
Council, the Student Education
Council and the ASSU Professor
Commission.
Coburn and Kane feel that
they have a knowledge of the
University and a sphere of
influence to lead an effective
Student Body government. Their
policy statements for proposed
changes within the University
have been informed and extensive,
ranging from ROTC and housing,
to community spirit and
organization of ASSU.
Coburn was head of the
chemical-biological warfare panel
for the Convocation of the
Stanford Area Scientific and
Technological Community on
March 4. He has been urging the
faculty of the Medical School to
become involved in the issue of
Stanford Research Institute, and
organized a rally at the Medical
School yesterday afternoon to
discuss the sit-in.

Floto
In a campaign that seems
increasingly irrelevant, Paul Floto
is surely one of the more
irrelevant candidates.
"Getting elected is not an
issue," he says. "Given the nature
of student government here at
Stanford, it doesn't make that
much difference."
So Floto is not concerned
about getting elected in an
election that very few people care
about anyway. It may be double
nihilism, but it is consistent with
Floto's philosophy of "social
anarchism."
Conveniently for Floto, he
does not believe that election to a
student office should have
anything to do with popularity.
"The 'cult of personality' which is
cultivated at Stanford during
presidential campaigns is
destructive of democratic
government of the University," he
says. The anarchist candidate has
built this position into a platform
which calls for the ASSU
president to delegate authority in
almost all areas.
If elected, Floto promises to
make ASSU voluntary, reform
Trustees election procedures,
institute a student referendum on
courses, prohibit classified
research at SRI, and keep
motorcycles off White Plaza.
But Floto will not run an
ingratiating campaign. "I refuse to
campaign or solicit campaign
workers or funds at any time," he
says. "I have distributed a
position paper on seven important
issues; if you are willing to
participate, find one, read it, and
tell someone what you think. If
you aren't willing, vote for any of
the other candidates. They are all
eager to govern in the vacuum you
create. I am not willing to govern
you, or govern for you. I am
willing to participate only to the
degree that you will also
participate."
Gould
As he relaxed in an office on
the second floor of the Applied
Electronics Laboratory, Andrew
Gould related many issues of his
campaign for ASSU president to
the present occupation of the
building.
He proposes that students,
faculty, and staff select the
trustees. "If you're going to have
a board, you might as well have
one that represents the people it
theoretically represents," he said.
Gould critized the trustees for
"not being at all responsive to
community needs." He cited the
delay in coed housing and their
misdevelopment of Palo Alto land
as evidence of their
irresponsibility to the community.
"People who work at Stanford
can't afford to live in Palo Alto,"
he said indignantly.
Feeling that students demands
about research are completely
justified, he supports the sit-in
although he commented that the
action was "not militant enough.
We should take over another
building."
"The more buildings we*have,
the more power we have," he
stressed. If elected, he would use a
similar tactic to force the trustees
to relinquish some of their power.
Gould said he recognized that
"the president has no power. The
only power he has is the power of
leadership and to act as a focal
point for student dissatisfaction."
Besides the question of the
trustees' power, Gould's platform
rests on his grievance with SES.
He stated that Stanford needs a
"real study of education."

He believed that the present
reports study "procedural reform
and academic bullshit" and ignore
the more essential problems.
Faculty control of courses
content and the hierarchical
structure in class were two areas
he felt were not covered. His view
of classes today at Stanford was
that the "professor emanates great
rays of knowledge and students sit
there and absorb them."
King
Despite seeing their original
"Daily Machine" ticket of 31
candidates trimmed to two, John
King and Bill Ellsworth are
continuing their campaign and
hope to "experiment with the
idea of participatory democracy
at the top."
The first minimum objective of
their campaign, according to King
who organized the slate of 31, was
to force an official ruling on
plural candidacy. "There were
others (plural candidacies)," King
reported, "and I was not sure if
any decision was being made
about it."
Since a ruling has now been
made, plural candidates on the
same ticket are not permissible,
King considers that he has been
"successful even at this point in
the campaign."
Although this is King's first
year at Stanford, he has had
considerable experience in both
student and national politics. At
Bakersfield College, he was
freshman class president and Chief
Justice of the Student Court. A
junior in political science, he has
been involved with both the
Young Democrats and Students
for McCarthy.
Bill Ellsworth, the
vice-presidential candidate, is a
junior physics major. King
selected him for his "very good
knowledge of the issues here at
Stanford."
The King-Ellsworth platform,
with 13 specific proposals, speaks
very clearly on the issues. "I am
able to do this," King noted,
"because I am not a major
personality in the campaign. I
don't have the ego attachments
that some of the other 'campus
personalities' have. I can speak my
mind."
Kitsman
Chuck Kitsman believes in
"keeping the channels of
communication always open."
"I don't want to label myself
politically," he added, "because
labels usually tend to alienate
people."
"I want to be able to talk to
anybody," Kitsman concluded.
Interested in psychology and
linguistics, Kitsman originates
from Texas but has lived in
Australia, Canada, and Kuwait,
and has attended schools in
Switzerland and the eastern
United States.
He also hesitates to comment
about the events that are
"currently flaring up" because
they are "constantly changing."
His vice-presidential candidate,
Neil Heller is a "shy sociology !
major."

Laird
"There's not a dime's worth of
difference between most of the
other candidates," Phil Laird said
yesterday, giving this as one of his
primary reasons for filing to run
for president of the Stanford
student body.
"I'm disappointed that some of
the more active individuals on this
campus didn't run," Laird told
the Daily yesterday. "The major
views of most of the candidates
running now are pretty much the
same."
Laird, a junior history major,
and John Thomas, a junior in
Psychology, filed their petition
for candidacy only five minutes
before the filing deadline. Laird
describes himself as a "farm boy,"
from the outskirts of Fresno.
Laird has expressed "emphatic
support" for the sit-in now in
progress at the Applied
Electronics Laboratories. "The
trustees failed to meet the issue,"
he declared. "There was no other
action that they the students
could take." Laird regards the
redirection of the Stanford
Research Institute as the central
issue in the conflict.
"I guess I'm pretty much of a
dark horse," Laird said, reflecting
on his own candidacy. "I'm a
member of the silent majority

that people are talking about, 1
feel I can represent this group,"
he added.
Laird expressed support for the
idea of increasing the number of
housing co-ops at Stanford, and
also supports decreasing the
number of requirements neede'
to complete a major here.
Mattson
"It is programs rather than
ideas that are important in
effecting better student
government," says Bob Mattson,
candidate for ASSU president. He
and his running-mate Dick Walker
offer a number of programs which
they hope will make the student
government an effective channel
of expression and action.
Mattson proposes a twenty one
member, residence centered
senate. He says that this will be
more effective than the sixty one
member body outlined by the
Hayes constitution. Being
residence-centered, each living
group would have an individual
means of communication with the
student government. Proportional
representation for graduate and
off-campus students is included in
the proposal.
Included in the Mattson-Walker
platform are suggestions for
experimental dorms which would
involve a cross section of the
university community. While
easing the housing shortage faced
by the university, the
experimental dorms will also
initiate an educational
in the living groups.
Along with the smaller senate,
Mattson and Walker advocate the
formation of a Student-Faculty-
Administration Council which will
insure that certain of the more
urgent issues facing the university
are acted upon promptly, rather
than being tabled for indefinite
lengths of time.
According to Mattson, the
present sit-in shows that the
present student government is not
effective. "A group of concerned
students therefore had to step
outside the normal channels of
action, but we hope to make the
student government an effective
channel."
Spiegal
Of the team of Spiegel and
Cornell, Brad Cornell says he's
more philosophically-oriented,
'but John s our spokesman."
"Brad has been a tremendous
influence on my philosophical
beliefs," admitted presidential
candidate, John Spiegel, "and if
we're elected, we'll both make

every attempt to act on these
beliefs."
"We strongly believe in a
unification of thought and
action, both of them agreed.
' This is perhaps the theme of our
political campaign and of our
political views."
Spiegel hails from Berkeley but
appears to have become involved
in politics after several years at
Stanford.
' I spent my first two years
here trying to get good grades and
playing tennis," explained Spiegel.
' But the role I had always
envisioned for myself in society
somehow didn't quite fit.
"I soon found myself talking
to people about what I felt should
be changed in the University and
society. It looked as if the human
race was going to vanish from the
face of the earth in our life time.
'A few isolated students,"
Spiegel stated, "began to unite
and become involved in an
attempt to save America and the
human race.
"I'd like to see the entire
student government united
toward these ends."
"I'm discouraged," stated
Cornell, ' that students have not
been confronted with the current
pressing questions that face our
entire society. Nor have they been
confronted with the real failure of
student government to deal with
these issues.
"We have to impress upon the
students the urgency of making a
moral commitment to the
question 'Does man have the right
to kill others?" And by taking the
fruits of a murdering society," he
stressed, "we are all indirect
murderers."
Regarding a moral
commitment to the US, Spiegel
explained, ' Getting SRI to stop
taking contracts dealing with
counterinsurgency is a much more
important task than fighting the
Viet Cong.'
Shea
In the eighth grade Pat Shea's
history teacher suggested that Pat
should read some Marx. The next
year Shea went to the Soviet
Union and discovered that the
Russians were human beings

afterall. So when he graduated
from a high school in Salt Lake
City, Shea came to Stanford with
1 a different background than
most freshmen. '
Shea is presently running for
ASSU President as one member of
a four-man ticket that also
includes John Grube, Joyce
Kobayashi and Barry Askinas.
The group originally planned
to appear as a four-man ticket on
the election ballot, but because of
an election violation ruling, Shea
will be listed as Presidential
candidate on the ballot and John
Grube as Vice Presidential
candidate.
This year Shea is a sponsor in
Wilbur. He has been central in the
student evaluation of the Study ol
Education at Stanford (SES). He
was one of the prime movers
behind the Coalition, the student
group which initially asked for a
student voice in the consideration
of SES proposals.
More recently, Shea has given a
lot of his time to contacting
Trustees on an individual basis
about the Stanford Research
Institute issue. He has written
letters to individual Board
members and has "attempted to
make personal contact with
several members at every
opportunity." Personal contact is
a better method of appeal than
letter writing, Shea maintains.
"The Board should be
expanded by 10 members," Shea
observed. Four of these new
members should be faculty- two
of them from Stanford and two
from other institutions. Four
should be students- two of them
students or recent graduates of
Stanford and two from other
institutions. The final two
members should be selected on
the basis of race or occupation
not presently represented on the
Board.
Shea feels it is important to
emphasize why he is running on a
four-man ticket.
"The executive office of ASSU
has so many tasks that to expect
one individual to perform them all
is impossible. Mainly because of
the exhaustion of the last three
presidents, the students haven't
been adequately represented by
the person they elected," he said.
Today, Bob Cory will be at
Roth House for lunch and his
running mate, Eckhard Schulz will
be at Phi Sigma Kappa. For the
remainder of the weekend, they
will make appearances at Stern,
Wilbur, Florence Moore, Lagunita,
and the Fraternities.
Jim Schnieder and A1 Dulan
will be at Florence Moore for
lunch and will speak in the
Alondra lounge afterwards.
Tonight they will both be eating
dinner with their wives at
Lagunita and will speak following
dinner in the Adelfa lounge.
Saturday, Schnieder will be eating
lunch and speaking in Muir House
of Stern.
Tim Coburn and Jeff Kane will

(Editor's note: The candidates
are reminded that their position
statements of 250-500 words are
due by 2:00 this afternoon.
These statements will be
published in Monday's Daily.)
Coburn
Tim Coburn and Jeff Kane,
co-presidential candidates in the
ASSU elections, believe that
students today are in a "peculiarly
apt position to effect change."
Recognizing "the power of the
university on the national scene,"
they want to lead Stanford
students in the assumption of a
responsibility for this power.
They feel, for example, that
students have access to national
policy makers through the
eminent faculty of the university,
and that the student body, by
showing its will to the Faculty
Senate, can move them to put
pressure on these national policy
makers in Washington.
Students can effect a change in
the general orientation of
research, from the military to the
more pressing problems of
society: pollution, population
control, and the urban crises.
Coburn and Kane believe that
student power to effect change
extends equally to concerns
within the University. Coburn is a
graduate student with one year to
go in the genetics department of
the Stanford Medical School.
Kane, a senior in physiological
psychology, is a member of the
Student Conduct Legislative
Council, the Student Education
Council and the ASSU Professor
Commission.
Coburn and Kane feel that
they have a knowledge of the
University and a sphere of
influence to lead an effective
Student Body government. Their
policy statements for proposed
changes within the University
have been informed and extensive,
ranging from ROTC and housing,
to community spirit and
organization of ASSU.
Coburn was head of the
chemical-biological warfare panel
for the Convocation of the
Stanford Area Scientific and
Technological Community on
March 4. He has been urging the
faculty of the Medical School to
become involved in the issue of
Stanford Research Institute, and
organized a rally at the Medical
School yesterday afternoon to
discuss the sit-in.

Floto
In a campaign that seems
increasingly irrelevant, Paul Floto
is surely one of the more
irrelevant candidates.
"Getting elected is not an
issue," he says. "Given the nature
of student government here at
Stanford, it doesn't make that
much difference."
So Floto is not concerned
about getting elected in an
election that very few people care
about anyway. It may be double
nihilism, but it is consistent with
Floto's philosophy of "social
anarchism."
Conveniently for Floto, he
does not believe that election to a
student office should have
anything to do with popularity.
"The 'cult of personality' which is
cultivated at Stanford during
presidential campaigns is
destructive of democratic
government of the University," he
says. The anarchist candidate has
built this position into a platform
which calls for the ASSU
president to delegate authority in
almost all areas.
If elected, Floto promises to
make ASSU voluntary, reform
Trustees election procedures,
institute a student referendum on
courses, prohibit classified
research at SRI, and keep
motorcycles off White Plaza.
But Floto will not run an
ingratiating campaign. "I refuse to
campaign or solicit campaign
workers or funds at any time," he
says. "I have distributed a
position paper on seven important
issues; if you are willing to
participate, find one, read it, and
tell someone what you think. If
you aren't willing, vote for any of
the other candidates. They are all
eager to govern in the vacuum you
create. I am not willing to govern
you, or govern for you. I am
willing to participate only to the
degree that you will also
participate."
Gould
As he relaxed in an office on
the second floor of the Applied
Electronics Laboratory, Andrew
Gould related many issues of his
campaign for ASSU president to
the present occupation of the
building.
He proposes that students,
faculty, and staff select the
trustees. "If you're going to have
a board, you might as well have
one that represents the people it
theoretically represents," he said.
Gould critized the trustees for
"not being at all responsive to
community needs." He cited the
delay in coed housing and their
misdevelopment of Palo Alto land
as evidence of their
irresponsibility to the community.
"People who work at Stanford
can't afford to live in Palo Alto,"
he said indignantly.
Feeling that students demands
about research are completely
justified, he supports the sit-in
although he commented that the
action was "not militant enough.
We should take over another
building."
"The more buildings we*have,
the more power we have," he
stressed. If elected, he would use a
similar tactic to force the trustees
to relinquish some of their power.
Gould said he recognized that
"the president has no power. The
only power he has is the power of
leadership and to act as a focal
point for student dissatisfaction."
Besides the question of the
trustees' power, Gould's platform
rests on his grievance with SES.
He stated that Stanford needs a
"real study of education."

He believed that the present
reports study "procedural reform
and academic bullshit" and ignore
the more essential problems.
Faculty control of courses
content and the hierarchical
structure in class were two areas
he felt were not covered. His view
of classes today at Stanford was
that the "professor emanates great
rays of knowledge and students sit
there and absorb them."
King
Despite seeing their original
"Daily Machine" ticket of 31
candidates trimmed to two, John
King and Bill Ellsworth are
continuing their campaign and
hope to "experiment with the
idea of participatory democracy
at the top."
The first minimum objective of
their campaign, according to King
who organized the slate of 31, was
to force an official ruling on
plural candidacy. "There were
others (plural candidacies)," King
reported, "and I was not sure if
any decision was being made
about it."
Since a ruling has now been
made, plural candidates on the
same ticket are not permissible,
King considers that he has been
"successful even at this point in
the campaign."
Although this is King's first
year at Stanford, he has had
considerable experience in both
student and national politics. At
Bakersfield College, he was
freshman class president and Chief
Justice of the Student Court. A
junior in political science, he has
been involved with both the
Young Democrats and Students
for McCarthy.
Bill Ellsworth, the
vice-presidential candidate, is a
junior physics major. King
selected him for his "very good
knowledge of the issues here at
Stanford."
The King-Ellsworth platform,
with 13 specific proposals, speaks
very clearly on the issues. "I am
able to do this," King noted,
"because I am not a major
personality in the campaign. I
don't have the ego attachments
that some of the other 'campus
personalities' have. I can speak my
mind."
Kitsman
Chuck Kitsman believes in
"keeping the channels of
communication always open."
"I don't want to label myself
politically," he added, "because
labels usually tend to alienate
people."
"I want to be able to talk to
anybody," Kitsman concluded.
Interested in psychology and
linguistics, Kitsman originates
from Texas but has lived in
Australia, Canada, and Kuwait,
and has attended schools in
Switzerland and the eastern
United States.
He also hesitates to comment
about the events that are
"currently flaring up" because
they are "constantly changing."
His vice-presidential candidate,
Neil Heller is a "shy sociology !
major."

Laird
"There's not a dime's worth of
difference between most of the
other candidates," Phil Laird said
yesterday, giving this as one of his
primary reasons for filing to run
for president of the Stanford
student body.
"I'm disappointed that some of
the more active individuals on this
campus didn't run," Laird told
the Daily yesterday. "The major
views of most of the candidates
running now are pretty much the
same."
Laird, a junior history major,
and John Thomas, a junior in
Psychology, filed their petition
for candidacy only five minutes
before the filing deadline. Laird
describes himself as a "farm boy,"
from the outskirts of Fresno.
Laird has expressed "emphatic
support" for the sit-in now in
progress at the Applied
Electronics Laboratories. "The
trustees failed to meet the issue,"
he declared. "There was no other
action that they the students
could take." Laird regards the
redirection of the Stanford
Research Institute as the central
issue in the conflict.
"I guess I'm pretty much of a
dark horse," Laird said, reflecting
on his own candidacy. "I'm a
member of the silent majority

that people are talking about, 1
feel I can represent this group,"
he added.
Laird expressed support for the
idea of increasing the number of
housing co-ops at Stanford, and
also supports decreasing the
number of requirements neede'
to complete a major here.
Mattson
"It is programs rather than
ideas that are important in
effecting better student
government," says Bob Mattson,
candidate for ASSU president. He
and his running-mate Dick Walker
offer a number of programs which
they hope will make the student
government an effective channel
of expression and action.
Mattson proposes a twenty one
member, residence centered
senate. He says that this will be
more effective than the sixty one
member body outlined by the
Hayes constitution. Being
residence-centered, each living
group would have an individual
means of communication with the
student government. Proportional
representation for graduate and
off-campus students is included in
the proposal.
Included in the Mattson-Walker
platform are suggestions for
experimental dorms which would
involve a cross section of the
university community. While
easing the housing shortage faced
by the university, the
experimental dorms will also
initiate an educational
in the living groups.
Along with the smaller senate,
Mattson and Walker advocate the
formation of a Student-Faculty-
Administration Council which will
insure that certain of the more
urgent issues facing the university
are acted upon promptly, rather
than being tabled for indefinite
lengths of time.
According to Mattson, the
present sit-in shows that the
present student government is not
effective. "A group of concerned
students therefore had to step
outside the normal channels of
action, but we hope to make the
student government an effective
channel."
Spiegal
Of the team of Spiegel and
Cornell, Brad Cornell says he's
more philosophically-oriented,
'but John s our spokesman."
"Brad has been a tremendous
influence on my philosophical
beliefs," admitted presidential
candidate, John Spiegel, "and if
we're elected, we'll both make

every attempt to act on these
beliefs."
"We strongly believe in a
unification of thought and
action, both of them agreed.
' This is perhaps the theme of our
political campaign and of our
political views."
Spiegel hails from Berkeley but
appears to have become involved
in politics after several years at
Stanford.
' I spent my first two years
here trying to get good grades and
playing tennis," explained Spiegel.
' But the role I had always
envisioned for myself in society
somehow didn't quite fit.
"I soon found myself talking
to people about what I felt should
be changed in the University and
society. It looked as if the human
race was going to vanish from the
face of the earth in our life time.
'A few isolated students,"
Spiegel stated, "began to unite
and become involved in an
attempt to save America and the
human race.
"I'd like to see the entire
student government united
toward these ends."
"I'm discouraged," stated
Cornell, ' that students have not
been confronted with the current
pressing questions that face our
entire society. Nor have they been
confronted with the real failure of
student government to deal with
these issues.
"We have to impress upon the
students the urgency of making a
moral commitment to the
question 'Does man have the right
to kill others?" And by taking the
fruits of a murdering society," he
stressed, "we are all indirect
murderers."
Regarding a moral
commitment to the US, Spiegel
explained, ' Getting SRI to stop
taking contracts dealing with
counterinsurgency is a much more
important task than fighting the
Viet Cong.'
Shea
In the eighth grade Pat Shea's
history teacher suggested that Pat
should read some Marx. The next
year Shea went to the Soviet
Union and discovered that the
Russians were human beings

afterall. So when he graduated
from a high school in Salt Lake
City, Shea came to Stanford with
1 a different background than
most freshmen. '
Shea is presently running for
ASSU President as one member of
a four-man ticket that also
includes John Grube, Joyce
Kobayashi and Barry Askinas.
The group originally planned
to appear as a four-man ticket on
the election ballot, but because of
an election violation ruling, Shea
will be listed as Presidential
candidate on the ballot and John
Grube as Vice Presidential
candidate.
This year Shea is a sponsor in
Wilbur. He has been central in the
student evaluation of the Study ol
Education at Stanford (SES). He
was one of the prime movers
behind the Coalition, the student
group which initially asked for a
student voice in the consideration
of SES proposals.
More recently, Shea has given a
lot of his time to contacting
Trustees on an individual basis
about the Stanford Research
Institute issue. He has written
letters to individual Board
members and has "attempted to
make personal contact with
several members at every
opportunity." Personal contact is
a better method of appeal than
letter writing, Shea maintains.
"The Board should be
expanded by 10 members," Shea
observed. Four of these new
members should be faculty- two
of them from Stanford and two
from other institutions. Four
should be students- two of them
students or recent graduates of
Stanford and two from other
institutions. The final two
members should be selected on
the basis of race or occupation
not presently represented on the
Board.
Shea feels it is important to
emphasize why he is running on a
four-man ticket.
"The executive office of ASSU
has so many tasks that to expect
one individual to perform them all
is impossible. Mainly because of
the exhaustion of the last three
presidents, the students haven't
been adequately represented by
the person they elected," he said.
Today, Bob Cory will be at
Roth House for lunch and his
running mate, Eckhard Schulz will
be at Phi Sigma Kappa. For the
remainder of the weekend, they
will make appearances at Stern,
Wilbur, Florence Moore, Lagunita,
and the Fraternities.
Jim Schnieder and A1 Dulan
will be at Florence Moore for
lunch and will speak in the
Alondra lounge afterwards.
Tonight they will both be eating
dinner with their wives at
Lagunita and will speak following
dinner in the Adelfa lounge.
Saturday, Schnieder will be eating
lunch and speaking in Muir House
of Stern.
Tim Coburn and Jeff Kane will
meet with students during lunch
and dinner at Soto.
Andrew Gould and Mark Heller
plan to be at AEL all day and will
talk with any interested students
there.
The following is a series of
profiles in alphabetical order
about the candidates. Profiles of
the other four candidates

students today are in a "peculiarly
apt position to effect change."
Recognizing "the power of the
university on the national scene,"
they want to lead Stanford
students in the assumption of a
responsibility for this power.
They feel, for example, that
students have access to national
policy makers through the
eminent faculty of the university,
and that the student body, by
showing its will to the Faculty
Senate, can move them to put
pressure on these national policy
makers in Washington.
Students can effect a change in
the general orientation of
research, from the military to the
more pressing problems of
society: pollution, population
control, and the urban crises.
Coburn and Kane believe that
student power to effect change
extends equally to concerns
within the University. Coburn is a
graduate student with one year to
go in the genetics department of
the Stanford Medical School.
Kane, a senior in physiological
psychology, is a member of the
Student Conduct Legislative
Council, the Student Education
Council and the ASSU Professor
Commission.
Coburn and Kane feel that
they have a knowledge of the
University and a sphere of
influence to lead an effective
Student Body government. Their
policy statements for proposed
changes within the University
have been informed and extensive,
ranging from ROTC and housing,
to community spirit and
organization of ASSU.
Coburn was head of the
chemical-biological warfare panel
for the Convocation of the
Stanford Area Scientific and
Technological Community on
March 4. He has been urging the
faculty of the Medical School to
become involved in the issue of
Stanford Research Institute, and
organized a rally at the Medical
School yesterday afternoon to
discuss the sit-in.

Floto
In a campaign that seems
increasingly irrelevant, Paul Floto
is surely one of the more
irrelevant candidates.
"Getting elected is not an
issue," he says. "Given the nature
of student government here at
Stanford, it doesn't make that
much difference."
So Floto is not concerned
about getting elected in an
election that very few people care
about anyway. It may be double
nihilism, but it is consistent with
Floto's philosophy of "social
anarchism."
Conveniently for Floto, he
does not believe that election to a
student office should have
anything to do with popularity.
"The 'cult of personality' which is
cultivated at Stanford during
presidential campaigns is
destructive of democratic
government of the University," he
says. The anarchist candidate has
built this position into a platform
which calls for the ASSU
president to delegate authority in
almost all areas.
If elected, Floto promises to
make ASSU voluntary, reform
Trustees election procedures,
institute a student referendum on
courses, prohibit classified
research at SRI, and keep
motorcycles off White Plaza.
But Floto will not run an
ingratiating campaign. "I refuse to
campaign or solicit campaign
workers or funds at any time," he
says. "I have distributed a
position paper on seven important
issues; if you are willing to
participate, find one, read it, and
tell someone what you think. If
you aren't willing, vote for any of
the other candidates. They are all
eager to govern in the vacuum you
create. I am not willing to govern
you, or govern for you. I am
willing to participate only to the
degree that you will also
participate."
Gould
As he relaxed in an office on
the second floor of the Applied
Electronics Laboratory, Andrew
Gould related many issues of his
campaign for ASSU president to
the present occupation of the
building.
He proposes that students,
faculty, and staff select the
trustees. "If you're going to have
a board, you might as well have
one that represents the people it
theoretically represents," he said.
Gould critized the trustees for
"not being at all responsive to
community needs." He cited the
delay in coed housing and their
misdevelopment of Palo Alto land
as evidence of their
irresponsibility to the community.
"People who work at Stanford
can't afford to live in Palo Alto,"
he said indignantly.
Feeling that students demands
about research are completely
justified, he supports the sit-in
although he commented that the
action was "not militant enough.
We should take over another
building."
"The more buildings we*have,
the more power we have," he
stressed. If elected, he would use a
similar tactic to force the trustees
to relinquish some of their power.
Gould said he recognized that
"the president has no power. The
only power he has is the power of
leadership and to act as a focal
point for student dissatisfaction."
Besides the question of the
trustees' power, Gould's platform
rests on his grievance with SES.
He stated that Stanford needs a
"real study of education."

He believed that the present
reports study "procedural reform
and academic bullshit" and ignore
the more essential problems.
Faculty control of courses
content and the hierarchical
structure in class were two areas
he felt were not covered. His view
of classes today at Stanford was
that the "professor emanates great
rays of knowledge and students sit
there and absorb them."
King
Despite seeing their original
"Daily Machine" ticket of 31
candidates trimmed to two, John
King and Bill Ellsworth are
continuing their campaign and
hope to "experiment with the
idea of participatory democracy
at the top."
The first minimum objective of
their campaign, according to King
who organized the slate of 31, was
to force an official ruling on
plural candidacy. "There were
others (plural candidacies)," King
reported, "and I was not sure if
any decision was being made
about it."
Since a ruling has now been
made, plural candidates on the
same ticket are not permissible,
King considers that he has been
"successful even at this point in
the campaign."
Although this is King's first
year at Stanford, he has had
considerable experience in both
student and national politics. At
Bakersfield College, he was
freshman class president and Chief
Justice of the Student Court. A
junior in political science, he has
been involved with both the
Young Democrats and Students
for McCarthy.
Bill Ellsworth, the
vice-presidential candidate, is a
junior physics major. King
selected him for his "very good
knowledge of the issues here at
Stanford."
The King-Ellsworth platform,
with 13 specific proposals, speaks
very clearly on the issues. "I am
able to do this," King noted,
"because I am not a major
personality in the campaign. I
don't have the ego attachments
that some of the other 'campus
personalities' have. I can speak my
mind."
Kitsman
Chuck Kitsman believes in
"keeping the channels of
communication always open."
"I don't want to label myself
politically," he added, "because
labels usually tend to alienate
people."
"I want to be able to talk to
anybody," Kitsman concluded.
Interested in psychology and
linguistics, Kitsman originates
from Texas but has lived in
Australia, Canada, and Kuwait,
and has attended schools in
Switzerland and the eastern
United States.
He also hesitates to comment
about the events that are
"currently flaring up" because
they are "constantly changing."
His vice-presidential candidate,
Neil Heller is a "shy sociology !
major."

Laird
"There's not a dime's worth of
difference between most of the
other candidates," Phil Laird said
yesterday, giving this as one of his
primary reasons for filing to run
for president of the Stanford
student body.
"I'm disappointed that some of
the more active individuals on this
campus didn't run," Laird told
the Daily yesterday. "The major
views of most of the candidates
running now are pretty much the
same."
Laird, a junior history major,
and John Thomas, a junior in
Psychology, filed their petition
for candidacy only five minutes
before the filing deadline. Laird
describes himself as a "farm boy,"
from the outskirts of Fresno.
Laird has expressed "emphatic
support" for the sit-in now in
progress at the Applied
Electronics Laboratories. "The
trustees failed to meet the issue,"
he declared. "There was no other
action that they the students
could take." Laird regards the
redirection of the Stanford
Research Institute as the central
issue in the conflict.
"I guess I'm pretty much of a
dark horse," Laird said, reflecting
on his own candidacy. "I'm a
member of the silent majority

that people are talking about, 1
feel I can represent this group,"
he added.
Laird expressed support for the
idea of increasing the number of
housing co-ops at Stanford, and
also supports decreasing the
number of requirements neede'
to complete a major here.
Mattson
"It is programs rather than
ideas that are important in
effecting better student
government," says Bob Mattson,
candidate for ASSU president. He
and his running-mate Dick Walker
offer a number of programs which
they hope will make the student
government an effective channel
of expression and action.
Mattson proposes a twenty one
member, residence centered
senate. He says that this will be
more effective than the sixty one
member body outlined by the
Hayes constitution. Being
residence-centered, each living
group would have an individual
means of communication with the
student government. Proportional
representation for graduate and
off-campus students is included in
the proposal.
Included in the Mattson-Walker
platform are suggestions for
experimental dorms which would
involve a cross section of the
university community. While
easing the housing shortage faced
by the university, the
experimental dorms will also
initiate an educational
in the living groups.
Along with the smaller senate,
Mattson and Walker advocate the
formation of a Student-Faculty-
Administration Council which will
insure that certain of the more
urgent issues facing the university
are acted upon promptly, rather
than being tabled for indefinite
lengths of time.
According to Mattson, the
present sit-in shows that the
present student government is not
effective. "A group of concerned
students therefore had to step
outside the normal channels of
action, but we hope to make the
student government an effective
channel."
Spiegal
Of the team of Spiegel and
Cornell, Brad Cornell says he's
more philosophically-oriented,
'but John s our spokesman."
"Brad has been a tremendous
influence on my philosophical
beliefs," admitted presidential
candidate, John Spiegel, "and if
we're elected, we'll both make

every attempt to act on these
beliefs."
"We strongly believe in a
unification of thought and
action, both of them agreed.
' This is perhaps the theme of our
political campaign and of our
political views."
Spiegel hails from Berkeley but
appears to have become involved
in politics after several years at
Stanford.
' I spent my first two years
here trying to get good grades and
playing tennis," explained Spiegel.
' But the role I had always
envisioned for myself in society
somehow didn't quite fit.
"I soon found myself talking
to people about what I felt should
be changed in the University and
society. It looked as if the human
race was going to vanish from the
face of the earth in our life time.
'A few isolated students,"
Spiegel stated, "began to unite
and become involved in an
attempt to save America and the
human race.
"I'd like to see the entire
student government united
toward these ends."
"I'm discouraged," stated
Cornell, ' that students have not
been confronted with the current
pressing questions that face our
entire society. Nor have they been
confronted with the real failure of
student government to deal with
these issues.
"We have to impress upon the
students the urgency of making a
moral commitment to the
question 'Does man have the right
to kill others?" And by taking the
fruits of a murdering society," he
stressed, "we are all indirect
murderers."
Regarding a moral
commitment to the US, Spiegel
explained, ' Getting SRI to stop
taking contracts dealing with
counterinsurgency is a much more
important task than fighting the
Viet Cong.'
Shea
In the eighth grade Pat Shea's
history teacher suggested that Pat
should read some Marx. The next
year Shea went to the Soviet
Union and discovered that the
Russians were human beings

afterall. So when he graduated
from a high school in Salt Lake
City, Shea came to Stanford with
1 a different background than
most freshmen. '
Shea is presently running for
ASSU President as one member of
a four-man ticket that also
includes John Grube, Joyce
Kobayashi and Barry Askinas.
The group originally planned
to appear as a four-man ticket on
the election ballot, but because of
an election violation ruling, Shea
will be listed as Presidential
candidate on the ballot and John
Grube as Vice Presidential
candidate.
This year Shea is a sponsor in
Wilbur. He has been central in the
student evaluation of the Study ol
Education at Stanford (SES). He
was one of the prime movers
behind the Coalition, the student
group which initially asked for a
student voice in the consideration
of SES proposals.
More recently, Shea has given a
lot of his time to contacting
Trustees on an individual basis
about the Stanford Research
Institute issue. He has written
letters to individual Board
members and has "attempted to
make personal contact with
several members at every
opportunity." Personal contact is
a better method of appeal than
letter writing, Shea maintains.
"The Board should be
expanded by 10 members," Shea
observed. Four of these new
members should be faculty- two
of them from Stanford and two
from other institutions. Four
should be students- two of them
students or recent graduates of
Stanford and two from other
institutions. The final two
members should be selected on
the basis of race or occupation
not presently represented on the
Board.
Shea feels it is important to
emphasize why he is running on a
four-man ticket.
"The executive office of ASSU
has so many tasks that to expect
one individual to perform them all
is impossible. Mainly because of
the exhaustion of the last three
presidents, the students haven't
been adequately represented by
the person they elected," he said.
Today, Bob Cory will be at
Roth House for lunch and his
running mate, Eckhard Schulz will
be at Phi Sigma Kappa. For the
remainder of the weekend, they
will make appearances at Stern,
Wilbur, Florence Moore, Lagunita,
and the Fraternities.
Jim Schnieder and A1 Dulan
will be at Florence Moore for
lunch and will speak in the
Alondra lounge afterwards.
Tonight they will both be eating
dinner with their wives at
Lagunita and will speak following
dinner in the Adelfa lounge.
Saturday, Schnieder will be eating
lunch and speaking in Muir House
of Stern.
Tim Coburn and Jeff Kane will
meet with students during lunch
and dinner at Soto.
Andrew Gould and Mark Heller
plan to be at AEL all day and will
talk with any interested students
there.
The following is a series of
profiles in alphabetical order
about the candidates. Profiles of
the other four candidates
appeared yesterday.
(Editor's note: The candidates
are reminded that their position
statements of 250-500 words are
due by 2:00 this afternoon.
These statements will be
published in Monday's Daily.)

eminent faculty of the university,
and that the student body, by
showing its will to the Faculty
Senate, can move them to put
pressure on these national policy
makers in Washington.
Students can effect a change in
the general orientation of
research, from the military to the
more pressing problems of
society: pollution, population
control, and the urban crises.
Coburn and Kane believe that
student power to effect change
extends equally to concerns
within the University. Coburn is a
graduate student with one year to
go in the genetics department of
the Stanford Medical School.
Kane, a senior in physiological
psychology, is a member of the
Student Conduct Legislative
Council, the Student Education
Council and the ASSU Professor
Commission.
Coburn and Kane feel that
they have a knowledge of the
University and a sphere of
influence to lead an effective
Student Body government. Their
policy statements for proposed
changes within the University
have been informed and extensive,
ranging from ROTC and housing,
to community spirit and
organization of ASSU.
Coburn was head of the
chemical-biological warfare panel
for the Convocation of the
Stanford Area Scientific and
Technological Community on
March 4. He has been urging the
faculty of the Medical School to
become involved in the issue of
Stanford Research Institute, and
organized a rally at the Medical
School yesterday afternoon to
discuss the sit-in.

Floto
In a campaign that seems
increasingly irrelevant, Paul Floto
is surely one of the more
irrelevant candidates.
"Getting elected is not an
issue," he says. "Given the nature
of student government here at
Stanford, it doesn't make that
much difference."
So Floto is not concerned
about getting elected in an
election that very few people care
about anyway. It may be double
nihilism, but it is consistent with
Floto's philosophy of "social
anarchism."
Conveniently for Floto, he
does not believe that election to a
student office should have
anything to do with popularity.
"The 'cult of personality' which is
cultivated at Stanford during
presidential campaigns is
destructive of democratic
government of the University," he
says. The anarchist candidate has
built this position into a platform
which calls for the ASSU
president to delegate authority in
almost all areas.
If elected, Floto promises to
make ASSU voluntary, reform
Trustees election procedures,
institute a student referendum on
courses, prohibit classified
research at SRI, and keep
motorcycles off White Plaza.
But Floto will not run an
ingratiating campaign. "I refuse to
campaign or solicit campaign
workers or funds at any time," he
says. "I have distributed a
position paper on seven important
issues; if you are willing to
participate, find one, read it, and
tell someone what you think. If
you aren't willing, vote for any of
the other candidates. They are all
eager to govern in the vacuum you
create. I am not willing to govern
you, or govern for you. I am
willing to participate only to the
degree that you will also
participate."
Gould
As he relaxed in an office on
the second floor of the Applied
Electronics Laboratory, Andrew
Gould related many issues of his
campaign for ASSU president to
the present occupation of the
building.
He proposes that students,
faculty, and staff select the
trustees. "If you're going to have
a board, you might as well have
one that represents the people it
theoretically represents," he said.
Gould critized the trustees for
"not being at all responsive to
community needs." He cited the
delay in coed housing and their
misdevelopment of Palo Alto land
as evidence of their
irresponsibility to the community.
"People who work at Stanford
can't afford to live in Palo Alto,"
he said indignantly.
Feeling that students demands
about research are completely
justified, he supports the sit-in
although he commented that the
action was "not militant enough.
We should take over another
building."
"The more buildings we*have,
the more power we have," he
stressed. If elected, he would use a
similar tactic to force the trustees
to relinquish some of their power.
Gould said he recognized that
"the president has no power. The
only power he has is the power of
leadership and to act as a focal
point for student dissatisfaction."
Besides the question of the
trustees' power, Gould's platform
rests on his grievance with SES.
He stated that Stanford needs a
"real study of education."

He believed that the present
reports study "procedural reform
and academic bullshit" and ignore
the more essential problems.
Faculty control of courses
content and the hierarchical
structure in class were two areas
he felt were not covered. His view
of classes today at Stanford was
that the "professor emanates great
rays of knowledge and students sit
there and absorb them."
King
Despite seeing their original
"Daily Machine" ticket of 31
candidates trimmed to two, John
King and Bill Ellsworth are
continuing their campaign and
hope to "experiment with the
idea of participatory democracy
at the top."
The first minimum objective of
their campaign, according to King
who organized the slate of 31, was
to force an official ruling on
plural candidacy. "There were
others (plural candidacies)," King
reported, "and I was not sure if
any decision was being made
about it."
Since a ruling has now been
made, plural candidates on the
same ticket are not permissible,
King considers that he has been
"successful even at this point in
the campaign."
Although this is King's first
year at Stanford, he has had
considerable experience in both
student and national politics. At
Bakersfield College, he was
freshman class president and Chief
Justice of the Student Court. A
junior in political science, he has
been involved with both the
Young Democrats and Students
for McCarthy.
Bill Ellsworth, the
vice-presidential candidate, is a
junior physics major. King
selected him for his "very good
knowledge of the issues here at
Stanford."
The King-Ellsworth platform,
with 13 specific proposals, speaks
very clearly on the issues. "I am
able to do this," King noted,
"because I am not a major
personality in the campaign. I
don't have the ego attachments
that some of the other 'campus
personalities' have. I can speak my
mind."
Kitsman
Chuck Kitsman believes in
"keeping the channels of
communication always open."
"I don't want to label myself
politically," he added, "because
labels usually tend to alienate
people."
"I want to be able to talk to
anybody," Kitsman concluded.
Interested in psychology and
linguistics, Kitsman originates
from Texas but has lived in
Australia, Canada, and Kuwait,
and has attended schools in
Switzerland and the eastern
United States.
He also hesitates to comment
about the events that are
"currently flaring up" because
they are "constantly changing."
His vice-presidential candidate,
Neil Heller is a "shy sociology !
major."

Laird
"There's not a dime's worth of
difference between most of the
other candidates," Phil Laird said
yesterday, giving this as one of his
primary reasons for filing to run
for president of the Stanford
student body.
"I'm disappointed that some of
the more active individuals on this
campus didn't run," Laird told
the Daily yesterday. "The major
views of most of the candidates
running now are pretty much the
same."
Laird, a junior history major,
and John Thomas, a junior in
Psychology, filed their petition
for candidacy only five minutes
before the filing deadline. Laird
describes himself as a "farm boy,"
from the outskirts of Fresno.
Laird has expressed "emphatic
support" for the sit-in now in
progress at the Applied
Electronics Laboratories. "The
trustees failed to meet the issue,"
he declared. "There was no other
action that they the students
could take." Laird regards the
redirection of the Stanford
Research Institute as the central
issue in the conflict.
"I guess I'm pretty much of a
dark horse," Laird said, reflecting
on his own candidacy. "I'm a
member of the silent majority

that people are talking about, 1
feel I can represent this group,"
he added.
Laird expressed support for the
idea of increasing the number of
housing co-ops at Stanford, and
also supports decreasing the
number of requirements neede'
to complete a major here.
Mattson
"It is programs rather than
ideas that are important in
effecting better student
government," says Bob Mattson,
candidate for ASSU president. He
and his running-mate Dick Walker
offer a number of programs which
they hope will make the student
government an effective channel
of expression and action.
Mattson proposes a twenty one
member, residence centered
senate. He says that this will be
more effective than the sixty one
member body outlined by the
Hayes constitution. Being
residence-centered, each living
group would have an individual
means of communication with the
student government. Proportional
representation for graduate and
off-campus students is included in
the proposal.
Included in the Mattson-Walker
platform are suggestions for
experimental dorms which would
involve a cross section of the
university community. While
easing the housing shortage faced
by the university, the
experimental dorms will also
initiate an educational
in the living groups.
Along with the smaller senate,
Mattson and Walker advocate the
formation of a Student-Faculty-
Administration Council which will
insure that certain of the more
urgent issues facing the university
are acted upon promptly, rather
than being tabled for indefinite
lengths of time.
According to Mattson, the
present sit-in shows that the
present student government is not
effective. "A group of concerned
students therefore had to step
outside the normal channels of
action, but we hope to make the
student government an effective
channel."
Spiegal
Of the team of Spiegel and
Cornell, Brad Cornell says he's
more philosophically-oriented,
'but John s our spokesman."
"Brad has been a tremendous
influence on my philosophical
beliefs," admitted presidential
candidate, John Spiegel, "and if
we're elected, we'll both make

every attempt to act on these
beliefs."
"We strongly believe in a
unification of thought and
action, both of them agreed.
' This is perhaps the theme of our
political campaign and of our
political views."
Spiegel hails from Berkeley but
appears to have become involved
in politics after several years at
Stanford.
' I spent my first two years
here trying to get good grades and
playing tennis," explained Spiegel.
' But the role I had always
envisioned for myself in society
somehow didn't quite fit.
"I soon found myself talking
to people about what I felt should
be changed in the University and
society. It looked as if the human
race was going to vanish from the
face of the earth in our life time.
'A few isolated students,"
Spiegel stated, "began to unite
and become involved in an
attempt to save America and the
human race.
"I'd like to see the entire
student government united
toward these ends."
"I'm discouraged," stated
Cornell, ' that students have not
been confronted with the current
pressing questions that face our
entire society. Nor have they been
confronted with the real failure of
student government to deal with
these issues.
"We have to impress upon the
students the urgency of making a
moral commitment to the
question 'Does man have the right
to kill others?" And by taking the
fruits of a murdering society," he
stressed, "we are all indirect
murderers."
Regarding a moral
commitment to the US, Spiegel
explained, ' Getting SRI to stop
taking contracts dealing with
counterinsurgency is a much more
important task than fighting the
Viet Cong.'
Shea
In the eighth grade Pat Shea's
history teacher suggested that Pat
should read some Marx. The next
year Shea went to the Soviet
Union and discovered that the
Russians were human beings

afterall. So when he graduated
from a high school in Salt Lake
City, Shea came to Stanford with
1 a different background than
most freshmen. '
Shea is presently running for
ASSU President as one member of
a four-man ticket that also
includes John Grube, Joyce
Kobayashi and Barry Askinas.
The group originally planned
to appear as a four-man ticket on
the election ballot, but because of
an election violation ruling, Shea
will be listed as Presidential
candidate on the ballot and John
Grube as Vice Presidential
candidate.
This year Shea is a sponsor in
Wilbur. He has been central in the
student evaluation of the Study ol
Education at Stanford (SES). He
was one of the prime movers
behind the Coalition, the student
group which initially asked for a
student voice in the consideration
of SES proposals.
More recently, Shea has given a
lot of his time to contacting
Trustees on an individual basis
about the Stanford Research
Institute issue. He has written
letters to individual Board
members and has "attempted to
make personal contact with
several members at every
opportunity." Personal contact is
a better method of appeal than
letter writing, Shea maintains.
"The Board should be
expanded by 10 members," Shea
observed. Four of these new
members should be faculty- two
of them from Stanford and two
from other institutions. Four
should be students- two of them
students or recent graduates of
Stanford and two from other
institutions. The final two
members should be selected on
the basis of race or occupation
not presently represented on the
Board.
Shea feels it is important to
emphasize why he is running on a
four-man ticket.
"The executive office of ASSU
has so many tasks that to expect
one individual to perform them all
is impossible. Mainly because of
the exhaustion of the last three
presidents, the students haven't
been adequately represented by
the person they elected," he said.
Today, Bob Cory will be at
Roth House for lunch and his
running mate, Eckhard Schulz will
be at Phi Sigma Kappa. For the
remainder of the weekend, they
will make appearances at Stern,
Wilbur, Florence Moore, Lagunita,
and the Fraternities.
Jim Schnieder and A1 Dulan
will be at Florence Moore for
lunch and will speak in the
Alondra lounge afterwards.
Tonight they will both be eating
dinner with their wives at
Lagunita and will speak following
dinner in the Adelfa lounge.
Saturday, Schnieder will be eating
lunch and speaking in Muir House
of Stern.
Tim Coburn and Jeff Kane will
meet with students during lunch
and dinner at Soto.
Andrew Gould and Mark Heller
plan to be at AEL all day and will
talk with any interested students
there.
The following is a series of
profiles in alphabetical order
about the candidates. Profiles of
the other four candidates
appeared yesterday.
(Editor's note: The candidates
are reminded that their position
statements of 250-500 words are
due by 2:00 this afternoon.
These statements will be
published in Monday's Daily.)

co-presidential candidates in the
ASSU elections, believe that
students today are in a "peculiarly

control, and the urban crises.
Coburn and Kane believe that
student power to effect change
extends equally to concerns
within the University. Coburn is a
graduate student with one year to
go in the genetics department of
the Stanford Medical School.
Kane, a senior in physiological
psychology, is a member of the
Student Conduct Legislative
Council, the Student Education
Council and the ASSU Professor
Commission.
Coburn and Kane feel that
they have a knowledge of the
University and a sphere of
influence to lead an effective
Student Body government. Their
policy statements for proposed
changes within the University
have been informed and extensive,
ranging from ROTC and housing,
to community spirit and
organization of ASSU.
Coburn was head of the
chemical-biological warfare panel
for the Convocation of the
Stanford Area Scientific and
Technological Community on
March 4. He has been urging the
faculty of the Medical School to
become involved in the issue of
Stanford Research Institute, and
organized a rally at the Medical
School yesterday afternoon to
discuss the sit-in.

Floto
In a campaign that seems
increasingly irrelevant, Paul Floto
is surely one of the more
irrelevant candidates.
"Getting elected is not an
issue," he says. "Given the nature
of student government here at
Stanford, it doesn't make that
much difference."
So Floto is not concerned
about getting elected in an
election that very few people care
about anyway. It may be double
nihilism, but it is consistent with
Floto's philosophy of "social
anarchism."
Conveniently for Floto, he
does not believe that election to a
student office should have
anything to do with popularity.
"The 'cult of personality' which is
cultivated at Stanford during
presidential campaigns is
destructive of democratic
government of the University," he
says. The anarchist candidate has
built this position into a platform
which calls for the ASSU
president to delegate authority in
almost all areas.
If elected, Floto promises to
make ASSU voluntary, reform
Trustees election procedures,
institute a student referendum on
courses, prohibit classified
research at SRI, and keep
motorcycles off White Plaza.
But Floto will not run an
ingratiating campaign. "I refuse to
campaign or solicit campaign
workers or funds at any time," he
says. "I have distributed a
position paper on seven important
issues; if you are willing to
participate, find one, read it, and
tell someone what you think. If
you aren't willing, vote for any of
the other candidates. They are all
eager to govern in the vacuum you
create. I am not willing to govern
you, or govern for you. I am
willing to participate only to the
degree that you will also
participate."
Gould
As he relaxed in an office on
the second floor of the Applied
Electronics Laboratory, Andrew
Gould related many issues of his
campaign for ASSU president to
the present occupation of the
building.
He proposes that students,
faculty, and staff select the
trustees. "If you're going to have
a board, you might as well have
one that represents the people it
theoretically represents," he said.
Gould critized the trustees for
"not being at all responsive to
community needs." He cited the
delay in coed housing and their
misdevelopment of Palo Alto land
as evidence of their
irresponsibility to the community.
"People who work at Stanford
can't afford to live in Palo Alto,"
he said indignantly.
Feeling that students demands
about research are completely
justified, he supports the sit-in
although he commented that the
action was "not militant enough.
We should take over another
building."
"The more buildings we*have,
the more power we have," he
stressed. If elected, he would use a
similar tactic to force the trustees
to relinquish some of their power.
Gould said he recognized that
"the president has no power. The
only power he has is the power of
leadership and to act as a focal
point for student dissatisfaction."
Besides the question of the
trustees' power, Gould's platform
rests on his grievance with SES.
He stated that Stanford needs a
"real study of education."

He believed that the present
reports study "procedural reform
and academic bullshit" and ignore
the more essential problems.
Faculty control of courses
content and the hierarchical
structure in class were two areas
he felt were not covered. His view
of classes today at Stanford was
that the "professor emanates great
rays of knowledge and students sit
there and absorb them."
King
Despite seeing their original
"Daily Machine" ticket of 31
candidates trimmed to two, John
King and Bill Ellsworth are
continuing their campaign and
hope to "experiment with the
idea of participatory democracy
at the top."
The first minimum objective of
their campaign, according to King
who organized the slate of 31, was
to force an official ruling on
plural candidacy. "There were
others (plural candidacies)," King
reported, "and I was not sure if
any decision was being made
about it."
Since a ruling has now been
made, plural candidates on the
same ticket are not permissible,
King considers that he has been
"successful even at this point in
the campaign."
Although this is King's first
year at Stanford, he has had
considerable experience in both
student and national politics. At
Bakersfield College, he was
freshman class president and Chief
Justice of the Student Court. A
junior in political science, he has
been involved with both the
Young Democrats and Students
for McCarthy.
Bill Ellsworth, the
vice-presidential candidate, is a
junior physics major. King
selected him for his "very good
knowledge of the issues here at
Stanford."
The King-Ellsworth platform,
with 13 specific proposals, speaks
very clearly on the issues. "I am
able to do this," King noted,
"because I am not a major
personality in the campaign. I
don't have the ego attachments
that some of the other 'campus
personalities' have. I can speak my
mind."
Kitsman
Chuck Kitsman believes in
"keeping the channels of
communication always open."
"I don't want to label myself
politically," he added, "because
labels usually tend to alienate
people."
"I want to be able to talk to
anybody," Kitsman concluded.
Interested in psychology and
linguistics, Kitsman originates
from Texas but has lived in
Australia, Canada, and Kuwait,
and has attended schools in
Switzerland and the eastern
United States.
He also hesitates to comment
about the events that are
"currently flaring up" because
they are "constantly changing."
His vice-presidential candidate,
Neil Heller is a "shy sociology !
major."

Laird
"There's not a dime's worth of
difference between most of the
other candidates," Phil Laird said
yesterday, giving this as one of his
primary reasons for filing to run
for president of the Stanford
student body.
"I'm disappointed that some of
the more active individuals on this
campus didn't run," Laird told
the Daily yesterday. "The major
views of most of the candidates
running now are pretty much the
same."
Laird, a junior history major,
and John Thomas, a junior in
Psychology, filed their petition
for candidacy only five minutes
before the filing deadline. Laird
describes himself as a "farm boy,"
from the outskirts of Fresno.
Laird has expressed "emphatic
support" for the sit-in now in
progress at the Applied
Electronics Laboratories. "The
trustees failed to meet the issue,"
he declared. "There was no other
action that they the students
could take." Laird regards the
redirection of the Stanford
Research Institute as the central
issue in the conflict.
"I guess I'm pretty much of a
dark horse," Laird said, reflecting
on his own candidacy. "I'm a
member of the silent majority

that people are talking about, 1
feel I can represent this group,"
he added.
Laird expressed support for the
idea of increasing the number of
housing co-ops at Stanford, and
also supports decreasing the
number of requirements neede'
to complete a major here.
Mattson
"It is programs rather than
ideas that are important in
effecting better student
government," says Bob Mattson,
candidate for ASSU president. He
and his running-mate Dick Walker
offer a number of programs which
they hope will make the student
government an effective channel
of expression and action.
Mattson proposes a twenty one
member, residence centered
senate. He says that this will be
more effective than the sixty one
member body outlined by the
Hayes constitution. Being
residence-centered, each living
group would have an individual
means of communication with the
student government. Proportional
representation for graduate and
off-campus students is included in
the proposal.
Included in the Mattson-Walker
platform are suggestions for
experimental dorms which would
involve a cross section of the
university community. While
easing the housing shortage faced
by the university, the
experimental dorms will also
initiate an educational
in the living groups.
Along with the smaller senate,
Mattson and Walker advocate the
formation of a Student-Faculty-
Administration Council which will
insure that certain of the more
urgent issues facing the university
are acted upon promptly, rather
than being tabled for indefinite
lengths of time.
According to Mattson, the
present sit-in shows that the
present student government is not
effective. "A group of concerned
students therefore had to step
outside the normal channels of
action, but we hope to make the
student government an effective
channel."
Spiegal
Of the team of Spiegel and
Cornell, Brad Cornell says he's
more philosophically-oriented,
'but John s our spokesman."
"Brad has been a tremendous
influence on my philosophical
beliefs," admitted presidential
candidate, John Spiegel, "and if
we're elected, we'll both make

every attempt to act on these
beliefs."
"We strongly believe in a
unification of thought and
action, both of them agreed.
' This is perhaps the theme of our
political campaign and of our
political views."
Spiegel hails from Berkeley but
appears to have become involved
in politics after several years at
Stanford.
' I spent my first two years
here trying to get good grades and
playing tennis," explained Spiegel.
' But the role I had always
envisioned for myself in society
somehow didn't quite fit.
"I soon found myself talking
to people about what I felt should
be changed in the University and
society. It looked as if the human
race was going to vanish from the
face of the earth in our life time.
'A few isolated students,"
Spiegel stated, "began to unite
and become involved in an
attempt to save America and the
human race.
"I'd like to see the entire
student government united
toward these ends."
"I'm discouraged," stated
Cornell, ' that students have not
been confronted with the current
pressing questions that face our
entire society. Nor have they been
confronted with the real failure of
student government to deal with
these issues.
"We have to impress upon the
students the urgency of making a
moral commitment to the
question 'Does man have the right
to kill others?" And by taking the
fruits of a murdering society," he
stressed, "we are all indirect
murderers."
Regarding a moral
commitment to the US, Spiegel
explained, ' Getting SRI to stop
taking contracts dealing with
counterinsurgency is a much more
important task than fighting the
Viet Cong.'
Shea
In the eighth grade Pat Shea's
history teacher suggested that Pat
should read some Marx. The next
year Shea went to the Soviet
Union and discovered that the
Russians were human beings

afterall. So when he graduated
from a high school in Salt Lake
City, Shea came to Stanford with
1 a different background than
most freshmen. '
Shea is presently running for
ASSU President as one member of
a four-man ticket that also
includes John Grube, Joyce
Kobayashi and Barry Askinas.
The group originally planned
to appear as a four-man ticket on
the election ballot, but because of
an election violation ruling, Shea
will be listed as Presidential
candidate on the ballot and John
Grube as Vice Presidential
candidate.
This year Shea is a sponsor in
Wilbur. He has been central in the
student evaluation of the Study ol
Education at Stanford (SES). He
was one of the prime movers
behind the Coalition, the student
group which initially asked for a
student voice in the consideration
of SES proposals.
More recently, Shea has given a
lot of his time to contacting
Trustees on an individual basis
about the Stanford Research
Institute issue. He has written
letters to individual Board
members and has "attempted to
make personal contact with
several members at every
opportunity." Personal contact is
a better method of appeal than
letter writing, Shea maintains.
"The Board should be
expanded by 10 members," Shea
observed. Four of these new
members should be faculty- two
of them from Stanford and two
from other institutions. Four
should be students- two of them
students or recent graduates of
Stanford and two from other
institutions. The final two
members should be selected on
the basis of race or occupation
not presently represented on the
Board.
Shea feels it is important to
emphasize why he is running on a
four-man ticket.
"The executive office of ASSU
has so many tasks that to expect
one individual to perform them all
is impossible. Mainly because of
the exhaustion of the last three
presidents, the students haven't
been adequately represented by
the person they elected," he said.
Today, Bob Cory will be at
Roth House for lunch and his
running mate, Eckhard Schulz will
be at Phi Sigma Kappa. For the
remainder of the weekend, they
will make appearances at Stern,
Wilbur, Florence Moore, Lagunita,
and the Fraternities.
Jim Schnieder and A1 Dulan
will be at Florence Moore for
lunch and will speak in the
Alondra lounge afterwards.
Tonight they will both be eating
dinner with their wives at
Lagunita and will speak following
dinner in the Adelfa lounge.
Saturday, Schnieder will be eating
lunch and speaking in Muir House
of Stern.
Tim Coburn and Jeff Kane will
meet with students during lunch
and dinner at Soto.
Andrew Gould and Mark Heller
plan to be at AEL all day and will
talk with any interested students
there.
The following is a series of
profiles in alphabetical order
about the candidates. Profiles of
the other four candidates
appeared yesterday.
(Editor's note: The candidates
are reminded that their position
statements of 250-500 words are
due by 2:00 this afternoon.
These statements will be
published in Monday's Daily.)
Coburn
Tim Coburn and Jeff Kane,
co-presidential candidates in the
ASSU elections, believe that
students today are in a "peculiarly
apt position to effect change."
Recognizing "the power of the
university on the national scene,"
they want to lead Stanford
students in the assumption of a
responsibility for this power.
They feel, for example, that
students have access to national
policy makers through the
eminent faculty of the university,
and that the student body, by
showing its will to the Faculty
Senate, can move them to put
pressure on these national policy
makers in Washington.
Students can effect a change in
the general orientation of
research, from the military to the
more pressing problems of
society: pollution, population
control, and the urban crises.
Coburn and Kane believe that
student power to effect change
extends equally to concerns
within the University. Coburn is a
graduate student with one year to
go in the genetics department of
the Stanford Medical School.
Kane, a senior in physiological
psychology, is a member of the
Student Conduct Legislative
Council, the Student Education
Council and the ASSU Professor
Commission.
Coburn and Kane feel that
