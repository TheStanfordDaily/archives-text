# Gimmick Rally Set
## 
### 
A gimmick car rally, 2001
Space Odyssey, will be launched
Saturday afternoon for all
members of the Stanford
community.
The course of El Tigre Club's
annual rally, according to
railymaster Mike Rahn, will be
easy enough for novice
participation while still being
sufficiently intricate to tax senior
rally ists.
There will be one class with
trophies awarded to the top three
finishers.
Registration of $2.50 per car
will begin at 12:30 Saturday in
the parking lot next to the Encina
tennis courts.
