# Tribe-Bruins Mix In LA
## 
### BROOK THOMAS 
The Tribe spikers fly south this
weekend in search of their first
conference victory at the new one
and a half million dollar UCLA
track stadium.
But like last week, the Indians
find themselves the underdogs to
a powerful UCLA squad even
though the Bruins met defeat at
OSU, 87-67.
Many of Coach Jim Bush's
standouts did not compete at
Corvallis because of illness or
injury, so the Bruins represent an
undetermined quality as Coach
Payton Jordan tries to dope out
the meet. But on paper, the Tribe
faces one of the toughest teams in
the Pacific-8.
Especially strong in the 440,
the UCLAns display three
sprinters under 48 seconds,
including smooth striding
sophomore Wayne Collett, who
has already turned in a 45.8 this
spring.
But it is hard to figure in which
event Collett will go since in

addition to the quarter, he is
equally adept in the sprints and
intermediate hurdles. With this
type of speed the Bruins become
favorites in both relays, giving
them a hard-to-overcome edge of
ten points.
With two 17 foot vaulters
Dick Railsback and .John Vaughn,
the men from Westwood are
expected to sweep that event.
Vaughn has however been
bothered by a shoulder injury.
Bush counts on another sweep
in the shot put, and he has a
convincing argument in two 60

footers . . . plus decatholon ace
Russ Hodge at 59-11.
In order to off set these
advantages, Jordan hopes to
counter with a few sweeps of his
own. Both the javelin with Tom
Colby, Lance Martin, and Jerry
Porter and the intermediate
hurdles with Randy White, Tom
Kommers, and Greg Ford
constitute possible white-washes.
Other key events for the
Indians are the 880 where
sophomores Pete Fairchild and
Duncan Mac Donald duel Dick
Bogard (1:51.4), and the high

jump where Peter Boyce and Tom
Massey meet head on with 6-10
leaper Cary Ross who was named
' field athlete of the week" in
Southern California. Ross, a
junior, had a prep best of only 6-0
at Beverly Hills High.
In order to pull out a team
upset, the Cards need a rash of
individual upsets along the way.
Here Jordan pins his hopes on
Massey in the triple jump, Fred
Storek or Charlie Francis in the
220, and Greg Brock or Chuck
Menz in the three mile. In
addition, Rick Tipton running the
sprint relay, high hurdles, and the
100, and Jim Kauffman entered in
the long jump, triple jump, 440,
and mile relay are counted on to
score heavily.

type of speed the Bruins become
favorites in both relays, giving
them a hard-to-overcome edge of
ten points.
With two 17 foot vaulters
Dick Railsback and .John Vaughn,
the men from Westwood are
expected to sweep that event.
Vaughn has however been
bothered by a shoulder injury.
Bush counts on another sweep
in the shot put, and he has a
convincing argument in two 60

footers . . . plus decatholon ace
Russ Hodge at 59-11.
In order to off set these
advantages, Jordan hopes to
counter with a few sweeps of his
own. Both the javelin with Tom
Colby, Lance Martin, and Jerry
Porter and the intermediate
hurdles with Randy White, Tom
Kommers, and Greg Ford
constitute possible white-washes.
Other key events for the
Indians are the 880 where
sophomores Pete Fairchild and
Duncan Mac Donald duel Dick
Bogard (1:51.4), and the high

jump where Peter Boyce and Tom
Massey meet head on with 6-10
leaper Cary Ross who was named
' field athlete of the week" in
Southern California. Ross, a
junior, had a prep best of only 6-0
at Beverly Hills High.
In order to pull out a team
upset, the Cards need a rash of
individual upsets along the way.
Here Jordan pins his hopes on
Massey in the triple jump, Fred
Storek or Charlie Francis in the
220, and Greg Brock or Chuck
Menz in the three mile. In
addition, Rick Tipton running the
sprint relay, high hurdles, and the
100, and Jim Kauffman entered in
the long jump, triple jump, 440,
and mile relay are counted on to
score heavily.
The Tribe spikers fly south this
weekend in search of their first
conference victory at the new one
and a half million dollar UCLA
track stadium.
But like last week, the Indians
find themselves the underdogs to
a powerful UCLA squad even
though the Bruins met defeat at
OSU, 87-67.
Many of Coach Jim Bush's
standouts did not compete at
Corvallis because of illness or
injury, so the Bruins represent an
undetermined quality as Coach
Payton Jordan tries to dope out
the meet. But on paper, the Tribe
faces one of the toughest teams in
the Pacific-8.
Especially strong in the 440,
the UCLAns display three
sprinters under 48 seconds,
including smooth striding
sophomore Wayne Collett, who
has already turned in a 45.8 this
spring.
But it is hard to figure in which
event Collett will go since in

addition to the quarter, he is
equally adept in the sprints and
intermediate hurdles. With this
type of speed the Bruins become
favorites in both relays, giving
them a hard-to-overcome edge of
ten points.
