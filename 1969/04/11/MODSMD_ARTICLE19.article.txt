The Pac-8 baseball season
begins for Stanford today as the
Tribe opens with a 2:30 game at
UCLA. Tomorrow the Indians
face USC, another tough
opponent, in a double header.
The Tribe takes a 13-6
won-lost record in pre-season
games into Los Angeles. The

season to date has been
highlighted by excellent pitching,
improved hitting, and much rain.
Co-captain Bob Boone, an all
Pac-8 third baseman last year, will
pitch the opener for the Indians;
his 0.69 earned run average over
39 innings leads the club to date.
Saturday's games will be pitched
by Rod Poteete (1.43 ERA in
50-1/3 innings plus 58 strike outs)
and Phil Keller (1/19 ERA in 22
innings). Boone, meanwhile, will
move back to third.
Left fielder Jack Hodges' .361
average led all Indian hitters
during pre-season play. Co-captain
Mark Marquess is in second place
with a .309 average, but Boone's
23 runs batted in lead the 11
collected by both Hodges and
Marquess. Boone also has
Stanford's only three home runs.
Other probable starters for the
Indians include catcher Bob Edie,
second baseman Dick Borchers,
third baseman Ron Shotts and
center fielder Mike Ewing. Keller
will start the UCLA game in right.
A muscle pull suffered in
Tuesday's game may keep
shortstop Russ Tweet out of the
line-up.
