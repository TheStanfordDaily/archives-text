# Police Battle Students At Harvard Sit-In
## 
### 
CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP)-More
than 400 policemen swept 200
protesters out of Harvard's revered
University Hall yesterday in a bloody
clash that left 30 persons hurt and
about 200 under arrest.
The helmeted officers, some swinging
clubs, stormed through a mass of
students to get inside the hall which had
been seized Wednesday by youths
protesting Harvard's Reserve Officer
Training Corps program.
Historic Harvard Yard was alive with
turmoil. Whistles, yells, jeers and curses
reverberated through the area as police,
in tight formations, swept back and
forth in skirmish platoons.
Bottles and other objects were hurled
at police, some from neighboring
buildings.
Many of those arrested were carried
bodily from the hall and thrust into
police wagons.
Police Withdrew
Most of the police withdrew within
an hour after the rush on the hall.
As the officers pulled back, more
than 1,000 young people surged

through the Yard to the steps of
Memorial Church, where they houted
'Seig Hail," "On strike, shut it down,"
and ' Pusey must go."
The last was a reference to Dr.
Nathan M. Pusey, Harvard's president.
The number of those inside
University Hall had dwindled to about
100 during the early morning hours, but
one student leader said the figure
swelled to between 150 and 200 with
word that police were arriving.
Colin Leinster, education editor for
Life magazine, was among those injured.
Police bodily removed the students
from the building and placed them in
police wagons. There was no estimate on
the number arrested but one student
leader said there were 150 to 200
students inside the building.
Leinster said he "was clubbed from
behind by State Police" as he stood
taking notes on the steps of the
building.
David Geddes, a Harvard freshman
who also was injured, described the
action: "I was standing on the top row
of steps when the police came in from
the side. They started piling in and came
over the edge of the steps with those big
baseball bat-sticks. One of them clubbed
me on the head and I fell down the
stairs getting clubbed all the time."
After state police filed into buses
yesterday and drove off the more than
1,000 students clustered on the steps of
Memorial Church, shouted "Seig Heil,"
"On strike, shut it down," and "Pusy
must go."

action: "I was standing on the top row
of steps when the police came in from
the side. They started piling in and came
over the edge of the steps with those big
baseball bat-sticks. One of them clubbed
me on the head and I fell down the
stairs getting clubbed all the time."

yesterday and drove off the more than

CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP)-More
than 400 policemen swept 200
protesters out of Harvard's revered
University Hall yesterday in a bloody
clash that left 30 persons hurt and
about 200 under arrest.
The helmeted officers, some swinging
clubs, stormed through a mass of
students to get inside the hall which had
been seized Wednesday by youths
protesting Harvard's Reserve Officer
Training Corps program.
Historic Harvard Yard was alive with
turmoil. Whistles, yells, jeers and curses
reverberated through the area as police,
in tight formations, swept back and
forth in skirmish platoons.
Bottles and other objects were hurled
at police, some from neighboring
buildings.
Many of those arrested were carried
bodily from the hall and thrust into
police wagons.
Police Withdrew
Most of the police withdrew within
an hour after the rush on the hall.
As the officers pulled back, more
than 1,000 young people surged

through the Yard to the steps of
Memorial Church, where they houted
'Seig Hail," "On strike, shut it down,"
and ' Pusey must go."
The last was a reference to Dr.
Nathan M. Pusey, Harvard's president.
The number of those inside
University Hall had dwindled to about
100 during the early morning hours, but
one student leader said the figure
swelled to between 150 and 200 with
word that police were arriving.
Colin Leinster, education editor for
Life magazine, was among those injured.
Police bodily removed the students
from the building and placed them in
police wagons. There was no estimate on
the number arrested but one student
leader said there were 150 to 200
students inside the building.
Leinster said he "was clubbed from
behind by State Police" as he stood
taking notes on the steps of the
building.
David Geddes, a Harvard freshman
who also was injured, described the
action: "I was standing on the top row
of steps when the police came in from
the side. They started piling in and came
over the edge of the steps with those big
baseball bat-sticks. One of them clubbed
me on the head and I fell down the
stairs getting clubbed all the time."
