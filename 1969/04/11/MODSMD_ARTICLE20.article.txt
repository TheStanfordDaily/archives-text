After two resounding victories
over non-league opponents, the
Stanford lacrosse team gets down
to the business of defending its
Northern California Lacrosse
Association title. Monarchs of the
league for the past two seasons,
most observers figure the Indians
to repeat.
The Indians will be tested
twice this weekend, Saturday
against the San Francisco Lacrosse
Club in Golden Gate park and
Sunday on their home field
against the Marin Country Club.
Both games will begin at 2:00
p.m.
Although Stanford has been
traditionally challenged for title
honors by the cross-town rival
Palo Alto Lacrosse Club,

alignments seem to have switched
this year and San Francisco
should be the greatest challenge.
The San Francisco club is the only
other team in the league besides
Stanford with a clean slate.
The Stanford team last year,
on their way to an undefeated
season and a regional ranking, was
saved by one of the nations best
defenses. This year, it appears that
the Indians have an explosive
attack, as scores of 15-1 and 18-1
over Utah and Oregon indicate.
