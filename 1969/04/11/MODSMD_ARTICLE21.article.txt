The Tribe tennis squad meets
their nld nemesis tomorrow at
1:00 p.m. They travel to Berkeley
to face the Bears in a battle for
third place in the conference.
For the past two years, the
teams have battled for the show
spot in the Pac-8 behind USC and
UCLA. Both times, Stanford won,
but this season may be different.
Bob Alloo leads Cal against the
inconsistent Indians while his
brother Chuck works for
Stanford.
