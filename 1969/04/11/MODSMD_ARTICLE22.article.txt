# Golfers Face Cal
## 
### 
Stanford's talented golf team
takes a big step toward their goal
of an NCAA championship today
when they take on the California
varsity at Mira Vista at 1 :00 p.m.
It will be the first outing for
Coach Bud Finger's clubbers since
they upset Arizona State for the
Fresno Classic crown two weeks
ago. The Sundevils were a top
choice for the collegiate title, and
the Stanford upset has brought
talk of a possible Indian
championship.
Tom Watson will lead the Tribe
against the potent Bears. The
defending Pac-8 champion Cards
should be favored over the East
Bay foes.
