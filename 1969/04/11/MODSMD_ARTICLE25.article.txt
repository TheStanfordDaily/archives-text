# Guitarist Performs
## 
### 
Doc Watson, considered by
many to be one of the finest folk
and country musicians alive
today, will appear this Friday
evening in Tresidder Union from 4
to 6 p.m.
Watson will be joined in part,
by two musicians from Berkeley,
Hank Bradley and Rick Shubb.
Last year The Daily ran a
review saying of Watson that
'the . . . concert seemed to throb

with excitement as Watson drew
repeated gasps from the audience
with seemingly impossible runs on
the guitar."
"Doc Watson rarely gives a
concert that is not received with
almost unreal enthusiasm by his
listeners. The Tresidder concert
was no exception."
Tickets for the concert are
$1.25 per person.
