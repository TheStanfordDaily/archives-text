# Five Resolutions Pass In Senate
## 
### MARK WEINBERGER 
The Senate of the Academic Council
yesterday urged the Board of Trustees
to attend open hearings to determine
the fate of Stanford Research Institute,
asked the trustees to report its
discussions on the SRI question by
mid-May, and voted to re-examine
policies controlling research on campus.
The Senate adopted the following
resolutions at its meeting yesterday
afternoon before student sit-inners
voted to remain at Applied Electronics
Laboratory:
"The Senate of the Academic
Council
"Endorses the statement made by
the President of the University to the
Board of Trustees April 8, and shares
the moral concerns expressed by that
statement and many members of the
University Community.
"Urgently requests that as many
members as possible of the Board of
Trustees attend open hearings to be held
on campus during the month of April to
consider the relationship of the
University and Stanford Research
Institute.
"Urgently requests that the Board
of Trustees report fully to the Stanford
community the results of its discussions
concerning the SRI-University
relationship by mid-May.
"Instructs the Steering Committee
to schedule a special meeting of the
Senate within two days of the issuance
of the report of the ad hoc committee

on relationships between the University
and SRI.
"Reaffirms its responsibilities for
policies controlling research on the
University campus and declares its
intention to re-examine these policies
this spring."
The Senate's votes came at the end
of a three and a half hour meeting. Six
members of the SRI Coalition and a
Daily reporter were present during part
of the deliberations.
Members of the Senate pressed
Coalition members to define their
objectives more precisely, including the
kinds of research they found
objectionable. While not enumerating
specific guidelines on research they
favored, the Coalition member John
Ehrenberg commented that they were
"united for the purpose of education.
We want to bring the issues to
everyone's concern."
Student Coalition members and
Student Body President Denis Hayes
asked the Senate to voice its moral
solidarity with the Coalition, stating
that it might lead to an early end to the
sit-in.
As Hayes put it,"The trustees'
response was inadequate. I hope yours is
not. I hope you will exhibit the good
faith that the trustees have not. I will go
to the Coalition tonight to argue for the
end of the sit-in if you will show that
moral concern."
The Senate response was evidently
not strong enough for the AEL

sit-inners, as it was termed a
"disappointment" last night. A
resolution introduced at the Senate that
termed the trustee response Tuesday
"inadequate" was not acted upon by
the Senators.
Talking with the Senate, President
Kenneth Pitzer affirmed his desire "to

basement and have been turning out literature continuously.
handle problems within the
community if at all possible." He
reminded the Senate, however,
that both faculty and students
have in the past indicated their
disapproval of disruptions.
In rejecting the need for the
use of outside forces to handle the
current situation, Pitzer
commented that "we should
depend on the Stanford Judicial
Council and expect that it will
meet its responsibilities."
Although he condemned what he
termed a "clear disruption,"
Pitzer pointed out his conscious
effort "not to overreact."

He added that the Coalition's
"point is made, and they should
vacate the building. They should
now use picketing or other
appropriate means."
During the period that students
were present, debate was often
spirited. Points of view differed
greatly among those present.
Sandy Peterson of the
Coalition said: "We are acting
with moral outrage" and warned
that it would be "disastrous" for
the Senate to take no response to
the student demands.
Moments earlier, Prof. Hubert
Heffner of Electrical Engineering
said he was "terribly tired of
childish intimidation" by AEL
occupiers. "The administration is
unwilling or unable to keep
order."

Sandy Peterson of the
Coalition said: "We are acting
with moral outrage" and warned
that it would be "disastrous" for
the Senate to take no response to
the student demands.
Moments earlier, Prof. Hubert
Heffner of Electrical Engineering
said he was "terribly tired of
childish intimidation" by AEL
occupiers. "The administration is
unwilling or unable to keep

The Senate of the Academic Council
yesterday urged the Board of Trustees
to attend open hearings to determine
the fate of Stanford Research Institute,
asked the trustees to report its
discussions on the SRI question by
mid-May, and voted to re-examine
policies controlling research on campus.
The Senate adopted the following
resolutions at its meeting yesterday
afternoon before student sit-inners
voted to remain at Applied Electronics
Laboratory:
"The Senate of the Academic
Council
"Endorses the statement made by
the President of the University to the
Board of Trustees April 8, and shares
the moral concerns expressed by that
statement and many members of the
University Community.
"Urgently requests that as many
members as possible of the Board of
Trustees attend open hearings to be held
on campus during the month of April to
consider the relationship of the
University and Stanford Research
Institute.
"Urgently requests that the Board
of Trustees report fully to the Stanford
community the results of its discussions
concerning the SRI-University
relationship by mid-May.
"Instructs the Steering Committee
to schedule a special meeting of the
Senate within two days of the issuance
of the report of the ad hoc committee

on relationships between the University
and SRI.
"Reaffirms its responsibilities for
policies controlling research on the
University campus and declares its
intention to re-examine these policies
this spring."
The Senate's votes came at the end
of a three and a half hour meeting. Six
members of the SRI Coalition and a
Daily reporter were present during part
of the deliberations.
Members of the Senate pressed
Coalition members to define their
objectives more precisely, including the
kinds of research they found
objectionable. While not enumerating
specific guidelines on research they
favored, the Coalition member John
Ehrenberg commented that they were
"united for the purpose of education.
We want to bring the issues to
everyone's concern."
Student Coalition members and
Student Body President Denis Hayes
asked the Senate to voice its moral
solidarity with the Coalition, stating
that it might lead to an early end to the
sit-in.
As Hayes put it,"The trustees'
response was inadequate. I hope yours is
not. I hope you will exhibit the good
faith that the trustees have not. I will go
to the Coalition tonight to argue for the
end of the sit-in if you will show that
moral concern."
The Senate response was evidently
not strong enough for the AEL

sit-inners, as it was termed a
"disappointment" last night. A
resolution introduced at the Senate that
termed the trustee response Tuesday
"inadequate" was not acted upon by
the Senators.
Talking with the Senate, President
Kenneth Pitzer affirmed his desire "to

basement and have been turning out literature continuously.
handle problems within the
community if at all possible." He
reminded the Senate, however,
that both faculty and students
have in the past indicated their
disapproval of disruptions.
In rejecting the need for the
use of outside forces to handle the
current situation, Pitzer
commented that "we should
depend on the Stanford Judicial
Council and expect that it will
meet its responsibilities."
Although he condemned what he
termed a "clear disruption,"
Pitzer pointed out his conscious
effort "not to overreact."

He added that the Coalition's
"point is made, and they should
vacate the building. They should
now use picketing or other
appropriate means."
During the period that students
were present, debate was often
spirited. Points of view differed
greatly among those present.
