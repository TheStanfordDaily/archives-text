# Up Against The Wall At Harvard
## 
### JIM SPICK ARD 
(Jim Spickard is a junior in li is lory and is
presently one of those occupying the Applied
Electronics Laboratory. His brother Paul it a
freshman in Social Relations a I Harvard, and
was one of those occupying University Hall in
the sit-in there. The following is based on a
telephone conversation between them late
Thursday afternoon.)
For the past several months at
Harvard there has been student agitation
for the abolition of credit for the ROTC
program, for an end to University
"redevelopment" programs in the
Roxbury ghettos, programs which move
out the black residents to make room
for University science centers, medical
buildings, and so on, and for an end to
"imperialistic policies in the third
world".
A few weeks ago, the governing
board of the faculty voted to meet the
first of these criticisms by abolishing
academic credit for ROTC. This
decision was met with much enthusiasm
by the SDS, Progressive Labor, and
other leftist elements on the campus
scene.

Yet at the beginning of this week the
"Corporation", the equivalent of our
Board of Trustees, voted to override the
faculty decision. SDS members met
Tuesday night to consider possible
action. They deferred any decision until
Wednesday noon, when a rally was held
to discuss whether a sit-in was the
appropriate response.
During this meeting, several members
of Progressive Labor, a more radical
group, took action themselves and
occupied University Hall. In the scuffle
that insued, a dean was struck, but was
given medical treatment and no more
violence resulted. Many of the other
SDS members and a loose coalition of
liberal elements decided to join the
sit-in.
Support Demonstration Staged
Other students, disagreeing with the
sit-in tactic, staged a supportive
demonstration outside the hall.
Although marred by occasional
anti-demonstration activity, this was on
the whole peaceful. The number of
students throughout the day and night
remained belween 200 .'lOO, while the

support demonstration dwindled from
an original 1000 to 300 in the dawn
hours.
Some contact was maintained with
members of the university
administration throughout the day,
although no real negotiation took place.
Order was maintained among the
demonstrators. They bedded down for
the night, both inside and outside the
hall, and guards were posted in shifts.
All went well until approximately 5:00
A.M.
At 5:00 state riot police moved into
the campus area. They were described as
being in full riot gear, badgeless to
protect the anonymity of the individual
officer. They despersed the support
demonstrators, not without violence,
and moved into the main building.
As it was cleared, several incidences
of beating were observed, and the
occupants were herded into busses and
police vans. The number of those
arrested was estimated to be 275, while
70 students were treated for injuries and
over 20 were hospitalized.
Amony those beaten was a Harvard

campus policeman, who was struck as
he bent to help an injured student.
Some 20 card-carrying members of the
Press Corps were among those arrested.
Campus In Turmoil
Thursday morning after the arrests,
the campus was in a turmoil. Some
1500-2000 moderate students, shocked
by the brutality and bloodshed
involved, met and passed a new series of
demands. These included the resignation
of Harvard President Pusey, an
immediate student faculty referendum
on the ROTC question, a restructuring
of the university to provide direct voice
for the students and faculty, and a
dropping of the criminal charges (not an
amnesty, as the penalties of the Campus
Judicial Council would still be in effect
This moderate coalition also called
for a three-day student strike, in effect
until Monday night, at which time a
decision as to future policy will be
made.
Needless to say, the campus is upset
over the aftermath of the decision of
the Directors of the Harvard
Corporal ion.
