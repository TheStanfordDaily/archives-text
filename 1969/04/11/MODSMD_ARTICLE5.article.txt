# Director Denies AEL Importance In Vietnam
## 
### THOMAS C. DAWSON 
William Rambo, director of the
occupied Applied Electronics
Laboratory (AEL), doesn't view the
work of AEL as contributing to the war
in Vietnam.
A fall in classified research at AEL of
some forty percent in the last four years
is evidence of the unimportance of AEL
in the Vietnam war, according to
Rambo.
"The military doesn't view our
programs as contributing to the war in
Vietnam. This is why we have been
getting less money," Rambo stated
yesterday in a press conference. He
expanded on some of these remarks in a
later interview with The Daily.
He says he views the occupation of
AEL as taking advantage of a "target of
opportunity, since it is easier to walk
here at eleven o'clock at night and be
able to go home for a shower or go to
class."
Military Use Possible
"The results of work sponsored by
the Department of Defense [at AEL)
could end up in military equipment,"
Rambo concedes, "and some people in
this community find this extremely
objectionable. I do not share the
intensity of their feeling."
Rambo described the Stanford
Electronic Laboratory (of which AEL is
a part) as "the research affiliate of the
electrical engineering department,
especially in doctoral research."
He denied that there was any close
relation between the work done at AEL

and applications in Vietnam saying, "We
are developing techniques and concepts,
yes, prototypes, no." The time span
between research at AEL and possible
war applications is "very long indeed,"
according to Rambo.
Sit-In "Orderly'"
Concerning the continuing sit-in,
Rambo said, "'So far, it has been an
orderly demonstration. It would
surprise me a great deal if there were
any arrests in view of the temperate
actions of the sit-inners."
"If the sit-in were to change mood
dramatically, that would be a whole
new ball game. If it were to go on, say, a
month, it would also be different,
Rambo observed, adding the
demonstration has been "remarkably
calm."
Answering a reporter's question,
Rambo said he felt the sit-in was
certainly a disruption, "I think that's
answered by the fact that there's
nothing going on (at AEL)." The sit-in
will not have an immediate impact on
the work of AEL, according to Rambo
who added, "If it goes on for, say, three
weeks it would have an enormous
impact on work," especially "the work
of our graduate students."
Asked what the position of his
employees and co-workers on the work
of AEL was, Rambo replied that he did
not think any of the AEL employees
supported the sit-in but he said that
some other professors in the electrical
engineering department probably did
support the sit-in.

relation between the work done at AEL

and applications in Vietnam saying, "We
are developing techniques and concepts,
yes, prototypes, no." The time span
between research at AEL and possible
war applications is "very long indeed,"
according to Rambo.
Sit-In "Orderly'"
Concerning the continuing sit-in,
Rambo said, "'So far, it has been an
orderly demonstration. It would
surprise me a great deal if there were
any arrests in view of the temperate
actions of the sit-inners."
"If the sit-in were to change mood
dramatically, that would be a whole
new ball game. If it were to go on, say, a
month, it would also be different,
Rambo observed, adding the
demonstration has been "remarkably
calm."
Answering a reporter's question,
Rambo said he felt the sit-in was
certainly a disruption, "I think that's
answered by the fact that there's
nothing going on (at AEL)." The sit-in
will not have an immediate impact on
the work of AEL, according to Rambo
who added, "If it goes on for, say, three
weeks it would have an enormous
impact on work," especially "the work
of our graduate students."
Asked what the position of his
employees and co-workers on the work
of AEL was, Rambo replied that he did
not think any of the AEL employees
supported the sit-in but he said that
some other professors in the electrical
engineering department probably did
support the sit-in.
William Rambo, director of the
occupied Applied Electronics
Laboratory (AEL), doesn't view the
work of AEL as contributing to the war
in Vietnam.
A fall in classified research at AEL of
some forty percent in the last four years
is evidence of the unimportance of AEL
in the Vietnam war, according to
Rambo.
"The military doesn't view our
programs as contributing to the war in
Vietnam. This is why we have been
getting less money," Rambo stated
yesterday in a press conference. He
expanded on some of these remarks in a
later interview with The Daily.
He says he views the occupation of
AEL as taking advantage of a "target of
opportunity, since it is easier to walk
here at eleven o'clock at night and be
able to go home for a shower or go to
class."
Military Use Possible
"The results of work sponsored by
the Department of Defense [at AEL)
could end up in military equipment,"
Rambo concedes, "and some people in
this community find this extremely
objectionable. I do not share the
intensity of their feeling."
Rambo described the Stanford
Electronic Laboratory (of which AEL is
a part) as "the research affiliate of the
electrical engineering department,
especially in doctoral research."
He denied that there was any close
relation between the work done at AEL

and applications in Vietnam saying, "We
are developing techniques and concepts,
yes, prototypes, no." The time span
between research at AEL and possible
war applications is "very long indeed,"
according to Rambo.
