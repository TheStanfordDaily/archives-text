# Researchers Support Severance Of SRI
## 
### CRAIG WILSON 
It appears that an informal survey of
some researchers taken at the Stanford
Research Institute indicates that a
significant number of them support the
severance of SRI from Stanford
University.
The survey was taken in the middle
of this week just prior to the
publication of the SRI report due early
next week.
When contacted last night SRI
administrators were extremely reluctant
to acknowledge anything at all about
the existence of such a survey. Rudolph
Brunsvold remarked that he felt it was
inappropriate to instruct until the
University study had been made known.
"We've made no survey," he stated
flatly.
The Daily learned of the study
yesterday after contacting numerous
research members of the Institute.
According to all of those contacted the
survey was performed on a "very
informal basis" with opinions being
acquired from small groups of
researchers.
Feeding Back
According to some, those handling
the survey in each department informed
researchers that this was a means of
feeding back information to Anderson
(Charles Anderson, President of SRI),
from lowor levels so Anderson can relate
statistics to Trustees.
In one instance a researcher
remembers being told that the results
were to be fed back to the President. He

went on further saying that he had been
told the result would be placed on the
agenda of a meeting scheduled today of
the SRI Board of Directors.
The Daily was able to learn from
Stanford Trustee and SRI Board
Director, Ernest Arbuckle, that a
meeting of the Executive Council of the
SRI Board is scheduled to meet today in
San Francisco.
Ties Severed
Last night nearly all researchers
interviewed vouched for the fact an
announcement had been made
yesterday afternoon that there would be
a board meeting of SRI on Friday to
request to Stanford University Trustees
that all longstanding ties between the
institutions be severed.
President Charles Anderson when
contacted commented that a survey was
anticipated but would not deny that a
survey had already taken place. When
asked point blank he refused comment.
He did say however that, he felt it
inappropriate to take such a survey
before researchers had an opportunity
to judge the alternatives in the SRI
report.
It appears, at least in the minds of
the researchers, that the alternatives
have already been judged.

remembers being told that the results
were to be fed back to the President. He

went on further saying that he had been
told the result would be placed on the
agenda of a meeting scheduled today of
the SRI Board of Directors.
The Daily was able to learn from
Stanford Trustee and SRI Board
Director, Ernest Arbuckle, that a
meeting of the Executive Council of the
SRI Board is scheduled to meet today in
San Francisco.
Ties Severed
Last night nearly all researchers
interviewed vouched for the fact an
announcement had been made
yesterday afternoon that there would be
a board meeting of SRI on Friday to
request to Stanford University Trustees
that all longstanding ties between the
institutions be severed.
President Charles Anderson when
contacted commented that a survey was
anticipated but would not deny that a
survey had already taken place. When
asked point blank he refused comment.
He did say however that, he felt it
inappropriate to take such a survey
before researchers had an opportunity
to judge the alternatives in the SRI
report.
It appears, at least in the minds of
the researchers, that the alternatives
have already been judged.
ritore will be a special four page tabloid
size DAILY tomorrow. It will be
distributed in the morning to the dorms,
tbe post officr, Tresidder Union and the
sit in.
