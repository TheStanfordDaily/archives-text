The sit-in at the Applied Electronics
Laboratories continues, and Stanford's
future is not what it used to be.
In the context existing at present, it
seems that the stand taken by the
Academic Senate yesterday and recent,
informal discussion within SRI pointing in
the direction of severance from the
University are matters which will weigh
heavily in events to come.
During the last few days, in informal
staff meetings, SRI researchers have been
polled on their attitude toward the
severance of ties with Stanford. The
oft-discussed possibility of cutting ties now
appears before us as a very real possibility.
Stanford Research Institute would be
something like an independent, non-profit
foundation.
But a move of this sort does not speak
to the issues which are before us at present.
As many speakers at the sit-in have
emphasized, the SRI report commissioned
by interim University President Robert
Glaser was charged with the task of
examining the relationship between the
University and SRI. In contrast, what those
at the sit-in are doing is stopping, through
direct action, research whose content they
disapprove of. Their moral concern is with
the substance of the research at SRI.
Polling the SRI researchers, who
apparently favor severance, may interest
directors and trustees who are anxious to
use in their deliberations what information
can be gleened from consultations. But
polling the researchers does not stop that
war research.
In the Academic Senate meeting
yesterday afternoon, faculty members took
the important step of setting time-limits for
the Trustees' deliberations on SRI. Tuesday
the Trustees did not accept the time-limits
suggested by student members of the
University Advisory Committee. The

possibility existed that the SRI question
might be stalled on until spring quarter
examinations or the summer was upon us.
The faculty named dates, a fact that can
only be disregarded by the Trustees at their
peril.
This faculty action puts needed pressure
on the Trustees at a time when it will be
effective. Uneasy lies the throne. The
Trustees have already indicated that even
they are questioning whether they are
perfect. They did this implicitly in setting
up the committee under John W. Gardner,
whose specialty is self-renewal. The
faculty's urgent requests were praise
worthy in so far as they were addressed to
making the Trustees take speedy action on
matters of great urgency.
The setting of time-limits, however, does
differ in important qualitative ways from
the lives being led by the students who are
sit ting-in. The Academic Senate has not
taken a risk; those students have. If the
faculty does stand behind the moral
concerns represented by the sit-in, then
they can truly do no less than take the risk.
During a sit-in speech last night, LASSU
speaker Yale Braunstein captured in part
our reaction to the faculty meeting. He
suggested that one can look at the faculty
as mere employees of the Trustees, but said
he did not choose to do so. Instead he
found that the faculty was deliberately
retreating into advisory capacity, that they
didn't want the power.
As a step in the proper direction, we
would recommend to every faculty
member a resolution which never did come
up formally for consideration at
yesterday's Senate meeting. The resolution
called on faculty to hold classes at the
Applied Electronics Laboratories. We urge
that the faculty and all other members of
the community be where the risks are being
taken and the research is being stopped.

matters of great urgency.
The setting of time-limits, however, does
differ in important qualitative ways from
the lives being led by the students who are
sit ting-in. The Academic Senate has not
taken a risk; those students have. If the
faculty does stand behind the moral
concerns represented by the sit-in, then
they can truly do no less than take the risk.
During a sit-in speech last night, LASSU
speaker Yale Braunstein captured in part
our reaction to the faculty meeting. He
suggested that one can look at the faculty
as mere employees of the Trustees, but said
he did not choose to do so. Instead he
found that the faculty was deliberately
retreating into advisory capacity, that they
didn't want the power.
As a step in the proper direction, we
would recommend to every faculty
member a resolution which never did come
up formally for consideration at
yesterday's Senate meeting. The resolution
called on faculty to hold classes at the
Applied Electronics Laboratories. We urge
that the faculty and all other members of
the community be where the risks are being
taken and the research is being stopped.
The sit-in at the Applied Electronics
Laboratories continues, and Stanford's
future is not what it used to be.
In the context existing at present, it
seems that the stand taken by the
Academic Senate yesterday and recent,
informal discussion within SRI pointing in
the direction of severance from the
University are matters which will weigh
heavily in events to come.
During the last few days, in informal
staff meetings, SRI researchers have been
polled on their attitude toward the
severance of ties with Stanford. The
oft-discussed possibility of cutting ties now
appears before us as a very real possibility.
Stanford Research Institute would be
something like an independent, non-profit
foundation.
But a move of this sort does not speak
to the issues which are before us at present.
As many speakers at the sit-in have
emphasized, the SRI report commissioned
by interim University President Robert
Glaser was charged with the task of
examining the relationship between the
University and SRI. In contrast, what those
at the sit-in are doing is stopping, through
direct action, research whose content they
disapprove of. Their moral concern is with
the substance of the research at SRI.
Polling the SRI researchers, who
apparently favor severance, may interest
directors and trustees who are anxious to
use in their deliberations what information
can be gleened from consultations. But
polling the researchers does not stop that
war research.
In the Academic Senate meeting
yesterday afternoon, faculty members took
the important step of setting time-limits for
the Trustees' deliberations on SRI. Tuesday
the Trustees did not accept the time-limits
suggested by student members of the
University Advisory Committee. The

possibility existed that the SRI question
might be stalled on until spring quarter
examinations or the summer was upon us.
The faculty named dates, a fact that can
only be disregarded by the Trustees at their
peril.
This faculty action puts needed pressure
on the Trustees at a time when it will be
effective. Uneasy lies the throne. The
Trustees have already indicated that even
they are questioning whether they are
perfect. They did this implicitly in setting
up the committee under John W. Gardner,
whose specialty is self-renewal. The
faculty's urgent requests were praise
worthy in so far as they were addressed to
making the Trustees take speedy action on
matters of great urgency.
