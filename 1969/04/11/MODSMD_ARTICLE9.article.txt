## Commitment By Fasting 
### Terry Fitzgerald 
Please grant me your patience,
for these aire words off the top of
a head that is starting to wander
for lack of sleep; but perhaps they
can convey part of what is in me
and part of what I want to give to
you.
Last night in an open meeting
of the April Third Movement a
large number of Stanford
Community members made a very
serious decision to sit-in at AEL
to protest and publicize the
war-related (i.e. death-producing)
research done at Stanford
University and SRI. But many
people are liable to look upon a
sit-in as something done for kocks
and a good way to spend
spring-quarter time.
In order to demonstrate our
true commitment to the goals of
the April Third Movement and to
protest and publicize in a new
way I am asking you to join me in
a fast. My fast personally is in
conjunction with the sit-in, and I
plan to fast from all solid foods
until progress has been made and
the sit-in ends (or until I give up).
But what I do need not bind your
actions in any way. You may
want to use a bread and liquid
fast, a partial fast (like bating only
one meal a day), fasting on
alternate days, or anything else.
But whatever we do, we must
do it together. The power of such
action is in the numbers of those
who choose so to express their
commitment. Without large
numbers and the resulting
publicity such action is practically
useless. And that means YOU,
dammit!

I'm doing this in conjunction
with the sit-in, but there is no
reason that you must feel this is in
support of the sit-in itself. In fact,
this could be considered to be in
protest to the use of sit-ins. But to
those who cry about tactics (and
perhaps justifiably so) every time
someone acts at this University,
and to those who are now
lamenting the use of a sit-in to
express a point, to these people
who complain about strategy, yet
profess to be "concerned"
persons: I challenge you to find
one arguement—moral, political,
ideological, you name it—to
contend that this fast is wrong.
Where are you at? Where is
your commitment? Where is your
'concern?" I'll tell you where a
lot of your brothers on the other
side of the world are at—they are
in ditches dying of God knows
what disease while their
U .S.-supported government
spends millions on producing
death.

They are in some village or
jungle burning from the hell-fire
we've rained down on them. They
are in some part of Viet-Nam or
Laos or who-knows-where torn by
the bombs Stanford has helped
deliver.
And where are a lot of your
brothers in Palo Alto? They're in
labs working on particle
(readrpoison) dissemination by
explosives and the enzyme work
of certain bacteria (read.plague,
anthrax, and all kinds of ways to
kill and immobilize). And where
are you at?
A lot of you are standing
around being "concerned" and
complaining about tactics. Now,
dammit, give me one reason why a
fast is a wrong thing.
Just where is your
commitment, brother?
Where is your "concern?"

psychology-Ed.)

who choose so to express their
commitment. Without large
numbers and the resulting
publicity such action is practically
useless. And that means YOU,
dammit!

I'm doing this in conjunction
with the sit-in, but there is no
reason that you must feel this is in
support of the sit-in itself. In fact,
this could be considered to be in
protest to the use of sit-ins. But to
those who cry about tactics (and
perhaps justifiably so) every time
someone acts at this University,
and to those who are now
lamenting the use of a sit-in to
express a point, to these people
who complain about strategy, yet
profess to be "concerned"
persons: I challenge you to find
one arguement—moral, political,
ideological, you name it—to
contend that this fast is wrong.
Where are you at? Where is
your commitment? Where is your
'concern?" I'll tell you where a
lot of your brothers on the other
side of the world are at—they are
in ditches dying of God knows
what disease while their
U .S.-supported government
spends millions on producing
death.

They are in some village or
jungle burning from the hell-fire
we've rained down on them. They
are in some part of Viet-Nam or
Laos or who-knows-where torn by
the bombs Stanford has helped
deliver.
And where are a lot of your
brothers in Palo Alto? They're in
labs working on particle
(readrpoison) dissemination by
explosives and the enzyme work
of certain bacteria (read.plague,
anthrax, and all kinds of ways to
kill and immobilize). And where
are you at?
A lot of you are standing
around being "concerned" and
complaining about tactics. Now,
dammit, give me one reason why a
fast is a wrong thing.
Just where is your
commitment, brother?
Where is your "concern?"
(Terry Fitzgerald is a sophomore in
psychology-Ed.)
Please grant me your patience,
for these aire words off the top of
a head that is starting to wander
for lack of sleep; but perhaps they
can convey part of what is in me
and part of what I want to give to
you.
Last night in an open meeting
of the April Third Movement a
large number of Stanford
Community members made a very
serious decision to sit-in at AEL
to protest and publicize the
war-related (i.e. death-producing)
research done at Stanford
University and SRI. But many
people are liable to look upon a
sit-in as something done for kocks
and a good way to spend
spring-quarter time.
In order to demonstrate our
true commitment to the goals of
the April Third Movement and to
protest and publicize in a new
way I am asking you to join me in
a fast. My fast personally is in
conjunction with the sit-in, and I
plan to fast from all solid foods
until progress has been made and
the sit-in ends (or until I give up).
But what I do need not bind your
actions in any way. You may
want to use a bread and liquid
fast, a partial fast (like bating only
one meal a day), fasting on
alternate days, or anything else.
But whatever we do, we must
do it together. The power of such
action is in the numbers of those
who choose so to express their
commitment. Without large
numbers and the resulting
publicity such action is practically
useless. And that means YOU,
dammit!
