# Sit-In Continues As Trustee And Faculty Respond To Demands: Names To Be Taken
## 
### MARSHALL E. SCHWARTZ 
Members of the faculty and staff will
begin taking names of those occupying
the Applied Electronics Laboratory
today, Provost Richard W. Lyman
announced last night, as the AEL sit-in
entered its fifth day, but students voted
to defy the investigators.
More than 120 people remained in
the Lab overnight.
Meanwhile, Board of Trustees
President W. Parmer Fuller 111 reiterated
the Board's position of April 8, saying
an open campus hearing on SRI will be
held after publication of the
student-faculty report on SRI
tomorrow.
Fuller said he would try to set a date
for the meeting today.
Lyman's announcement was read at a
mass meeting of nearly 500 Coalition
supporters in the AEL courtyard last
night, and was greeted with laughter and
derision.
No Names
The group voted not to give their
names to the investigators, but merely
to say, "I am a member of the April 3
Coalition. My address is the Applied
Electronics Laboratory."
The Coalition began circulating a
statement of complicity with the sit-in
last night, and in several hours garnered
over 600 signatures.
The decision to take names of
demonstrators comes after the
announcement to them Friday by
Kenneth S. Pitzer that the continuation
of the sit-in "obligates me to initiate
proceedings against your actions
through the Stanford Judicial Council."
Lyman said 24 faculty and
administration members had already
consented to aid in taking names (see
statement on page three).
Members Not Set
Fuller also announced he planned to
announce Trustee members of the
hearing committee "within the next two
days." He noted the hearing would be
formal, "following normal judicial and
legislative procedures." Radio Broadcast
or closed-circuit television of the
hearing is still planned.
He again said time was needed to
study the report, thus making
immediate hearings impossible.
When contacted by the Daily last
night. Fuller said the Board would again
consider the possibility of an open
decision-making session of the Board on
the SRI questions, as demanded by the
Coalition, but he admitted chances for
such a meeting were "slim." (See
statement on page three.)
Several Meetings
While response to Coalition demands
by the Board was minimal, faculty
groups planned several meetings for
today and tomorrow.
In response to criticism of on-campus

classified research, the Academic
Council Committee on Research Policy
will hold an open hearing at 3:30 p.m.
in room 66 of the School of Business
(see story below).
A detailed summary of present
University research policy appears on
page four of today's Daily.
The Committee will also meet in
closed session tomorrow afternoon. This
meeting will proceed a special meeting
of the Academic Senate, also devoted to
the topic of classified research. This
meeting was called after a large number
of Senate members petitioned for one.
Senate To Meet
The Senate will also meet a week
from tomorrow to consider the SRI
Committee report. That meeting was
scheduled by the Senate Steering
Committee in accord with a Senate
resolution Thursday.
Reportedly, the reason for the
request for a special Senate meeting
tomorrow is that the name and
description of at least one report in the
list of classified projects being
researched at Stanford, as published by
the Research Policy Committee in
October, was altered to make it less
objectionable to the community.
This project, as described by SDS
member Dave Pugh at last night's mass
meeting, was originally titled "Applied
Research in Electronic Warfare
Techniques." Its name was changed to
"Applied Research Electromagnetics."
One of the professors working on the
project, Allen Waterman, is part of
AEL's Systems Techniques Laboratory
and a member of the Research Policy
Committee.
At present, Stanford police are still
the only law enforcement officers at
AEL, according to the Stanford police
themselves.
The police now in the building are in
plain clothes and unarmed. The
sitters-in originally voted Friday to
request the officers, who had been in
the building almost from the start of its
occupation, be removed.
Police Chief Thomas Bell assented,
but Dan DeYoung, assistant to the
Business Manager, ordered the officers
back into the building. DeYoung said
that because of the presence of
classified documents in the building,
either Stanford police would have to be
stationed there or federal marshals
would move in.

The police are in plain clothes at
their own choice. One officer on duty
early Sunday morning said he felt
"vulnerable" if he were unarmed while
in uniform.
Schiff Highlight
Last night's meeting was highlighted
by a question and answer session with
Academic Senate Chairman Leonard
Schiff, who had presented a statement
from the Senate Steering Committee to
the group earlier in the day.
In the statement, Schiff and his
colleagues declared, "We are assured
that no work characterized as
chemical-warfare, biological-warfare, or
radiological-warfare research is being
done on this campus, and we pledge our
efforts that such work will never be
undertaken.
"Much progress had been made,
especially during the past two years, to
reduce the classified and war-related
research on campus.
"The Senate on April 10 reaffirmed
its responsibilities for policies
controlling research on the campus and
declared its intent to re-examine these
policies this spring."
SKI Questions Out
The Committee noted that the
questions on SRI were out of its
jurisdiction, but added, "We believe that
moral concern over national priorities
pervades the membership of every
Stanford constituency . . .We believe we
share with you the deep conviction that
this community's efforts should be

FACULTY TLA-Many members of the faculty and the surrounding communities were present for yesterday afternoon's
tea and discussion of the issues surrounding the sit-in at the Applied Electronics Lab. Pictured above are Leonard Schiff,
Chairman of the Academic Senate (right), and Matthew Sands, Associate Director of the Stanford Linear Accelerator
directed entirely toward the causes of
peace and human welfare."
Last night, Schiff declared, "People
do have concerns even if they don't lay
their bodies on the line." He reiterated
his belief that the sit-in makes
"substantive decision-making only
marginally possible," but noted that a
number of senators felt such an effort
was necessary.
Letters of support for the group have
been received from many organizations.
A small meeting of the American
Federation of Teachers local voted last
night to "express its unqualified support
for and participation in both the
demands and the tactics of the April 3
Coalition. We call upon the University
community to end all war-related
research at Stanford."
The sit-in has had repercussion on
research in a neighboring building. The
High Energy Physics Lab's linear
accelerator was shut down Thursday

night tor the duration of the AEL
occupation.
Concern over the accelerator's
emission of large doses of radiation has
caused laboratory directors to close
their operation.
Yesterday, well over 100 faculty
members, along with many community
members, attended a "faculty tea" at
AEL at 3 p.m. More than 500 people
were there. Also present were Palo Alto
Mayor Robert Arnold, and Joseph D.
Cooney, one of nine people indicted last
March in connection with a series of
terrorist-style bombings directed against
liberal and left-wing institutions and
merchants.
Cooney was recognized upon his
arrival by several students, and was
followed during the hour he-was in
AEL. Stanford police were notified, and
confirmed Cooney's presence at the
sit-in.
