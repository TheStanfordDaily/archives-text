# The 						Faculty
## 
### 
As the occupation of the Applied
Electronics Laboratory moves into its sixth
day, it is relevant of ask of Stanford's
faculty: "Where are they now?"
If yesterday's statement by the Steering
Committee of the Academic Council to the
April Third Movement is any indication,
the answer is: "Nowhere."
The Committee says. "We believe we
share with you [ the April Third
Movement] the deep conviction that this
community's efforts should be directed
entirely toward the causes of peace and
human welfare."
But if their position was accurately
represented by Leonard Schiff, the faculty
is most anxious to minimize both the
extent of war-related research on campus
and their ability to influence the work
done of Stanford Research Institute.
"SRI activities are not controlled by the
Academic Council or its Senate," says the
Steering Committee. "We are assured that
no work characterized as chemical-warfare,
biological-warfare, or radiological-wartare
research is being done on this campus, and
we pledge our efforts that such work will
never be undertaken," they add.
Even though they portray the problems
as small or distant, the faculty seems to feel
that it would be easier to discuss them if
the occupation of AEL were ended. They
"fear that, should the sit-in continue, our
special Senate meeting about SRI relations
will bog down on procedural matters."
Yesterday's faculty statement is
misleading in several respects.
By virtue of their prestige and their
indespensibility to the University, the
faculty docs have the power to shape the
future course of SRI. The question is
whether they will chose to employ this
power.
In view of the practice of renaming
research projects and providing ambiguous
or misleading descriptions of them, it
ap-pears that there is much more
war-related research in progress on campus
that members of the faculty, and even the
present occupants of AEL, have previously
imagined.
Despite such inaccuracies, the statement
is valuable. It portrays accurately the

present position of the faeulty, or at least
the sentiments of a significant portion of
that body.
Clearly the Steering Committee's
message was not influenced by the urgency
that is so evident among those who are
working and sleeping at AEL.
"Much progress has been made,
especially during the past two years, to
reduce the classified and war-related
research on campus," they say. But in no
statement or action has the faculty shown
concern for the people who may die during
the next two years, while more "progress"
is being made.
The faculty claims to share the moral
concerns of the April Third community.
But they emphasize that, while the
disruption continues, they will be forced to
focus on "procedural rather than
substantive issues."
What kind of moral concern would lead
these men to quibble about an orderly,
peaceful sit-in while reprehensible research
continues?
The fact is that the faculty's first
priority is re-establishing normal University
routine. The issues at hand must be
somewhere lower on their list.
Equally obvious is the fact that most
members of this prestigious group have
consistently refused to make the kind of
commitment that might threaten their
comfortable academic customs or even
their jobs.
They have politely asked the Trustees to
discuss SRI-University relations. They have
decided to re-examine their research
policies. But, as a body, they have never
taken a stand.
They have not said that it is insane to
develop deadly gases and bacteria
anywhere, much less here. They have not
said that it is wrong to repress the political
development of the Third World with the
techniques of "counterinsurgency." They
have not said the former Trustee David
Packard is wasting money and risking
nuclear destruction by advocating the
production and deployment of antiballistic
missiles.
These are the people who teach us.

Despite such inaccuracies, the statement
is valuable. It portrays accurately the

present position of the faeulty, or at least
the sentiments of a significant portion of
that body.
Clearly the Steering Committee's
message was not influenced by the urgency
that is so evident among those who are
working and sleeping at AEL.
"Much progress has been made,
especially during the past two years, to
reduce the classified and war-related
research on campus," they say. But in no
statement or action has the faculty shown
concern for the people who may die during
the next two years, while more "progress"
is being made.
The faculty claims to share the moral
concerns of the April Third community.
But they emphasize that, while the
disruption continues, they will be forced to
focus on "procedural rather than
substantive issues."
What kind of moral concern would lead
these men to quibble about an orderly,
peaceful sit-in while reprehensible research
continues?
The fact is that the faculty's first
priority is re-establishing normal University
routine. The issues at hand must be
somewhere lower on their list.
Equally obvious is the fact that most
members of this prestigious group have
consistently refused to make the kind of
commitment that might threaten their
comfortable academic customs or even
their jobs.
They have politely asked the Trustees to
discuss SRI-University relations. They have
decided to re-examine their research
policies. But, as a body, they have never
taken a stand.
They have not said that it is insane to
develop deadly gases and bacteria
anywhere, much less here. They have not
said that it is wrong to repress the political
development of the Third World with the
techniques of "counterinsurgency." They
have not said the former Trustee David
Packard is wasting money and risking
nuclear destruction by advocating the
production and deployment of antiballistic
missiles.
These are the people who teach us.
Where do they stand?
As the occupation of the Applied
Electronics Laboratory moves into its sixth
day, it is relevant of ask of Stanford's
faculty: "Where are they now?"
If yesterday's statement by the Steering
Committee of the Academic Council to the
April Third Movement is any indication,
the answer is: "Nowhere."
The Committee says. "We believe we
share with you [ the April Third
Movement] the deep conviction that this
community's efforts should be directed
entirely toward the causes of peace and
human welfare."
But if their position was accurately
represented by Leonard Schiff, the faculty
is most anxious to minimize both the
extent of war-related research on campus
and their ability to influence the work
done of Stanford Research Institute.
"SRI activities are not controlled by the
Academic Council or its Senate," says the
Steering Committee. "We are assured that
no work characterized as chemical-warfare,
biological-warfare, or radiological-wartare
research is being done on this campus, and
we pledge our efforts that such work will
never be undertaken," they add.
Even though they portray the problems
as small or distant, the faculty seems to feel
that it would be easier to discuss them if
the occupation of AEL were ended. They
"fear that, should the sit-in continue, our
special Senate meeting about SRI relations
will bog down on procedural matters."
Yesterday's faculty statement is
misleading in several respects.
By virtue of their prestige and their
indespensibility to the University, the
faculty docs have the power to shape the
future course of SRI. The question is
whether they will chose to employ this
power.
In view of the practice of renaming
research projects and providing ambiguous
or misleading descriptions of them, it
ap-pears that there is much more
war-related research in progress on campus
that members of the faculty, and even the
present occupants of AEL, have previously
imagined.
