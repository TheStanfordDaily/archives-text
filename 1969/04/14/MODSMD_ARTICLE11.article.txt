## Historical Challenge To Review Boards 
### Bill Evers 
There has been a lot of talk
about review boards emanating
from the occupied Applied
Electronics Laboratory lately. The
idea of review boards has a certain
appeal to me.
A civilian review board over
the police looks like a step in the
right direction. It is a check on
the murderous Leviathan. But
further thoughts on review boards
and regulatory bodies crowd my
mind at this time when a board to
review research at Stanford is
being considered.
The politics of review boards
strikes me as being the politics of
Hayakawa at. San Francisco State
or of the Soviets normalizing
Czechoslovakia. The politics of
direct action or of participatory
democracy seem to me to be
different from the politics of
review boards. Hayakawa feels
very uncomfortable in the face of
direct action or participatory
democracy, but he would be right
at home with the politics of
review boards.

To be trapped in the politics of
review boards is to be caught in
the bag of manipulative
democracy. On the other hand,
when a man stands up and says
with his life "Freedom now" or
"Get out of Viet Nam now," he is
taking a moral stance which cuts
up root and branch "realistic"
considerations and "practical"
objections.
If a reformist says to a radical,
"So you want to get out of
Viet-Nam, well, where's your plan
for withdrawing," don't as a
radical commit yourself to a plan
to which the reformist will raise
all sorts of practical objections. If
you do, you've been co-opted.
These reformists are what C.
Wright Mills called "crackpot
realists," and realism in this case
means subservience to the
power-holders. An
extra-parliamentary opposition
changes qualitatively when it
becomes intrgrated with what
Paul Goodman has termed "the
empty system of power."

If radicalism means anything, it
means going to the roots. Review
boards do not do this. They are
another hierarchical structure
superimposed on a hierarchical
system. You can call it
"community control" if you want
to. But I don't think that civilian
review boards over police have
brought justice.
Similarly the history of other
review and regulatory boards has
been disappointing. Pendleton
Herring noticed in the 1930's how
much alike the regulators and the
regulated had become in the
American political economy.
There is evidence that in order to
function in their symbiotic
relationship, regulator and
regulated must co-operate as a
kind of joint venture.
What is important in the receni
writing of new leftist Gabriel
Kolko is his discovery that giant
corporations seeking monopoly
profits recognized the advantages
of regulation and eagerly sought
it. Kolko's investigations have

placed the history of the
Progressive era in a whole new
light.
Complex
It seems to me that the
problems of Stanford University
can be understood in he light of
what Senator Fulbright calls the
"military-industrial-university
complex," and along with San
Jose State economist James
O'Connor I would call t any
university which receives 50% of
its funds or more from the federal
government a ''federal
university." I don't think a review
board will solve our problems.
My hope is that should this
new review board not work,
people will join again in direct
action

revolution ends! (A slogan of the

THE DAILY editorial

There has been a lot of talk
about review boards emanating
from the occupied Applied
Electronics Laboratory lately. The
idea of review boards has a certain
appeal to me.
A civilian review board over
the police looks like a step in the
right direction. It is a check on
the murderous Leviathan. But
further thoughts on review boards
and regulatory bodies crowd my
mind at this time when a board to
review research at Stanford is
being considered.
The politics of review boards
strikes me as being the politics of
Hayakawa at. San Francisco State
or of the Soviets normalizing
Czechoslovakia. The politics of
direct action or of participatory
democracy seem to me to be
different from the politics of
review boards. Hayakawa feels
very uncomfortable in the face of
direct action or participatory
democracy, but he would be right
at home with the politics of
review boards.

To be trapped in the politics of
review boards is to be caught in
the bag of manipulative
democracy. On the other hand,
when a man stands up and says
with his life "Freedom now" or
"Get out of Viet Nam now," he is
taking a moral stance which cuts
up root and branch "realistic"
considerations and "practical"
objections.
If a reformist says to a radical,
"So you want to get out of
Viet-Nam, well, where's your plan
for withdrawing," don't as a
radical commit yourself to a plan
to which the reformist will raise
all sorts of practical objections. If
you do, you've been co-opted.
These reformists are what C.
Wright Mills called "crackpot
realists," and realism in this case
means subservience to the
power-holders. An
extra-parliamentary opposition
changes qualitatively when it
becomes intrgrated with what
Paul Goodman has termed "the
empty system of power."

If radicalism means anything, it
means going to the roots. Review
boards do not do this. They are
another hierarchical structure
superimposed on a hierarchical
system. You can call it
"community control" if you want
to. But I don't think that civilian
review boards over police have
brought justice.
Similarly the history of other
review and regulatory boards has
been disappointing. Pendleton
Herring noticed in the 1930's how
much alike the regulators and the
regulated had become in the
American political economy.
There is evidence that in order to
function in their symbiotic
relationship, regulator and
regulated must co-operate as a
kind of joint venture.
What is important in the receni
writing of new leftist Gabriel
Kolko is his discovery that giant
corporations seeking monopoly
profits recognized the advantages
of regulation and eagerly sought
it. Kolko's investigations have

placed the history of the
Progressive era in a whole new
light.
Complex
It seems to me that the
problems of Stanford University
can be understood in he light of
what Senator Fulbright calls the
"military-industrial-university
complex," and along with San
Jose State economist James
O'Connor I would call t any
university which receives 50% of
its funds or more from the federal
government a ''federal
university." I don't think a review
board will solve our problems.
My hope is that should this
new review board not work,
people will join again in direct
action
Whei-p authority begins, the
revolution ends! (A slogan of the
Kronstadt rebellion)
