## Alternative To AEL: Move 
### DENIS HAYES Denis Hayes 
There have been several
hundred sit-ins across the country
in the past year, but the April 3
Coalition's decision last
Wednesday to move into the AEL
was in many ways unique.
The Stanford sit-in did not
grow out of a small, manipulated
radical rally with "stacked"
speakers: it grew out of a
well-publicized meeting at which
respectful attention was paid to a
spectrum of speakers ranging from
Kenneth Pitzer to Steve
Weissman. The audience was a
cross-section of the Stanford
student body and faculty, and it
made its decision after a long
analysis of the background facts
and of the probable implications
of its actions.
The Wednesday night group
did not set a terminal date for the
sit-in, but it was commonly
understood that it would be
conducted for a finite period with
the following two objectives:
1. To demonstrate to the
Stanford community that the
community had the power to stop
immoral research.
2. To dramatically focus the
attention of the Stanford
community upon the nature of
some research performed at SRI
and on the Stanford campus, and
as a result to win adherants to the
movement to end research in the
following areas:
a. Chemical warfare and
biological warfare.
b. Counterinsurgency.
c. Research geared to
prolonging the American
military involvement in
Southeast Asia.
d. Classified research on the
university campus.
Unique
The sit-in was unique, then,
because it had no demands: it had
only self-realizable objectives. It
would stop the AEL research by
the very fact of its presence in
AEL, and it would focus the
attention of the Stanford
community upon a moral issue
and seek to win adherants. The
sit-in was to be terminated and
replaced by a different tactic if it
did not successfully work toward
these two ends.
It was further unique because
it bound itself strictly to a high

set of principles, designed to avoid
alienating potential supporters
and to keep attention focused
upon the central issue—immoral
research. The sitters-in voted
unanimously to inflict no harm
upon any person, to damage no
property, no enter no classified
materials, and to grant free access
to anyone who wanted to come
into the area of the
demonstration.
We sought not to polarize the
Stanford community, but rather
to mobilize the community
around a cluster of widely-shared
values, and thus to remove de
facto power for a particular moral
decision from a board of trustees
whose values tend not to overlap
very much with our own.
Since Wednesday night there
have been a number of subtle
changes in the demonstration. It
now seems to be slowly evolving
toward the traditional American
college pattern—a pattern which
has proven time and time again to
be singularly unsuccessful.
The demonstration has now
been focused upon a demand.
This is perhaps the most
significant change, for it
somewhat reduces our earlier
flexibility. Before we had the
option of de-escalating whenever
we saw that as tactically wise. But
a Friday morning meeting
established a demand for a trustee
meeting today as a condition for
de-escalation.
There seems to be change in
the character of the people in the
demonstration. There are still
many beautiful things happening;
most people are happy, and
wanting to talk, and pleased to be
touching one another and getting
a feeling for one another. But too
many are getting up-tight.
Most of the high school kids
are so up-tight that they can
communicate only at 10,000
decibels. A couple of the Third
World people are really up-tight.
Many radicals get up-tight when
their most cherished symbols fail
to move less politically-motivated
students. And many moderate,
morally-concerned students have
become very up-tight (and a good
number have left the
demonstration) because of what
they consider to be manipulation
in the decision-making process.

There is a very fine line to be
tread, and if the movement
becomes either too moderate or
too radical a number of fissure
lines are likely to crack. Any such
splinter groups can only weaken
the overall movement.
Another important factor to be
considered in plotting the future
of the Coalition is the existence of
a huge pool of students, faculty,
and administrators who have not
yet developed an allegiance to our
goals. We need them, and we are
not presently winning them. Any
further escalation will further
alienate them.
A M istake
The demand and the Monday
deadline was a mistake. One or
two of the more enlightened
trustees may drop by the campus,
but the Board is not about to have
an open decision-making meeting
today. There was never any
chance whatsoever that they
would have such a meeting. The
people who formulated that
demand either didn't understand
trustees, or else they had some
reason for wanting to frustrate the
sit-in by positing an unattainable
demand. The demand was an
error, and we must now decide
whether we will recognize that
error, or compound it.
There is a long-standing
American tradition: "When in
doubt, send in the Marines."
When a situation doesn't resolve
itself in the expected
manner —apply more pressure.
When a tactic doesn't
succeed—escalate.
When the typical American
motorist finds himself in the
snow, he floors his accelerator.
When the Pentagon found itself
stuck in Vietnam, it escalated.
Another Building
So what should we do? Many
demonstrators are suggesting that
we should set another deadline
and take over another building. If
this new deadline is not met, we
should set another deadline and
take over still another building.
I submit that this approach will
have the same effect upon our
trustees as bombing Hanoi had
upon Ho: they will simply
entrench.
More important, I submit that
this approach will do the same
thing to the Stanford communitv

that the Pentagon' 6 escalation did
to America: we will polarize the
factions and transform potential
supporters into vigorous
opponents.
Furthermore, if the
demonstration moves into new
buildings, we will lose some of the
present demonstrators and
exacerbate the splintering of the
remainder. The new buildings will
come to take on splinter group
identifications: the radical
building, the moderate building,
the Third World building, etc., the
central issues will be submerged,
at least one building will abandon
the operating principles, and the
unified movement will be
finished.
The best things we've done
lately have been the faculty tea
and the SRI "lawn-in." These
were in no way related to an
occupied building.
AEL has outlived its utility to
us and its continued occupation
will only work against our ends. I
propose that we leave at 9 a.m.
Tuesday and establish the Old
Union Courtyard as our new base
of concern.
We would be able to set up
tables in the courtyard and on
White Plaza to distribute
information to all the passers-by
whom we are presently not
affecting.
Meetings, Food
We would be in the heart of
campus and in an area filled with
small rooms and with grassy spots
for meetings.
We would be next door to
Tresidder Union, a good source of
food and of potential supporters
who live off campus.
We would be able to move into
the Union and the Clubhouse at
night to sleep, and to move out
again during the day to allow
these places to perform their usual
services.
Finally, we would constitute a
visible and news-worthy presence
but would not be explicitly
violating the campus disruption
regulations. This fact should gain
us many moderate supporters and
a great many faculty supporters
who are presently disturbed by
the illegality of the sit-in. This is
very . important. A small
movement which sees its numbers
diminishing will tend to become
violent, and few tears will be shed
when it is crushed. A large
movement can win. It is
absolutely crucial that the
Coalition grow.
Our only real force is a moral
force. It is imperative that we
accentuate that fact. I would hope
that we would have some evening
candlelight vigils with religious,
political, and academic spokesmen
coming to speak in support of our
stand.
I would hope that we could
limit the political diatribes and
the personal antagonisms and let
nothing cloud the moral issues
we're raising for our university
and our nation.

exacerbate the splintering of the
remainder. The new buildings will
come to take on splinter group
identifications: the radical
building, the moderate building,
the Third World building, etc., the
central issues will be submerged,
at least one building will abandon
the operating principles, and the
unified movement will be
finished.
The best things we've done
lately have been the faculty tea
and the SRI "lawn-in." These
were in no way related to an
occupied building.
AEL has outlived its utility to
us and its continued occupation
will only work against our ends. I
propose that we leave at 9 a.m.
Tuesday and establish the Old
Union Courtyard as our new base
of concern.
We would be able to set up
tables in the courtyard and on
White Plaza to distribute
information to all the passers-by
whom we are presently not
affecting.
Meetings, Food
We would be in the heart of
campus and in an area filled with
small rooms and with grassy spots
for meetings.
We would be next door to
Tresidder Union, a good source of
food and of potential supporters
who live off campus.
We would be able to move into
the Union and the Clubhouse at
night to sleep, and to move out
again during the day to allow
these places to perform their usual
services.
Finally, we would constitute a
visible and news-worthy presence
but would not be explicitly
violating the campus disruption
regulations. This fact should gain
us many moderate supporters and
a great many faculty supporters
who are presently disturbed by
the illegality of the sit-in. This is
very . important. A small
movement which sees its numbers
diminishing will tend to become
violent, and few tears will be shed
when it is crushed. A large
movement can win. It is
absolutely crucial that the
Coalition grow.
Our only real force is a moral
force. It is imperative that we
accentuate that fact. I would hope
that we would have some evening
candlelight vigils with religious,
political, and academic spokesmen

There have been several
hundred sit-ins across the country
in the past year, but the April 3
Coalition's decision last
Wednesday to move into the AEL
was in many ways unique.
The Stanford sit-in did not
grow out of a small, manipulated
radical rally with "stacked"
speakers: it grew out of a
well-publicized meeting at which
respectful attention was paid to a
spectrum of speakers ranging from
Kenneth Pitzer to Steve
Weissman. The audience was a
cross-section of the Stanford
student body and faculty, and it
made its decision after a long
analysis of the background facts
and of the probable implications
of its actions.
The Wednesday night group
did not set a terminal date for the
sit-in, but it was commonly
understood that it would be
conducted for a finite period with
the following two objectives:
1. To demonstrate to the
Stanford community that the
community had the power to stop
immoral research.
2. To dramatically focus the
attention of the Stanford
community upon the nature of
some research performed at SRI
and on the Stanford campus, and
as a result to win adherants to the
movement to end research in the
following areas:
a. Chemical warfare and
biological warfare.
b. Counterinsurgency.
c. Research geared to
prolonging the American
military involvement in
Southeast Asia.
d. Classified research on the
university campus.
Unique
The sit-in was unique, then,
because it had no demands: it had
only self-realizable objectives. It
would stop the AEL research by
the very fact of its presence in
AEL, and it would focus the
attention of the Stanford
community upon a moral issue
and seek to win adherants. The
sit-in was to be terminated and
replaced by a different tactic if it
did not successfully work toward
these two ends.
It was further unique because
it bound itself strictly to a high

set of principles, designed to avoid
alienating potential supporters
and to keep attention focused
upon the central issue—immoral
research. The sitters-in voted
unanimously to inflict no harm
upon any person, to damage no
property, no enter no classified
materials, and to grant free access
to anyone who wanted to come
into the area of the
demonstration.
We sought not to polarize the
Stanford community, but rather
to mobilize the community
around a cluster of widely-shared
values, and thus to remove de
facto power for a particular moral
decision from a board of trustees
whose values tend not to overlap
very much with our own.
Since Wednesday night there
have been a number of subtle
changes in the demonstration. It
now seems to be slowly evolving
toward the traditional American
college pattern—a pattern which
has proven time and time again to
be singularly unsuccessful.
The demonstration has now
been focused upon a demand.
This is perhaps the most
significant change, for it
somewhat reduces our earlier
flexibility. Before we had the
option of de-escalating whenever
we saw that as tactically wise. But
a Friday morning meeting
established a demand for a trustee
meeting today as a condition for
de-escalation.
There seems to be change in
the character of the people in the
demonstration. There are still
many beautiful things happening;
most people are happy, and
wanting to talk, and pleased to be
touching one another and getting
a feeling for one another. But too
many are getting up-tight.
Most of the high school kids
are so up-tight that they can
communicate only at 10,000
decibels. A couple of the Third
World people are really up-tight.
Many radicals get up-tight when
their most cherished symbols fail
to move less politically-motivated
students. And many moderate,
morally-concerned students have
become very up-tight (and a good
number have left the
demonstration) because of what
they consider to be manipulation
in the decision-making process.

There is a very fine line to be
tread, and if the movement
becomes either too moderate or
too radical a number of fissure
lines are likely to crack. Any such
splinter groups can only weaken
the overall movement.
Another important factor to be
considered in plotting the future
of the Coalition is the existence of
a huge pool of students, faculty,
and administrators who have not
yet developed an allegiance to our
goals. We need them, and we are
not presently winning them. Any
further escalation will further
alienate them.
A M istake
The demand and the Monday
deadline was a mistake. One or
two of the more enlightened
trustees may drop by the campus,
but the Board is not about to have
an open decision-making meeting
today. There was never any
chance whatsoever that they
would have such a meeting. The
people who formulated that
demand either didn't understand
trustees, or else they had some
reason for wanting to frustrate the
sit-in by positing an unattainable
demand. The demand was an
error, and we must now decide
whether we will recognize that
error, or compound it.
There is a long-standing
American tradition: "When in
doubt, send in the Marines."
When a situation doesn't resolve
itself in the expected
manner —apply more pressure.
When a tactic doesn't
succeed—escalate.
When the typical American
motorist finds himself in the
snow, he floors his accelerator.
When the Pentagon found itself
stuck in Vietnam, it escalated.
Another Building
So what should we do? Many
demonstrators are suggesting that
we should set another deadline
and take over another building. If
this new deadline is not met, we
should set another deadline and
take over still another building.
I submit that this approach will
have the same effect upon our
trustees as bombing Hanoi had
upon Ho: they will simply
entrench.
More important, I submit that
this approach will do the same
thing to the Stanford communitv

that the Pentagon' 6 escalation did
to America: we will polarize the
factions and transform potential
supporters into vigorous
opponents.
Furthermore, if the
demonstration moves into new
buildings, we will lose some of the
present demonstrators and
exacerbate the splintering of the
remainder. The new buildings will
come to take on splinter group
identifications: the radical
building, the moderate building,
the Third World building, etc., the
central issues will be submerged,
at least one building will abandon
the operating principles, and the
unified movement will be
finished.
The best things we've done

demonstration) because of what
they consider to be manipulation
in the decision-making process.

There is a very fine line to be
tread, and if the movement
becomes either too moderate or
too radical a number of fissure
lines are likely to crack. Any such
splinter groups can only weaken
the overall movement.
Another important factor to be
considered in plotting the future
of the Coalition is the existence of
a huge pool of students, faculty,
and administrators who have not
yet developed an allegiance to our
goals. We need them, and we are
not presently winning them. Any
further escalation will further
alienate them.
A M istake
The demand and the Monday
deadline was a mistake. One or
two of the more enlightened
trustees may drop by the campus,
but the Board is not about to have
an open decision-making meeting
today. There was never any
chance whatsoever that they
would have such a meeting. The
people who formulated that
demand either didn't understand
trustees, or else they had some
reason for wanting to frustrate the
sit-in by positing an unattainable
demand. The demand was an
error, and we must now decide
whether we will recognize that
error, or compound it.
There is a long-standing
American tradition: "When in
doubt, send in the Marines."
When a situation doesn't resolve
itself in the expected
manner —apply more pressure.
When a tactic doesn't
succeed—escalate.
When the typical American
motorist finds himself in the
snow, he floors his accelerator.
When the Pentagon found itself
stuck in Vietnam, it escalated.
Another Building
So what should we do? Many
demonstrators are suggesting that
we should set another deadline
and take over another building. If
this new deadline is not met, we
should set another deadline and
take over still another building.
I submit that this approach will
have the same effect upon our
trustees as bombing Hanoi had
upon Ho: they will simply
entrench.
More important, I submit that
this approach will do the same
thing to the Stanford communitv

that the Pentagon' 6 escalation did
to America: we will polarize the
factions and transform potential
supporters into vigorous
opponents.
Furthermore, if the
demonstration moves into new
buildings, we will lose some of the
present demonstrators and
exacerbate the splintering of the
remainder. The new buildings will
come to take on splinter group
identifications: the radical
building, the moderate building,
the Third World building, etc., the
central issues will be submerged,
at least one building will abandon
the operating principles, and the
unified movement will be
finished.
The best things we've done
lately have been the faculty tea
and the SRI "lawn-in." These
were in no way related to an
occupied building.
AEL has outlived its utility to
us and its continued occupation
will only work against our ends. I
propose that we leave at 9 a.m.
Tuesday and establish the Old
Union Courtyard as our new base
of concern.
We would be able to set up
tables in the courtyard and on
White Plaza to distribute
information to all the passers-by
whom we are presently not
affecting.
Meetings, Food
We would be in the heart of
campus and in an area filled with
small rooms and with grassy spots
for meetings.
We would be next door to
Tresidder Union, a good source of
food and of potential supporters
who live off campus.
We would be able to move into
the Union and the Clubhouse at
night to sleep, and to move out
again during the day to allow
these places to perform their usual
services.
Finally, we would constitute a
visible and news-worthy presence
but would not be explicitly
violating the campus disruption
regulations. This fact should gain
us many moderate supporters and
a great many faculty supporters
who are presently disturbed by
the illegality of the sit-in. This is
very . important. A small
movement which sees its numbers
diminishing will tend to become
violent, and few tears will be shed
when it is crushed. A large
movement can win. It is
absolutely crucial that the
Coalition grow.
Our only real force is a moral
force. It is imperative that we
accentuate that fact. I would hope
that we would have some evening
candlelight vigils with religious,
political, and academic spokesmen
coming to speak in support of our
stand.
I would hope that we could
limit the political diatribes and
the personal antagonisms and let
nothing cloud the moral issues
we're raising for our university
and our nation.

There have been several
hundred sit-ins across the country
in the past year, but the April 3
Coalition's decision last
Wednesday to move into the AEL
was in many ways unique.
The Stanford sit-in did not
grow out of a small, manipulated
radical rally with "stacked"
speakers: it grew out of a
well-publicized meeting at which
respectful attention was paid to a
spectrum of speakers ranging from
Kenneth Pitzer to Steve
Weissman. The audience was a
cross-section of the Stanford
student body and faculty, and it
made its decision after a long
analysis of the background facts
and of the probable implications
of its actions.
The Wednesday night group
did not set a terminal date for the
sit-in, but it was commonly
understood that it would be
conducted for a finite period with
the following two objectives:
1. To demonstrate to the
Stanford community that the
community had the power to stop
immoral research.
2. To dramatically focus the
attention of the Stanford
community upon the nature of
some research performed at SRI
and on the Stanford campus, and
as a result to win adherants to the
movement to end research in the
following areas:
a. Chemical warfare and
biological warfare.
b. Counterinsurgency.
c. Research geared to
prolonging the American
military involvement in
Southeast Asia.
d. Classified research on the
university campus.
Unique
The sit-in was unique, then,
because it had no demands: it had
only self-realizable objectives. It
would stop the AEL research by
the very fact of its presence in
AEL, and it would focus the
attention of the Stanford
community upon a moral issue
and seek to win adherants. The
sit-in was to be terminated and
replaced by a different tactic if it
did not successfully work toward
these two ends.
It was further unique because
it bound itself strictly to a high

set of principles, designed to avoid
alienating potential supporters
and to keep attention focused
upon the central issue—immoral
research. The sitters-in voted
unanimously to inflict no harm
upon any person, to damage no
property, no enter no classified
materials, and to grant free access
to anyone who wanted to come
into the area of the
demonstration.
We sought not to polarize the
Stanford community, but rather
to mobilize the community
around a cluster of widely-shared
values, and thus to remove de
facto power for a particular moral
decision from a board of trustees
whose values tend not to overlap
very much with our own.
Since Wednesday night there
have been a number of subtle
changes in the demonstration. It
now seems to be slowly evolving
toward the traditional American
college pattern—a pattern which
has proven time and time again to
be singularly unsuccessful.
The demonstration has now
been focused upon a demand.
This is perhaps the most
significant change, for it
somewhat reduces our earlier
flexibility. Before we had the
option of de-escalating whenever
we saw that as tactically wise. But
a Friday morning meeting
established a demand for a trustee
meeting today as a condition for
de-escalation.
There seems to be change in
the character of the people in the
demonstration. There are still
many beautiful things happening;
most people are happy, and
wanting to talk, and pleased to be
touching one another and getting
a feeling for one another. But too
many are getting up-tight.
Most of the high school kids
are so up-tight that they can
communicate only at 10,000
decibels. A couple of the Third
World people are really up-tight.
Many radicals get up-tight when
their most cherished symbols fail
to move less politically-motivated
students. And many moderate,
morally-concerned students have
become very up-tight (and a good
number have left the
demonstration) because of what
they consider to be manipulation
in the decision-making process.

There is a very fine line to be
tread, and if the movement
becomes either too moderate or
too radical a number of fissure
lines are likely to crack. Any such
splinter groups can only weaken
the overall movement.

would stop the AEL research by
the very fact of its presence in
AEL, and it would focus the
attention of the Stanford
community upon a moral issue
and seek to win adherants. The
sit-in was to be terminated and
replaced by a different tactic if it
did not successfully work toward
these two ends.
It was further unique because
it bound itself strictly to a high

set of principles, designed to avoid
alienating potential supporters
and to keep attention focused
upon the central issue—immoral
research. The sitters-in voted
unanimously to inflict no harm
upon any person, to damage no
property, no enter no classified
materials, and to grant free access
to anyone who wanted to come
into the area of the
demonstration.
We sought not to polarize the
Stanford community, but rather
to mobilize the community
around a cluster of widely-shared
values, and thus to remove de
facto power for a particular moral
decision from a board of trustees
whose values tend not to overlap
very much with our own.
Since Wednesday night there
have been a number of subtle
changes in the demonstration. It
now seems to be slowly evolving
toward the traditional American
college pattern—a pattern which
has proven time and time again to
be singularly unsuccessful.
The demonstration has now
been focused upon a demand.
This is perhaps the most
significant change, for it
somewhat reduces our earlier
flexibility. Before we had the
option of de-escalating whenever
we saw that as tactically wise. But
a Friday morning meeting
established a demand for a trustee
meeting today as a condition for
de-escalation.
There seems to be change in
the character of the people in the
demonstration. There are still
many beautiful things happening;
most people are happy, and
wanting to talk, and pleased to be
touching one another and getting
a feeling for one another. But too
many are getting up-tight.
Most of the high school kids
are so up-tight that they can
communicate only at 10,000
decibels. A couple of the Third
World people are really up-tight.
Many radicals get up-tight when
their most cherished symbols fail
to move less politically-motivated
students. And many moderate,
morally-concerned students have
become very up-tight (and a good
number have left the
demonstration) because of what
they consider to be manipulation
in the decision-making process.

There is a very fine line to be
tread, and if the movement
becomes either too moderate or
too radical a number of fissure
lines are likely to crack. Any such
splinter groups can only weaken
the overall movement.
Another important factor to be
considered in plotting the future
of the Coalition is the existence of
a huge pool of students, faculty,
and administrators who have not
yet developed an allegiance to our
goals. We need them, and we are
not presently winning them. Any
further escalation will further
alienate them.
A M istake
The demand and the Monday
deadline was a mistake. One or
two of the more enlightened
trustees may drop by the campus,
but the Board is not about to have
an open decision-making meeting
today. There was never any
chance whatsoever that they
would have such a meeting. The
people who formulated that
demand either didn't understand
trustees, or else they had some
reason for wanting to frustrate the
sit-in by positing an unattainable
demand. The demand was an
error, and we must now decide
whether we will recognize that
error, or compound it.
There is a long-standing
American tradition: "When in
doubt, send in the Marines."
When a situation doesn't resolve
itself in the expected
manner —apply more pressure.
When a tactic doesn't
succeed—escalate.
When the typical American
motorist finds himself in the
snow, he floors his accelerator.
When the Pentagon found itself
stuck in Vietnam, it escalated.
Another Building
So what should we do? Many
demonstrators are suggesting that
we should set another deadline
and take over another building. If
this new deadline is not met, we
should set another deadline and
take over still another building.
I submit that this approach will
have the same effect upon our
trustees as bombing Hanoi had
upon Ho: they will simply
entrench.
More important, I submit that
this approach will do the same
thing to the Stanford communitv

that the Pentagon' 6 escalation did
to America: we will polarize the
factions and transform potential
supporters into vigorous
opponents.
Furthermore, if the
demonstration moves into new
buildings, we will lose some of the
present demonstrators and
exacerbate the splintering of the
remainder. The new buildings will
come to take on splinter group
identifications: the radical
building, the moderate building,
the Third World building, etc., the
central issues will be submerged,
at least one building will abandon
the operating principles, and the
unified movement will be
finished.
The best things we've done
lately have been the faculty tea
and the SRI "lawn-in." These
were in no way related to an
occupied building.
AEL has outlived its utility to
us and its continued occupation
will only work against our ends. I
propose that we leave at 9 a.m.
Tuesday and establish the Old
Union Courtyard as our new base
of concern.
We would be able to set up
tables in the courtyard and on
White Plaza to distribute
information to all the passers-by
whom we are presently not
affecting.
Meetings, Food
We would be in the heart of
campus and in an area filled with
small rooms and with grassy spots
for meetings.
We would be next door to
Tresidder Union, a good source of
food and of potential supporters
who live off campus.
We would be able to move into
the Union and the Clubhouse at
night to sleep, and to move out
again during the day to allow
these places to perform their usual
services.
Finally, we would constitute a
visible and news-worthy presence
but would not be explicitly
violating the campus disruption
regulations. This fact should gain
us many moderate supporters and
a great many faculty supporters
who are presently disturbed by
the illegality of the sit-in. This is
very . important. A small
movement which sees its numbers
diminishing will tend to become
violent, and few tears will be shed
when it is crushed. A large
movement can win. It is
absolutely crucial that the
Coalition grow.
Our only real force is a moral
force. It is imperative that we
accentuate that fact. I would hope
that we would have some evening
candlelight vigils with religious,
political, and academic spokesmen
coming to speak in support of our
stand.
I would hope that we could
limit the political diatribes and
the personal antagonisms and let
nothing cloud the moral issues
we're raising for our university
and our nation.

There have been several
hundred sit-ins across the country
in the past year, but the April 3
Coalition's decision last
Wednesday to move into the AEL
was in many ways unique.
The Stanford sit-in did not
grow out of a small, manipulated
radical rally with "stacked"
speakers: it grew out of a
well-publicized meeting at which
respectful attention was paid to a
spectrum of speakers ranging from
Kenneth Pitzer to Steve
Weissman. The audience was a
cross-section of the Stanford
student body and faculty, and it
made its decision after a long
analysis of the background facts
and of the probable implications
of its actions.
The Wednesday night group
did not set a terminal date for the
sit-in, but it was commonly
understood that it would be
conducted for a finite period with
the following two objectives:
1. To demonstrate to the
Stanford community that the
community had the power to stop
immoral research.
2. To dramatically focus the
attention of the Stanford
community upon the nature of
some research performed at SRI
and on the Stanford campus, and
as a result to win adherants to the
movement to end research in the
following areas:
a. Chemical warfare and
biological warfare.
b. Counterinsurgency.
c. Research geared to
prolonging the American
military involvement in
Southeast Asia.
d. Classified research on the
university campus.
