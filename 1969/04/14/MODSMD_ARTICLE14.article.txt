## Sit-In Sits On Black Time Bomb?

"And there came a voice from
the Wilderness, crying . ..
Repent."
Well, now children; I'm right
proud of you. I mean, you
socially aware and morally
conscious reformers have AEL,
SRI (CBW), and the USA all
hanging by the nails, and that's
good. You have established
yourselves as the initiators of a
new, forceful but reasonable
moral conscience for a system
which has become corrupt.
You're the new breed, with an

increased awareness and sense of
brotherhood for the myriad of
lives which now seem to get
misplaced and forgotten in the
immoral complex of
counter insurgency research done
as SRI(CBW)—at SRI(CBW),
where it seems that at times
considerations of humanity are
sacrificed for strategic
propositions; since you know that
this is wrong, you're going to
change it. Well now, children,
that's good.
It's good bullshit.
I am rapidly becoming
determined that the SDS and its
sundry affiliates represent one of
the most abject examples of the
degeneration (Heaven forbid,
could it be profression?) of the at
best mystical cult called "white
liberalism" in America. (If your
ego demands "radical," then have
it your way.)
But I'm black, and from the
South (as in cotton), and maybe I
just don't think too straight, but
this "reasonable" uproar you're
propagating seems to me to
indicate the advance of an
insidiously insipid liberal
philosophy which courts utter
disaster much more assiduously
than it qualifies its justifications.

What really upsets me, though,
is that you people are becoming
indignant, in some cases horrified,
and in others just plain mad,
because a particular type of
research is being done at
SRI(CBW).
But what seems to have
avoided your recognition is that
chemical-biological warfare
research is not the No. 1 burning
moral issue in this country. It's
not even close. And anyone that
believes that it is is grossly, and
dangerously, mistaken.
Logic (as in "Alas, poor")
would seem to indicate that the
results of the research being done
may or may not ever be used on
anyone or anything, but there is a
100% absolute certainty that
before you finish reading this
column, black people will starve
in the Mississippi Delta, or die of
tetanus in Harlem, or be exploited
in Detroit, or Chicago, or St.
Louis, or Oakland, or East Palo
Alto.
So where are your shrill voices
of moral outrage now? Where are
the cries of systematic
immorality, and the demands (as
opposed to requests) of
immediate action? Huh. All we
get are a few "Tsk, tsk's" and a

couple of impassioned "That's a
shame's"—platitudes which are
guaranteed to keep the BSU, the
New Toms of the New Left, in
line.
You people don't seem to
realize that America is now sitting
on a gigantic black time bomb
which was fused over 300 years
ago; yet you simply ignore it and
clean your fingernails of such grit
as chemical-biological research
and counterinsurgency research,
secure in your belief that the
bomb won't go off. Hmmm.
Actually, I wish you well. I
hope that you do end the nasty
research, abolish the ROTC,
design and control your own
courses, and elect President's
Pitzer's successor by student
referendum. Then after you've
satiated your moral consciences
and insured your personal
standards of academia, then,
maybe, it will be time to work for
equality for those poor black
men, who, as usual, will have
waited patiently and peacefully at
the end of the line.
You hope.
But then may be too late.
