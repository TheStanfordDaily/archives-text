# Letter For Every Trustee
## 
### 
.The issues raised by the AEL
sit-in this week are urgent and
important. However, judging from
the Trustees' silence, we can only
assume that they do not view
them as pressing.
Nothing will be resolved—no
programs will be made—unless the
entire University community
expresses its concern on the vital
issues of chemical and biological
warfare, classified research, Viet
Nam war research, and
counterinsurgency studies.
As long as the Trustees think
these matters concern only a small
minority of the student body,
they will not act. Yet none of us

can permit immoral and illegal
research to occupy university time
and- facilities which could be
solving the problems of hunger,
pollution, and poverty.
The Committee of
Correspondence is a
newly-organized group which feels
tha these questions must be
confronted by the Trustees, and
that it is the responsibility of the
entire university community
including those who for whatever
reason cannot support the AEL
sit-in—to impress on the Trustees
the urgency and importance of
these issues.
Currently, all communication
to the Board has gone through

President Pitzer. Clearly, this has
not motivated them to action, and
a more direct outpouring of
popular concern is needed if the
vital issues raised by the sit-in are
to be resolved.
We have adopted the slogan:
"Every Trustee Deserves a
Letter." Writing a letter takes
only ten minutes. It could be the
most effective alternative yet
devised in the campaign to
humanize Stanford research.
