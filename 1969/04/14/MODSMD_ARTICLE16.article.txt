## Channels Ignored? 
### 
Attempts to justify the
disruptive tactic of the sit-in at
Stanford's AEL on grounds that
more rational procedures have not
been successful, ignore the fact
that a mechanism for orderly,
rational action does exist at the
university. The Research Policy
Committee has been in existence
for nearly three years, and it can
hardly be accused of being
ineffective when complaints
expressed through the current
sit-in have not even been brought
before it.
This committee has been
willing, indeed eager, to examine
aspects of research about which
questions have been raised. Its
membership has included some
who, three years ago, challenged
the presence of "classified"
research which have come before
it (including all the university's
"classified" contracts). Those
programs which have been
approved by this committee have
been considered by them to be
appropriate for a university
environment.
If someone disagrees with the
bases on which this approval is
granted, he is welcome to express
his views before the committee, or
its members individually; and if he
has not done so, he should not
complain about inaction.
On repeated occasions within
the past year, the Stanford
student body has voted, by more
than two to one, to condemn
sit-ins and to refuse to yield to
any coercive tactics.
The pertinent question is
whether university research is to
be controlled in a systematic way
based on scrutiny of the pertinent
facts, or whether it is to be
controlled by an emotionally
aroused group whose sensitivities
and concerns are directed toward
sweeping measures based on
incomplete understandings and
oversimplified reasoning.

In either case, what we are
dealing with is censorship, in a
literal sense, censorship of one
segment of the university
community by another segment.
When such censorship is based on
action which does not even
attempt to give existing channels
for rational procedure a try, it is
deplorable.
To eliminate research because
it is legally "classified," or
because it is sponsored by DOD,
or because it might lead to
military applications—to employ
any such blanket prohibitions
would hinder as many progressive
pursuits as "immoral" ones, and
would be totally antithetical to
the academic purpose.
If we do not keep some
sensible balance in this matter,
there is a very serious danger that
intellectual progress will be
seriously retarded. Do we really
want our researchers to be so
cautious that they dare not work
on any project which some group
might consider offensive? Should
research be limited to only those
subjects which are "safe?"
Whatever the criteria for
Stanford's acceptance of research
contracts, they must provide for
intelligent, rational decisions
rather than mass action. To take
such action without even trying
existing channels is not only
inexcusable, it is detrimental to all
research.

questions have been raised. Its
membership has included some
who, three years ago, challenged
the presence of "classified"
research which have come before
it (including all the university's
"classified" contracts). Those
programs which have been
approved by this committee have
been considered by them to be
appropriate for a university
environment.
If someone disagrees with the
bases on which this approval is
granted, he is welcome to express
his views before the committee, or
its members individually; and if he
has not done so, he should not
complain about inaction.
On repeated occasions within
the past year, the Stanford
student body has voted, by more
than two to one, to condemn
sit-ins and to refuse to yield to
any coercive tactics.
The pertinent question is
whether university research is to
be controlled in a systematic way
based on scrutiny of the pertinent
facts, or whether it is to be
controlled by an emotionally
aroused group whose sensitivities
and concerns are directed toward
sweeping measures based on
incomplete understandings and
oversimplified reasoning.

In either case, what we are
dealing with is censorship, in a
literal sense, censorship of one
segment of the university
community by another segment.
When such censorship is based on
action which does not even
attempt to give existing channels
for rational procedure a try, it is
deplorable.
To eliminate research because
it is legally "classified," or
because it is sponsored by DOD,
or because it might lead to
military applications—to employ
any such blanket prohibitions
would hinder as many progressive
pursuits as "immoral" ones, and
would be totally antithetical to
the academic purpose.
If we do not keep some
sensible balance in this matter,
there is a very serious danger that
intellectual progress will be
seriously retarded. Do we really
want our researchers to be so
cautious that they dare not work
on any project which some group
might consider offensive? Should
research be limited to only those
subjects which are "safe?"
Whatever the criteria for
Stanford's acceptance of research
contracts, they must provide for
intelligent, rational decisions
rather than mass action. To take
such action without even trying
existing channels is not only
inexcusable, it is detrimental to all
research.

Attempts to justify the
disruptive tactic of the sit-in at
Stanford's AEL on grounds that
more rational procedures have not
been successful, ignore the fact
that a mechanism for orderly,
rational action does exist at the
university. The Research Policy
Committee has been in existence
for nearly three years, and it can
hardly be accused of being
ineffective when complaints
expressed through the current
sit-in have not even been brought
before it.
