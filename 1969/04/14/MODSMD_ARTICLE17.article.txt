## Time For Liberals To Act 
### Jim Spickard Ashley Crandell 
It is time for the liberals of
Stanford to act! Since we began
our sit-in at the AEL many of you
have come to us expressing your
complete sympathy with our
aims, claiming support for our
demands of an end both at
Stanford and at SRI, to classified
research, chemical-biological
warfare research, counter-insur
gency research, and research to be
used to subjugate the peoples of
the third world.
Yet, you say, you are forced
into inaction because of the
tactics we have used to support
these demands.
What you are really saying is
that you refuse to act in your
way, because we have acted in our
way. You back out of your own
moral commitment because we
have exercised ours.
You must realize that you are
attacking your own goals by
wasting all of your energy
attacking our means. That energy

is far better spent in working
swiftly in your own way to bring
an end to that research we all
oppose.
This will require effort on your
part. You must work through
"the proper channels," contact
members of the administration,
members of the Board of
Trustees, members of the
Academic Senate, and urge upon
them action to end objectionable
research in a rational way.
If you are students you may
urge your professors to use their
influence as faculty to control
research at Stanford, and can urge
the Trustees to come before the
Stanford community soon to
decide the fate of such research at
SRI.
If you are members of the
Academic Council you can urge
the Baxter committee to report
on new guidelines for Stanford
research, and urge the Trustees to
install such guidelines at SRI.

If you are members of the
surrounding community you can
make your concern known to all
those who have institutionalized
decision-making power.
But you must not merely sit
back and criticize. If you are truly
concerned with bringing about an
end to war research in this
university you must act —in a way
acceptable to your conscience, to
be sure, but you must act just the
same. If you chose to do so, the
aims we all support will triumph.
But if you do not, if you
simply sit and criticize "evil
tactics," you will be working
against the very goals you profess
to hold, and we can only assume
that you do not hold those goals
at all, and are using criticism as a
cloak to hide your antagonism to
peace.
