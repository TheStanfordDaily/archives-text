# Fuller Statement

### 
At its April Bth meeting, the Board
of Trustees announced that it planned
to hold a committee hearing on campus
as soon as possible after publication of
the SRI Study Committee report. We
are now informed that this report will
be published on Tuesday, April 15.
Accordingly, I shall try to set a date
tomorrow for the hearing.
Within the next two days I also
expect to name the trustees who will
serve on the hearing committee. All
trustees, of course, will be invited to
attend. The hearing will follow normal
judicial and legislative procedures, with
opportunity for both oral and written
testimony. As indicated in the Board's
statement following the April Bth
meeting, we expect to make
arrangements to carry the hearings to a
wider campus community by radio
broadcast, closed circuit television, or
both.
As recommended by the University
Advisory Committee, the trustees also
have expressed interest in obtaining
information on the views of the several
constituencies concerned about this
relationship, both on campus and at
SRI. Questionnaires for this purpose are
being drafted and will be circulated

shortly after publication of the report.
With respect to the question of
University research policy, the Board
took no action at its meeting of April
Bth, as President Pitzer reported to the
Academic Senate, because the trustees
regarded this as primarily the
responsibility of the faculty. I
understand that the Academic Council's
Committee on Research Policy has
scheduled an open hearing for Monday
and a regular meeting for Tuesday.
The trustees are aware of the urgency
which some members of the Stanford
community attach to an early resolution
of these questions, and the Board has
expressed its own concern that a fair
and responsible solution be arrived at as
soon as possible. However, for the
Board to act upon campus research
policy on Monday, as requested, would
pre-empt any further faculty
considerations of this issue. To act on
the SRI relationship within two days of
publication of the Study Committee
report would provide practically no
opportunity for reasoned consideration
of this issue and the expression of
opinions by individuals, on campus and
at SRI, who are affected by its
outcome. \y Parmer Fuller
