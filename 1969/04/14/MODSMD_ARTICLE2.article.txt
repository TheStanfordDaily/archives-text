# Coalition Seeking Support From Area Communities
## 
### FELICITY BARRINGER 
The ideas and issues behind the sit-in
at the Stanford Electronics Laboratory
(AEL) have filtered into the community
around Stanford and Palo Alto, thanks
largely to the efforts of the
demonstrators themselves.
Leafleters and speakers have gone to
Palo Alto's shopping centers and its
schools to show to the community the
purposes of the demonstration.
Three members of the demonstration
attempted to speak Friday at local high
schools. Two were not granted
permission to address the students in
the schools, due to a rule which forbids
permitting speakers of one political
persuasion to talk when opposing
viewpoints are not readily available.
Fred Cohen, a member of SDS and a
participant in the sit-in, was allowed to
address interested students in Palo Alto
High School during their lunch hour on
Friday. An estimated third of the
students listened to Cohen's speech in
the amphitheater.
During his talk, Cohen explained the
background of the events leading up to
the sit-in, and the issues of the types of
research done at Stanford and at the
Stanford Research Institute (SRI).
After his talk, Cohen asked for
questions from the audience. One
faculty member asked pointed questions
about SDS, such as where it funds were
obtained. He also asked Cohen to justify
the use of violence by a group

professing the the ends of stopping
violence. Cohen stated, however, that
despite this, the student body was very
receptive to his talk.
Jim Schoch and Larry Christiani, also
members of the sit-in, were refused
permission to speak at Cubberley High
School and Gunn High School. Schoch
addressed the students in the courtyard
of Cubberley High School after he was
refused permission to speak, until he
was informed by the principal that he
would be arrested if he continued.
Christiani, when informed that he could
not use school property to address the
students at Gunn High School, went to
a hill just off school property and talked
to some students from there.
Leafleting
The Liason Committee of the sit-in
has been organizing leafleting at centers
around Palo Alto. On Thursday, the day
after the sit-in began, demonstrators and
sympathizers distributed leaflets at the
Stanford Shopping Center and the
Town and Country Shopping Center,
according to a member of the
committee.
On Saturday, leafleters went to the
Stanford Shopping Center, and to
University and California avenues, in
downdown Palo Alto. Their leaflets
included the pamphlet on research
guidelines which has been published by
the demonstrators, and invitations to
the community tea being held on
Sunday afternoon.

Some passers-by expressed opinions
sympathetic to the proposals made by
the April 3rd Coalition. Some people,
according to the report of the Liason
Committee, were "... reluctant, even
adamant about not accepting the
literature or our arguments."
One Stanford alumnus asked for
copies of the leaflets to take to a party
for fellow alumni and friends which he
was attending in San Francisco Saturday
evening. He stated to a leafleter that he
would defend the views of the coalition
at that gathering.
The Committee's report adjudges
about one third of the community
"receptive" to the leafleters.
Sixteen area churches were also
leafleted on Sunday morning. Seven
ministers of these churches extended
the invitation to the Coalition's tea to
their congregations. On Sunday evening
in the First Presbyterian Church, a panel
discussion on the ethnical and social
problems surrounding scientific research
and national defense was held.
In dormitories, fraternities ana eating
clubs, demonstrators and sympathizers
have been initiating discussions
concerning Stanford's research
activities. A few houses have drafted
resolutions supporting either the sin-in
or its aims.
Serra House, Twain House (Holladay
and Fremont), Cedro, Soto and Arroyo
have all issued statements of suyport for
the demonstrators at the AEL. Serra
House's statement supported three of
the goals of the coalition; that Chemical
and Biological warfare research be
stopped, that an open decision-making
meeting of the Trustees be held on
Monday, April 14th, and that the
faculty assume the responsibility for
"evaluating and re-evaluating their own
research projects . . ." Serra and Arroyo
Houses each also donated $50.00 to the
sit-in.
The American Feueration of
Teachers Local 1316, of
Stanford-employed graduate students,
also declared support for the demands.
A letter-writing campaign of growing
proportions is also in progress among
those people who sympathize with the
objectives of the sit-in. Some students
have contacted their parents, asking
them to write the Trustees and express
their support for the aims of the sit-in.
Members of the sit-in are in the process
of drafting a list of the trusters' names
and addresses.

and Fremont), Cedro, Soto and Arroyo
have all issued statements of suyport for
the demonstrators at the AEL. Serra
House's statement supported three of
the goals of the coalition; that Chemical
and Biological warfare research be
stopped, that an open decision-making
meeting of the Trustees be held on
Monday, April 14th, and that the
faculty assume the responsibility for
"evaluating and re-evaluating their own
research projects . . ." Serra and Arroyo
Houses each also donated $50.00 to the
sit-in.
The American Feueration of
Teachers Local 1316, of
Stanford-employed graduate students,
also declared support for the demands.
A letter-writing campaign of growing
proportions is also in progress among
those people who sympathize with the
objectives of the sit-in. Some students
have contacted their parents, asking
them to write the Trustees and express
their support for the aims of the sit-in.
Members of the sit-in are in the process
of drafting a list of the trusters' names
and addresses.
The ideas and issues behind the sit-in
at the Stanford Electronics Laboratory
(AEL) have filtered into the community
around Stanford and Palo Alto, thanks
largely to the efforts of the
demonstrators themselves.
Leafleters and speakers have gone to
Palo Alto's shopping centers and its
schools to show to the community the
purposes of the demonstration.
Three members of the demonstration
attempted to speak Friday at local high
schools. Two were not granted
permission to address the students in
the schools, due to a rule which forbids
permitting speakers of one political
persuasion to talk when opposing
viewpoints are not readily available.
Fred Cohen, a member of SDS and a
participant in the sit-in, was allowed to
address interested students in Palo Alto
High School during their lunch hour on
Friday. An estimated third of the
students listened to Cohen's speech in
the amphitheater.
During his talk, Cohen explained the
background of the events leading up to
the sit-in, and the issues of the types of
research done at Stanford and at the
Stanford Research Institute (SRI).
After his talk, Cohen asked for
questions from the audience. One
faculty member asked pointed questions
about SDS, such as where it funds were
obtained. He also asked Cohen to justify
the use of violence by a group

professing the the ends of stopping
violence. Cohen stated, however, that
despite this, the student body was very
receptive to his talk.
Jim Schoch and Larry Christiani, also
members of the sit-in, were refused
permission to speak at Cubberley High
School and Gunn High School. Schoch
addressed the students in the courtyard
of Cubberley High School after he was
refused permission to speak, until he
was informed by the principal that he
would be arrested if he continued.
Christiani, when informed that he could
not use school property to address the
students at Gunn High School, went to
a hill just off school property and talked
to some students from there.
Leafleting
The Liason Committee of the sit-in
has been organizing leafleting at centers
around Palo Alto. On Thursday, the day
after the sit-in began, demonstrators and
sympathizers distributed leaflets at the
Stanford Shopping Center and the
Town and Country Shopping Center,
according to a member of the
committee.
On Saturday, leafleters went to the
Stanford Shopping Center, and to
University and California avenues, in
downdown Palo Alto. Their leaflets
included the pamphlet on research
guidelines which has been published by
the demonstrators, and invitations to
the community tea being held on
Sunday afternoon.

Some passers-by expressed opinions
sympathetic to the proposals made by
the April 3rd Coalition. Some people,
according to the report of the Liason
Committee, were "... reluctant, even
adamant about not accepting the
literature or our arguments."
One Stanford alumnus asked for
copies of the leaflets to take to a party
for fellow alumni and friends which he
was attending in San Francisco Saturday
evening. He stated to a leafleter that he
would defend the views of the coalition
at that gathering.
The Committee's report adjudges
about one third of the community
"receptive" to the leafleters.
Sixteen area churches were also
leafleted on Sunday morning. Seven
ministers of these churches extended
the invitation to the Coalition's tea to
their congregations. On Sunday evening
in the First Presbyterian Church, a panel
discussion on the ethnical and social
problems surrounding scientific research
and national defense was held.
In dormitories, fraternities ana eating
clubs, demonstrators and sympathizers
have been initiating discussions
concerning Stanford's research
activities. A few houses have drafted
resolutions supporting either the sin-in
or its aims.

according to the report of the Liason
Committee, were "... reluctant, even
adamant about not accepting the
literature or our arguments."
One Stanford alumnus asked for
copies of the leaflets to take to a party
for fellow alumni and friends which he
was attending in San Francisco Saturday
evening. He stated to a leafleter that he
would defend the views of the coalition
at that gathering.
The Committee's report adjudges
about one third of the community
"receptive" to the leafleters.
Sixteen area churches were also
leafleted on Sunday morning. Seven
ministers of these churches extended
the invitation to the Coalition's tea to
their congregations. On Sunday evening
in the First Presbyterian Church, a panel
discussion on the ethnical and social
problems surrounding scientific research
and national defense was held.
In dormitories, fraternities ana eating
clubs, demonstrators and sympathizers
have been initiating discussions
concerning Stanford's research
activities. A few houses have drafted
resolutions supporting either the sin-in
or its aims.
Serra House, Twain House (Holladay
and Fremont), Cedro, Soto and Arroyo
have all issued statements of suyport for
the demonstrators at the AEL. Serra
House's statement supported three of
the goals of the coalition; that Chemical
and Biological warfare research be
stopped, that an open decision-making
meeting of the Trustees be held on
Monday, April 14th, and that the
faculty assume the responsibility for
"evaluating and re-evaluating their own
research projects . . ." Serra and Arroyo
Houses each also donated $50.00 to the
sit-in.
The American Feueration of
Teachers Local 1316, of
Stanford-employed graduate students,
also declared support for the demands.
A letter-writing campaign of growing
proportions is also in progress among
those people who sympathize with the
objectives of the sit-in. Some students
have contacted their parents, asking
them to write the Trustees and express
their support for the aims of the sit-in.
Members of the sit-in are in the process
of drafting a list of the trusters' names
and addresses.
