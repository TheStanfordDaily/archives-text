## Pro's And Con's Of Sit-In Argued 
### 
• Eml Sit-In
Editor, THE DAILY:
As a Stanford student and a
research assistant in the Systems
Techniques Laboratory, I strongly
disagree with the tactics of those
who are presently occupying the
AEL building.
The idea of coercive research

censorship undertaken under
pressure of mob action is
antithetical to the most
fundamental concepts of
democracy. The university
community should be a leader in
its ability to discuss these issues
and act in a rational fashion, not
on the basis of gut feelings based
largely on misinformation.
The students, faculty and staff
of STL have exhibited
considerable interest in discussing
these issues with members of the
Stanford community, both before
and during this disruption.
Stanford students have voted,
at least twice, against the use of
coercive tactics on campus.
Apparently the leadership of
ASSU does not feel bound by the
results of the democratic
processes on campus. If such is
jthe case, I question whether any
department or research laboratory
is safe from having their normal
activities disrupted by mob
action.
In light of the above, I strongly
urge an end to the AEL sit-in so
that meaningful and constructive
discussions may take place.

Editor, THE DAILY:
We, as Stanford employees,
solely empathize with the SRI
Coalition. We are also very
concerned with the reaction of
the trustees to our demands and
hope that they end their research

on CWB, counterinsurgency, and
other war-related research.
We are appalled by the research
that has been going on at SRI, but
are hoping for a termination to
the research as soon as the
trustees "wake up."

• I oter Eligibility
Editor, THE DAILY:
The SRI Coalition at their
Thursday evening meeting
established an interesting
requirement for voter eligibility:
only those persons who are willing
to be bound by the Coalition's
ultimate decisions (regardless of
what those decisions might turn
out to be) are considered as
eligible to vote.
By their logic only those
people who are willing to fight in
Vietnam should vote on that
issue, only those people who are
willing to do classified research
should vote on that issue, etc. It is
unlikely that the results of any
such voting will be startling.
More importantly this
procedure has invalidated any
claim which the Coalition might
have previously been able to make
with regard to either its legitimacy
or community representativeness.

Editor, THE DAILY:
Indifference is our worst
enemy found in the community at

large. Let not the aware
community directly involved in
the issue of university war-related
applied research also fall into this
category.
Indifference through ignorance
is bad, temporary indifference
because of no direct motivational
relevance (e.g. draft inductance) is
worse-immoral. When one is
aware, one must take a stand.
Be opposed. Come and voice
your opposition to our work and
action. Disseminate your views
and propose your alternatives.
ACT on your alternative tactic,
don't just criticize ours.
Be with us. ACT in your own
way to educate yourself, to
distribute information of the issue,
to construct positive ways of
resolving the problems at hand, to
convince scientists and the
community of their role in
changing the defense-dominated
economy of our country; come
and join us physically in our
demonstration of concern.

President Pitzer and the Trustees
of Stanford University
Dear Sirs:
There have been some vital
issues raised at Stanford during
the last few weeks. In the near
future you are going to make
some decisions concerning these

questions; and these decisions will
be of consequence to people
around the world.
We are a group of individuals
convinced of the critical nature of
these questions and of the action
you take. And we are deeply
committed to the proposition that
these questions be resolved
according to the requests of the
April Third Coalition.
As an expression of our
commitment and of our sense of
the urgency of these questions, we
have begun fasting and will
continue fasting until we receive a
positive response from you, the
Trustees, toward a morally
acceptable resolution of these
questions.

and propose your alternatives.
ACT on your alternative tactic,
don't just criticize ours.
Be with us. ACT in your own
way to educate yourself, to
distribute information of the issue,
to construct positive ways of
resolving the problems at hand, to
convince scientists and the
community of their role in
changing the defense-dominated
economy of our country; come

President Pitzer and the Trustees
of Stanford University
Dear Sirs:
There have been some vital
issues raised at Stanford during
the last few weeks. In the near
future you are going to make
some decisions concerning these

questions; and these decisions will
be of consequence to people
around the world.
We are a group of individuals
convinced of the critical nature of
these questions and of the action
you take. And we are deeply
committed to the proposition that
these questions be resolved
according to the requests of the
April Third Coalition.
As an expression of our
commitment and of our sense of
the urgency of these questions, we
have begun fasting and will
continue fasting until we receive a
positive response from you, the
Trustees, toward a morally
acceptable resolution of these
questions.
Sincerely,

Editor, THE DAILY:
As a Stanford student and a
research assistant in the Systems
Techniques Laboratory, I strongly
disagree with the tactics of those
who are presently occupying the
AEL building.
The idea of coercive research

censorship undertaken under
pressure of mob action is
antithetical to the most
fundamental concepts of
democracy. The university
community should be a leader in
its ability to discuss these issues
and act in a rational fashion, not
on the basis of gut feelings based
largely on misinformation.
The students, faculty and staff
of STL have exhibited
considerable interest in discussing
these issues with members of the
Stanford community, both before
and during this disruption.
Stanford students have voted,
at least twice, against the use of
coercive tactics on campus.
Apparently the leadership of
ASSU does not feel bound by the
results of the democratic
processes on campus. If such is
jthe case, I question whether any
department or research laboratory
is safe from having their normal
activities disrupted by mob
action.
In light of the above, I strongly
urge an end to the AEL sit-in so
that meaningful and constructive
discussions may take place.

We, as Stanford employees,
solely empathize with the SRI
Coalition. We are also very
concerned with the reaction of
the trustees to our demands and
hope that they end their research

on CWB, counterinsurgency, and
other war-related research.
We are appalled by the research
that has been going on at SRI, but
are hoping for a termination to
the research as soon as the
trustees "wake up."

Editor, THE DAILY:
The SRI Coalition at their
Thursday evening meeting
established an interesting
requirement for voter eligibility:
only those persons who are willing
to be bound by the Coalition's
ultimate decisions (regardless of
what those decisions might turn
out to be) are considered as
eligible to vote.
By their logic only those
people who are willing to fight in
Vietnam should vote on that
issue, only those people who are
willing to do classified research
should vote on that issue, etc. It is
unlikely that the results of any
such voting will be startling.
More importantly this
procedure has invalidated any
claim which the Coalition might
have previously been able to make
with regard to either its legitimacy
or community representativeness.

Indifference is our worst
enemy found in the community at

large. Let not the aware
community directly involved in
the issue of university war-related
applied research also fall into this
category.
Indifference through ignorance
is bad, temporary indifference
because of no direct motivational
relevance (e.g. draft inductance) is
worse-immoral. When one is
aware, one must take a stand.

concerned with the reaction of
the trustees to our demands and
hope that they end their research

on CWB, counterinsurgency, and
other war-related research.
We are appalled by the research
that has been going on at SRI, but
are hoping for a termination to
the research as soon as the
trustees "wake up."

• I oter Eligibility
Editor, THE DAILY:
The SRI Coalition at their
Thursday evening meeting
established an interesting
requirement for voter eligibility:
only those persons who are willing
to be bound by the Coalition's
ultimate decisions (regardless of
what those decisions might turn
out to be) are considered as
eligible to vote.
By their logic only those
people who are willing to fight in
Vietnam should vote on that
issue, only those people who are
willing to do classified research
should vote on that issue, etc. It is
unlikely that the results of any
such voting will be startling.
More importantly this
procedure has invalidated any
claim which the Coalition might
have previously been able to make
with regard to either its legitimacy
or community representativeness.

• Take Sides!
Editor, THE DAILY:
Indifference is our worst
enemy found in the community at

large. Let not the aware
community directly involved in
the issue of university war-related
applied research also fall into this
category.
Indifference through ignorance
is bad, temporary indifference
because of no direct motivational
relevance (e.g. draft inductance) is
worse-immoral. When one is
aware, one must take a stand.
Be opposed. Come and voice
your opposition to our work and
action. Disseminate your views
and propose your alternatives.
ACT on your alternative tactic,
don't just criticize ours.
Be with us. ACT in your own
way to educate yourself, to
distribute information of the issue,
to construct positive ways of
resolving the problems at hand, to
convince scientists and the
community of their role in
changing the defense-dominated
economy of our country; come
and join us physically in our
demonstration of concern.

Below is a copy of the letter
sent to President Pitzer and the
Trustees of Stanford University:
President Pitzer and the Trustees
of Stanford University
Dear Sirs:
There have been some vital
issues raised at Stanford during
the last few weeks. In the near
future you are going to make
some decisions concerning these

questions; and these decisions will
be of consequence to people
around the world.
We are a group of individuals
convinced of the critical nature of
these questions and of the action
you take. And we are deeply
committed to the proposition that
these questions be resolved
according to the requests of the
April Third Coalition.
As an expression of our
commitment and of our sense of
the urgency of these questions, we
have begun fasting and will
continue fasting until we receive a
positive response from you, the
Trustees, toward a morally
acceptable resolution of these
questions.
Sincerely,
Terry Fitzgerald
