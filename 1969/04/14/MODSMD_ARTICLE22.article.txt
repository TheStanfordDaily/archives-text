# Lyman Statement
## 
### 
As the President has made clear in his
statements on April 10 and 11, the
occupation of the Applied Electronics
Laboratory, by preventing the normal
conduct of University business in
University offices and laboratories, is a
violation of the University Policy on
Campus Disruptions. The violation has
been referred to the Stanford Judicial
Council.
The President and I are continuing to
deal with this disruption by internal
means. With the advice of the Faculty
Consultative Group on Campus
Disruptions, the President has decided
to continue the process of identifying
participants in the occupation, as a
necessary prelude to the SJC's normal
procedures. Members of the faculty and
staff are being asked to participate in
that identification process.
The following request is being made
to a number of members of the faculty
and staff:
"A number of violators have been
identified and are being charged, but
many are as yet unidentified. The
University needs assistance from
officials, both faculty and
administration, to make further
identification of violators in a
systematic way in the near future. This
procedure for making identifications
will be strictly in accord with the
University Policy on Campus
Disruptions and with the Statement on
Community Responsibility that was
recently passed by the Senate and
endorsed by the Academic Council. Are
you willing to assist in making
identification of the violators?"
The following people are among
those who already have been asked and

have agreed to participate in the
necessary interviewing:
Mr. R. F. Bacchetti, Prof. G. L. Bach,
Mr. D. Carlson, Prof. J. P. Dawson, Prof.
J. M. Gere, Prof. J. L. Gibbs Jr., Prof.
W. O. Hamilton, Prof. H. Heffner, Mr.
B. G. Hinchliffe, Prof. W. M. Kays, Prof.
D. Kennedy, Prof. J. K. Mann, Prof. D.
M. Mason, Prof. W. F. Miller, Mr. F.
Newman, Prof. J. M. Pettit, Mr. F. G.
Riddle, Mr. M. M. Roberts, Mr. R. M.
Rosenzweig, Prof. H. L. Royden, Mr. J.
H. Ruetz, Prof. L. V. Ryan, Mr. D. C.
Weber and Prof. R. E. Wolfinger.
The procedure will be carried out in
the following way, from tomorrow on.
Two of these interviewers will approach
individuals in the building in turn,
announce their own ident'ty, and ask
individuals to leave the building. Any
who refuse to leave will be asked for
identification.
We hope there will be voluntary
cooperation with this procedure. We are
encouraged in this hope by the strong
moral convictions expressed by many
participants in the demonstration. That
hope is embodied in the following
statement that will be used by
interviewers:
"I remind you that your obligation
to identify yourself to me under these
circumstances is specifically imposed by
the University Policy on Campus
Disruptions. I understand, moreover,
that many of you have decided that
your moral concerns and tactical
judgments make you willing to face
University disciplinary processes in
order to achieve your objectives. (living
your name to me now is consistent with
these moral principles."

judgments make you willing to face
University disciplinary processes in
order to achieve your objectives. (living
your name to me now is consistent with
these moral principles."
Richard W. Lyman, Provost
As the President has made clear in his
statements on April 10 and 11, the
occupation of the Applied Electronics
Laboratory, by preventing the normal
conduct of University business in
University offices and laboratories, is a
violation of the University Policy on
Campus Disruptions. The violation has
been referred to the Stanford Judicial
Council.
The President and I are continuing to
deal with this disruption by internal
means. With the advice of the Faculty
Consultative Group on Campus
Disruptions, the President has decided
to continue the process of identifying
participants in the occupation, as a
necessary prelude to the SJC's normal
procedures. Members of the faculty and
staff are being asked to participate in
that identification process.
The following request is being made
to a number of members of the faculty
and staff:
"A number of violators have been
identified and are being charged, but
many are as yet unidentified. The
University needs assistance from
officials, both faculty and
administration, to make further
identification of violators in a
systematic way in the near future. This
procedure for making identifications
will be strictly in accord with the
University Policy on Campus
Disruptions and with the Statement on
Community Responsibility that was
recently passed by the Senate and
endorsed by the Academic Council. Are
you willing to assist in making
identification of the violators?"
The following people are among
those who already have been asked and

have agreed to participate in the
necessary interviewing:
Mr. R. F. Bacchetti, Prof. G. L. Bach,
Mr. D. Carlson, Prof. J. P. Dawson, Prof.
J. M. Gere, Prof. J. L. Gibbs Jr., Prof.
W. O. Hamilton, Prof. H. Heffner, Mr.
B. G. Hinchliffe, Prof. W. M. Kays, Prof.
D. Kennedy, Prof. J. K. Mann, Prof. D.
M. Mason, Prof. W. F. Miller, Mr. F.
Newman, Prof. J. M. Pettit, Mr. F. G.
Riddle, Mr. M. M. Roberts, Mr. R. M.
Rosenzweig, Prof. H. L. Royden, Mr. J.
H. Ruetz, Prof. L. V. Ryan, Mr. D. C.
Weber and Prof. R. E. Wolfinger.
The procedure will be carried out in
the following way, from tomorrow on.
Two of these interviewers will approach
individuals in the building in turn,
announce their own ident'ty, and ask
individuals to leave the building. Any
who refuse to leave will be asked for
identification.
We hope there will be voluntary
cooperation with this procedure. We are
encouraged in this hope by the strong
moral convictions expressed by many
participants in the demonstration. That
hope is embodied in the following
statement that will be used by
interviewers:
"I remind you that your obligation
to identify yourself to me under these
circumstances is specifically imposed by
the University Policy on Campus
Disruptions. I understand, moreover,
that many of you have decided that
your moral concerns and tactical
judgments make you willing to face
University disciplinary processes in
order to achieve your objectives. (living
your name to me now is consistent with
these moral principles."
