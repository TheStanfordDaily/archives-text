Subject: Sponsored Research at Stanford
The paper on "Research at Stanford" issued this week describes the policies that
have been pursued at Stanford for a number of years in regard to sponsored re
search activities. Though this paper contains no new information, it does bring
together in one document a number of policies, all of which relate to the University's
research program. The paper has been reviewed by the President, the Research Ad
ministrator and by us.
RESEARCH AT STANFORD

The purpose of this paper is to describe the basis upon which
, research, education and training projects carried on with
outside support are approved and conducted at Stanford.
All sponsored projects which are undertaken at Stanford
with external financial support begin with faculty initiative.
That is to say, sponsored projects are not undertaken at the
request of an outside agency. When a. faculty member wishes
to undertake an externally sponsored project, he prepares a
proposal setting forth the nature of the problem to be studied
(e.g., a research project in the synthesis of alkaloids, or an
educational project to train students in a foreign language),
explains the significance of what it is that he proposes to
undertake, and gives a general description of how he proposes
to conduct the program. 1 his includes a description of the
j, facilities to be used and the significance of the work to be
undertaken, the University faculty and staff involved, the
duration of the project, and the sponsor oV sponsors for whom'
the proposal is intended. Also included in the proposal is an
estimate of the cost of the project, the amount of money re
quested from the potential sponsor and the amount of the
cost if anv to be borne bv the Universitv. The orooosal is then
submitted to the chairman of the faculty member's depart
ment who reviews and formally approves it. The approved
proposal then goes to the appropriate school Dean's office
where it is again reviewed and approved for academic pro
priety as a School project.
The approved proposal is then transmitted to the Research
Administrators office where it is again reviewed for Univer
sity approval against a list of guidelines provided by the Pro
vost. These guidelines are:
1. Academic Propriety
(a) Principal Investigator. Is the proposal submitted
by a Stanford faculty member or Senior Research
Associate as principal investigator?
Proposals for research, education and training
are directed by an Academic Council member or
Senior Research Associate as principal investiga
tor, except in highly unusual circumstances, and
then only with the Provost's approval.
{b) Educational Component. Does the proposal in
volve students? Research proposals include an
educational component usually through the train
ing and support of graduate students.
(c) Presence at Stanford. Does (he proposal require
faculty members to he away from the campus for
exte.idea periods of time? If so, what are the bene
fits accruing to Stanford and do they outweigh
tnis disadvantage?
(d) Faculty Time Involvement. Is the amount of ef
fort committed to the- research by each faculty
member consistent with his other academic du
tiesr
2. Commitments
(a) New Staff. Are commitments for the acquisition
of additional faculty or senior staff members con
sistent with school plans?
If the proposal requires additional staff which
w.l result in an eventual charge to the academic
budget, specific Provost's Office approval is re
quired.
(b) Space. Will the project require additional space?
If so, are requirements for additional space con
sistent with school plans in the sense that they are
a part of a construction program which has Presi
dent s Office approval or of a minor remodeling
nature for which funds have been approved?
(c) Cost Sharing (Federal Research Grants). Is the
listing of the University contribution which may
be included accurate, consistent with school plans
and budget, and in accord with the guidelines
issued by the Research Administrator's Office?

In addition, should a proposal involve the use of human
su r( , search projects , nvolWng . n yjvo sh]djes

using patients at the Medical School or psychological or so
ciological investigations in the School of Humanities and Sci
ences), the proposal is referred to one of the two University
standing committees on the use of human subjects, to insure
that the rights of the experimental subjects are protected
under the Helsinki Declaration.
Exceptions in the review of a proposal on any of the above
points are referred back to the school or department as ap
propriate for reconsideration. Any exceptions to the above
criteria which the school recommends are referred to the
Provost for his review and approval before the proposal is
forwarded.
In the past year, the University faculty has submitted
through this mechanism some 1,250 proposals to some 90
different foundations and government agencies for sponsor
ship.
One category of proposals for research and educational
grants and contracts receives an additional review: proposals
to undertake research which may involve classification of the
contract or grant if the potential sponsor elects to make an
award. It should be noted that of the 1,250 proposals sub
mitted in the last twelve months, 20 involved the possibility
of classification and of those sixteen resulted in awards. In
cases where the Principal Investigator has reason to believe
that the work he is proposing will involve the likelihood that
some part of it will be classified, the proposal, after it is re
viewed in the manner described above, is referred to the Sub
committee on Classified Contracts-of the faculty Committee
on Research Policy.
The Committer .was created in June of 1966 as a standing
committee of the Academic Council to review research pol-.
icy in general and to review in detail and in depth the ques-i
ti°n of the propriety of classified research in a university set
ting. From the Committee's extensive deliberations emerged
a set of rules, subsequently approved by vote of the Academic
Council, that arc applied by the Subcommittee in its review
of each such proposal. The method used by the Subcommittee
to conduct the review is to circulate the proposal in question
to the members for reading in advance of the meeting at
which it is to be taken up, and then to invite to the meeting
the faculty member initiating the proposal so that he may
discuss the proposal and the work to be performed. Under
the Committee's definition, a proposal is considered to be
classified if any one researcher to work on the project requires
security clearance from the federal government. All proposals
which appear before the Committee are reviewed in accord
with the following general rules:
(a) No research on a thesis or dissertation should be
undertaken if, at the time the topic is set, there is
any substantial possibility that it will lead to a
classified thesis or dissertation;
(b) No classified thesis or dissertation should be ac
cepted as the basis for a degree unless, in the judg
ment of the Committee on the Graduate Division,
the imposition of classification could not reasonably
have been foreseen until the work was so far ad
vanced that modification of the thesis topic would
have resulted in substantial inequity to the student;
Scholarly activities not accessible for scrutiny by
the entire Advisory Board should not be considered
in connection with appointments, reappointments or
promotions;
(d) The University should enter no contract and accept
no grant that involves the collection of social or be
havioral data in a foreign country and requires the
security clearance of any person involved in the
oroiect:
(e ) Ihe University should enter no contract and accept
no grant to carry out research under circumstances
that restrain the freedom of the University to dis
close (1) the existence of the contract or grant or
(2) the general nature of the inquiry to be con
ducted or (3) the identity of the outside contracting
or granting entity; Provided, that clause (3) shall
not apply either (a) to anonymous gifts or grants
that do not call for the performance of specified
lines of inquiry, or (b) to research grants or con
tracts from individuals or non-governmental en
tities who request anonymity out of a justifiable
motivation to protect individual privacy.
In the case of the majority of proposals which do not in
volve classification, slightly in excess of one half of the pro
posals which are approved and forwarded to government
and non-government potential sponsors result in awards,
through the University, to the principal faculty investigator
to undertake and carry out the project proposed. When a
proposal is accepted for sponsorship, usually following spon
sor screening for quality and importance of the work pro
posed (within the limits of the funds that are available to
support such projects), the foundation or agency concerned
then contacts the University and a grant or contract is ne
gotiated. Any changes in the proposal as submitted which
are requested by the sponsor are then reviewed by the prin
cipal investigator and the Research Administrator's office as
to acceptability and an award is not accepted by the Uni
versity in which any such differences cannot be satisfactorily
resolved.
Once the award has hecn accepted by the University and
the principal investigator, the principal investigator is then
free to begin work on the project, with the University ad

m providing other than required fiscal and prop,

Subject: Sponsored Research at Stanford
The paper on "Research at Stanford" issued this week describes the policies that
have been pursued at Stanford for a number of years in regard to sponsored re
search activities. Though this paper contains no new information, it does bring
together in one document a number of policies, all of which relate to the University's
research program. The paper has been reviewed by the President, the Research Ad
ministrator and by us.
RESEARCH AT STANFORD

The purpose of this paper is to describe the basis upon which
, research, education and training projects carried on with
outside support are approved and conducted at Stanford.
All sponsored projects which are undertaken at Stanford
with external financial support begin with faculty initiative.
That is to say, sponsored projects are not undertaken at the
request of an outside agency. When a. faculty member wishes
to undertake an externally sponsored project, he prepares a
proposal setting forth the nature of the problem to be studied
(e.g., a research project in the synthesis of alkaloids, or an
educational project to train students in a foreign language),
explains the significance of what it is that he proposes to
undertake, and gives a general description of how he proposes
to conduct the program. 1 his includes a description of the
j, facilities to be used and the significance of the work to be
undertaken, the University faculty and staff involved, the
duration of the project, and the sponsor oV sponsors for whom'
the proposal is intended. Also included in the proposal is an
estimate of the cost of the project, the amount of money re
quested from the potential sponsor and the amount of the
cost if anv to be borne bv the Universitv. The orooosal is then
submitted to the chairman of the faculty member's depart
ment who reviews and formally approves it. The approved
proposal then goes to the appropriate school Dean's office
where it is again reviewed and approved for academic pro
priety as a School project.
The approved proposal is then transmitted to the Research
Administrators office where it is again reviewed for Univer
sity approval against a list of guidelines provided by the Pro
vost. These guidelines are:
1. Academic Propriety
(a) Principal Investigator. Is the proposal submitted
by a Stanford faculty member or Senior Research
Associate as principal investigator?
Proposals for research, education and training
are directed by an Academic Council member or
Senior Research Associate as principal investiga
tor, except in highly unusual circumstances, and
then only with the Provost's approval.
{b) Educational Component. Does the proposal in
volve students? Research proposals include an
educational component usually through the train
ing and support of graduate students.
(c) Presence at Stanford. Does (he proposal require
faculty members to he away from the campus for
exte.idea periods of time? If so, what are the bene
fits accruing to Stanford and do they outweigh
tnis disadvantage?
(d) Faculty Time Involvement. Is the amount of ef
fort committed to the- research by each faculty
member consistent with his other academic du
tiesr
2. Commitments
(a) New Staff. Are commitments for the acquisition
of additional faculty or senior staff members con
sistent with school plans?
If the proposal requires additional staff which
w.l result in an eventual charge to the academic
budget, specific Provost's Office approval is re
quired.
(b) Space. Will the project require additional space?
If so, are requirements for additional space con
sistent with school plans in the sense that they are
a part of a construction program which has Presi
dent s Office approval or of a minor remodeling
nature for which funds have been approved?
(c) Cost Sharing (Federal Research Grants). Is the
listing of the University contribution which may
be included accurate, consistent with school plans
and budget, and in accord with the guidelines
issued by the Research Administrator's Office?

In addition, should a proposal involve the use of human

using patients at the Medical School or psychological or so
ciological investigations in the School of Humanities and Sci
ences), the proposal is referred to one of the two University
standing committees on the use of human subjects, to insure
that the rights of the experimental subjects are protected
under the Helsinki Declaration.
Exceptions in the review of a proposal on any of the above
points are referred back to the school or department as ap
propriate for reconsideration. Any exceptions to the above
criteria which the school recommends are referred to the
Provost for his review and approval before the proposal is
forwarded.
In the past year, the University faculty has submitted
through this mechanism some 1,250 proposals to some 90
different foundations and government agencies for sponsor
ship.
One category of proposals for research and educational
grants and contracts receives an additional review: proposals
to undertake research which may involve classification of the
contract or grant if the potential sponsor elects to make an
award. It should be noted that of the 1,250 proposals sub
mitted in the last twelve months, 20 involved the possibility
of classification and of those sixteen resulted in awards. In
cases where the Principal Investigator has reason to believe
that the work he is proposing will involve the likelihood that
some part of it will be classified, the proposal, after it is re
viewed in the manner described above, is referred to the Sub
committee on Classified Contracts-of the faculty Committee
on Research Policy.
The Committer .was created in June of 1966 as a standing
committee of the Academic Council to review research pol-.
icy in general and to review in detail and in depth the ques-i
ti°n of the propriety of classified research in a university set
ting. From the Committee's extensive deliberations emerged
a set of rules, subsequently approved by vote of the Academic
Council, that arc applied by the Subcommittee in its review
of each such proposal. The method used by the Subcommittee
to conduct the review is to circulate the proposal in question
to the members for reading in advance of the meeting at
which it is to be taken up, and then to invite to the meeting
the faculty member initiating the proposal so that he may
discuss the proposal and the work to be performed. Under
the Committee's definition, a proposal is considered to be
classified if any one researcher to work on the project requires
security clearance from the federal government. All proposals
which appear before the Committee are reviewed in accord
with the following general rules:
(a) No research on a thesis or dissertation should be
undertaken if, at the time the topic is set, there is
any substantial possibility that it will lead to a
classified thesis or dissertation;
(b) No classified thesis or dissertation should be ac
cepted as the basis for a degree unless, in the judg
ment of the Committee on the Graduate Division,
the imposition of classification could not reasonably
have been foreseen until the work was so far ad
vanced that modification of the thesis topic would
have resulted in substantial inequity to the student;
Scholarly activities not accessible for scrutiny by
the entire Advisory Board should not be considered
in connection with appointments, reappointments or
promotions;
(d) The University should enter no contract and accept
no grant that involves the collection of social or be
havioral data in a foreign country and requires the
security clearance of any person involved in the
oroiect:
(e ) Ihe University should enter no contract and accept
no grant to carry out research under circumstances
that restrain the freedom of the University to dis
close (1) the existence of the contract or grant or
(2) the general nature of the inquiry to be con
ducted or (3) the identity of the outside contracting
or granting entity; Provided, that clause (3) shall
not apply either (a) to anonymous gifts or grants
that do not call for the performance of specified
lines of inquiry, or (b) to research grants or con
tracts from individuals or non-governmental en
tities who request anonymity out of a justifiable
motivation to protect individual privacy.
In the case of the majority of proposals which do not in
volve classification, slightly in excess of one half of the pro
posals which are approved and forwarded to government
and non-government potential sponsors result in awards,
through the University, to the principal faculty investigator
to undertake and carry out the project proposed. When a
proposal is accepted for sponsorship, usually following spon
sor screening for quality and importance of the work pro

committee on Classified Contracts-of the faculty Committee
on Research Policy.
The Committer .was created in June of 1966 as a standing
committee of the Academic Council to review research pol-.
icy in general and to review in detail and in depth the ques-i
ti°n of the propriety of classified research in a university set
ting. From the Committee's extensive deliberations emerged
a set of rules, subsequently approved by vote of the Academic
Council, that arc applied by the Subcommittee in its review
of each such proposal. The method used by the Subcommittee
to conduct the review is to circulate the proposal in question
to the members for reading in advance of the meeting at
which it is to be taken up, and then to invite to the meeting
the faculty member initiating the proposal so that he may
discuss the proposal and the work to be performed. Under
the Committee's definition, a proposal is considered to be
classified if any one researcher to work on the project requires
security clearance from the federal government. All proposals
which appear before the Committee are reviewed in accord
with the following general rules:
(a) No research on a thesis or dissertation should be
undertaken if, at the time the topic is set, there is
any substantial possibility that it will lead to a
classified thesis or dissertation;
(b) No classified thesis or dissertation should be ac
cepted as the basis for a degree unless, in the judg
ment of the Committee on the Graduate Division,
the imposition of classification could not reasonably
have been foreseen until the work was so far ad
vanced that modification of the thesis topic would
have resulted in substantial inequity to the student;
Scholarly activities not accessible for scrutiny by
the entire Advisory Board should not be considered
in connection with appointments, reappointments or
promotions;
(d) The University should enter no contract and accept
no grant that involves the collection of social or be
havioral data in a foreign country and requires the
security clearance of any person involved in the
oroiect:
(e ) Ihe University should enter no contract and accept
no grant to carry out research under circumstances
that restrain the freedom of the University to dis
close (1) the existence of the contract or grant or
(2) the general nature of the inquiry to be con
ducted or (3) the identity of the outside contracting
or granting entity; Provided, that clause (3) shall
not apply either (a) to anonymous gifts or grants
that do not call for the performance of specified
lines of inquiry, or (b) to research grants or con
tracts from individuals or non-governmental en
tities who request anonymity out of a justifiable
motivation to protect individual privacy.
In the case of the majority of proposals which do not in
volve classification, slightly in excess of one half of the pro
posals which are approved and forwarded to government
and non-government potential sponsors result in awards,
through the University, to the principal faculty investigator
to undertake and carry out the project proposed. When a
proposal is accepted for sponsorship, usually following spon
sor screening for quality and importance of the work pro
posed (within the limits of the funds that are available to
support such projects), the foundation or agency concerned
then contacts the University and a grant or contract is ne
gotiated. Any changes in the proposal as submitted which
are requested by the sponsor are then reviewed by the prin
cipal investigator and the Research Administrator's office as
to acceptability and an award is not accepted by the Uni
versity in which any such differences cannot be satisfactorily
resolved.

Subject: Sponsored Research at Stanford
The paper on "Research at Stanford" issued this week describes the policies that
have been pursued at Stanford for a number of years in regard to sponsored re
search activities. Though this paper contains no new information, it does bring
together in one document a number of policies, all of which relate to the University's
research program. The paper has been reviewed by the President, the Research Ad
ministrator and by us.
RESEARCH AT STANFORD

The purpose of this paper is to describe the basis upon which
, research, education and training projects carried on with
outside support are approved and conducted at Stanford.
All sponsored projects which are undertaken at Stanford
with external financial support begin with faculty initiative.
That is to say, sponsored projects are not undertaken at the
request of an outside agency. When a. faculty member wishes
to undertake an externally sponsored project, he prepares a
proposal setting forth the nature of the problem to be studied
(e.g., a research project in the synthesis of alkaloids, or an
educational project to train students in a foreign language),
explains the significance of what it is that he proposes to
undertake, and gives a general description of how he proposes
to conduct the program. 1 his includes a description of the
j, facilities to be used and the significance of the work to be
undertaken, the University faculty and staff involved, the
duration of the project, and the sponsor oV sponsors for whom'
the proposal is intended. Also included in the proposal is an
estimate of the cost of the project, the amount of money re
quested from the potential sponsor and the amount of the
cost if anv to be borne bv the Universitv. The orooosal is then
submitted to the chairman of the faculty member's depart
ment who reviews and formally approves it. The approved
proposal then goes to the appropriate school Dean's office
where it is again reviewed and approved for academic pro
priety as a School project.
The approved proposal is then transmitted to the Research
Administrators office where it is again reviewed for Univer
sity approval against a list of guidelines provided by the Pro
vost. These guidelines are:
1. Academic Propriety
(a) Principal Investigator. Is the proposal submitted
by a Stanford faculty member or Senior Research
Associate as principal investigator?
Proposals for research, education and training
are directed by an Academic Council member or
Senior Research Associate as principal investiga
tor, except in highly unusual circumstances, and
then only with the Provost's approval.
{b) Educational Component. Does the proposal in
volve students? Research proposals include an
educational component usually through the train
ing and support of graduate students.
(c) Presence at Stanford. Does (he proposal require
faculty members to he away from the campus for
exte.idea periods of time? If so, what are the bene
fits accruing to Stanford and do they outweigh
tnis disadvantage?
(d) Faculty Time Involvement. Is the amount of ef
fort committed to the- research by each faculty
member consistent with his other academic du
tiesr
2. Commitments
(a) New Staff. Are commitments for the acquisition
of additional faculty or senior staff members con
sistent with school plans?
If the proposal requires additional staff which
w.l result in an eventual charge to the academic
budget, specific Provost's Office approval is re
quired.
(b) Space. Will the project require additional space?
If so, are requirements for additional space con
sistent with school plans in the sense that they are
a part of a construction program which has Presi
dent s Office approval or of a minor remodeling
nature for which funds have been approved?
(c) Cost Sharing (Federal Research Grants). Is the
listing of the University contribution which may
be included accurate, consistent with school plans
and budget, and in accord with the guidelines
issued by the Research Administrator's Office?

In addition, should a proposal involve the use of human

using patients at the Medical School or psychological or so
ciological investigations in the School of Humanities and Sci
ences), the proposal is referred to one of the two University
standing committees on the use of human subjects, to insure
that the rights of the experimental subjects are protected
under the Helsinki Declaration.
Exceptions in the review of a proposal on any of the above
points are referred back to the school or department as ap
propriate for reconsideration. Any exceptions to the above
criteria which the school recommends are referred to the
Provost for his review and approval before the proposal is
forwarded.
In the past year, the University faculty has submitted
through this mechanism some 1,250 proposals to some 90
different foundations and government agencies for sponsor
ship.
One category of proposals for research and educational
grants and contracts receives an additional review: proposals
to undertake research which may involve classification of the
contract or grant if the potential sponsor elects to make an
award. It should be noted that of the 1,250 proposals sub
mitted in the last twelve months, 20 involved the possibility
of classification and of those sixteen resulted in awards. In
cases where the Principal Investigator has reason to believe
that the work he is proposing will involve the likelihood that
some part of it will be classified, the proposal, after it is re
viewed in the manner described above, is referred to the Sub
committee on Classified Contracts-of the faculty Committee
on Research Policy.

cases where the Principal Investigator has reason to believe
that the work he is proposing will involve the likelihood that
some part of it will be classified, the proposal, after it is re

committee on Classified Contracts-of the faculty Committee
on Research Policy.
The Committer .was created in June of 1966 as a standing
committee of the Academic Council to review research pol-.
icy in general and to review in detail and in depth the ques-i
ti°n of the propriety of classified research in a university set
ting. From the Committee's extensive deliberations emerged
a set of rules, subsequently approved by vote of the Academic
Council, that arc applied by the Subcommittee in its review
of each such proposal. The method used by the Subcommittee
to conduct the review is to circulate the proposal in question
to the members for reading in advance of the meeting at
which it is to be taken up, and then to invite to the meeting
the faculty member initiating the proposal so that he may
discuss the proposal and the work to be performed. Under
the Committee's definition, a proposal is considered to be
classified if any one researcher to work on the project requires
security clearance from the federal government. All proposals
which appear before the Committee are reviewed in accord
with the following general rules:
(a) No research on a thesis or dissertation should be
undertaken if, at the time the topic is set, there is
any substantial possibility that it will lead to a
classified thesis or dissertation;
(b) No classified thesis or dissertation should be ac
cepted as the basis for a degree unless, in the judg
ment of the Committee on the Graduate Division,
the imposition of classification could not reasonably
have been foreseen until the work was so far ad
vanced that modification of the thesis topic would
have resulted in substantial inequity to the student;
Scholarly activities not accessible for scrutiny by
the entire Advisory Board should not be considered
in connection with appointments, reappointments or
promotions;
(d) The University should enter no contract and accept
no grant that involves the collection of social or be
havioral data in a foreign country and requires the
security clearance of any person involved in the
oroiect:
(e ) Ihe University should enter no contract and accept
no grant to carry out research under circumstances
that restrain the freedom of the University to dis
close (1) the existence of the contract or grant or
(2) the general nature of the inquiry to be con
ducted or (3) the identity of the outside contracting
or granting entity; Provided, that clause (3) shall
not apply either (a) to anonymous gifts or grants
that do not call for the performance of specified
lines of inquiry, or (b) to research grants or con
tracts from individuals or non-governmental en
tities who request anonymity out of a justifiable
motivation to protect individual privacy.
In the case of the majority of proposals which do not in
volve classification, slightly in excess of one half of the pro
posals which are approved and forwarded to government
and non-government potential sponsors result in awards,
through the University, to the principal faculty investigator
to undertake and carry out the project proposed. When a
proposal is accepted for sponsorship, usually following spon
sor screening for quality and importance of the work pro
posed (within the limits of the funds that are available to
support such projects), the foundation or agency concerned
then contacts the University and a grant or contract is ne
gotiated. Any changes in the proposal as submitted which
are requested by the sponsor are then reviewed by the prin
cipal investigator and the Research Administrator's office as
to acceptability and an award is not accepted by the Uni
versity in which any such differences cannot be satisfactorily

Subject: Sponsored Research at Stanford
The paper on "Research at Stanford" issued this week describes the policies that
have been pursued at Stanford for a number of years in regard to sponsored re
search activities. Though this paper contains no new information, it does bring
together in one document a number of policies, all of which relate to the University's
research program. The paper has been reviewed by the President, the Research Ad
ministrator and by us.
RESEARCH AT STANFORD

The purpose of this paper is to describe the basis upon which
, research, education and training projects carried on with
outside support are approved and conducted at Stanford.
All sponsored projects which are undertaken at Stanford
with external financial support begin with faculty initiative.
That is to say, sponsored projects are not undertaken at the
request of an outside agency. When a. faculty member wishes
to undertake an externally sponsored project, he prepares a
proposal setting forth the nature of the problem to be studied
(e.g., a research project in the synthesis of alkaloids, or an
educational project to train students in a foreign language),
explains the significance of what it is that he proposes to
undertake, and gives a general description of how he proposes
to conduct the program. 1 his includes a description of the
j, facilities to be used and the significance of the work to be
undertaken, the University faculty and staff involved, the
duration of the project, and the sponsor oV sponsors for whom'
the proposal is intended. Also included in the proposal is an
estimate of the cost of the project, the amount of money re
quested from the potential sponsor and the amount of the
cost if anv to be borne bv the Universitv. The orooosal is then
submitted to the chairman of the faculty member's depart
ment who reviews and formally approves it. The approved
proposal then goes to the appropriate school Dean's office
where it is again reviewed and approved for academic pro
priety as a School project.
The approved proposal is then transmitted to the Research
Administrators office where it is again reviewed for Univer
sity approval against a list of guidelines provided by the Pro
vost. These guidelines are:
1. Academic Propriety
(a) Principal Investigator. Is the proposal submitted
by a Stanford faculty member or Senior Research
Associate as principal investigator?
Proposals for research, education and training
are directed by an Academic Council member or
Senior Research Associate as principal investiga
tor, except in highly unusual circumstances, and
then only with the Provost's approval.
{b) Educational Component. Does the proposal in
volve students? Research proposals include an
educational component usually through the train
ing and support of graduate students.
(c) Presence at Stanford. Does (he proposal require
faculty members to he away from the campus for
exte.idea periods of time? If so, what are the bene
fits accruing to Stanford and do they outweigh
tnis disadvantage?
(d) Faculty Time Involvement. Is the amount of ef
fort committed to the- research by each faculty
member consistent with his other academic du
tiesr
2. Commitments
(a) New Staff. Are commitments for the acquisition
of additional faculty or senior staff members con
sistent with school plans?
If the proposal requires additional staff which
w.l result in an eventual charge to the academic
budget, specific Provost's Office approval is re
quired.
(b) Space. Will the project require additional space?
If so, are requirements for additional space con
sistent with school plans in the sense that they are
a part of a construction program which has Presi
dent s Office approval or of a minor remodeling
nature for which funds have been approved?
(c) Cost Sharing (Federal Research Grants). Is the
listing of the University contribution which may
be included accurate, consistent with school plans
and budget, and in accord with the guidelines
issued by the Research Administrator's Office?

outside support are approved and conducted at Stanford.
All sponsored projects which are undertaken at Stanford
with external financial support begin with faculty initiative.
That is to say, sponsored projects are not undertaken at the
request of an outside agency. When a. faculty member wishes
to undertake an externally sponsored project, he prepares a
proposal setting forth the nature of the problem to be studied
(e.g., a research project in the synthesis of alkaloids, or an
educational project to train students in a foreign language),
explains the significance of what it is that he proposes to
undertake, and gives a general description of how he proposes
to conduct the program. 1 his includes a description of the
j, facilities to be used and the significance of the work to be
undertaken, the University faculty and staff involved, the
duration of the project, and the sponsor oV sponsors for whom'
the proposal is intended. Also included in the proposal is an
estimate of the cost of the project, the amount of money re
quested from the potential sponsor and the amount of the
cost if anv to be borne bv the Universitv. The orooosal is then
submitted to the chairman of the faculty member's depart
ment who reviews and formally approves it. The approved
proposal then goes to the appropriate school Dean's office
where it is again reviewed and approved for academic pro
priety as a School project.
The approved proposal is then transmitted to the Research
Administrators office where it is again reviewed for Univer
sity approval against a list of guidelines provided by the Pro
vost. These guidelines are:
1. Academic Propriety
(a) Principal Investigator. Is the proposal submitted
by a Stanford faculty member or Senior Research
Associate as principal investigator?
Proposals for research, education and training
are directed by an Academic Council member or
Senior Research Associate as principal investiga
tor, except in highly unusual circumstances, and
then only with the Provost's approval.
{b) Educational Component. Does the proposal in
volve students? Research proposals include an
educational component usually through the train
ing and support of graduate students.
(c) Presence at Stanford. Does (he proposal require
faculty members to he away from the campus for
exte.idea periods of time? If so, what are the bene
fits accruing to Stanford and do they outweigh
tnis disadvantage?
(d) Faculty Time Involvement. Is the amount of ef
fort committed to the- research by each faculty
member consistent with his other academic du
tiesr
2. Commitments
(a) New Staff. Are commitments for the acquisition
of additional faculty or senior staff members con
sistent with school plans?
If the proposal requires additional staff which
w.l result in an eventual charge to the academic
budget, specific Provost's Office approval is re
quired.
(b) Space. Will the project require additional space?
If so, are requirements for additional space con
sistent with school plans in the sense that they are
a part of a construction program which has Presi
dent s Office approval or of a minor remodeling
nature for which funds have been approved?
(c) Cost Sharing (Federal Research Grants). Is the
listing of the University contribution which may
be included accurate, consistent with school plans
and budget, and in accord with the guidelines
issued by the Research Administrator's Office?

Exceptions in the review of a proposal on any of the above
points are referred back to the school or department as ap

criteria which the school recommends are referred to the
Provost for his review and approval before the proposal is

In the past year, the University faculty has submitted
through this mechanism some 1,250 proposals to some 90
different foundations and government agencies for sponsor
ship.
One category of proposals for research and educational
grants and contracts receives an additional review: proposals
to undertake research which may involve classification of the
contract or grant if the potential sponsor elects to make an
award. It should be noted that of the 1,250 proposals sub
mitted in the last twelve months, 20 involved the possibility
of classification and of those sixteen resulted in awards. In
cases where the Principal Investigator has reason to believe
that the work he is proposing will involve the likelihood that
some part of it will be classified, the proposal, after it is re
viewed in the manner described above, is referred to the Sub
committee on Classified Contracts-of the faculty Committee
on Research Policy.
The Committer .was created in June of 1966 as a standing
committee of the Academic Council to review research pol-.
icy in general and to review in detail and in depth the ques-i
ti°n of the propriety of classified research in a university set
ting. From the Committee's extensive deliberations emerged
a set of rules, subsequently approved by vote of the Academic
Council, that arc applied by the Subcommittee in its review
of each such proposal. The method used by the Subcommittee
to conduct the review is to circulate the proposal in question
to the members for reading in advance of the meeting at
which it is to be taken up, and then to invite to the meeting
the faculty member initiating the proposal so that he may
discuss the proposal and the work to be performed. Under
the Committee's definition, a proposal is considered to be
classified if any one researcher to work on the project requires
security clearance from the federal government. All proposals
which appear before the Committee are reviewed in accord
with the following general rules:
(a) No research on a thesis or dissertation should be
undertaken if, at the time the topic is set, there is
any substantial possibility that it will lead to a
classified thesis or dissertation;
(b) No classified thesis or dissertation should be ac
cepted as the basis for a degree unless, in the judg
ment of the Committee on the Graduate Division,
the imposition of classification could not reasonably
have been foreseen until the work was so far ad
vanced that modification of the thesis topic would
have resulted in substantial inequity to the student;
Scholarly activities not accessible for scrutiny by
the entire Advisory Board should not be considered
in connection with appointments, reappointments or
promotions;
(d) The University should enter no contract and accept
no grant that involves the collection of social or be
havioral data in a foreign country and requires the
security clearance of any person involved in the
oroiect:
(e ) Ihe University should enter no contract and accept
no grant to carry out research under circumstances
that restrain the freedom of the University to dis
close (1) the existence of the contract or grant or
(2) the general nature of the inquiry to be con
ducted or (3) the identity of the outside contracting
or granting entity; Provided, that clause (3) shall
not apply either (a) to anonymous gifts or grants
that do not call for the performance of specified
lines of inquiry, or (b) to research grants or con
tracts from individuals or non-governmental en
tities who request anonymity out of a justifiable
motivation to protect individual privacy.
In the case of the majority of proposals which do not in
volve classification, slightly in excess of one half of the pro
posals which are approved and forwarded to government
and non-government potential sponsors result in awards,
through the University, to the principal faculty investigator
to undertake and carry out the project proposed. When a
proposal is accepted for sponsorship, usually following spon
sor screening for quality and importance of the work pro
posed (within the limits of the funds that are available to
support such projects), the foundation or agency concerned
then contacts the University and a grant or contract is ne
gotiated. Any changes in the proposal as submitted which
are requested by the sponsor are then reviewed by the prin
cipal investigator and the Research Administrator's office as
to acceptability and an award is not accepted by the Uni
versity in which any such differences cannot be satisfactorily
resolved.
