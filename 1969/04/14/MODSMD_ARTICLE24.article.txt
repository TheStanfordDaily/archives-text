14 Classified Research Projects,
Financial Reports Filed in Library
The University has filed in the Meyer undergraduate li
brary a pamphlet containing information on the 14 classified
research contracts on which work is being conducted at Stan
ford, the 1967-68 financial report on all sponsored projects,
and the annual University financial report for the year end
ed August 31, 1968.
The classified research pamphlet includes the title of the
project, the contract number, the sponsor, the school or de
partment engaging in the research, the principal investiga
tor, approximate annual funding, and a brief description of
the objectives, type work being done, and the reason the
work is regarded as classified.
It is the responsibility of the Committee on Research Pol
icy to keep the list of projects up to date by withdrawing
those which have expired and adding new ones. Because of
this, 14 projects are filed instead of the originally announced
16.
The Sponsored Projects Report includes current data and
10-year comparative summaries by school or laboratory, by
contract, grant, and government agency.
The 323-page annual financial report contains detailed in
formation on sources of income and operating expenditures
for instruction, research, libraries, and institutes, student aid
and services, physical plant, administration, and auxiliary
activities. The latter covers such things as student residence
halls and Stanford clinics.
Income and expenditures for the Stanford Linear Accel
erator Center are given, but independent and affiliated or
ganizations, such as the Bookstore and Stanford Research
Institute, are not included.
The projects in the classified research document generally
fall into one of three categories:
1. Research that itself has no classified aspects but is af
fected by a non-Stanford project which involves classified
information (such as a launch date of a moon probe).
2. Security clearance for some Stanford personnel is neces
sary so they may have access to research in a classified field.
The results of this type work might not be classified, but
without access to classified material, the specific project
could not be clone.
3. Projects that might produce some results which may
themselves be classified or may generally be used by others
in connection with classified work.
'Classified' Explanation
"In a substantial portion of the 'classified' projects at the
University, it is necessary that someone hold a clearance only
for purposes very tangential to the research involved," the
Committee on Research Policy points out in the foreword
to the classified research pamphlet.
The foreword also explains:
"Stanford University has long followed the practice of
making available to any interested member of the University
community the type of information regarding 'classified' con
tracts that is contained in this pamphlet. Indeed, since 1967,
there has been in effect a general regulation that, The Uni
versity should enter no contract and accept no grant to carry
out research under circumstances that restrain the freedom
of the University to disclose (1) the existence of the con
tract or grant or (2) the general nature of the inquiry to be
conducted or (3) the identity of the outside contracting or
granting entity .. •
"Hence, preparation of this pamphlet represents an at
tempt to make more easily available to the University com
munity information that has long been available to any mem
ber of that»comnumity who was sufficiently interested to in
quire; it represents no change in basic policy."

14 Classified Research Projects,
Financial Reports Filed in Library
The University has filed in the Meyer undergraduate li
brary a pamphlet containing information on the 14 classified
research contracts on which work is being conducted at Stan
ford, the 1967-68 financial report on all sponsored projects,
and the annual University financial report for the year end
ed August 31, 1968.
The classified research pamphlet includes the title of the
project, the contract number, the sponsor, the school or de
partment engaging in the research, the principal investiga
tor, approximate annual funding, and a brief description of
the objectives, type work being done, and the reason the
work is regarded as classified.
It is the responsibility of the Committee on Research Pol
icy to keep the list of projects up to date by withdrawing
those which have expired and adding new ones. Because of
this, 14 projects are filed instead of the originally announced
16.
The Sponsored Projects Report includes current data and
10-year comparative summaries by school or laboratory, by
contract, grant, and government agency.
The 323-page annual financial report contains detailed in
formation on sources of income and operating expenditures
for instruction, research, libraries, and institutes, student aid
and services, physical plant, administration, and auxiliary
activities. The latter covers such things as student residence
halls and Stanford clinics.
Income and expenditures for the Stanford Linear Accel
erator Center are given, but independent and affiliated or
ganizations, such as the Bookstore and Stanford Research
Institute, are not included.
The projects in the classified research document generally
fall into one of three categories:
1. Research that itself has no classified aspects but is af
fected by a non-Stanford project which involves classified
information (such as a launch date of a moon probe).
2. Security clearance for some Stanford personnel is neces
sary so they may have access to research in a classified field.
The results of this type work might not be classified, but
without access to classified material, the specific project
could not be clone.
3. Projects that might produce some results which may
themselves be classified or may generally be used by others
in connection with classified work.
'Classified' Explanation
"In a substantial portion of the 'classified' projects at the
University, it is necessary that someone hold a clearance only
for purposes very tangential to the research involved," the
Committee on Research Policy points out in the foreword
to the classified research pamphlet.
The foreword also explains:
"Stanford University has long followed the practice of
making available to any interested member of the University
community the type of information regarding 'classified' con
tracts that is contained in this pamphlet. Indeed, since 1967,
there has been in effect a general regulation that, The Uni
versity should enter no contract and accept no grant to carry
out research under circumstances that restrain the freedom
of the University to disclose (1) the existence of the con
tract or grant or (2) the general nature of the inquiry to be
conducted or (3) the identity of the outside contracting or
granting entity .. •
"Hence, preparation of this pamphlet represents an at
tempt to make more easily available to the University com
munity information that has long been available to any mem
ber of that»comnumity who was sufficiently interested to in
quire; it represents no change in basic policy."

14 Classified Research Projects,
Financial Reports Filed in Library
The University has filed in the Meyer undergraduate li
brary a pamphlet containing information on the 14 classified
research contracts on which work is being conducted at Stan
ford, the 1967-68 financial report on all sponsored projects,
and the annual University financial report for the year end
ed August 31, 1968.
The classified research pamphlet includes the title of the
project, the contract number, the sponsor, the school or de
partment engaging in the research, the principal investiga
tor, approximate annual funding, and a brief description of
the objectives, type work being done, and the reason the
work is regarded as classified.
It is the responsibility of the Committee on Research Pol
icy to keep the list of projects up to date by withdrawing
those which have expired and adding new ones. Because of
this, 14 projects are filed instead of the originally announced
16.
The Sponsored Projects Report includes current data and
10-year comparative summaries by school or laboratory, by
contract, grant, and government agency.
The 323-page annual financial report contains detailed in
formation on sources of income and operating expenditures
for instruction, research, libraries, and institutes, student aid
and services, physical plant, administration, and auxiliary
activities. The latter covers such things as student residence
halls and Stanford clinics.
Income and expenditures for the Stanford Linear Accel
erator Center are given, but independent and affiliated or
ganizations, such as the Bookstore and Stanford Research
Institute, are not included.
The projects in the classified research document generally
fall into one of three categories:
1. Research that itself has no classified aspects but is af
fected by a non-Stanford project which involves classified
information (such as a launch date of a moon probe).
2. Security clearance for some Stanford personnel is neces
sary so they may have access to research in a classified field.
The results of this type work might not be classified, but
without access to classified material, the specific project
could not be clone.
3. Projects that might produce some results which may
themselves be classified or may generally be used by others
in connection with classified work.
'Classified' Explanation
"In a substantial portion of the 'classified' projects at the
University, it is necessary that someone hold a clearance only
for purposes very tangential to the research involved," the
Committee on Research Policy points out in the foreword
to the classified research pamphlet.
The foreword also explains:
"Stanford University has long followed the practice of
making available to any interested member of the University
community the type of information regarding 'classified' con
tracts that is contained in this pamphlet. Indeed, since 1967,
there has been in effect a general regulation that, The Uni
versity should enter no contract and accept no grant to carry
out research under circumstances that restrain the freedom
of the University to disclose (1) the existence of the con
tract or grant or (2) the general nature of the inquiry to be
conducted or (3) the identity of the outside contracting or
granting entity .. •
"Hence, preparation of this pamphlet represents an at
tempt to make more easily available to the University com
munity information that has long been available to any mem
ber of that»comnumity who was sufficiently interested to in
quire; it represents no change in basic policy."

14 Classified Research Projects,
Financial Reports Filed in Library
The University has filed in the Meyer undergraduate li
brary a pamphlet containing information on the 14 classified
research contracts on which work is being conducted at Stan
ford, the 1967-68 financial report on all sponsored projects,
and the annual University financial report for the year end
ed August 31, 1968.
The classified research pamphlet includes the title of the
project, the contract number, the sponsor, the school or de
partment engaging in the research, the principal investiga
tor, approximate annual funding, and a brief description of
the objectives, type work being done, and the reason the
work is regarded as classified.
It is the responsibility of the Committee on Research Pol
icy to keep the list of projects up to date by withdrawing
those which have expired and adding new ones. Because of
this, 14 projects are filed instead of the originally announced
16.
The Sponsored Projects Report includes current data and
10-year comparative summaries by school or laboratory, by
contract, grant, and government agency.
The 323-page annual financial report contains detailed in
formation on sources of income and operating expenditures
for instruction, research, libraries, and institutes, student aid
and services, physical plant, administration, and auxiliary
activities. The latter covers such things as student residence
halls and Stanford clinics.
Income and expenditures for the Stanford Linear Accel
erator Center are given, but independent and affiliated or
ganizations, such as the Bookstore and Stanford Research
Institute, are not included.
The projects in the classified research document generally
fall into one of three categories:
1. Research that itself has no classified aspects but is af
fected by a non-Stanford project which involves classified
information (such as a launch date of a moon probe).
2. Security clearance for some Stanford personnel is neces
sary so they may have access to research in a classified field.
The results of this type work might not be classified, but
without access to classified material, the specific project
could not be clone.
3. Projects that might produce some results which may
themselves be classified or may generally be used by others
in connection with classified work.
'Classified' Explanation
"In a substantial portion of the 'classified' projects at the
University, it is necessary that someone hold a clearance only
for purposes very tangential to the research involved," the
Committee on Research Policy points out in the foreword
to the classified research pamphlet.
The foreword also explains:
"Stanford University has long followed the practice of
making available to any interested member of the University
community the type of information regarding 'classified' con
tracts that is contained in this pamphlet. Indeed, since 1967,
there has been in effect a general regulation that, The Uni
versity should enter no contract and accept no grant to carry
out research under circumstances that restrain the freedom
of the University to disclose (1) the existence of the con
tract or grant or (2) the general nature of the inquiry to be
conducted or (3) the identity of the outside contracting or
granting entity .. •
"Hence, preparation of this pamphlet represents an at
tempt to make more easily available to the University com
munity information that has long been available to any mem
ber of that»comnumity who was sufficiently interested to in
quire; it represents no change in basic policy."

14 Classified Research Projects,
Financial Reports Filed in Library
The University has filed in the Meyer undergraduate li
brary a pamphlet containing information on the 14 classified
research contracts on which work is being conducted at Stan
ford, the 1967-68 financial report on all sponsored projects,
and the annual University financial report for the year end
ed August 31, 1968.
The classified research pamphlet includes the title of the
project, the contract number, the sponsor, the school or de
partment engaging in the research, the principal investiga
tor, approximate annual funding, and a brief description of
the objectives, type work being done, and the reason the
work is regarded as classified.
It is the responsibility of the Committee on Research Pol
icy to keep the list of projects up to date by withdrawing
those which have expired and adding new ones. Because of
this, 14 projects are filed instead of the originally announced
16.
The Sponsored Projects Report includes current data and
10-year comparative summaries by school or laboratory, by
contract, grant, and government agency.
The 323-page annual financial report contains detailed in
formation on sources of income and operating expenditures
for instruction, research, libraries, and institutes, student aid
and services, physical plant, administration, and auxiliary
activities. The latter covers such things as student residence
halls and Stanford clinics.
Income and expenditures for the Stanford Linear Accel
erator Center are given, but independent and affiliated or
ganizations, such as the Bookstore and Stanford Research
Institute, are not included.
The projects in the classified research document generally
fall into one of three categories:
1. Research that itself has no classified aspects but is af
fected by a non-Stanford project which involves classified
information (such as a launch date of a moon probe).
2. Security clearance for some Stanford personnel is neces
sary so they may have access to research in a classified field.
The results of this type work might not be classified, but
without access to classified material, the specific project
could not be clone.
3. Projects that might produce some results which may
themselves be classified or may generally be used by others
in connection with classified work.
'Classified' Explanation
"In a substantial portion of the 'classified' projects at the
University, it is necessary that someone hold a clearance only
for purposes very tangential to the research involved," the
Committee on Research Policy points out in the foreword
to the classified research pamphlet.
The foreword also explains:
"Stanford University has long followed the practice of
making available to any interested member of the University
community the type of information regarding 'classified' con
tracts that is contained in this pamphlet. Indeed, since 1967,
there has been in effect a general regulation that, The Uni
versity should enter no contract and accept no grant to carry
out research under circumstances that restrain the freedom
of the University to disclose (1) the existence of the con
tract or grant or (2) the general nature of the inquiry to be
conducted or (3) the identity of the outside contracting or
granting entity .. •
"Hence, preparation of this pamphlet represents an at
tempt to make more easily available to the University com
munity information that has long been available to any mem
ber of that»comnumity who was sufficiently interested to in
quire; it represents no change in basic policy."
List of Projects
Following are the projects listed, and, in order, arc title,
