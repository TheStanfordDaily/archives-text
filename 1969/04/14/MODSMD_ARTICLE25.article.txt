New Priorities
The problems facing the world
are awesome. • In our own
community we can see the effects
of racism, environmental
pollution, destruction of our
national resources, and an
uncontrolled growth of
population. There are no easy
solutions to them, and the old
priorities of national defense are
draining away those very energies
which we need so desperately. We
are indeed burning the candle at
both ends. The results of
proceeding in the present
directions at an ever increasing
pace should be obvious to all
members of the community. And
yet many of the more esteemed
members of our community are
still saying, "But the patient
doesn't look sick, and anyway we
have been treating him. What right
do you have to question our
diagnosis?" It would appear that
the time has come to seek a new
physician and a new set of
priorities.
Student Responsibility
"You face a set of decisions
which are really symbolic of a
major national and international
crisis."
This statement by Dr. Kenneth
Pitzer to the Stanford Board of
Trustees is equally applicable to
every student, faculty, and staff
member on this campus. The
responsibility for our lives, our
future, and our University cannot
be delegated to a wise set of
oligarchs. This is a democracy and
ultimately every individual must
make his own decision. The
students at the AEL have made
their decision. They are described
as "a small percentage of the
Stanford student body." But, in
effect, they are speaking for all
students.
We feel that every student has
a choice to make at this time.
Their alternatives are basically
two. He (or she) can seriously
evaluate the problems we face,
and speak out in an attempt to
find a solution. Or he can
continue to pretend that these
problems do not concern him or
his future. As ASSU co-presidents
we will encourage every individual
to make up his own mind by the
rational process which is
fundamental to a University. But
ignoring the basic rights of a
democracy by remaining silent
and unconcerned is, at this time,
the height of irresponsibility. A
"silent majority" gives up any
claim to the future.
Cory
Eckhard and I envision student
government as a force pushing for
greater university participation in
public affairs. We propose the
establishment of a Department of
Urban and Environmental Studies,
which would take an

interdisciplinary approach to the
solutions of the major problems
confronting urban areas, such as
transportation, pollution and
housing. Under this department
one could not only bring in the
talents and resources of a variety
of departments, but also establish
individual programs whereby
students would be able to receive
academic credit for research and
field work in communities and
urban areas.
The creating of this department
should be only the first of many
steps taken to reorient education
and research at Stanford in order
to increase the relevance of both
the university to society and of
education to the individual. For
example, this department should
be encouraged to draw heavily on
the ample research facilities of
SRI. Urban problems currently
form a significant portion of the
Institute's research activities. By
expanding these efforts SRI could
better serve the vital interests of
the community and the students.
Regarding SRI and the
University, we have been told that
the negotiations process cannot
aid the implementation of these
needed changes. It is disturbing to
hear this verdict rendered on the
eve of a long-awaited
student-faculty report on the
future of SRI.
Tomorrow this report will be
issued to the entire Stanford
community. Two days later the
Academic Senate will meet in
urgent deliberation over the new
proposals. By the end of the week
every student and faculty member
will receive by mail a detailed
ballot concerning CBW, SRI and
related questions pertinent to
research and the university. This
schedule represents the
culmination of months of effort
by concerned students, faculty
and members of the
administration. To dismiss
negotiations as inevitably
non-productive is to frustrate the
efforts of these individuals, to
fragment our support, and
ultimately, to jeopardize the goals
for which we all share a common
concern.
While these issues are of great
interest to the Stanford
community, we hope that their
importance does not obscure
other problems that are relevant
to education at Stanford.
In the past year we have
witnessed an erosion of
governmental responsibility, in
which the open forum of student
government has been replaced by
an elite group which recognizes
the legitimacy of majority student
opinion only when it conforms to
their pre-conceived notions. We
feel strongly that government
should fulfill a representative
function, and to that end we offer
leadership that adheres to
democratic principles.
An additional problem is that
the great diversity of opinion on
campus has not been adequately
reflected by the Daily's editorial
and news coverage. We cannot
expect one journal to represent all
interests and points of view, so we
therefore subsidizing a
variety of other newsletters to
give balanced coverage to such
divergent groups as the BSU, the
I-Center and the YR's. To further
encourage the expression of
varying opinions we believe that
any individual, not only those
belonging to organizations, should
have the right to express his
opinion and address rallies in
White Plaza.

Finally, we recognize the
severe and inexcusable housing
shortage. We will undertake all
necessary steps to obtain more
and better housing for both
graduate and undergraduate
students.
Stanford
31
1. Our first reason for running
is to institute participatory
democracy at the top, with 31
Presidents to rotate DAILY.
2. Secondly, most other
candidates who may consider
themselves major campus
personalities with much to lose or

gain, have failed, or feared to take
concrete stands on the issues.
Being "jokers in the pack"
however, we can take clear and
concrete stands in our Platform,
for whatever constructive value it
may have.
Platform
1. THE ASSU SHOULD NOT
BE IMPOSED INVOLUNTARILY
ON STUDENTS; it must become
voluntary, like the GRADUATE
STUDENT ASSOCIATION. It is
only in this context that it will be
an independent spokesman for
students. The administration need
not retain petty student officers
to administrate petty tasks for
them.
2. Until such a transformation
(1) WE SUPPORT THE HAYES
CONSTITUTION WITHOUT
RESERVATIONS. The unspoken
"reservations" of other candidates
may be dealt with later. Now, the
HAYES CONSTITUTION must
be accepted so that ASSU will not
be strangled by LASSU.
3. To create a greater sense of
community, and provide

recreation, we support
construction of a LOUIS AGAZZI
GLACIER MEMORIAL PARK
ON FRENCHMAN'S HILL WITH
CAMPSITES.
4. 500-1 000 BLACK,
BROWN, AND INDIAN, AND
OTHER MINORITIES,
ENROLLED IN STANFORD as
soon as possible, is not too much
to ask of this university. We must
not lay down our moral burdens
when the present goal of 350 is
reached.
Furthermore: WE SUPPORT
ALL 11 BSU DEMANDS, with
the exception of the first (Which
demands dismissal of Dr. Koff).
Furthermore: WE BELIEVE
THAT THE ASSU SHOULD
ACTIVELY TAKE PART IN
INTENSIVE RECRUITMENT OF
SAID MINORITY STUDENTS.
5. THERE MUST BE 16
HOURS OF DAYLIGHT.
6. SRI MUST BE SEVERED,
FROM THE GOVERNMENT,
NOT FROM STANFORD
CHEMICAL ANDBIOLOGICAL
WARFARE, AND ALL
, DEFENSE CONTRACTS
MILITATE (LITERALLY)
AGAINST THE ACADEMIC
" SPIRIT OF A UNIVERSITY.
Defense, and political research
should be done by the
government itself, where it may
be politically opposed (as in the
ABM crisis).
7. ROTC SHOULD NOT BE
ACCREDITED; HOWEVER THE
ROTC PROGRAM SHOULD BE
ALLOWED TO CONTINUE ON
CAMPUS, AS THE COLLEGE
EDUCATED OFFICERS IT
SUPPLIES ARE ONE OF THE
FEW MODERATING FORCES
ON OUR MILITARY.
8. THE ASSU SHOULD
ESTABLISH A RENT CONTROL
BOARD to thoroughly investigate
the practices of landlords in
surrounding communities, and
protect and warn off-campus
students against abuses.
9. THE ASSU SHOULD
ESTABLISH A COMPULSORY
COURSE REVIEW PROGRAM,
IN WHICH STUDENTS MUST
SUBMIT A PASS-NEUTRAL
FAIL MARK ON EACH
PROFESSOR, before receiving his
own quarter report.
10. WITH OUR ESTIMATED
93 YEARS OF EXPERIENCE,
THE PRUDENCE OF AGE, AND
EXUBERANCE OF YOUTH
WILL BE MIRACULOUSLY
COMBINED.
11. THE STANFORD DAILY
SHOULD BE PUT ON A
SUBSCRIPTION BASIS, and
made financially independent of
the student political apparatus, or
the election of editor should be
| campus wide.
12. The only stand we have on
VIOLENCE is that we have no
stand; but we might SITDOWN on
it.
13. NOR DO WE HAVE A
STAND ON THE SAN
FRANCISCO EARTHQUAKE
although we do not believe that
this puts our platform on shaky
grounds.
Laird
I'm sick and I'm tired of this
whole campaign!
Every one of the candidates,
including myself, has
demonstrated a profound
understanding of politics by
taking a flexible stand on every
issue while using every gimmick
available to prove how well
qualified we are to hold office.
We've spoken of "support" and
"non-support" while others have
acted, and in their action
proclaimed a higher sense of
, purpose and interest in this
University than any of us. In
short, we've compromised our
souls and sold our guts for your
support and your vote.
The sad thing is that I can say
this about not just one, or two, or
most, but of all the candidates.
The funny thing is that the office
we seek has proven always in the
past to be one of such limited
power and served only to bolster
the prestige of the individual who
has gained it. Some of us are
sincere in our desire to change
that, but so have others been and
they have been beaten. Here we
are, candidates who say nothing
after an office which means
nothing. Which of us are you to
support? Perhaps you realize that
the absurd conclusion of this
absurd race is that one of us is
going to stand before the public at
large as representative of
Stanford's student body. Like so
many decisions, you must choose
the least of the list of evils with
little or no evidence to support
your choice.
I could speak now of issues,
but I would simply be repeating in
differertt phrases the statements
and beliefs of the other candidates
and the community in general.
You know how I stand—I'm a
Stanford liberal, but I'm only a
. man.
What more can I say?
"Born into a gathering of
valuers, whose values enslave me, I
attempted to free myself. Freed
from values, without which I am
lost, I searched for meaning. I
imagined that I searched alone: I
was wrong. There has come a
moment of small understanding."
I'm sick and I'm tired of this
whole campaign!

Schedule of appearances for
ASSU Presidential and
Vice-Presidential candidates
Hughie MacDonald and Bobby
Wiesenberg: Hughie will scream at
lunch at a surprise location. Both
will hate in the form of apathy by

not showing up at appointments.
Hughie will speak on "Equal Hate
for All" at the noon White Plaza
rally.
Mattson
There is a great schism dividing
this unversity community into
two halves. One half believes that
changes in important issues must
be effected quickly through any
means of expression, legitimate or
otherwise. There is a second group
who react to this type of student
expression with an equal
conviction that change is only
necessary when effected through
the normal channels offered to
the members of this University. In
between these polarized sides, a
third group find themselves
sympathizing with the causes of
activist concern, but unable to
bring themselves to openly
support the tactics of pressure
politics. Student government has
done little to alleviate the
desperate situation we now find
ourselves in. There has been a void
of effective action by the student
government on the sensitive and
legitimate concerns of students at
this university. The results of this
inaction are the sit-ins of today
and last Spring.
No other candidates are
honestly speaking to the problem
of polarization of interest on this
campus. No other candidates are
offering imaginative and in-depth
programs that would attempt to
move us towards a reconciliation
of community. This cannot be
accomplished through vague
generalizations of what's wrong
with Stanford; they will not be
solved by barbeques on the Wilbur
Lawn or a Centrix telephone
system. They will not be solved
through enlarging the office of
presidency to four presidents.
Dave Harris and Peter Lyman did
not resign because the office .vas
too exhausting. They resigned
because the framework of student
government as it exists here is
insensitive and unresponsive to
creative programs proposed; it is
inoperative. Making a LASSU of
the presidency is not the answer.
We have approached the
problems and issues honestly. We
have offered constructive
programs already in operation at
other universities to help meet the
problems here. We hope to make
the student government
framework more operable by
reorganizing its cumbersome
legislative structure. Our proposals
for experimental dorms, an
Applied Research Institute Fall
Symposium, and a
Student-Fac ulty-Administration
Council offer an opportunity to
close the student schism and
provide the university with a
creative, powerful channel for
student expression through
student government. Although we
cannot elaborate on our proposals
in this limited space we invite
everyone to read our position
papers and see that we are
offering more than the usual spate
of generalizations.
Schneider
When those with conflicting
ideologies are unaware of the
middle ground which separates
them, the magnitude of their
differences seem irreconcilable,
and therefore, rather than
communicating in the spirit of
compromise, they speak only to
entrench themselves in their own
perspective. We need to reduce
this wasteful polarization by
involving more of those in the
middle of the political spectrum
in the affairs of the ASSU. Only
when the individual can identify
with those involved in the
decision-making process can he
relate to the decisions. This
applies not only to the neglected
middle, but also to the racial
minority students, whom
heretofore have had little, if no,
representation in student
government.
Most students are not
apathetic, but because they
cannot identify with student
government, they dismiss it as
being frivolous. The "left" has
played an inordinate role in
student government. And the
"right" in its response has
purported to speak for the silent
majority. We need to
de-emphasize the extremes by
involving more students from the
middle.
We need to involve minority
students in student government so
that not only can they seek to
improve the University by
working unilaterally with the
administration, but they can use
the "system" to their and our

advantage. In this way, the white
community would be more apt to
gain a better understanding of
their situation.
National and world problems
should be of the utmost concern
to us all. And as students, we have
a responsibility to effect social
and political change. But the first
commitment of a student body
officer is to the student and his
university - related interests and
needs. Through a more human
and relevant system of
communication with you, we feel
that we can best help you to meet
your needs while at Stanford.
Shea
The crucial task for students
now is maintaining the
momentum toward a powerful
student voice in education and the
affairs of the University. The
ASSU Presidency offers a
potential focal point for
strengthening and coordinating
the role of students in University
affairs. In the past, however, the
job has been too demanding for
one individual—two of the last
three incumbents have resigned.
The expectation of new student
demands and responsibilities
further emphasizes the need for a
stronger Executive Office.
We propose a Council of
Presidents: four individuals,
together responsible for
performing all the duties of the
ASSU Presidency. The Council
will meet daily; chairmanship of
the Council will rotate monthly
among the four. The chairman
will set the daily agenda, and will
exercise a tie-breaking vote.
A key strength of the Council
would be the specialized areas of
responsibility of each member.
Barry Askinas, President of the
Graduate Students Association
and a tutor in Otero, would be
concerned with the problems of
graduate students; he is presently
involved with the problem of
housing.
John Grube, former Assistant
Financial Manager for the ASSU
and a sponsor in Trancos, would
coordinate student activities
within the ASSU and organize the
publication of a student Course
Review.
Joyce Kobayashi, chairman of
the Biafran/Nigerian Relief Drive,
would work with the problems of
international students, such as
increasing interaction with
American students, organizing
courses taught by foreign
students, housing.
Pat Shea, currently a member
of the University Advisory
Committee, would work to
develop and improve
communication among students,
the faculty, the administration
and Trustees.
We are all members of the
Student Education Council and
have been actively participating in
the deliberations of the SES
recommendations. We regard
these deliberations as only a
beginning toward essential change
in education at Stanford.
Regarding our position with
respect to the demands of the
SRI-Coalition: we participated in
the April 9 SRI-Coalition meeting
and voted against the tactic of a
sit-in; we voted, however, for the
sit-in with a time limit. We have
since then participated in it to
varying degrees, feeling it most
important that the real issues of
concern not be lost in the
question of this particular tactic,
and that a point of inflexibility or
irreparable polarization not be
reached.
We find it a shame that only
illegitimate action has been
successful in opening up closed
channels of communication and
arousing campus-wide concern in
the issues.
We would work to achieve a
community where change can
occur long before confrontation
politics is the only recourse.
Pat Shea and John Grube will
appear on the ballot as candidates
for President and Vice-President,
respectively. If elected, they,
together with Barry Askinas and
Joyce Kobayashi, will assume the
responsibilities of the ASSU
Presidency.
Spiegel
Student government at
Stanford has failed because it has
put the cart before the horse—it
has made proposals and "urgent
requests" to the administration
without an independent power
base in the student body with
which to back up its requests.
Such a power base would consist
of a large group of students who
aio sufficiently concerned about a
particular problem to give
generously of their time and
ultimately to put themselves on
the line in support of what they
want done. Without this support
behind him, the ASSU president,
whether the competent and
hard-working Denis Hayes, or the
topless dancer who nearly beat
him, will remain an obscure and
somewhat comic figure, while the
really exciting and important
changes in the university will be
instigated by ad hoc groups such
as the SRI Coalition.
John Spiegel and Brad Cornell
are alone among the many ASSU

candidates in recognizing the need
for a student power base as a
prerequisite for effective student
government, and in proposing to
meet this need. We have outlined
how the president could inform,
organize, and mobilize students
around a particular issue through
articles in The Daily,
informational literature similar to
that of the SRI Coalition,
discussions in residences, and
open ASSU meetings. We seek at
once to inform and to be
informed by the student body,
and to develop a participatory
democracy where students make
individual commitments from
which emerges a collective
strength. We endorse the AEL
sit-in not only for the issue behind
it, but also as a confused and
often frustrated attempt to make
this collective strength felt.
Spiegel and Cornell propose to
use student power to bring about
fundamental change in the
university. We seek a radical
revision of Stanford's priorities—a
re-direction of resources to
teaching at the undergraduate
level, to campus housing, and to
educational innovation. Most
immediately, we seek a
re-direction of research away from
the development of weapons of
greater destruction to peaceful
and acutely needed projects. This
re-direction will not be achieved
through persuasion alone. The
pressure of a mobilized group of
concerned students is needed to
overcome the inertia and opposing
interests of Trustees, faculty, and
administration.
By the very nature of his
power base, the ASSU president
must be selective in what he
attempts beyond his role as a
persuasive lobbyist. We will work
for the implementation of the
April Third Coalition demands on
university research policy, and of
the SES proposals on
undergraduate education and
housing. To promise more is
either naive or misleading. To
promise anything without an
attempt to develop a student
power base offers nothing but a
perpetuation of the discredited
past tradition of Stanford student
government.
Wernick
Students have one political
function: to act as a power lobby!
Nobody listens unless you

howl. Capitalistic bourgeois
Stanford has not responded to
rational discussion through their
committees or any other means of
communication.
A new environment is to be
created if Allan and Larry are
elected. Allan Wernick and Larry
Gamble believe that students
should and will run this place, and
they will help the community
reach this goal. (Wernick and
Gamble don't want to run
Stanford—they want you to run
it.)
The sit-in at AEL is an example
of the student activism that Allan
and Larry support for this
university. Two things are very
important:
1. Students are acting on their
own initiative, doing what they
believe to be right, no matter
what the veiled threats from the
administration are . . .
2. Students are enjoying
themselves, and they now have
the chance to discuss the real
issues of our time outside of the
traditional structured classroom
situation . . .
SRI will not be stopped by
forming new committees to study
the problem—Sßl will be stopped
if we stop it by whatever means
necessary.
If Pitzer doesn't build new
housing, we will.
If trustees don't have open
meetings, we'll open them.
If courses we want aren't
taught, we will find someone to
teach them.
You can vote for a
committee-forming, issue-hiding
candidate (or half-assed multiple
candidate) and by doing so KISS
THE ESTABLISHMENT'S ASS.
You can vote for Wernick and
see something change-really
change.
Wernick is better qualified than
any other candidate—he has not,
and will not sit on any
committees, work for an impotent
though biased newspaper. Wernick
runs with no establishment
experience—he refuses to be
bound by assininity. He belongs
to no political organization.
Call him conservative .. . call
him radical . . . call him moderate
and you will be wrong, for he
cannot be limited—he is free, and
he will make you free. Free of the
bureaucratic nonsense other
candidates feed you, Wernick says
"Fuck that Shit." You will get
none of it from Wernick and
Gamble. Only Freedom!

I'm sick and I'm tired of this
whole campaign!
Every one of the candidates,
including myself, has
demonstrated a profound
understanding of politics by
taking a flexible stand on every
issue while using every gimmick
available to prove how well
qualified we are to hold office.
We've spoken of "support" and
"non-support" while others have
acted, and in their action
proclaimed a higher sense of
, purpose and interest in this
University than any of us. In
short, we've compromised our
souls and sold our guts for your
support and your vote.
The sad thing is that I can say
this about not just one, or two, or
most, but of all the candidates.
The funny thing is that the office
we seek has proven always in the
past to be one of such limited
power and served only to bolster
the prestige of the individual who
has gained it. Some of us are
sincere in our desire to change
that, but so have others been and
they have been beaten. Here we
are, candidates who say nothing
after an office which means
nothing. Which of us are you to
support? Perhaps you realize that
the absurd conclusion of this
absurd race is that one of us is
going to stand before the public at
large as representative of
Stanford's student body. Like so
many decisions, you must choose
the least of the list of evils with
little or no evidence to support
your choice.
I could speak now of issues,

You know how I stand—I'm a
Stanford liberal, but I'm only a

"Born into a gathering of

There is a great schism dividing
this unversity community into
two halves. One half believes that
changes in important issues must
be effected quickly through any
means of expression, legitimate or
otherwise. There is a second group
who react to this type of student
expression with an equal
conviction that change is only
necessary when effected through
the normal channels offered to
the members of this University. In
between these polarized sides, a
third group find themselves
sympathizing with the causes of
activist concern, but unable to
bring themselves to openly
support the tactics of pressure
politics. Student government has
done little to alleviate the
desperate situation we now find
ourselves in. There has been a void
of effective action by the student
government on the sensitive and
legitimate concerns of students at
this university. The results of this
inaction are the sit-ins of today
and last Spring.
No other candidates are
honestly speaking to the problem
of polarization of interest on this
campus. No other candidates are
offering imaginative and in-depth
programs that would attempt to
move us towards a reconciliation
of community. This cannot be
accomplished through vague
generalizations of what's wrong
with Stanford; they will not be
solved by barbeques on the Wilbur
Lawn or a Centrix telephone
system. They will not be solved
through enlarging the office of
presidency to four presidents.
Dave Harris and Peter Lyman did
not resign because the office .vas
too exhausting. They resigned
because the framework of student
government as it exists here is
insensitive and unresponsive to
creative programs proposed; it is
inoperative. Making a LASSU of
the presidency is not the answer.
We have approached the
problems and issues honestly. We
have offered constructive
programs already in operation at
other universities to help meet the
problems here. We hope to make
the student government
framework more operable by
reorganizing its cumbersome
legislative structure. Our proposals
for experimental dorms, an
Applied Research Institute Fall
Symposium, and a
Student-Fac ulty-Administration
Council offer an opportunity to
close the student schism and
provide the university with a
creative, powerful channel for
student expression through
student government. Although we
cannot elaborate on our proposals
in this limited space we invite
everyone to read our position
papers and see that we are
offering more than the usual spate
of generalizations.
Schneider
When those with conflicting
ideologies are unaware of the
middle ground which separates
them, the magnitude of their
differences seem irreconcilable,
and therefore, rather than
communicating in the spirit of
compromise, they speak only to
entrench themselves in their own
perspective. We need to reduce
this wasteful polarization by
involving more of those in the
middle of the political spectrum
in the affairs of the ASSU. Only
when the individual can identify
with those involved in the
decision-making process can he
relate to the decisions. This
applies not only to the neglected
middle, but also to the racial
minority students, whom
heretofore have had little, if no,
representation in student
government.
Most students are not
apathetic, but because they
cannot identify with student
government, they dismiss it as
being frivolous. The "left" has
played an inordinate role in
student government. And the
"right" in its response has
purported to speak for the silent
majority. We need to
de-emphasize the extremes by
involving more students from the
middle.
We need to involve minority
students in student government so
that not only can they seek to
improve the University by
working unilaterally with the
administration, but they can use
the "system" to their and our

advantage. In this way, the white
community would be more apt to
gain a better understanding of
their situation.
National and world problems
should be of the utmost concern
to us all. And as students, we have
a responsibility to effect social
and political change. But the first
commitment of a student body
officer is to the student and his
university - related interests and
needs. Through a more human
and relevant system of
communication with you, we feel
that we can best help you to meet
your needs while at Stanford.
Shea
The crucial task for students
now is maintaining the
momentum toward a powerful
student voice in education and the
affairs of the University. The
ASSU Presidency offers a
potential focal point for
strengthening and coordinating
the role of students in University
affairs. In the past, however, the
job has been too demanding for
one individual—two of the last
three incumbents have resigned.
The expectation of new student
demands and responsibilities
further emphasizes the need for a
stronger Executive Office.
We propose a Council of
Presidents: four individuals,
together responsible for
performing all the duties of the
ASSU Presidency. The Council
will meet daily; chairmanship of
the Council will rotate monthly
among the four. The chairman
will set the daily agenda, and will
exercise a tie-breaking vote.
A key strength of the Council
would be the specialized areas of
responsibility of each member.
Barry Askinas, President of the
Graduate Students Association
and a tutor in Otero, would be
concerned with the problems of
graduate students; he is presently
involved with the problem of
housing.
John Grube, former Assistant
Financial Manager for the ASSU
and a sponsor in Trancos, would
coordinate student activities
within the ASSU and organize the
publication of a student Course
Review.
Joyce Kobayashi, chairman of
the Biafran/Nigerian Relief Drive,
would work with the problems of
international students, such as
increasing interaction with
American students, organizing
courses taught by foreign
students, housing.
Pat Shea, currently a member
of the University Advisory
Committee, would work to
develop and improve
communication among students,
the faculty, the administration
and Trustees.
We are all members of the
Student Education Council and
have been actively participating in
the deliberations of the SES
recommendations. We regard
these deliberations as only a
beginning toward essential change
in education at Stanford.
Regarding our position with
respect to the demands of the
SRI-Coalition: we participated in
the April 9 SRI-Coalition meeting
and voted against the tactic of a
sit-in; we voted, however, for the
sit-in with a time limit. We have
since then participated in it to
varying degrees, feeling it most
important that the real issues of
concern not be lost in the
question of this particular tactic,
and that a point of inflexibility or
irreparable polarization not be
reached.
We find it a shame that only
illegitimate action has been
successful in opening up closed
channels of communication and
arousing campus-wide concern in
the issues.
We would work to achieve a
community where change can
occur long before confrontation
politics is the only recourse.
Pat Shea and John Grube will
appear on the ballot as candidates
for President and Vice-President,
respectively. If elected, they,
together with Barry Askinas and
Joyce Kobayashi, will assume the
responsibilities of the ASSU
Presidency.
Spiegel
Student government at
Stanford has failed because it has
put the cart before the horse—it
has made proposals and "urgent
requests" to the administration
without an independent power
base in the student body with
which to back up its requests.
Such a power base would consist
of a large group of students who
aio sufficiently concerned about a
particular problem to give
generously of their time and
ultimately to put themselves on
the line in support of what they
want done. Without this support
behind him, the ASSU president,
whether the competent and
hard-working Denis Hayes, or the
topless dancer who nearly beat
him, will remain an obscure and
somewhat comic figure, while the
really exciting and important
changes in the university will be
instigated by ad hoc groups such
as the SRI Coalition.
John Spiegel and Brad Cornell
are alone among the many ASSU

candidates in recognizing the need
for a student power base as a
prerequisite for effective student
government, and in proposing to
meet this need. We have outlined
how the president could inform,
organize, and mobilize students
around a particular issue through
articles in The Daily,
informational literature similar to
that of the SRI Coalition,
discussions in residences, and
open ASSU meetings. We seek at
once to inform and to be
informed by the student body,
and to develop a participatory
democracy where students make
individual commitments from
which emerges a collective
strength. We endorse the AEL
sit-in not only for the issue behind
it, but also as a confused and
often frustrated attempt to make
this collective strength felt.
Spiegel and Cornell propose to
use student power to bring about
fundamental change in the
university. We seek a radical
revision of Stanford's priorities—a
re-direction of resources to
teaching at the undergraduate
level, to campus housing, and to
educational innovation. Most
immediately, we seek a
re-direction of research away from
the development of weapons of
greater destruction to peaceful
and acutely needed projects. This
re-direction will not be achieved
through persuasion alone. The
pressure of a mobilized group of
concerned students is needed to
overcome the inertia and opposing
interests of Trustees, faculty, and
administration.
By the very nature of his
power base, the ASSU president
must be selective in what he
attempts beyond his role as a
persuasive lobbyist. We will work
for the implementation of the
April Third Coalition demands on
university research policy, and of
the SES proposals on
undergraduate education and
housing. To promise more is
either naive or misleading. To
promise anything without an
attempt to develop a student
power base offers nothing but a
perpetuation of the discredited
past tradition of Stanford student
government.
Wernick
Students have one political
function: to act as a power lobby!
Nobody listens unless you

howl. Capitalistic bourgeois
Stanford has not responded to
rational discussion through their
committees or any other means of
communication.
A new environment is to be
created if Allan and Larry are
elected. Allan Wernick and Larry
Gamble believe that students
should and will run this place, and
they will help the community
reach this goal. (Wernick and
Gamble don't want to run
Stanford—they want you to run
it.)
The sit-in at AEL is an example
of the student activism that Allan
and Larry support for this
university. Two things are very
important:
1. Students are acting on their
own initiative, doing what they
believe to be right, no matter
what the veiled threats from the
administration are . . .
2. Students are enjoying
themselves, and they now have
the chance to discuss the real
issues of our time outside of the
traditional structured classroom
situation . . .
SRI will not be stopped by
forming new committees to study
the problem—Sßl will be stopped
if we stop it by whatever means
necessary.
If Pitzer doesn't build new
housing, we will.
If trustees don't have open
meetings, we'll open them.
If courses we want aren't
taught, we will find someone to
teach them.
You can vote for a
committee-forming, issue-hiding
candidate (or half-assed multiple
candidate) and by doing so KISS
THE ESTABLISHMENT'S ASS.
You can vote for Wernick and
see something change-really
change.
Wernick is better qualified than
any other candidate—he has not,
and will not sit on any
committees, work for an impotent
though biased newspaper. Wernick
runs with no establishment
experience—he refuses to be
bound by assininity. He belongs
to no political organization.
Call him conservative .. . call
him radical . . . call him moderate
and you will be wrong, for he
cannot be limited—he is free, and
he will make you free. Free of the
bureaucratic nonsense other
candidates feed you, Wernick says
"Fuck that Shit." You will get
none of it from Wernick and
Gamble. Only Freedom!

New Priorities
The problems facing the world
are awesome. • In our own
community we can see the effects
of racism, environmental
pollution, destruction of our
national resources, and an
uncontrolled growth of
population. There are no easy
solutions to them, and the old
priorities of national defense are
draining away those very energies
which we need so desperately. We
are indeed burning the candle at
both ends. The results of
proceeding in the present
directions at an ever increasing
pace should be obvious to all
members of the community. And
yet many of the more esteemed
members of our community are
still saying, "But the patient
doesn't look sick, and anyway we
have been treating him. What right
do you have to question our
diagnosis?" It would appear that
the time has come to seek a new
physician and a new set of
priorities.
Student Responsibility
"You face a set of decisions
which are really symbolic of a
major national and international
crisis."
This statement by Dr. Kenneth
Pitzer to the Stanford Board of
Trustees is equally applicable to
every student, faculty, and staff
member on this campus. The
responsibility for our lives, our
future, and our University cannot
be delegated to a wise set of
oligarchs. This is a democracy and
ultimately every individual must
make his own decision. The
students at the AEL have made
their decision. They are described
as "a small percentage of the
Stanford student body." But, in
effect, they are speaking for all
students.
We feel that every student has
a choice to make at this time.
Their alternatives are basically
two. He (or she) can seriously
evaluate the problems we face,
and speak out in an attempt to
find a solution. Or he can
continue to pretend that these
problems do not concern him or
his future. As ASSU co-presidents
we will encourage every individual
to make up his own mind by the
rational process which is
fundamental to a University. But
ignoring the basic rights of a
democracy by remaining silent
and unconcerned is, at this time,
the height of irresponsibility. A
"silent majority" gives up any
claim to the future.
Cory
Eckhard and I envision student
government as a force pushing for
greater university participation in
public affairs. We propose the
establishment of a Department of
Urban and Environmental Studies,
which would take an

interdisciplinary approach to the
solutions of the major problems
confronting urban areas, such as
transportation, pollution and
housing. Under this department
one could not only bring in the
talents and resources of a variety
of departments, but also establish
individual programs whereby
students would be able to receive
academic credit for research and
field work in communities and
urban areas.
The creating of this department
should be only the first of many
steps taken to reorient education
and research at Stanford in order
to increase the relevance of both
the university to society and of
education to the individual. For
example, this department should
be encouraged to draw heavily on
the ample research facilities of
SRI. Urban problems currently
form a significant portion of the
Institute's research activities. By
expanding these efforts SRI could
better serve the vital interests of
the community and the students.
Regarding SRI and the
University, we have been told that
the negotiations process cannot
aid the implementation of these
needed changes. It is disturbing to
hear this verdict rendered on the
eve of a long-awaited
student-faculty report on the
future of SRI.
Tomorrow this report will be
issued to the entire Stanford
community. Two days later the
Academic Senate will meet in
urgent deliberation over the new
proposals. By the end of the week
every student and faculty member
will receive by mail a detailed
ballot concerning CBW, SRI and
related questions pertinent to
research and the university. This
schedule represents the
culmination of months of effort
by concerned students, faculty
and members of the
administration. To dismiss
negotiations as inevitably
non-productive is to frustrate the
efforts of these individuals, to
fragment our support, and
ultimately, to jeopardize the goals
for which we all share a common
concern.
While these issues are of great
interest to the Stanford
community, we hope that their
importance does not obscure
other problems that are relevant
to education at Stanford.
In the past year we have
witnessed an erosion of
governmental responsibility, in
which the open forum of student
government has been replaced by
an elite group which recognizes
the legitimacy of majority student
opinion only when it conforms to
their pre-conceived notions. We
feel strongly that government
should fulfill a representative
function, and to that end we offer
leadership that adheres to
democratic principles.
An additional problem is that
the great diversity of opinion on
campus has not been adequately
reflected by the Daily's editorial
and news coverage. We cannot
expect one journal to represent all
interests and points of view, so we
therefore subsidizing a
variety of other newsletters to
give balanced coverage to such
divergent groups as the BSU, the
I-Center and the YR's. To further
encourage the expression of
varying opinions we believe that
any individual, not only those
belonging to organizations, should
have the right to express his
opinion and address rallies in
White Plaza.

Finally, we recognize the
severe and inexcusable housing
shortage. We will undertake all
necessary steps to obtain more
and better housing for both
graduate and undergraduate
students.

31
1. Our first reason for running
is to institute participatory
democracy at the top, with 31
Presidents to rotate DAILY.
2. Secondly, most other
candidates who may consider
themselves major campus
personalities with much to lose or

gain, have failed, or feared to take
concrete stands on the issues.
Being "jokers in the pack"
however, we can take clear and
concrete stands in our Platform,
for whatever constructive value it
may have.
Platform
1. THE ASSU SHOULD NOT
BE IMPOSED INVOLUNTARILY
ON STUDENTS; it must become
voluntary, like the GRADUATE
STUDENT ASSOCIATION. It is
only in this context that it will be
an independent spokesman for
students. The administration need
not retain petty student officers
to administrate petty tasks for
them.
2. Until such a transformation
(1) WE SUPPORT THE HAYES
CONSTITUTION WITHOUT
RESERVATIONS. The unspoken
"reservations" of other candidates
may be dealt with later. Now, the
HAYES CONSTITUTION must
be accepted so that ASSU will not
be strangled by LASSU.
3. To create a greater sense of
community, and provide

recreation, we support
construction of a LOUIS AGAZZI
GLACIER MEMORIAL PARK
ON FRENCHMAN'S HILL WITH
CAMPSITES.
4. 500-1 000 BLACK,
BROWN, AND INDIAN, AND
OTHER MINORITIES,
ENROLLED IN STANFORD as
soon as possible, is not too much
to ask of this university. We must
not lay down our moral burdens
when the present goal of 350 is
reached.
Furthermore: WE SUPPORT
ALL 11 BSU DEMANDS, with
the exception of the first (Which
demands dismissal of Dr. Koff).
Furthermore: WE BELIEVE
THAT THE ASSU SHOULD
ACTIVELY TAKE PART IN
INTENSIVE RECRUITMENT OF

5. THERE MUST BE 16

6. SRI MUST BE SEVERED,

MILITATE (LITERALLY)
AGAINST THE ACADEMIC

Defense, and political research

government itself, where it may
be politically opposed (as in the
ABM crisis).
7. ROTC SHOULD NOT BE

8. THE ASSU SHOULD

9. THE ASSU SHOULD
ESTABLISH A COMPULSORY

10. WITH OUR ESTIMATED

de-emphasize the extremes by
involving more students from the

We need to involve minority
students in student government so
that not only can they seek to
improve the University by
working unilaterally with the
administration, but they can use
the "system" to their and our

advantage. In this way, the white
community would be more apt to
gain a better understanding of

National and world problems

The crucial task for students
now is maintaining the
momentum toward a powerful
student voice in education and the
affairs of the University. The
ASSU Presidency offers a
potential focal point for
strengthening and coordinating
the role of students in University
affairs. In the past, however, the
job has been too demanding for
one individual—two of the last
three incumbents have resigned.
The expectation of new student
demands and responsibilities
further emphasizes the need for a
stronger Executive Office.
We propose a Council of
Presidents: four individuals,
together responsible for
performing all the duties of the
ASSU Presidency. The Council
will meet daily; chairmanship of
the Council will rotate monthly
among the four. The chairman
will set the daily agenda, and will
exercise a tie-breaking vote.
A key strength of the Council
would be the specialized areas of
responsibility of each member.
Barry Askinas, President of the
Graduate Students Association
and a tutor in Otero, would be
concerned with the problems of
graduate students; he is presently
involved with the problem of
housing.
John Grube, former Assistant
Financial Manager for the ASSU
and a sponsor in Trancos, would
coordinate student activities
within the ASSU and organize the
publication of a student Course
Review.
Joyce Kobayashi, chairman of
the Biafran/Nigerian Relief Drive,
would work with the problems of
international students, such as
increasing interaction with
American students, organizing
courses taught by foreign
students, housing.
Pat Shea, currently a member
of the University Advisory
Committee, would work to
develop and improve
communication among students,
the faculty, the administration
and Trustees.
We are all members of the
Student Education Council and
have been actively participating in
the deliberations of the SES
recommendations. We regard
these deliberations as only a
beginning toward essential change
in education at Stanford.
Regarding our position with
respect to the demands of the
SRI-Coalition: we participated in
the April 9 SRI-Coalition meeting
and voted against the tactic of a
sit-in; we voted, however, for the
sit-in with a time limit. We have
since then participated in it to
varying degrees, feeling it most
important that the real issues of
concern not be lost in the
question of this particular tactic,
and that a point of inflexibility or
irreparable polarization not be
reached.
We find it a shame that only
illegitimate action has been
successful in opening up closed
channels of communication and
arousing campus-wide concern in
the issues.
We would work to achieve a
community where change can
occur long before confrontation
politics is the only recourse.
Pat Shea and John Grube will
appear on the ballot as candidates
for President and Vice-President,
respectively. If elected, they,
together with Barry Askinas and
Joyce Kobayashi, will assume the
responsibilities of the ASSU
Presidency.

Student government at
Stanford has failed because it has
put the cart before the horse—it
has made proposals and "urgent
requests" to the administration
without an independent power
base in the student body with
which to back up its requests.
Such a power base would consist
of a large group of students who
aio sufficiently concerned about a
particular problem to give
generously of their time and
ultimately to put themselves on
the line in support of what they
want done. Without this support
behind him, the ASSU president,
whether the competent and
hard-working Denis Hayes, or the
topless dancer who nearly beat
him, will remain an obscure and
somewhat comic figure, while the
really exciting and important
changes in the university will be
instigated by ad hoc groups such
as the SRI Coalition.
John Spiegel and Brad Cornell
are alone among the many ASSU

candidates in recognizing the need
for a student power base as a
prerequisite for effective student
government, and in proposing to
meet this need. We have outlined
how the president could inform,
organize, and mobilize students
around a particular issue through
articles in The Daily,
informational literature similar to
that of the SRI Coalition,
discussions in residences, and
open ASSU meetings. We seek at
once to inform and to be
informed by the student body,
and to develop a participatory
democracy where students make
individual commitments from
which emerges a collective
strength. We endorse the AEL
sit-in not only for the issue behind
it, but also as a confused and
often frustrated attempt to make
this collective strength felt.
Spiegel and Cornell propose to
use student power to bring about
fundamental change in the
university. We seek a radical
revision of Stanford's priorities—a
re-direction of resources to
teaching at the undergraduate
level, to campus housing, and to
educational innovation. Most
immediately, we seek a
re-direction of research away from
the development of weapons of
greater destruction to peaceful
and acutely needed projects. This
re-direction will not be achieved
through persuasion alone. The
pressure of a mobilized group of
concerned students is needed to
overcome the inertia and opposing
interests of Trustees, faculty, and
administration.
By the very nature of his
power base, the ASSU president
must be selective in what he
attempts beyond his role as a
persuasive lobbyist. We will work
for the implementation of the
April Third Coalition demands on
university research policy, and of
the SES proposals on
undergraduate education and
housing. To promise more is
either naive or misleading. To
promise anything without an
attempt to develop a student
power base offers nothing but a
perpetuation of the discredited
past tradition of Stanford student
government.
Wernick
Students have one political
function: to act as a power lobby!
Nobody listens unless you

howl. Capitalistic bourgeois
Stanford has not responded to
rational discussion through their
committees or any other means of
communication.
A new environment is to be
created if Allan and Larry are
elected. Allan Wernick and Larry
Gamble believe that students
should and will run this place, and
they will help the community
reach this goal. (Wernick and
Gamble don't want to run
Stanford—they want you to run
it.)
The sit-in at AEL is an example
of the student activism that Allan
and Larry support for this
university. Two things are very
important:
1. Students are acting on their
own initiative, doing what they
believe to be right, no matter
what the veiled threats from the
administration are . . .
2. Students are enjoying
themselves, and they now have
the chance to discuss the real
issues of our time outside of the
traditional structured classroom
situation . . .
SRI will not be stopped by
forming new committees to study
the problem—Sßl will be stopped
if we stop it by whatever means
necessary.
If Pitzer doesn't build new
housing, we will.
If trustees don't have open
meetings, we'll open them.
If courses we want aren't
taught, we will find someone to
teach them.
You can vote for a
committee-forming, issue-hiding
candidate (or half-assed multiple
candidate) and by doing so KISS
THE ESTABLISHMENT'S ASS.
You can vote for Wernick and
see something change-really
change.
Wernick is better qualified than
any other candidate—he has not,
and will not sit on any
committees, work for an impotent
though biased newspaper. Wernick
runs with no establishment
experience—he refuses to be
bound by assininity. He belongs
to no political organization.
Call him conservative .. . call
him radical . . . call him moderate
and you will be wrong, for he
cannot be limited—he is free, and
he will make you free. Free of the
bureaucratic nonsense other
candidates feed you, Wernick says
"Fuck that Shit." You will get
none of it from Wernick and
Gamble. Only Freedom!

New Priorities
The problems facing the world
are awesome. • In our own
community we can see the effects
of racism, environmental
pollution, destruction of our
national resources, and an
uncontrolled growth of
population. There are no easy
solutions to them, and the old
priorities of national defense are
draining away those very energies
which we need so desperately. We
are indeed burning the candle at
both ends. The results of
proceeding in the present
directions at an ever increasing
pace should be obvious to all
members of the community. And
yet many of the more esteemed
members of our community are
still saying, "But the patient
doesn't look sick, and anyway we
have been treating him. What right
do you have to question our
diagnosis?" It would appear that
the time has come to seek a new
physician and a new set of
priorities.
Student Responsibility
"You face a set of decisions
which are really symbolic of a
major national and international
crisis."
This statement by Dr. Kenneth
Pitzer to the Stanford Board of
Trustees is equally applicable to
every student, faculty, and staff
member on this campus. The
responsibility for our lives, our
future, and our University cannot
be delegated to a wise set of
oligarchs. This is a democracy and
ultimately every individual must
make his own decision. The
students at the AEL have made
their decision. They are described
as "a small percentage of the
Stanford student body." But, in
effect, they are speaking for all
students.
We feel that every student has
a choice to make at this time.
Their alternatives are basically
two. He (or she) can seriously
evaluate the problems we face,
and speak out in an attempt to
find a solution. Or he can
continue to pretend that these
problems do not concern him or
his future. As ASSU co-presidents
we will encourage every individual
to make up his own mind by the
rational process which is
fundamental to a University. But
ignoring the basic rights of a
democracy by remaining silent
and unconcerned is, at this time,
the height of irresponsibility. A
"silent majority" gives up any
claim to the future.
Cory
Eckhard and I envision student
government as a force pushing for
greater university participation in
public affairs. We propose the
establishment of a Department of
Urban and Environmental Studies,
which would take an

interdisciplinary approach to the
solutions of the major problems
confronting urban areas, such as
transportation, pollution and
housing. Under this department
one could not only bring in the
talents and resources of a variety
of departments, but also establish
individual programs whereby
students would be able to receive
academic credit for research and
field work in communities and
urban areas.
The creating of this department
should be only the first of many
steps taken to reorient education
and research at Stanford in order
to increase the relevance of both
the university to society and of
education to the individual. For
example, this department should
be encouraged to draw heavily on
the ample research facilities of
SRI. Urban problems currently
form a significant portion of the
Institute's research activities. By
expanding these efforts SRI could
better serve the vital interests of
the community and the students.
Regarding SRI and the
University, we have been told that
the negotiations process cannot
aid the implementation of these
needed changes. It is disturbing to
hear this verdict rendered on the
eve of a long-awaited
student-faculty report on the
future of SRI.
Tomorrow this report will be
issued to the entire Stanford
community. Two days later the
Academic Senate will meet in
urgent deliberation over the new
proposals. By the end of the week
every student and faculty member
will receive by mail a detailed
ballot concerning CBW, SRI and
related questions pertinent to
research and the university. This
schedule represents the
culmination of months of effort
by concerned students, faculty
and members of the
administration. To dismiss
negotiations as inevitably
non-productive is to frustrate the
efforts of these individuals, to
fragment our support, and
ultimately, to jeopardize the goals
for which we all share a common
concern.
While these issues are of great
interest to the Stanford
community, we hope that their
importance does not obscure
other problems that are relevant
to education at Stanford.
In the past year we have
witnessed an erosion of
governmental responsibility, in
which the open forum of student
government has been replaced by
an elite group which recognizes
the legitimacy of majority student
opinion only when it conforms to
their pre-conceived notions. We
feel strongly that government
should fulfill a representative
function, and to that end we offer
leadership that adheres to
democratic principles.
An additional problem is that
the great diversity of opinion on
campus has not been adequately
reflected by the Daily's editorial
and news coverage. We cannot
expect one journal to represent all
interests and points of view, so we
therefore subsidizing a
variety of other newsletters to
give balanced coverage to such
divergent groups as the BSU, the
I-Center and the YR's. To further
encourage the expression of
varying opinions we believe that
any individual, not only those
belonging to organizations, should
have the right to express his
opinion and address rallies in
White Plaza.

Finally, we recognize the
severe and inexcusable housing
shortage. We will undertake all
necessary steps to obtain more
and better housing for both
graduate and undergraduate
students.
Stanford
31
1. Our first reason for running
is to institute participatory
democracy at the top, with 31
Presidents to rotate DAILY.
2. Secondly, most other
candidates who may consider
themselves major campus
personalities with much to lose or

gain, have failed, or feared to take
concrete stands on the issues.
Being "jokers in the pack"
however, we can take clear and
concrete stands in our Platform,
for whatever constructive value it
may have.
Platform
1. THE ASSU SHOULD NOT
BE IMPOSED INVOLUNTARILY
ON STUDENTS; it must become
voluntary, like the GRADUATE
STUDENT ASSOCIATION. It is
only in this context that it will be
an independent spokesman for
students. The administration need
not retain petty student officers
to administrate petty tasks for
them.
2. Until such a transformation
(1) WE SUPPORT THE HAYES
CONSTITUTION WITHOUT
RESERVATIONS. The unspoken
"reservations" of other candidates
may be dealt with later. Now, the
HAYES CONSTITUTION must
be accepted so that ASSU will not
be strangled by LASSU.
3. To create a greater sense of
community, and provide

recreation, we support
construction of a LOUIS AGAZZI
GLACIER MEMORIAL PARK
ON FRENCHMAN'S HILL WITH
CAMPSITES.
4. 500-1 000 BLACK,
BROWN, AND INDIAN, AND
OTHER MINORITIES,
ENROLLED IN STANFORD as
soon as possible, is not too much
to ask of this university. We must
not lay down our moral burdens
when the present goal of 350 is
reached.
Furthermore: WE SUPPORT
ALL 11 BSU DEMANDS, with
the exception of the first (Which
demands dismissal of Dr. Koff).
Furthermore: WE BELIEVE
THAT THE ASSU SHOULD
ACTIVELY TAKE PART IN
INTENSIVE RECRUITMENT OF
SAID MINORITY STUDENTS.
5. THERE MUST BE 16
HOURS OF DAYLIGHT.
6. SRI MUST BE SEVERED,
FROM THE GOVERNMENT,
NOT FROM STANFORD
CHEMICAL ANDBIOLOGICAL
WARFARE, AND ALL
, DEFENSE CONTRACTS
MILITATE (LITERALLY)
AGAINST THE ACADEMIC
" SPIRIT OF A UNIVERSITY.
Defense, and political research
should be done by the
government itself, where it may
be politically opposed (as in the
ABM crisis).
7. ROTC SHOULD NOT BE
ACCREDITED; HOWEVER THE
ROTC PROGRAM SHOULD BE
ALLOWED TO CONTINUE ON
CAMPUS, AS THE COLLEGE
EDUCATED OFFICERS IT
SUPPLIES ARE ONE OF THE
FEW MODERATING FORCES
ON OUR MILITARY.
8. THE ASSU SHOULD
ESTABLISH A RENT CONTROL
BOARD to thoroughly investigate
the practices of landlords in
surrounding communities, and
protect and warn off-campus
students against abuses.
9. THE ASSU SHOULD
ESTABLISH A COMPULSORY
COURSE REVIEW PROGRAM,
IN WHICH STUDENTS MUST
SUBMIT A PASS-NEUTRAL
FAIL MARK ON EACH
PROFESSOR, before receiving his
own quarter report.
10. WITH OUR ESTIMATED
93 YEARS OF EXPERIENCE,
THE PRUDENCE OF AGE, AND
EXUBERANCE OF YOUTH
WILL BE MIRACULOUSLY
COMBINED.
11. THE STANFORD DAILY
SHOULD BE PUT ON A
SUBSCRIPTION BASIS, and
made financially independent of
the student political apparatus, or
the election of editor should be
| campus wide.
12. The only stand we have on
VIOLENCE is that we have no
stand; but we might SITDOWN on
it.
13. NOR DO WE HAVE A
STAND ON THE SAN
FRANCISCO EARTHQUAKE
although we do not believe that
this puts our platform on shaky
grounds.

I'm sick and I'm tired of this
whole campaign!
Every one of the candidates,
including myself, has
demonstrated a profound
understanding of politics by
taking a flexible stand on every
issue while using every gimmick
available to prove how well
qualified we are to hold office.
We've spoken of "support" and
"non-support" while others have
acted, and in their action
proclaimed a higher sense of
, purpose and interest in this
University than any of us. In
short, we've compromised our
souls and sold our guts for your
support and your vote.
The sad thing is that I can say
this about not just one, or two, or
most, but of all the candidates.
The funny thing is that the office
we seek has proven always in the
past to be one of such limited
power and served only to bolster
the prestige of the individual who
has gained it. Some of us are
sincere in our desire to change
that, but so have others been and
they have been beaten. Here we
are, candidates who say nothing
after an office which means
nothing. Which of us are you to
support? Perhaps you realize that
the absurd conclusion of this
absurd race is that one of us is
going to stand before the public at
large as representative of
Stanford's student body. Like so
many decisions, you must choose
the least of the list of evils with
little or no evidence to support
your choice.
I could speak now of issues,
but I would simply be repeating in
differertt phrases the statements
and beliefs of the other candidates
and the community in general.
You know how I stand—I'm a
Stanford liberal, but I'm only a
. man.
What more can I say?
"Born into a gathering of
valuers, whose values enslave me, I
attempted to free myself. Freed
from values, without which I am
lost, I searched for meaning. I
imagined that I searched alone: I
was wrong. There has come a
moment of small understanding."
I'm sick and I'm tired of this
whole campaign!

There is a great schism dividing
this unversity community into
two halves. One half believes that
changes in important issues must
be effected quickly through any
means of expression, legitimate or
otherwise. There is a second group
who react to this type of student
expression with an equal
conviction that change is only
necessary when effected through
the normal channels offered to
the members of this University. In
between these polarized sides, a
third group find themselves
sympathizing with the causes of
activist concern, but unable to
bring themselves to openly
support the tactics of pressure
politics. Student government has
done little to alleviate the
desperate situation we now find
ourselves in. There has been a void
of effective action by the student
government on the sensitive and
legitimate concerns of students at
this university. The results of this
inaction are the sit-ins of today
and last Spring.
No other candidates are
honestly speaking to the problem
of polarization of interest on this
campus. No other candidates are
offering imaginative and in-depth
programs that would attempt to
move us towards a reconciliation
of community. This cannot be
accomplished through vague
generalizations of what's wrong
with Stanford; they will not be
solved by barbeques on the Wilbur
Lawn or a Centrix telephone
system. They will not be solved
through enlarging the office of
presidency to four presidents.
Dave Harris and Peter Lyman did
not resign because the office .vas
too exhausting. They resigned
because the framework of student
government as it exists here is
insensitive and unresponsive to
creative programs proposed; it is
inoperative. Making a LASSU of
the presidency is not the answer.
We have approached the
problems and issues honestly. We
have offered constructive
programs already in operation at
other universities to help meet the
problems here. We hope to make
the student government
framework more operable by
reorganizing its cumbersome
legislative structure. Our proposals
for experimental dorms, an
Applied Research Institute Fall
Symposium, and a
Student-Fac ulty-Administration
Council offer an opportunity to
close the student schism and
provide the university with a
creative, powerful channel for
student expression through
student government. Although we
cannot elaborate on our proposals
in this limited space we invite
everyone to read our position
papers and see that we are
offering more than the usual spate
of generalizations.
Schneider
When those with conflicting
ideologies are unaware of the
middle ground which separates
them, the magnitude of their
differences seem irreconcilable,
and therefore, rather than
communicating in the spirit of
compromise, they speak only to
entrench themselves in their own
perspective. We need to reduce
this wasteful polarization by
involving more of those in the
middle of the political spectrum
in the affairs of the ASSU. Only
when the individual can identify
with those involved in the
decision-making process can he
relate to the decisions. This
applies not only to the neglected
middle, but also to the racial
minority students, whom
heretofore have had little, if no,
representation in student
government.
Most students are not
apathetic, but because they
cannot identify with student
government, they dismiss it as
being frivolous. The "left" has
played an inordinate role in
student government. And the
"right" in its response has
purported to speak for the silent
majority. We need to
de-emphasize the extremes by

middle.

students in student government so
that not only can they seek to
improve the University by
working unilaterally with the
administration, but they can use
the "system" to their and our

advantage. In this way, the white
community would be more apt to
gain a better understanding of
their situation.

issues of our time outside of the
traditional structured classroom
situation . . .
SRI will not be stopped by
forming new committees to study
the problem—Sßl will be stopped

necessary.
If Pitzer doesn't build new
housing, we will.
If trustees don't have open
meetings, we'll open them.
If courses we want aren't
taught, we will find someone to
teach them.
You can vote for a
committee-forming, issue-hiding
candidate (or half-assed multiple
candidate) and by doing so KISS
THE ESTABLISHMENT'S ASS.

Wernick is better qualified than
any other candidate—he has not,
and will not sit on any
committees, work for an impotent
though biased newspaper. Wernick
runs with no establishment
experience—he refuses to be
bound by assininity. He belongs
to no political organization.
Call him conservative .. . call
him radical . . . call him moderate

cannot be limited—he is free, and
he will make you free. Free of the
bureaucratic nonsense other

"Fuck that Shit." You will get
none of it from Wernick and
Gamble. Only Freedom!

New Priorities
The problems facing the world
are awesome. • In our own
community we can see the effects
of racism, environmental
pollution, destruction of our
national resources, and an
uncontrolled growth of
population. There are no easy
solutions to them, and the old
priorities of national defense are
draining away those very energies
which we need so desperately. We
are indeed burning the candle at
both ends. The results of
proceeding in the present
directions at an ever increasing
pace should be obvious to all
members of the community. And
yet many of the more esteemed
members of our community are
still saying, "But the patient
doesn't look sick, and anyway we
have been treating him. What right
do you have to question our
diagnosis?" It would appear that
the time has come to seek a new
physician and a new set of
priorities.
Student Responsibility
"You face a set of decisions
which are really symbolic of a
major national and international
crisis."
This statement by Dr. Kenneth
Pitzer to the Stanford Board of
Trustees is equally applicable to
every student, faculty, and staff
member on this campus. The
responsibility for our lives, our
future, and our University cannot
be delegated to a wise set of
oligarchs. This is a democracy and
ultimately every individual must
make his own decision. The
students at the AEL have made
their decision. They are described
as "a small percentage of the
Stanford student body." But, in
effect, they are speaking for all
students.
We feel that every student has
a choice to make at this time.
Their alternatives are basically
two. He (or she) can seriously
evaluate the problems we face,
and speak out in an attempt to
find a solution. Or he can
continue to pretend that these
problems do not concern him or
his future. As ASSU co-presidents
we will encourage every individual
to make up his own mind by the
rational process which is
fundamental to a University. But
ignoring the basic rights of a
democracy by remaining silent
and unconcerned is, at this time,
the height of irresponsibility. A
"silent majority" gives up any
claim to the future.
Cory
Eckhard and I envision student
government as a force pushing for
greater university participation in
public affairs. We propose the
establishment of a Department of
Urban and Environmental Studies,
which would take an

interdisciplinary approach to the
solutions of the major problems
confronting urban areas, such as
transportation, pollution and
housing. Under this department
one could not only bring in the
talents and resources of a variety
of departments, but also establish
individual programs whereby
students would be able to receive
academic credit for research and
field work in communities and
urban areas.
The creating of this department
should be only the first of many
steps taken to reorient education
and research at Stanford in order
to increase the relevance of both
the university to society and of
education to the individual. For
example, this department should
be encouraged to draw heavily on
the ample research facilities of
SRI. Urban problems currently
form a significant portion of the
Institute's research activities. By
expanding these efforts SRI could
better serve the vital interests of
the community and the students.
Regarding SRI and the
University, we have been told that
the negotiations process cannot
aid the implementation of these
needed changes. It is disturbing to
hear this verdict rendered on the
eve of a long-awaited
student-faculty report on the
future of SRI.
Tomorrow this report will be
issued to the entire Stanford
community. Two days later the
Academic Senate will meet in
urgent deliberation over the new
proposals. By the end of the week
every student and faculty member
will receive by mail a detailed
ballot concerning CBW, SRI and
related questions pertinent to
research and the university. This
schedule represents the
culmination of months of effort
by concerned students, faculty
and members of the
administration. To dismiss
negotiations as inevitably
non-productive is to frustrate the
efforts of these individuals, to
fragment our support, and
ultimately, to jeopardize the goals
for which we all share a common
concern.
While these issues are of great
interest to the Stanford
community, we hope that their
importance does not obscure
other problems that are relevant
to education at Stanford.
In the past year we have
witnessed an erosion of
governmental responsibility, in
which the open forum of student
government has been replaced by
an elite group which recognizes
the legitimacy of majority student
opinion only when it conforms to
their pre-conceived notions. We
feel strongly that government
should fulfill a representative
function, and to that end we offer
leadership that adheres to
democratic principles.
An additional problem is that
the great diversity of opinion on
campus has not been adequately
reflected by the Daily's editorial
and news coverage. We cannot
expect one journal to represent all
interests and points of view, so we
therefore subsidizing a
variety of other newsletters to
give balanced coverage to such
divergent groups as the BSU, the
I-Center and the YR's. To further
encourage the expression of
varying opinions we believe that
any individual, not only those
belonging to organizations, should
have the right to express his
opinion and address rallies in
White Plaza.

Finally, we recognize the
severe and inexcusable housing
shortage. We will undertake all
necessary steps to obtain more
and better housing for both
graduate and undergraduate
students.
Stanford
31
1. Our first reason for running
is to institute participatory
democracy at the top, with 31
Presidents to rotate DAILY.
2. Secondly, most other
candidates who may consider
themselves major campus
personalities with much to lose or

gain, have failed, or feared to take
concrete stands on the issues.
Being "jokers in the pack"
however, we can take clear and
concrete stands in our Platform,
for whatever constructive value it
may have.
Platform
1. THE ASSU SHOULD NOT
BE IMPOSED INVOLUNTARILY
ON STUDENTS; it must become
voluntary, like the GRADUATE
STUDENT ASSOCIATION. It is
only in this context that it will be
an independent spokesman for
students. The administration need
not retain petty student officers
to administrate petty tasks for
them.
2. Until such a transformation
(1) WE SUPPORT THE HAYES
CONSTITUTION WITHOUT
RESERVATIONS. The unspoken
"reservations" of other candidates
may be dealt with later. Now, the
HAYES CONSTITUTION must
be accepted so that ASSU will not
be strangled by LASSU.
3. To create a greater sense of
community, and provide

recreation, we support
construction of a LOUIS AGAZZI
GLACIER MEMORIAL PARK
ON FRENCHMAN'S HILL WITH
CAMPSITES.
4. 500-1 000 BLACK,
BROWN, AND INDIAN, AND
OTHER MINORITIES,
ENROLLED IN STANFORD as
soon as possible, is not too much
to ask of this university. We must
not lay down our moral burdens
when the present goal of 350 is
reached.
Furthermore: WE SUPPORT
ALL 11 BSU DEMANDS, with
the exception of the first (Which
demands dismissal of Dr. Koff).
Furthermore: WE BELIEVE
THAT THE ASSU SHOULD
ACTIVELY TAKE PART IN
INTENSIVE RECRUITMENT OF
SAID MINORITY STUDENTS.
5. THERE MUST BE 16
HOURS OF DAYLIGHT.
6. SRI MUST BE SEVERED,
FROM THE GOVERNMENT,
NOT FROM STANFORD
CHEMICAL ANDBIOLOGICAL
WARFARE, AND ALL
, DEFENSE CONTRACTS
MILITATE (LITERALLY)
AGAINST THE ACADEMIC
" SPIRIT OF A UNIVERSITY.
Defense, and political research
should be done by the
government itself, where it may
be politically opposed (as in the
ABM crisis).
7. ROTC SHOULD NOT BE
ACCREDITED; HOWEVER THE
ROTC PROGRAM SHOULD BE
ALLOWED TO CONTINUE ON
CAMPUS, AS THE COLLEGE
EDUCATED OFFICERS IT
SUPPLIES ARE ONE OF THE
FEW MODERATING FORCES
ON OUR MILITARY.
8. THE ASSU SHOULD
ESTABLISH A RENT CONTROL
BOARD to thoroughly investigate
the practices of landlords in
surrounding communities, and
protect and warn off-campus
students against abuses.
9. THE ASSU SHOULD
ESTABLISH A COMPULSORY
COURSE REVIEW PROGRAM,
IN WHICH STUDENTS MUST
SUBMIT A PASS-NEUTRAL
FAIL MARK ON EACH
PROFESSOR, before receiving his
own quarter report.
10. WITH OUR ESTIMATED
93 YEARS OF EXPERIENCE,
THE PRUDENCE OF AGE, AND
EXUBERANCE OF YOUTH
WILL BE MIRACULOUSLY
COMBINED.
11. THE STANFORD DAILY
SHOULD BE PUT ON A
SUBSCRIPTION BASIS, and
made financially independent of
the student political apparatus, or
the election of editor should be
| campus wide.
12. The only stand we have on
VIOLENCE is that we have no
stand; but we might SITDOWN on
it.
13. NOR DO WE HAVE A
STAND ON THE SAN
FRANCISCO EARTHQUAKE
although we do not believe that
this puts our platform on shaky
grounds.
Laird
I'm sick and I'm tired of this
whole campaign!
Every one of the candidates,
including myself, has
demonstrated a profound
understanding of politics by
taking a flexible stand on every
issue while using every gimmick
available to prove how well
qualified we are to hold office.
We've spoken of "support" and
"non-support" while others have
acted, and in their action
proclaimed a higher sense of
, purpose and interest in this
University than any of us. In
short, we've compromised our
souls and sold our guts for your
support and your vote.
The sad thing is that I can say
this about not just one, or two, or
most, but of all the candidates.
The funny thing is that the office
we seek has proven always in the
past to be one of such limited
power and served only to bolster
the prestige of the individual who
has gained it. Some of us are
sincere in our desire to change
that, but so have others been and
they have been beaten. Here we
are, candidates who say nothing
after an office which means
nothing. Which of us are you to
support? Perhaps you realize that
the absurd conclusion of this
absurd race is that one of us is
going to stand before the public at
large as representative of
Stanford's student body. Like so
many decisions, you must choose
the least of the list of evils with
little or no evidence to support
your choice.
I could speak now of issues,
but I would simply be repeating in
differertt phrases the statements
and beliefs of the other candidates
and the community in general.
You know how I stand—I'm a
Stanford liberal, but I'm only a
. man.
What more can I say?
"Born into a gathering of
valuers, whose values enslave me, I
attempted to free myself. Freed
from values, without which I am
lost, I searched for meaning. I
imagined that I searched alone: I
was wrong. There has come a
moment of small understanding."
I'm sick and I'm tired of this
whole campaign!

Mattson
There is a great schism dividing
this unversity community into
two halves. One half believes that
changes in important issues must
be effected quickly through any
means of expression, legitimate or
otherwise. There is a second group
who react to this type of student
expression with an equal
conviction that change is only
necessary when effected through
the normal channels offered to
the members of this University. In
between these polarized sides, a
third group find themselves
sympathizing with the causes of
activist concern, but unable to
bring themselves to openly
support the tactics of pressure
politics. Student government has
done little to alleviate the
desperate situation we now find
ourselves in. There has been a void
of effective action by the student
government on the sensitive and
legitimate concerns of students at
this university. The results of this
inaction are the sit-ins of today
and last Spring.
No other candidates are
honestly speaking to the problem
of polarization of interest on this
campus. No other candidates are
offering imaginative and in-depth
programs that would attempt to
move us towards a reconciliation
of community. This cannot be
accomplished through vague
generalizations of what's wrong
with Stanford; they will not be
solved by barbeques on the Wilbur
Lawn or a Centrix telephone
system. They will not be solved
through enlarging the office of
presidency to four presidents.
Dave Harris and Peter Lyman did
not resign because the office .vas
too exhausting. They resigned
because the framework of student
government as it exists here is
insensitive and unresponsive to
creative programs proposed; it is
inoperative. Making a LASSU of
the presidency is not the answer.
We have approached the
problems and issues honestly. We
have offered constructive
programs already in operation at
other universities to help meet the
problems here. We hope to make
the student government
framework more operable by
reorganizing its cumbersome
legislative structure. Our proposals
for experimental dorms, an
Applied Research Institute Fall
Symposium, and a
Student-Fac ulty-Administration
Council offer an opportunity to
close the student schism and
provide the university with a
creative, powerful channel for
student expression through
student government. Although we
cannot elaborate on our proposals
in this limited space we invite
everyone to read our position
papers and see that we are
offering more than the usual spate
of generalizations.
Schneider
When those with conflicting
ideologies are unaware of the
middle ground which separates
them, the magnitude of their
differences seem irreconcilable,
and therefore, rather than
communicating in the spirit of
compromise, they speak only to
entrench themselves in their own
perspective. We need to reduce
this wasteful polarization by
involving more of those in the
middle of the political spectrum
in the affairs of the ASSU. Only
when the individual can identify
with those involved in the
decision-making process can he
relate to the decisions. This
applies not only to the neglected
middle, but also to the racial
minority students, whom
heretofore have had little, if no,
representation in student
government.
Most students are not
apathetic, but because they
cannot identify with student
government, they dismiss it as
being frivolous. The "left" has
played an inordinate role in
student government. And the
"right" in its response has
purported to speak for the silent
majority. We need to
de-emphasize the extremes by
involving more students from the
middle.
We need to involve minority
students in student government so
that not only can they seek to
improve the University by
working unilaterally with the
administration, but they can use
the "system" to their and our

advantage. In this way, the white
community would be more apt to
gain a better understanding of
their situation.
National and world problems
should be of the utmost concern
to us all. And as students, we have
a responsibility to effect social
and political change. But the first
commitment of a student body
officer is to the student and his
university - related interests and
needs. Through a more human
and relevant system of
communication with you, we feel
that we can best help you to meet
your needs while at Stanford.
Shea
The crucial task for students
now is maintaining the
momentum toward a powerful
student voice in education and the
affairs of the University. The
ASSU Presidency offers a
potential focal point for
strengthening and coordinating
the role of students in University
affairs. In the past, however, the
job has been too demanding for
one individual—two of the last
three incumbents have resigned.
The expectation of new student
demands and responsibilities
further emphasizes the need for a
stronger Executive Office.
We propose a Council of
Presidents: four individuals,
together responsible for
performing all the duties of the
ASSU Presidency. The Council
will meet daily; chairmanship of
the Council will rotate monthly
among the four. The chairman
will set the daily agenda, and will
exercise a tie-breaking vote.
A key strength of the Council
would be the specialized areas of
responsibility of each member.
Barry Askinas, President of the
Graduate Students Association
and a tutor in Otero, would be
concerned with the problems of
graduate students; he is presently
involved with the problem of
housing.
John Grube, former Assistant
Financial Manager for the ASSU
and a sponsor in Trancos, would
coordinate student activities
within the ASSU and organize the
publication of a student Course
Review.
Joyce Kobayashi, chairman of
the Biafran/Nigerian Relief Drive,
would work with the problems of
international students, such as
increasing interaction with
American students, organizing
courses taught by foreign
students, housing.
Pat Shea, currently a member
of the University Advisory
Committee, would work to
develop and improve
communication among students,
the faculty, the administration
and Trustees.
We are all members of the
Student Education Council and
have been actively participating in
the deliberations of the SES
recommendations. We regard
these deliberations as only a
beginning toward essential change
in education at Stanford.
Regarding our position with
respect to the demands of the
SRI-Coalition: we participated in
the April 9 SRI-Coalition meeting
and voted against the tactic of a
sit-in; we voted, however, for the
sit-in with a time limit. We have
since then participated in it to
varying degrees, feeling it most
important that the real issues of
concern not be lost in the
question of this particular tactic,
and that a point of inflexibility or
irreparable polarization not be
reached.
We find it a shame that only
illegitimate action has been
successful in opening up closed
channels of communication and
arousing campus-wide concern in
the issues.
We would work to achieve a
community where change can
occur long before confrontation
politics is the only recourse.
Pat Shea and John Grube will
appear on the ballot as candidates
for President and Vice-President,
respectively. If elected, they,
together with Barry Askinas and
Joyce Kobayashi, will assume the
responsibilities of the ASSU
Presidency.
Spiegel
Student government at
Stanford has failed because it has
put the cart before the horse—it
has made proposals and "urgent
requests" to the administration
without an independent power
base in the student body with
which to back up its requests.
Such a power base would consist
of a large group of students who
aio sufficiently concerned about a
particular problem to give
generously of their time and
ultimately to put themselves on
the line in support of what they
want done. Without this support
behind him, the ASSU president,
whether the competent and
hard-working Denis Hayes, or the
topless dancer who nearly beat
him, will remain an obscure and
somewhat comic figure, while the
really exciting and important
changes in the university will be
instigated by ad hoc groups such
as the SRI Coalition.
John Spiegel and Brad Cornell
are alone among the many ASSU

candidates in recognizing the need
for a student power base as a
prerequisite for effective student
government, and in proposing to
meet this need. We have outlined
how the president could inform,
organize, and mobilize students
around a particular issue through
articles in The Daily,
informational literature similar to
that of the SRI Coalition,
discussions in residences, and
open ASSU meetings. We seek at
once to inform and to be
informed by the student body,
and to develop a participatory
democracy where students make
individual commitments from
which emerges a collective
strength. We endorse the AEL
sit-in not only for the issue behind
it, but also as a confused and
often frustrated attempt to make
this collective strength felt.
Spiegel and Cornell propose to
use student power to bring about
fundamental change in the
university. We seek a radical
revision of Stanford's priorities—a
re-direction of resources to
teaching at the undergraduate
level, to campus housing, and to
educational innovation. Most
immediately, we seek a
re-direction of research away from
the development of weapons of
greater destruction to peaceful
and acutely needed projects. This
re-direction will not be achieved
through persuasion alone. The
pressure of a mobilized group of
concerned students is needed to
overcome the inertia and opposing
interests of Trustees, faculty, and
administration.
By the very nature of his
power base, the ASSU president
must be selective in what he
attempts beyond his role as a
persuasive lobbyist. We will work
for the implementation of the
April Third Coalition demands on
university research policy, and of
the SES proposals on
undergraduate education and
housing. To promise more is
either naive or misleading. To
promise anything without an
attempt to develop a student
power base offers nothing but a
perpetuation of the discredited
past tradition of Stanford student
government.
Wernick
Students have one political
function: to act as a power lobby!
Nobody listens unless you

howl. Capitalistic bourgeois
Stanford has not responded to
rational discussion through their
committees or any other means of
communication.
A new environment is to be
created if Allan and Larry are
elected. Allan Wernick and Larry
Gamble believe that students
should and will run this place, and
they will help the community
reach this goal. (Wernick and
Gamble don't want to run
Stanford—they want you to run
it.)
The sit-in at AEL is an example
of the student activism that Allan
and Larry support for this
university. Two things are very
important:
1. Students are acting on their
own initiative, doing what they
believe to be right, no matter
what the veiled threats from the
administration are . . .
2. Students are enjoying
themselves, and they now have
the chance to discuss the real
issues of our time outside of the
traditional structured classroom
situation . . .
SRI will not be stopped by
forming new committees to study
the problem—Sßl will be stopped
if we stop it by whatever means
necessary.
If Pitzer doesn't build new
housing, we will.
If trustees don't have open
meetings, we'll open them.
If courses we want aren't
taught, we will find someone to
teach them.
You can vote for a
committee-forming, issue-hiding

candidate) and by doing so KISS
THE ESTABLISHMENT'S ASS.

see something change-really
change.
Wernick is better qualified than
any other candidate—he has not,
and will not sit on any
committees, work for an impotent
though biased newspaper. Wernick
runs with no establishment
experience—he refuses to be
bound by assininity. He belongs

he will make you free. Free of the

Laird
I'm sick and I'm tired of this
whole campaign!
Every one of the candidates,
including myself, has
demonstrated a profound
understanding of politics by
taking a flexible stand on every
issue while using every gimmick
available to prove how well
qualified we are to hold office.
We've spoken of "support" and
"non-support" while others have
acted, and in their action
proclaimed a higher sense of
, purpose and interest in this
University than any of us. In
short, we've compromised our
souls and sold our guts for your
support and your vote.
The sad thing is that I can say
this about not just one, or two, or
most, but of all the candidates.
The funny thing is that the office
we seek has proven always in the
past to be one of such limited
power and served only to bolster
the prestige of the individual who
has gained it. Some of us are
sincere in our desire to change
that, but so have others been and
they have been beaten. Here we
are, candidates who say nothing
after an office which means
nothing. Which of us are you to
support? Perhaps you realize that
the absurd conclusion of this
absurd race is that one of us is
going to stand before the public at
large as representative of
Stanford's student body. Like so
many decisions, you must choose
the least of the list of evils with
little or no evidence to support
your choice.
I could speak now of issues,
but I would simply be repeating in
differertt phrases the statements

You know how I stand—I'm a
Stanford liberal, but I'm only a

"Born into a gathering of

attempted to free myself. Freed
from values, without which I am
lost, I searched for meaning. I
imagined that I searched alone: I

moment of small understanding."

Mattson
There is a great schism dividing
this unversity community into
two halves. One half believes that
changes in important issues must
be effected quickly through any
means of expression, legitimate or
otherwise. There is a second group
who react to this type of student
expression with an equal
conviction that change is only
necessary when effected through
the normal channels offered to
the members of this University. In
between these polarized sides, a
third group find themselves
sympathizing with the causes of
activist concern, but unable to
bring themselves to openly
support the tactics of pressure
politics. Student government has
done little to alleviate the
desperate situation we now find
ourselves in. There has been a void
of effective action by the student
government on the sensitive and
legitimate concerns of students at
this university. The results of this
inaction are the sit-ins of today
and last Spring.
No other candidates are
honestly speaking to the problem
of polarization of interest on this
campus. No other candidates are
offering imaginative and in-depth
programs that would attempt to
move us towards a reconciliation
of community. This cannot be
accomplished through vague
generalizations of what's wrong
with Stanford; they will not be
solved by barbeques on the Wilbur
Lawn or a Centrix telephone
system. They will not be solved
through enlarging the office of
presidency to four presidents.
Dave Harris and Peter Lyman did
not resign because the office .vas
too exhausting. They resigned
because the framework of student
government as it exists here is
insensitive and unresponsive to
creative programs proposed; it is
inoperative. Making a LASSU of
the presidency is not the answer.
We have approached the
problems and issues honestly. We
have offered constructive
programs already in operation at
other universities to help meet the
problems here. We hope to make
the student government
framework more operable by
reorganizing its cumbersome
legislative structure. Our proposals
for experimental dorms, an
Applied Research Institute Fall
Symposium, and a
Student-Fac ulty-Administration
Council offer an opportunity to
close the student schism and
provide the university with a
creative, powerful channel for
student expression through
student government. Although we
cannot elaborate on our proposals
in this limited space we invite
everyone to read our position
papers and see that we are
offering more than the usual spate
of generalizations.
Schneider
When those with conflicting
ideologies are unaware of the
middle ground which separates
them, the magnitude of their
differences seem irreconcilable,
and therefore, rather than
communicating in the spirit of
compromise, they speak only to
entrench themselves in their own
perspective. We need to reduce
this wasteful polarization by
involving more of those in the
middle of the political spectrum
in the affairs of the ASSU. Only
when the individual can identify
with those involved in the
decision-making process can he
relate to the decisions. This
applies not only to the neglected
middle, but also to the racial
minority students, whom
heretofore have had little, if no,
representation in student
government.
Most students are not
apathetic, but because they
cannot identify with student
government, they dismiss it as
being frivolous. The "left" has
played an inordinate role in
student government. And the
"right" in its response has
purported to speak for the silent
majority. We need to
de-emphasize the extremes by
involving more students from the
middle.
We need to involve minority
students in student government so
that not only can they seek to
improve the University by
working unilaterally with the
administration, but they can use
the "system" to their and our

advantage. In this way, the white
community would be more apt to
gain a better understanding of
their situation.
National and world problems
should be of the utmost concern
to us all. And as students, we have
a responsibility to effect social
and political change. But the first
commitment of a student body
officer is to the student and his
university - related interests and
needs. Through a more human
and relevant system of
communication with you, we feel
that we can best help you to meet
your needs while at Stanford.
Shea
The crucial task for students
now is maintaining the
momentum toward a powerful
student voice in education and the
affairs of the University. The
ASSU Presidency offers a
potential focal point for
strengthening and coordinating
the role of students in University
affairs. In the past, however, the
job has been too demanding for
one individual—two of the last
three incumbents have resigned.
The expectation of new student
demands and responsibilities
further emphasizes the need for a
stronger Executive Office.
We propose a Council of
Presidents: four individuals,
together responsible for
performing all the duties of the
ASSU Presidency. The Council
will meet daily; chairmanship of
the Council will rotate monthly
among the four. The chairman
will set the daily agenda, and will
exercise a tie-breaking vote.
A key strength of the Council
would be the specialized areas of
responsibility of each member.
Barry Askinas, President of the
Graduate Students Association
and a tutor in Otero, would be
concerned with the problems of
graduate students; he is presently
involved with the problem of
housing.
John Grube, former Assistant
Financial Manager for the ASSU
and a sponsor in Trancos, would
coordinate student activities
within the ASSU and organize the
publication of a student Course
Review.
Joyce Kobayashi, chairman of
the Biafran/Nigerian Relief Drive,
would work with the problems of
international students, such as
increasing interaction with
American students, organizing
courses taught by foreign
students, housing.
Pat Shea, currently a member
of the University Advisory
Committee, would work to
develop and improve
communication among students,
the faculty, the administration
and Trustees.
We are all members of the
Student Education Council and
have been actively participating in
the deliberations of the SES
recommendations. We regard
these deliberations as only a
beginning toward essential change
in education at Stanford.
Regarding our position with
respect to the demands of the
SRI-Coalition: we participated in
the April 9 SRI-Coalition meeting
and voted against the tactic of a
sit-in; we voted, however, for the
sit-in with a time limit. We have
since then participated in it to
varying degrees, feeling it most
important that the real issues of
concern not be lost in the
question of this particular tactic,
and that a point of inflexibility or
irreparable polarization not be
reached.
We find it a shame that only
illegitimate action has been
successful in opening up closed
channels of communication and
arousing campus-wide concern in
the issues.
We would work to achieve a
community where change can
occur long before confrontation
politics is the only recourse.
Pat Shea and John Grube will
appear on the ballot as candidates
for President and Vice-President,
respectively. If elected, they,
together with Barry Askinas and
Joyce Kobayashi, will assume the
responsibilities of the ASSU
Presidency.
Spiegel
Student government at
Stanford has failed because it has
put the cart before the horse—it
has made proposals and "urgent
requests" to the administration
without an independent power
base in the student body with
which to back up its requests.
Such a power base would consist
of a large group of students who
aio sufficiently concerned about a
particular problem to give
generously of their time and
ultimately to put themselves on
the line in support of what they
want done. Without this support
behind him, the ASSU president,
whether the competent and
hard-working Denis Hayes, or the
topless dancer who nearly beat
him, will remain an obscure and
somewhat comic figure, while the
really exciting and important
changes in the university will be
instigated by ad hoc groups such
as the SRI Coalition.
John Spiegel and Brad Cornell
are alone among the many ASSU

candidates in recognizing the need
for a student power base as a
prerequisite for effective student
government, and in proposing to
meet this need. We have outlined
how the president could inform,
organize, and mobilize students
around a particular issue through
articles in The Daily,
informational literature similar to
that of the SRI Coalition,
discussions in residences, and
open ASSU meetings. We seek at
once to inform and to be
informed by the student body,
and to develop a participatory
democracy where students make
individual commitments from
which emerges a collective
strength. We endorse the AEL
sit-in not only for the issue behind
it, but also as a confused and
often frustrated attempt to make
this collective strength felt.
Spiegel and Cornell propose to
use student power to bring about
fundamental change in the
university. We seek a radical
revision of Stanford's priorities—a
re-direction of resources to
teaching at the undergraduate
level, to campus housing, and to
educational innovation. Most
immediately, we seek a
re-direction of research away from
the development of weapons of
greater destruction to peaceful
and acutely needed projects. This
re-direction will not be achieved
through persuasion alone. The
pressure of a mobilized group of
concerned students is needed to
overcome the inertia and opposing
interests of Trustees, faculty, and
administration.
By the very nature of his
power base, the ASSU president
must be selective in what he
attempts beyond his role as a
persuasive lobbyist. We will work
for the implementation of the
April Third Coalition demands on
university research policy, and of
the SES proposals on
undergraduate education and
housing. To promise more is
either naive or misleading. To
promise anything without an
attempt to develop a student
power base offers nothing but a
perpetuation of the discredited
past tradition of Stanford student
government.
Wernick
Students have one political
function: to act as a power lobby!
Nobody listens unless you

howl. Capitalistic bourgeois
Stanford has not responded to
rational discussion through their
committees or any other means of
communication.
A new environment is to be
created if Allan and Larry are
elected. Allan Wernick and Larry
Gamble believe that students
should and will run this place, and
they will help the community
reach this goal. (Wernick and
Gamble don't want to run
Stanford—they want you to run
it.)
The sit-in at AEL is an example
of the student activism that Allan
and Larry support for this
university. Two things are very
important:
1. Students are acting on their
own initiative, doing what they
believe to be right, no matter
what the veiled threats from the
administration are . . .
2. Students are enjoying
themselves, and they now have
the chance to discuss the real
issues of our time outside of the
traditional structured classroom
situation . . .
SRI will not be stopped by
forming new committees to study
the problem—Sßl will be stopped
if we stop it by whatever means
necessary.
If Pitzer doesn't build new
housing, we will.
If trustees don't have open
meetings, we'll open them.
If courses we want aren't
taught, we will find someone to
teach them.
You can vote for a
committee-forming, issue-hiding
candidate (or half-assed multiple
candidate) and by doing so KISS
THE ESTABLISHMENT'S ASS.
You can vote for Wernick and
see something change-really
change.
Wernick is better qualified than
any other candidate—he has not,
and will not sit on any
committees, work for an impotent
though biased newspaper. Wernick
runs with no establishment
experience—he refuses to be
bound by assininity. He belongs
to no political organization.
Call him conservative .. . call
him radical . . . call him moderate
and you will be wrong, for he
cannot be limited—he is free, and
he will make you free. Free of the
bureaucratic nonsense other
candidates feed you, Wernick says
"Fuck that Shit." You will get
none of it from Wernick and
Gamble. Only Freedom!

New Priorities
The problems facing the world
are awesome. • In our own
community we can see the effects
of racism, environmental
pollution, destruction of our
national resources, and an
uncontrolled growth of
population. There are no easy
solutions to them, and the old
priorities of national defense are
draining away those very energies
which we need so desperately. We
are indeed burning the candle at
both ends. The results of
proceeding in the present
directions at an ever increasing
pace should be obvious to all
members of the community. And
yet many of the more esteemed
members of our community are
still saying, "But the patient
doesn't look sick, and anyway we
have been treating him. What right
do you have to question our
diagnosis?" It would appear that
the time has come to seek a new
physician and a new set of
priorities.
Student Responsibility
"You face a set of decisions
which are really symbolic of a
major national and international
crisis."
This statement by Dr. Kenneth
Pitzer to the Stanford Board of
Trustees is equally applicable to
every student, faculty, and staff
member on this campus. The
responsibility for our lives, our
future, and our University cannot
be delegated to a wise set of
oligarchs. This is a democracy and
ultimately every individual must
make his own decision. The
students at the AEL have made
their decision. They are described
as "a small percentage of the
Stanford student body." But, in
effect, they are speaking for all
students.
We feel that every student has
a choice to make at this time.
Their alternatives are basically
two. He (or she) can seriously
evaluate the problems we face,
and speak out in an attempt to
find a solution. Or he can
continue to pretend that these
problems do not concern him or
his future. As ASSU co-presidents
we will encourage every individual
to make up his own mind by the
rational process which is
fundamental to a University. But
ignoring the basic rights of a
democracy by remaining silent
and unconcerned is, at this time,
the height of irresponsibility. A
"silent majority" gives up any
claim to the future.
Cory
Eckhard and I envision student
government as a force pushing for
greater university participation in
public affairs. We propose the
establishment of a Department of
Urban and Environmental Studies,
which would take an

interdisciplinary approach to the
solutions of the major problems
confronting urban areas, such as
transportation, pollution and
housing. Under this department
one could not only bring in the
talents and resources of a variety
of departments, but also establish
individual programs whereby
students would be able to receive
academic credit for research and
field work in communities and
urban areas.
The creating of this department
should be only the first of many
steps taken to reorient education
and research at Stanford in order
to increase the relevance of both
the university to society and of
education to the individual. For
example, this department should
be encouraged to draw heavily on
the ample research facilities of
SRI. Urban problems currently
form a significant portion of the
Institute's research activities. By
expanding these efforts SRI could
better serve the vital interests of
the community and the students.
Regarding SRI and the
University, we have been told that
the negotiations process cannot
aid the implementation of these
needed changes. It is disturbing to
hear this verdict rendered on the
eve of a long-awaited
student-faculty report on the
future of SRI.
Tomorrow this report will be
issued to the entire Stanford
community. Two days later the
Academic Senate will meet in
urgent deliberation over the new
proposals. By the end of the week
every student and faculty member
will receive by mail a detailed
ballot concerning CBW, SRI and
related questions pertinent to
research and the university. This
schedule represents the
culmination of months of effort
by concerned students, faculty
and members of the
administration. To dismiss
negotiations as inevitably
non-productive is to frustrate the
efforts of these individuals, to
fragment our support, and
ultimately, to jeopardize the goals
for which we all share a common
concern.
While these issues are of great
interest to the Stanford
community, we hope that their
importance does not obscure
other problems that are relevant
to education at Stanford.
In the past year we have
witnessed an erosion of
governmental responsibility, in
which the open forum of student
government has been replaced by
an elite group which recognizes
the legitimacy of majority student
opinion only when it conforms to
their pre-conceived notions. We
feel strongly that government
should fulfill a representative
function, and to that end we offer
leadership that adheres to
democratic principles.
An additional problem is that
the great diversity of opinion on
campus has not been adequately
reflected by the Daily's editorial
and news coverage. We cannot
expect one journal to represent all
interests and points of view, so we
therefore subsidizing a
variety of other newsletters to
give balanced coverage to such
divergent groups as the BSU, the
I-Center and the YR's. To further
encourage the expression of
varying opinions we believe that
any individual, not only those
belonging to organizations, should
have the right to express his
opinion and address rallies in
White Plaza.

Finally, we recognize the
severe and inexcusable housing
shortage. We will undertake all
necessary steps to obtain more
and better housing for both
graduate and undergraduate
students.

close the student schism and
provide the university with a
creative, powerful channel for
student expression through
student government. Although we
cannot elaborate on our proposals
in this limited space we invite
everyone to read our position
papers and see that we are
offering more than the usual spate
of generalizations.
Schneider
When those with conflicting
ideologies are unaware of the
middle ground which separates
them, the magnitude of their
differences seem irreconcilable,
and therefore, rather than
communicating in the spirit of
compromise, they speak only to
entrench themselves in their own
perspective. We need to reduce
this wasteful polarization by
involving more of those in the
middle of the political spectrum
in the affairs of the ASSU. Only
when the individual can identify
with those involved in the
decision-making process can he
relate to the decisions. This
applies not only to the neglected
middle, but also to the racial
minority students, whom
heretofore have had little, if no,
representation in student
government.
Most students are not
apathetic, but because they
cannot identify with student
government, they dismiss it as
being frivolous. The "left" has
played an inordinate role in
student government. And the
"right" in its response has
purported to speak for the silent
majority. We need to
de-emphasize the extremes by
involving more students from the
middle.
We need to involve minority
students in student government so
that not only can they seek to
improve the University by
working unilaterally with the
administration, but they can use
the "system" to their and our

advantage. In this way, the white
community would be more apt to
gain a better understanding of
their situation.
National and world problems
should be of the utmost concern
to us all. And as students, we have
a responsibility to effect social
and political change. But the first
commitment of a student body
officer is to the student and his
university - related interests and
needs. Through a more human
and relevant system of
communication with you, we feel
that we can best help you to meet
your needs while at Stanford.

The crucial task for students
now is maintaining the
momentum toward a powerful
student voice in education and the
affairs of the University. The
ASSU Presidency offers a
potential focal point for
strengthening and coordinating
the role of students in University
affairs. In the past, however, the
job has been too demanding for
one individual—two of the last
three incumbents have resigned.
The expectation of new student
demands and responsibilities
further emphasizes the need for a
stronger Executive Office.
We propose a Council of
Presidents: four individuals,
together responsible for
performing all the duties of the
ASSU Presidency. The Council
will meet daily; chairmanship of
the Council will rotate monthly
among the four. The chairman
will set the daily agenda, and will
exercise a tie-breaking vote.
A key strength of the Council
would be the specialized areas of
responsibility of each member.
Barry Askinas, President of the
Graduate Students Association
and a tutor in Otero, would be
concerned with the problems of
graduate students; he is presently
involved with the problem of
housing.
John Grube, former Assistant
Financial Manager for the ASSU
and a sponsor in Trancos, would
coordinate student activities
within the ASSU and organize the
publication of a student Course
Review.
Joyce Kobayashi, chairman of
the Biafran/Nigerian Relief Drive,
would work with the problems of
international students, such as
increasing interaction with
American students, organizing
courses taught by foreign
students, housing.
Pat Shea, currently a member
of the University Advisory
Committee, would work to
develop and improve
communication among students,
the faculty, the administration
and Trustees.
We are all members of the
Student Education Council and
have been actively participating in
the deliberations of the SES
recommendations. We regard
these deliberations as only a
beginning toward essential change
in education at Stanford.
Regarding our position with
respect to the demands of the
SRI-Coalition: we participated in
the April 9 SRI-Coalition meeting
and voted against the tactic of a
sit-in; we voted, however, for the
sit-in with a time limit. We have
since then participated in it to
varying degrees, feeling it most
important that the real issues of
concern not be lost in the
question of this particular tactic,
and that a point of inflexibility or
irreparable polarization not be
reached.
We find it a shame that only
illegitimate action has been
successful in opening up closed
channels of communication and
arousing campus-wide concern in
the issues.
We would work to achieve a
community where change can
occur long before confrontation
politics is the only recourse.
Pat Shea and John Grube will
appear on the ballot as candidates
for President and Vice-President,
respectively. If elected, they,
together with Barry Askinas and
Joyce Kobayashi, will assume the
responsibilities of the ASSU
Presidency.
Spiegel
Student government at
Stanford has failed because it has
put the cart before the horse—it
has made proposals and "urgent
requests" to the administration
without an independent power
base in the student body with
which to back up its requests.
Such a power base would consist
of a large group of students who
aio sufficiently concerned about a
particular problem to give
generously of their time and
ultimately to put themselves on
the line in support of what they
want done. Without this support
behind him, the ASSU president,
whether the competent and
hard-working Denis Hayes, or the
topless dancer who nearly beat
him, will remain an obscure and
somewhat comic figure, while the
really exciting and important
changes in the university will be
instigated by ad hoc groups such
as the SRI Coalition.
John Spiegel and Brad Cornell
are alone among the many ASSU

candidates in recognizing the need
for a student power base as a
prerequisite for effective student
government, and in proposing to
meet this need. We have outlined
how the president could inform,
organize, and mobilize students
around a particular issue through
articles in The Daily,
informational literature similar to
that of the SRI Coalition,
discussions in residences, and
open ASSU meetings. We seek at
once to inform and to be
informed by the student body,
and to develop a participatory
democracy where students make
individual commitments from
which emerges a collective
strength. We endorse the AEL
sit-in not only for the issue behind
it, but also as a confused and
often frustrated attempt to make
this collective strength felt.
Spiegel and Cornell propose to
use student power to bring about
fundamental change in the
university. We seek a radical
revision of Stanford's priorities—a
re-direction of resources to
teaching at the undergraduate
level, to campus housing, and to
educational innovation. Most
immediately, we seek a
re-direction of research away from
the development of weapons of
greater destruction to peaceful
and acutely needed projects. This
re-direction will not be achieved
through persuasion alone. The
pressure of a mobilized group of
concerned students is needed to
overcome the inertia and opposing
interests of Trustees, faculty, and
administration.
By the very nature of his
power base, the ASSU president
must be selective in what he
attempts beyond his role as a
persuasive lobbyist. We will work
for the implementation of the
April Third Coalition demands on
university research policy, and of
the SES proposals on
undergraduate education and
housing. To promise more is
either naive or misleading. To
promise anything without an
attempt to develop a student
power base offers nothing but a
perpetuation of the discredited
past tradition of Stanford student
government.
Wernick
Students have one political
function: to act as a power lobby!
Nobody listens unless you

howl. Capitalistic bourgeois
Stanford has not responded to
rational discussion through their
committees or any other means of
communication.
A new environment is to be
created if Allan and Larry are
elected. Allan Wernick and Larry
Gamble believe that students
should and will run this place, and
they will help the community
reach this goal. (Wernick and
Gamble don't want to run
Stanford—they want you to run
it.)
The sit-in at AEL is an example
of the student activism that Allan
and Larry support for this
university. Two things are very
important:
1. Students are acting on their
own initiative, doing what they
believe to be right, no matter
what the veiled threats from the
administration are . . .
2. Students are enjoying
themselves, and they now have
the chance to discuss the real
issues of our time outside of the
traditional structured classroom
situation . . .
SRI will not be stopped by
forming new committees to study
the problem—Sßl will be stopped
if we stop it by whatever means
necessary.
If Pitzer doesn't build new
housing, we will.
If trustees don't have open
meetings, we'll open them.
If courses we want aren't
taught, we will find someone to
teach them.
You can vote for a
committee-forming, issue-hiding
candidate (or half-assed multiple
candidate) and by doing so KISS
THE ESTABLISHMENT'S ASS.
You can vote for Wernick and
see something change-really
change.
Wernick is better qualified than
any other candidate—he has not,
and will not sit on any
committees, work for an impotent
though biased newspaper. Wernick
runs with no establishment
experience—he refuses to be
bound by assininity. He belongs
to no political organization.
Call him conservative .. . call
him radical . . . call him moderate
and you will be wrong, for he
cannot be limited—he is free, and
he will make you free. Free of the
bureaucratic nonsense other
candidates feed you, Wernick says
"Fuck that Shit." You will get
none of it from Wernick and
Gamble. Only Freedom!

New Priorities
The problems facing the world
are awesome. • In our own
community we can see the effects
of racism, environmental
pollution, destruction of our
national resources, and an
uncontrolled growth of
population. There are no easy
solutions to them, and the old
priorities of national defense are
draining away those very energies
which we need so desperately. We
are indeed burning the candle at
both ends. The results of
proceeding in the present
directions at an ever increasing
pace should be obvious to all
members of the community. And
yet many of the more esteemed
members of our community are
still saying, "But the patient
doesn't look sick, and anyway we
have been treating him. What right
do you have to question our
diagnosis?" It would appear that
the time has come to seek a new
physician and a new set of
priorities.
Student Responsibility
"You face a set of decisions
which are really symbolic of a
major national and international
crisis."
This statement by Dr. Kenneth
Pitzer to the Stanford Board of
Trustees is equally applicable to
every student, faculty, and staff
member on this campus. The
responsibility for our lives, our
future, and our University cannot
be delegated to a wise set of
oligarchs. This is a democracy and
ultimately every individual must
make his own decision. The
students at the AEL have made
their decision. They are described
as "a small percentage of the
Stanford student body." But, in
effect, they are speaking for all
students.
We feel that every student has
a choice to make at this time.
Their alternatives are basically
two. He (or she) can seriously
evaluate the problems we face,
and speak out in an attempt to
find a solution. Or he can
continue to pretend that these
problems do not concern him or
his future. As ASSU co-presidents
we will encourage every individual
to make up his own mind by the
rational process which is
fundamental to a University. But
ignoring the basic rights of a
democracy by remaining silent
and unconcerned is, at this time,
the height of irresponsibility. A
"silent majority" gives up any
claim to the future.
Cory
Eckhard and I envision student
government as a force pushing for
greater university participation in
public affairs. We propose the
establishment of a Department of
Urban and Environmental Studies,
which would take an

interdisciplinary approach to the
solutions of the major problems
confronting urban areas, such as
transportation, pollution and
housing. Under this department
one could not only bring in the
talents and resources of a variety
of departments, but also establish
individual programs whereby
students would be able to receive
academic credit for research and
field work in communities and
urban areas.
The creating of this department
should be only the first of many
steps taken to reorient education
and research at Stanford in order
to increase the relevance of both
the university to society and of
education to the individual. For
example, this department should
be encouraged to draw heavily on
the ample research facilities of
SRI. Urban problems currently
form a significant portion of the
Institute's research activities. By
expanding these efforts SRI could
better serve the vital interests of
the community and the students.
Regarding SRI and the
University, we have been told that
the negotiations process cannot
aid the implementation of these
needed changes. It is disturbing to
hear this verdict rendered on the
eve of a long-awaited
student-faculty report on the
future of SRI.
Tomorrow this report will be
issued to the entire Stanford
community. Two days later the
Academic Senate will meet in
urgent deliberation over the new
proposals. By the end of the week
every student and faculty member
will receive by mail a detailed
ballot concerning CBW, SRI and
related questions pertinent to
research and the university. This
schedule represents the
culmination of months of effort
by concerned students, faculty
and members of the
administration. To dismiss
negotiations as inevitably
non-productive is to frustrate the
efforts of these individuals, to
fragment our support, and
ultimately, to jeopardize the goals
for which we all share a common
concern.
While these issues are of great
interest to the Stanford
community, we hope that their
importance does not obscure
other problems that are relevant
to education at Stanford.
In the past year we have
witnessed an erosion of
governmental responsibility, in
which the open forum of student
government has been replaced by
an elite group which recognizes
the legitimacy of majority student
opinion only when it conforms to
their pre-conceived notions. We
feel strongly that government
should fulfill a representative
function, and to that end we offer
leadership that adheres to
democratic principles.
An additional problem is that
the great diversity of opinion on
campus has not been adequately
reflected by the Daily's editorial
and news coverage. We cannot
expect one journal to represent all
interests and points of view, so we
therefore subsidizing a
variety of other newsletters to
give balanced coverage to such
divergent groups as the BSU, the
I-Center and the YR's. To further
encourage the expression of
varying opinions we believe that
any individual, not only those
belonging to organizations, should
have the right to express his
opinion and address rallies in
White Plaza.

Finally, we recognize the
severe and inexcusable housing
shortage. We will undertake all
necessary steps to obtain more
and better housing for both
graduate and undergraduate
students.
Stanford
31
1. Our first reason for running
is to institute participatory
democracy at the top, with 31
Presidents to rotate DAILY.
2. Secondly, most other
candidates who may consider
themselves major campus
personalities with much to lose or

gain, have failed, or feared to take
concrete stands on the issues.
Being "jokers in the pack"
however, we can take clear and
concrete stands in our Platform,
for whatever constructive value it
may have.
Platform
1. THE ASSU SHOULD NOT
BE IMPOSED INVOLUNTARILY
ON STUDENTS; it must become
voluntary, like the GRADUATE
STUDENT ASSOCIATION. It is
only in this context that it will be
an independent spokesman for
students. The administration need
not retain petty student officers
to administrate petty tasks for
them.
2. Until such a transformation
(1) WE SUPPORT THE HAYES
CONSTITUTION WITHOUT
RESERVATIONS. The unspoken
"reservations" of other candidates
may be dealt with later. Now, the
HAYES CONSTITUTION must
be accepted so that ASSU will not
be strangled by LASSU.
3. To create a greater sense of
community, and provide

recreation, we support
construction of a LOUIS AGAZZI
GLACIER MEMORIAL PARK
ON FRENCHMAN'S HILL WITH
CAMPSITES.
4. 500-1 000 BLACK,
BROWN, AND INDIAN, AND
OTHER MINORITIES,
ENROLLED IN STANFORD as
soon as possible, is not too much
to ask of this university. We must
not lay down our moral burdens
when the present goal of 350 is
reached.
Furthermore: WE SUPPORT
ALL 11 BSU DEMANDS, with
the exception of the first (Which
demands dismissal of Dr. Koff).
Furthermore: WE BELIEVE
THAT THE ASSU SHOULD
ACTIVELY TAKE PART IN
INTENSIVE RECRUITMENT OF
SAID MINORITY STUDENTS.
5. THERE MUST BE 16
HOURS OF DAYLIGHT.
6. SRI MUST BE SEVERED,
FROM THE GOVERNMENT,
NOT FROM STANFORD
CHEMICAL ANDBIOLOGICAL
WARFARE, AND ALL
, DEFENSE CONTRACTS
MILITATE (LITERALLY)
AGAINST THE ACADEMIC
" SPIRIT OF A UNIVERSITY.
Defense, and political research
should be done by the
government itself, where it may
be politically opposed (as in the
ABM crisis).
7. ROTC SHOULD NOT BE
ACCREDITED; HOWEVER THE
ROTC PROGRAM SHOULD BE
ALLOWED TO CONTINUE ON
CAMPUS, AS THE COLLEGE
EDUCATED OFFICERS IT
SUPPLIES ARE ONE OF THE
FEW MODERATING FORCES
ON OUR MILITARY.
8. THE ASSU SHOULD
ESTABLISH A RENT CONTROL
BOARD to thoroughly investigate
the practices of landlords in
surrounding communities, and
protect and warn off-campus
students against abuses.
9. THE ASSU SHOULD
ESTABLISH A COMPULSORY
COURSE REVIEW PROGRAM,
IN WHICH STUDENTS MUST
SUBMIT A PASS-NEUTRAL
FAIL MARK ON EACH
PROFESSOR, before receiving his
own quarter report.
10. WITH OUR ESTIMATED
93 YEARS OF EXPERIENCE,
THE PRUDENCE OF AGE, AND
EXUBERANCE OF YOUTH
WILL BE MIRACULOUSLY
COMBINED.
11. THE STANFORD DAILY
SHOULD BE PUT ON A
SUBSCRIPTION BASIS, and
made financially independent of
the student political apparatus, or
the election of editor should be
| campus wide.
12. The only stand we have on
VIOLENCE is that we have no
stand; but we might SITDOWN on
it.
13. NOR DO WE HAVE A
STAND ON THE SAN
FRANCISCO EARTHQUAKE
although we do not believe that
this puts our platform on shaky
grounds.
Laird
I'm sick and I'm tired of this
whole campaign!
Every one of the candidates,
including myself, has
demonstrated a profound
understanding of politics by
taking a flexible stand on every
issue while using every gimmick
available to prove how well
qualified we are to hold office.
We've spoken of "support" and
"non-support" while others have
acted, and in their action
proclaimed a higher sense of
, purpose and interest in this
University than any of us. In
short, we've compromised our
souls and sold our guts for your
support and your vote.
The sad thing is that I can say
this about not just one, or two, or
most, but of all the candidates.
The funny thing is that the office
we seek has proven always in the
past to be one of such limited
power and served only to bolster
the prestige of the individual who
has gained it. Some of us are
sincere in our desire to change
that, but so have others been and
they have been beaten. Here we
are, candidates who say nothing
after an office which means
nothing. Which of us are you to
support? Perhaps you realize that
the absurd conclusion of this
absurd race is that one of us is
going to stand before the public at
large as representative of
Stanford's student body. Like so
many decisions, you must choose
the least of the list of evils with
little or no evidence to support
your choice.
I could speak now of issues,
but I would simply be repeating in
differertt phrases the statements
and beliefs of the other candidates
and the community in general.
You know how I stand—I'm a
Stanford liberal, but I'm only a
. man.
What more can I say?
"Born into a gathering of
valuers, whose values enslave me, I
attempted to free myself. Freed
from values, without which I am
lost, I searched for meaning. I
imagined that I searched alone: I
was wrong. There has come a
moment of small understanding."
I'm sick and I'm tired of this
whole campaign!

There is a great schism dividing
this unversity community into
two halves. One half believes that
changes in important issues must
be effected quickly through any
means of expression, legitimate or
otherwise. There is a second group
who react to this type of student
expression with an equal
conviction that change is only
necessary when effected through
the normal channels offered to
the members of this University. In
between these polarized sides, a
third group find themselves
sympathizing with the causes of
activist concern, but unable to
bring themselves to openly
support the tactics of pressure
politics. Student government has
done little to alleviate the
desperate situation we now find
ourselves in. There has been a void
of effective action by the student
government on the sensitive and
legitimate concerns of students at
this university. The results of this
inaction are the sit-ins of today
and last Spring.
No other candidates are
honestly speaking to the problem
of polarization of interest on this
campus. No other candidates are
offering imaginative and in-depth
programs that would attempt to
move us towards a reconciliation
of community. This cannot be
accomplished through vague
generalizations of what's wrong
with Stanford; they will not be
solved by barbeques on the Wilbur
Lawn or a Centrix telephone
system. They will not be solved
through enlarging the office of
presidency to four presidents.
Dave Harris and Peter Lyman did
not resign because the office .vas
too exhausting. They resigned
because the framework of student
government as it exists here is
insensitive and unresponsive to
creative programs proposed; it is
inoperative. Making a LASSU of
the presidency is not the answer.
We have approached the
problems and issues honestly. We
have offered constructive
programs already in operation at
other universities to help meet the
problems here. We hope to make
the student government
framework more operable by
reorganizing its cumbersome
legislative structure. Our proposals
for experimental dorms, an
Applied Research Institute Fall

New Priorities
The problems facing the world
are awesome. • In our own
community we can see the effects
of racism, environmental
pollution, destruction of our
national resources, and an
uncontrolled growth of
population. There are no easy
solutions to them, and the old
priorities of national defense are
draining away those very energies
which we need so desperately. We
are indeed burning the candle at
both ends. The results of
proceeding in the present
directions at an ever increasing
pace should be obvious to all
members of the community. And
yet many of the more esteemed
members of our community are
still saying, "But the patient
doesn't look sick, and anyway we
have been treating him. What right
do you have to question our
diagnosis?" It would appear that
the time has come to seek a new
physician and a new set of
priorities.
Student Responsibility
"You face a set of decisions
which are really symbolic of a
major national and international
crisis."
This statement by Dr. Kenneth
Pitzer to the Stanford Board of
Trustees is equally applicable to
every student, faculty, and staff
member on this campus. The
responsibility for our lives, our
future, and our University cannot
be delegated to a wise set of
oligarchs. This is a democracy and
ultimately every individual must
make his own decision. The
students at the AEL have made
their decision. They are described
as "a small percentage of the
Stanford student body." But, in
effect, they are speaking for all
students.
We feel that every student has
a choice to make at this time.
Their alternatives are basically
two. He (or she) can seriously
evaluate the problems we face,
and speak out in an attempt to
find a solution. Or he can
continue to pretend that these
problems do not concern him or
his future. As ASSU co-presidents
we will encourage every individual
to make up his own mind by the
rational process which is
fundamental to a University. But
ignoring the basic rights of a
democracy by remaining silent
and unconcerned is, at this time,
the height of irresponsibility. A
"silent majority" gives up any
claim to the future.
Cory
Eckhard and I envision student
government as a force pushing for
greater university participation in
public affairs. We propose the
establishment of a Department of
Urban and Environmental Studies,
which would take an

interdisciplinary approach to the
solutions of the major problems
confronting urban areas, such as
transportation, pollution and
housing. Under this department
one could not only bring in the
talents and resources of a variety
of departments, but also establish
individual programs whereby
students would be able to receive
academic credit for research and
field work in communities and
urban areas.
The creating of this department
should be only the first of many
steps taken to reorient education
and research at Stanford in order
to increase the relevance of both
the university to society and of
education to the individual. For
example, this department should
be encouraged to draw heavily on
the ample research facilities of
SRI. Urban problems currently
form a significant portion of the
Institute's research activities. By
expanding these efforts SRI could
better serve the vital interests of
the community and the students.
Regarding SRI and the
University, we have been told that
the negotiations process cannot
aid the implementation of these
needed changes. It is disturbing to
hear this verdict rendered on the
eve of a long-awaited
student-faculty report on the
future of SRI.
Tomorrow this report will be
issued to the entire Stanford
community. Two days later the
Academic Senate will meet in
urgent deliberation over the new
proposals. By the end of the week
every student and faculty member
will receive by mail a detailed
ballot concerning CBW, SRI and
related questions pertinent to
research and the university. This
schedule represents the
culmination of months of effort
by concerned students, faculty
and members of the
administration. To dismiss
negotiations as inevitably
non-productive is to frustrate the
efforts of these individuals, to
fragment our support, and
ultimately, to jeopardize the goals
for which we all share a common
concern.
While these issues are of great
interest to the Stanford
community, we hope that their
importance does not obscure
other problems that are relevant
to education at Stanford.
In the past year we have
witnessed an erosion of
governmental responsibility, in
which the open forum of student
government has been replaced by
an elite group which recognizes
the legitimacy of majority student
opinion only when it conforms to
their pre-conceived notions. We
feel strongly that government
should fulfill a representative
function, and to that end we offer
leadership that adheres to
democratic principles.
An additional problem is that
the great diversity of opinion on
campus has not been adequately
reflected by the Daily's editorial
and news coverage. We cannot
expect one journal to represent all
interests and points of view, so we
therefore subsidizing a
variety of other newsletters to
give balanced coverage to such
divergent groups as the BSU, the
I-Center and the YR's. To further
encourage the expression of
varying opinions we believe that
any individual, not only those
belonging to organizations, should
have the right to express his
opinion and address rallies in
White Plaza.

Finally, we recognize the
severe and inexcusable housing
shortage. We will undertake all
necessary steps to obtain more
and better housing for both
graduate and undergraduate
students.
Stanford
31
1. Our first reason for running
is to institute participatory
democracy at the top, with 31
Presidents to rotate DAILY.
2. Secondly, most other
candidates who may consider
themselves major campus
personalities with much to lose or

gain, have failed, or feared to take
concrete stands on the issues.
Being "jokers in the pack"
however, we can take clear and
concrete stands in our Platform,
for whatever constructive value it
may have.
Platform
1. THE ASSU SHOULD NOT
BE IMPOSED INVOLUNTARILY
ON STUDENTS; it must become
voluntary, like the GRADUATE
STUDENT ASSOCIATION. It is
only in this context that it will be
an independent spokesman for
students. The administration need
not retain petty student officers
to administrate petty tasks for
them.
2. Until such a transformation
(1) WE SUPPORT THE HAYES
CONSTITUTION WITHOUT
RESERVATIONS. The unspoken
"reservations" of other candidates
may be dealt with later. Now, the
HAYES CONSTITUTION must
be accepted so that ASSU will not
be strangled by LASSU.
3. To create a greater sense of
community, and provide

recreation, we support
construction of a LOUIS AGAZZI
GLACIER MEMORIAL PARK
ON FRENCHMAN'S HILL WITH
CAMPSITES.
4. 500-1 000 BLACK,
BROWN, AND INDIAN, AND
OTHER MINORITIES,
ENROLLED IN STANFORD as
soon as possible, is not too much
to ask of this university. We must
not lay down our moral burdens
when the present goal of 350 is
reached.
Furthermore: WE SUPPORT
ALL 11 BSU DEMANDS, with
the exception of the first (Which
demands dismissal of Dr. Koff).
Furthermore: WE BELIEVE
THAT THE ASSU SHOULD
ACTIVELY TAKE PART IN
INTENSIVE RECRUITMENT OF
SAID MINORITY STUDENTS.
5. THERE MUST BE 16
HOURS OF DAYLIGHT.
6. SRI MUST BE SEVERED,
FROM THE GOVERNMENT,
NOT FROM STANFORD
CHEMICAL ANDBIOLOGICAL
WARFARE, AND ALL
, DEFENSE CONTRACTS
MILITATE (LITERALLY)
AGAINST THE ACADEMIC
" SPIRIT OF A UNIVERSITY.
Defense, and political research
should be done by the
government itself, where it may
be politically opposed (as in the
ABM crisis).
7. ROTC SHOULD NOT BE
ACCREDITED; HOWEVER THE
ROTC PROGRAM SHOULD BE
ALLOWED TO CONTINUE ON
CAMPUS, AS THE COLLEGE
EDUCATED OFFICERS IT
SUPPLIES ARE ONE OF THE
FEW MODERATING FORCES
ON OUR MILITARY.
8. THE ASSU SHOULD
ESTABLISH A RENT CONTROL
BOARD to thoroughly investigate
the practices of landlords in
surrounding communities, and
protect and warn off-campus
students against abuses.
9. THE ASSU SHOULD
ESTABLISH A COMPULSORY
COURSE REVIEW PROGRAM,
IN WHICH STUDENTS MUST
SUBMIT A PASS-NEUTRAL
FAIL MARK ON EACH
PROFESSOR, before receiving his
own quarter report.
10. WITH OUR ESTIMATED
93 YEARS OF EXPERIENCE,
THE PRUDENCE OF AGE, AND
EXUBERANCE OF YOUTH
WILL BE MIRACULOUSLY
COMBINED.
11. THE STANFORD DAILY
SHOULD BE PUT ON A
SUBSCRIPTION BASIS, and
made financially independent of
the student political apparatus, or
the election of editor should be
| campus wide.
12. The only stand we have on
VIOLENCE is that we have no
stand; but we might SITDOWN on
it.
13. NOR DO WE HAVE A
STAND ON THE SAN
FRANCISCO EARTHQUAKE
although we do not believe that
this puts our platform on shaky
grounds.
Laird
I'm sick and I'm tired of this
whole campaign!
Every one of the candidates,
including myself, has
demonstrated a profound
understanding of politics by
taking a flexible stand on every
issue while using every gimmick
available to prove how well
qualified we are to hold office.
We've spoken of "support" and
"non-support" while others have
acted, and in their action
proclaimed a higher sense of
, purpose and interest in this
University than any of us. In
short, we've compromised our
souls and sold our guts for your
support and your vote.
The sad thing is that I can say
this about not just one, or two, or
most, but of all the candidates.
The funny thing is that the office
we seek has proven always in the
past to be one of such limited
power and served only to bolster
the prestige of the individual who
has gained it. Some of us are
sincere in our desire to change
that, but so have others been and
they have been beaten. Here we
are, candidates who say nothing
after an office which means
nothing. Which of us are you to
support? Perhaps you realize that
the absurd conclusion of this
absurd race is that one of us is
going to stand before the public at
large as representative of
Stanford's student body. Like so
many decisions, you must choose
the least of the list of evils with
little or no evidence to support
your choice.
I could speak now of issues,
but I would simply be repeating in
differertt phrases the statements
and beliefs of the other candidates
and the community in general.
You know how I stand—I'm a
Stanford liberal, but I'm only a
. man.
What more can I say?
"Born into a gathering of
valuers, whose values enslave me, I
attempted to free myself. Freed
from values, without which I am
lost, I searched for meaning. I
imagined that I searched alone: I
was wrong. There has come a
moment of small understanding."
I'm sick and I'm tired of this
whole campaign!

Mattson
There is a great schism dividing
this unversity community into
two halves. One half believes that
changes in important issues must
be effected quickly through any
means of expression, legitimate or
otherwise. There is a second group
who react to this type of student
expression with an equal
conviction that change is only
necessary when effected through
the normal channels offered to
the members of this University. In
between these polarized sides, a
third group find themselves
sympathizing with the causes of
activist concern, but unable to
bring themselves to openly
support the tactics of pressure
politics. Student government has
done little to alleviate the
desperate situation we now find
ourselves in. There has been a void
of effective action by the student
government on the sensitive and
legitimate concerns of students at
this university. The results of this
inaction are the sit-ins of today
and last Spring.
No other candidates are
honestly speaking to the problem
of polarization of interest on this
campus. No other candidates are
offering imaginative and in-depth
programs that would attempt to
move us towards a reconciliation
of community. This cannot be
accomplished through vague
generalizations of what's wrong
with Stanford; they will not be
solved by barbeques on the Wilbur
Lawn or a Centrix telephone
system. They will not be solved
through enlarging the office of
presidency to four presidents.
Dave Harris and Peter Lyman did
not resign because the office .vas
too exhausting. They resigned
because the framework of student
government as it exists here is
insensitive and unresponsive to
creative programs proposed; it is
inoperative. Making a LASSU of
the presidency is not the answer.
We have approached the
problems and issues honestly. We
have offered constructive
programs already in operation at
other universities to help meet the
problems here. We hope to make
the student government
framework more operable by
reorganizing its cumbersome
legislative structure. Our proposals
for experimental dorms, an
Applied Research Institute Fall
Symposium, and a
Student-Fac ulty-Administration
Council offer an opportunity to
close the student schism and
provide the university with a
creative, powerful channel for
student expression through
student government. Although we
cannot elaborate on our proposals
in this limited space we invite
everyone to read our position
papers and see that we are
offering more than the usual spate
of generalizations.
Schneider
When those with conflicting
ideologies are unaware of the
middle ground which separates
them, the magnitude of their
differences seem irreconcilable,
and therefore, rather than
communicating in the spirit of
compromise, they speak only to
entrench themselves in their own
perspective. We need to reduce
this wasteful polarization by
involving more of those in the
middle of the political spectrum
in the affairs of the ASSU. Only
when the individual can identify
with those involved in the
decision-making process can he
relate to the decisions. This
applies not only to the neglected
middle, but also to the racial
minority students, whom
heretofore have had little, if no,
representation in student
government.
Most students are not
apathetic, but because they
cannot identify with student
government, they dismiss it as
being frivolous. The "left" has
played an inordinate role in
student government. And the
"right" in its response has
purported to speak for the silent
majority. We need to
de-emphasize the extremes by
involving more students from the
middle.
We need to involve minority
students in student government so
that not only can they seek to
improve the University by
working unilaterally with the
administration, but they can use
the "system" to their and our

advantage. In this way, the white
community would be more apt to
gain a better understanding of
their situation.
National and world problems
should be of the utmost concern
to us all. And as students, we have
a responsibility to effect social
and political change. But the first
commitment of a student body
officer is to the student and his
university - related interests and
needs. Through a more human
and relevant system of
communication with you, we feel
that we can best help you to meet
your needs while at Stanford.
Shea
The crucial task for students
now is maintaining the
momentum toward a powerful
student voice in education and the
affairs of the University. The
ASSU Presidency offers a
potential focal point for
strengthening and coordinating
the role of students in University
affairs. In the past, however, the
job has been too demanding for
one individual—two of the last
three incumbents have resigned.
The expectation of new student
demands and responsibilities
further emphasizes the need for a
stronger Executive Office.
We propose a Council of
Presidents: four individuals,
together responsible for
performing all the duties of the
ASSU Presidency. The Council
will meet daily; chairmanship of
the Council will rotate monthly
among the four. The chairman
will set the daily agenda, and will
exercise a tie-breaking vote.
A key strength of the Council
would be the specialized areas of
responsibility of each member.
Barry Askinas, President of the
Graduate Students Association
and a tutor in Otero, would be
concerned with the problems of
graduate students; he is presently
involved with the problem of
housing.
John Grube, former Assistant
Financial Manager for the ASSU
and a sponsor in Trancos, would
coordinate student activities
within the ASSU and organize the
publication of a student Course
Review.
Joyce Kobayashi, chairman of
the Biafran/Nigerian Relief Drive,
would work with the problems of
international students, such as
increasing interaction with
American students, organizing
courses taught by foreign
students, housing.
Pat Shea, currently a member
of the University Advisory
Committee, would work to
develop and improve
communication among students,
the faculty, the administration
and Trustees.
We are all members of the
Student Education Council and
have been actively participating in
the deliberations of the SES
recommendations. We regard
these deliberations as only a
beginning toward essential change
in education at Stanford.
Regarding our position with
respect to the demands of the
SRI-Coalition: we participated in
the April 9 SRI-Coalition meeting
and voted against the tactic of a
sit-in; we voted, however, for the
sit-in with a time limit. We have
since then participated in it to
varying degrees, feeling it most
important that the real issues of
concern not be lost in the
question of this particular tactic,
and that a point of inflexibility or
irreparable polarization not be
reached.
We find it a shame that only
illegitimate action has been
successful in opening up closed
channels of communication and
arousing campus-wide concern in
the issues.
We would work to achieve a
community where change can
occur long before confrontation
politics is the only recourse.
Pat Shea and John Grube will
appear on the ballot as candidates
for President and Vice-President,
respectively. If elected, they,
together with Barry Askinas and
Joyce Kobayashi, will assume the
responsibilities of the ASSU
Presidency.
Spiegel
Student government at
Stanford has failed because it has
put the cart before the horse—it
has made proposals and "urgent
requests" to the administration
without an independent power
base in the student body with
which to back up its requests.
Such a power base would consist
of a large group of students who
aio sufficiently concerned about a
particular problem to give
generously of their time and
ultimately to put themselves on
the line in support of what they
want done. Without this support
behind him, the ASSU president,
whether the competent and
hard-working Denis Hayes, or the
topless dancer who nearly beat
him, will remain an obscure and
somewhat comic figure, while the
really exciting and important
changes in the university will be
instigated by ad hoc groups such
as the SRI Coalition.
John Spiegel and Brad Cornell
are alone among the many ASSU

candidates in recognizing the need
for a student power base as a
prerequisite for effective student
government, and in proposing to
meet this need. We have outlined
how the president could inform,
organize, and mobilize students
around a particular issue through
articles in The Daily,
informational literature similar to
that of the SRI Coalition,
discussions in residences, and
open ASSU meetings. We seek at
once to inform and to be
informed by the student body,
and to develop a participatory
democracy where students make
individual commitments from
which emerges a collective
strength. We endorse the AEL
sit-in not only for the issue behind
it, but also as a confused and
often frustrated attempt to make
this collective strength felt.
Spiegel and Cornell propose to
use student power to bring about
fundamental change in the
university. We seek a radical
revision of Stanford's priorities—a
re-direction of resources to
teaching at the undergraduate
level, to campus housing, and to
educational innovation. Most
immediately, we seek a
re-direction of research away from
the development of weapons of
greater destruction to peaceful
and acutely needed projects. This
re-direction will not be achieved
through persuasion alone. The
pressure of a mobilized group of
concerned students is needed to
overcome the inertia and opposing
interests of Trustees, faculty, and
administration.
By the very nature of his
power base, the ASSU president
must be selective in what he
attempts beyond his role as a
persuasive lobbyist. We will work
for the implementation of the
April Third Coalition demands on
university research policy, and of
the SES proposals on
undergraduate education and
housing. To promise more is
either naive or misleading. To
promise anything without an
attempt to develop a student
power base offers nothing but a
perpetuation of the discredited
past tradition of Stanford student
government.

Finally, we recognize the
severe and inexcusable housing

I'm sick and I'm tired of this
whole campaign!
Every one of the candidates,
including myself, has
demonstrated a profound
understanding of politics by
taking a flexible stand on every
issue while using every gimmick
available to prove how well
qualified we are to hold office.
We've spoken of "support" and

The sad thing is that I can say
this about not just one, or two, or
most, but of all the candidates.
The funny thing is that the office
we seek has proven always in the
past to be one of such limited
power and served only to bolster
the prestige of the individual who
has gained it. Some of us are
sincere in our desire to change
that, but so have others been and
they have been beaten. Here we
are, candidates who say nothing
after an office which means
nothing. Which of us are you to
support? Perhaps you realize that
the absurd conclusion of this
absurd race is that one of us is
going to stand before the public at

Stanford's student body. Like so
many decisions, you must choose

Mattson
There is a great schism dividing
this unversity community into
two halves. One half believes that
changes in important issues must
be effected quickly through any
means of expression, legitimate or
otherwise. There is a second group
who react to this type of student
expression with an equal
conviction that change is only
necessary when effected through
the normal channels offered to
the members of this University. In
between these polarized sides, a
third group find themselves
sympathizing with the causes of
activist concern, but unable to
bring themselves to openly
support the tactics of pressure
politics. Student government has
done little to alleviate the
desperate situation we now find
ourselves in. There has been a void
of effective action by the student
government on the sensitive and
legitimate concerns of students at
this university. The results of this
inaction are the sit-ins of today
and last Spring.
No other candidates are
honestly speaking to the problem
of polarization of interest on this
campus. No other candidates are
offering imaginative and in-depth
programs that would attempt to
move us towards a reconciliation
of community. This cannot be
accomplished through vague
generalizations of what's wrong
with Stanford; they will not be
solved by barbeques on the Wilbur
Lawn or a Centrix telephone
system. They will not be solved
through enlarging the office of
presidency to four presidents.
Dave Harris and Peter Lyman did
not resign because the office .vas
too exhausting. They resigned
because the framework of student
government as it exists here is
insensitive and unresponsive to
creative programs proposed; it is
inoperative. Making a LASSU of
the presidency is not the answer.
We have approached the
problems and issues honestly. We
have offered constructive
programs already in operation at
other universities to help meet the
problems here. We hope to make
the student government
framework more operable by
reorganizing its cumbersome
legislative structure. Our proposals
for experimental dorms, an
Applied Research Institute Fall
Symposium, and a
Student-Fac ulty-Administration
Council offer an opportunity to
close the student schism and
provide the university with a
creative, powerful channel for
student expression through
student government. Although we
cannot elaborate on our proposals
in this limited space we invite
everyone to read our position
papers and see that we are
offering more than the usual spate
of generalizations.
Schneider
When those with conflicting
ideologies are unaware of the
middle ground which separates
them, the magnitude of their
differences seem irreconcilable,
and therefore, rather than
communicating in the spirit of
compromise, they speak only to
entrench themselves in their own
perspective. We need to reduce
this wasteful polarization by
involving more of those in the
middle of the political spectrum
in the affairs of the ASSU. Only
when the individual can identify
with those involved in the
decision-making process can he
relate to the decisions. This
applies not only to the neglected
middle, but also to the racial
minority students, whom
heretofore have had little, if no,
representation in student
government.
Most students are not
apathetic, but because they
cannot identify with student
government, they dismiss it as
being frivolous. The "left" has
played an inordinate role in
student government. And the
"right" in its response has
purported to speak for the silent
majority. We need to
de-emphasize the extremes by
involving more students from the
middle.
We need to involve minority
students in student government so
that not only can they seek to
improve the University by
working unilaterally with the
administration, but they can use
the "system" to their and our

advantage. In this way, the white
community would be more apt to
gain a better understanding of
their situation.
National and world problems
should be of the utmost concern
to us all. And as students, we have
a responsibility to effect social
and political change. But the first
commitment of a student body
officer is to the student and his
university - related interests and
needs. Through a more human
and relevant system of
communication with you, we feel
that we can best help you to meet
your needs while at Stanford.
Shea
The crucial task for students
now is maintaining the
momentum toward a powerful
student voice in education and the
affairs of the University. The
ASSU Presidency offers a
potential focal point for
strengthening and coordinating
the role of students in University
affairs. In the past, however, the
job has been too demanding for
one individual—two of the last
three incumbents have resigned.
The expectation of new student
demands and responsibilities
further emphasizes the need for a
stronger Executive Office.
We propose a Council of
Presidents: four individuals,
together responsible for
performing all the duties of the
ASSU Presidency. The Council
will meet daily; chairmanship of
the Council will rotate monthly
among the four. The chairman
will set the daily agenda, and will
exercise a tie-breaking vote.
A key strength of the Council
would be the specialized areas of
responsibility of each member.
Barry Askinas, President of the
Graduate Students Association
and a tutor in Otero, would be
concerned with the problems of
graduate students; he is presently
involved with the problem of
housing.
John Grube, former Assistant
Financial Manager for the ASSU
and a sponsor in Trancos, would
coordinate student activities
within the ASSU and organize the
publication of a student Course
Review.
Joyce Kobayashi, chairman of
the Biafran/Nigerian Relief Drive,
would work with the problems of
international students, such as
increasing interaction with
American students, organizing
courses taught by foreign
students, housing.
Pat Shea, currently a member
of the University Advisory
Committee, would work to
develop and improve
communication among students,
the faculty, the administration
and Trustees.
We are all members of the
Student Education Council and
have been actively participating in
the deliberations of the SES
recommendations. We regard
these deliberations as only a
beginning toward essential change
in education at Stanford.
Regarding our position with
respect to the demands of the
SRI-Coalition: we participated in
the April 9 SRI-Coalition meeting
and voted against the tactic of a
sit-in; we voted, however, for the
sit-in with a time limit. We have
since then participated in it to
varying degrees, feeling it most
important that the real issues of
concern not be lost in the
question of this particular tactic,
and that a point of inflexibility or
irreparable polarization not be
reached.
We find it a shame that only
illegitimate action has been
successful in opening up closed
channels of communication and
arousing campus-wide concern in
the issues.
We would work to achieve a
community where change can
occur long before confrontation
politics is the only recourse.
Pat Shea and John Grube will
appear on the ballot as candidates
for President and Vice-President,
respectively. If elected, they,
together with Barry Askinas and
Joyce Kobayashi, will assume the
responsibilities of the ASSU
Presidency.
Spiegel
Student government at
Stanford has failed because it has
put the cart before the horse—it
has made proposals and "urgent
requests" to the administration
without an independent power
base in the student body with
which to back up its requests.
Such a power base would consist
of a large group of students who
aio sufficiently concerned about a
particular problem to give
generously of their time and
ultimately to put themselves on
the line in support of what they
want done. Without this support
behind him, the ASSU president,
whether the competent and
hard-working Denis Hayes, or the
topless dancer who nearly beat
him, will remain an obscure and
somewhat comic figure, while the
really exciting and important
changes in the university will be
instigated by ad hoc groups such
as the SRI Coalition.
John Spiegel and Brad Cornell
are alone among the many ASSU

candidates in recognizing the need
for a student power base as a
prerequisite for effective student
government, and in proposing to
meet this need. We have outlined
how the president could inform,
organize, and mobilize students
around a particular issue through
articles in The Daily,
informational literature similar to
that of the SRI Coalition,
discussions in residences, and
open ASSU meetings. We seek at
once to inform and to be
informed by the student body,
and to develop a participatory
democracy where students make
individual commitments from
which emerges a collective
strength. We endorse the AEL
sit-in not only for the issue behind
it, but also as a confused and
often frustrated attempt to make
this collective strength felt.
Spiegel and Cornell propose to
use student power to bring about
fundamental change in the
university. We seek a radical
revision of Stanford's priorities—a
re-direction of resources to
teaching at the undergraduate
level, to campus housing, and to
educational innovation. Most
immediately, we seek a
re-direction of research away from
the development of weapons of
greater destruction to peaceful
and acutely needed projects. This
re-direction will not be achieved
through persuasion alone. The
pressure of a mobilized group of
concerned students is needed to
overcome the inertia and opposing
interests of Trustees, faculty, and
administration.
By the very nature of his
power base, the ASSU president
must be selective in what he
attempts beyond his role as a
persuasive lobbyist. We will work
for the implementation of the
April Third Coalition demands on
university research policy, and of
the SES proposals on
undergraduate education and
housing. To promise more is
either naive or misleading. To
promise anything without an
attempt to develop a student
power base offers nothing but a
perpetuation of the discredited
past tradition of Stanford student
government.
Wernick
Students have one political
function: to act as a power lobby!
Nobody listens unless you

howl. Capitalistic bourgeois
Stanford has not responded to
rational discussion through their
committees or any other means of
communication.
A new environment is to be
created if Allan and Larry are
elected. Allan Wernick and Larry
Gamble believe that students
should and will run this place, and
they will help the community
reach this goal. (Wernick and
Gamble don't want to run
Stanford—they want you to run
it.)
The sit-in at AEL is an example
of the student activism that Allan
and Larry support for this
university. Two things are very
important:
1. Students are acting on their
own initiative, doing what they
believe to be right, no matter
what the veiled threats from the
administration are . . .
2. Students are enjoying
themselves, and they now have
the chance to discuss the real
issues of our time outside of the
traditional structured classroom
situation . . .
SRI will not be stopped by
forming new committees to study
the problem—Sßl will be stopped
if we stop it by whatever means
necessary.
If Pitzer doesn't build new
housing, we will.
If trustees don't have open
meetings, we'll open them.
If courses we want aren't
taught, we will find someone to
teach them.
You can vote for a
committee-forming, issue-hiding
candidate (or half-assed multiple
candidate) and by doing so KISS
THE ESTABLISHMENT'S ASS.
You can vote for Wernick and
see something change-really
change.
Wernick is better qualified than
any other candidate—he has not,
and will not sit on any
committees, work for an impotent
though biased newspaper. Wernick
runs with no establishment
experience—he refuses to be
bound by assininity. He belongs
to no political organization.
Call him conservative .. . call
him radical . . . call him moderate
and you will be wrong, for he
cannot be limited—he is free, and
he will make you free. Free of the
bureaucratic nonsense other
candidates feed you, Wernick says
"Fuck that Shit." You will get
none of it from Wernick and
Gamble. Only Freedom!

New Priorities
The problems facing the world
are awesome. • In our own
community we can see the effects
of racism, environmental
pollution, destruction of our
national resources, and an
uncontrolled growth of
population. There are no easy
solutions to them, and the old
priorities of national defense are
draining away those very energies
which we need so desperately. We
are indeed burning the candle at
both ends. The results of
proceeding in the present
directions at an ever increasing
pace should be obvious to all
members of the community. And
yet many of the more esteemed
members of our community are
still saying, "But the patient
doesn't look sick, and anyway we
have been treating him. What right
do you have to question our
diagnosis?" It would appear that
the time has come to seek a new
physician and a new set of
priorities.
Student Responsibility
"You face a set of decisions
which are really symbolic of a
major national and international
crisis."
This statement by Dr. Kenneth
Pitzer to the Stanford Board of
Trustees is equally applicable to
every student, faculty, and staff
member on this campus. The
responsibility for our lives, our
future, and our University cannot
be delegated to a wise set of
oligarchs. This is a democracy and
ultimately every individual must
make his own decision. The
students at the AEL have made
their decision. They are described
as "a small percentage of the
Stanford student body." But, in
effect, they are speaking for all
students.
We feel that every student has
a choice to make at this time.
Their alternatives are basically
two. He (or she) can seriously
evaluate the problems we face,
and speak out in an attempt to
find a solution. Or he can
continue to pretend that these
problems do not concern him or
his future. As ASSU co-presidents
we will encourage every individual
to make up his own mind by the
rational process which is
fundamental to a University. But
ignoring the basic rights of a
democracy by remaining silent
and unconcerned is, at this time,
the height of irresponsibility. A
"silent majority" gives up any
claim to the future.
Cory
Eckhard and I envision student
government as a force pushing for
greater university participation in
public affairs. We propose the
establishment of a Department of
Urban and Environmental Studies,
which would take an

interdisciplinary approach to the
solutions of the major problems
confronting urban areas, such as
transportation, pollution and
housing. Under this department
one could not only bring in the
talents and resources of a variety
of departments, but also establish
individual programs whereby
students would be able to receive
academic credit for research and
field work in communities and
urban areas.
The creating of this department
should be only the first of many
steps taken to reorient education
and research at Stanford in order
to increase the relevance of both
the university to society and of
education to the individual. For
example, this department should
be encouraged to draw heavily on
the ample research facilities of
SRI. Urban problems currently
form a significant portion of the
Institute's research activities. By
expanding these efforts SRI could
better serve the vital interests of
the community and the students.
Regarding SRI and the
University, we have been told that
the negotiations process cannot
aid the implementation of these
needed changes. It is disturbing to
hear this verdict rendered on the
eve of a long-awaited
student-faculty report on the
future of SRI.
Tomorrow this report will be
issued to the entire Stanford
community. Two days later the
Academic Senate will meet in
urgent deliberation over the new
proposals. By the end of the week
every student and faculty member
will receive by mail a detailed
ballot concerning CBW, SRI and
related questions pertinent to
research and the university. This
schedule represents the
culmination of months of effort
by concerned students, faculty
and members of the
administration. To dismiss
negotiations as inevitably
non-productive is to frustrate the
efforts of these individuals, to
fragment our support, and
ultimately, to jeopardize the goals
for which we all share a common
concern.
While these issues are of great
interest to the Stanford
community, we hope that their
importance does not obscure
other problems that are relevant
to education at Stanford.
In the past year we have
witnessed an erosion of
governmental responsibility, in
which the open forum of student
government has been replaced by
an elite group which recognizes
the legitimacy of majority student
opinion only when it conforms to
their pre-conceived notions. We
feel strongly that government
should fulfill a representative
function, and to that end we offer
leadership that adheres to
democratic principles.
An additional problem is that
the great diversity of opinion on
campus has not been adequately
reflected by the Daily's editorial

expect one journal to represent all

the normal channels offered to
the members of this University. In
between these polarized sides, a
third group find themselves
sympathizing with the causes of
activist concern, but unable to
bring themselves to openly
support the tactics of pressure
politics. Student government has
done little to alleviate the
desperate situation we now find
ourselves in. There has been a void
of effective action by the student
government on the sensitive and
legitimate concerns of students at
this university. The results of this
inaction are the sit-ins of today
and last Spring.
No other candidates are
honestly speaking to the problem
of polarization of interest on this
campus. No other candidates are
offering imaginative and in-depth
programs that would attempt to
move us towards a reconciliation
of community. This cannot be
accomplished through vague
generalizations of what's wrong
with Stanford; they will not be
solved by barbeques on the Wilbur
Lawn or a Centrix telephone
system. They will not be solved
through enlarging the office of
presidency to four presidents.
Dave Harris and Peter Lyman did
not resign because the office .vas
too exhausting. They resigned
because the framework of student
government as it exists here is
insensitive and unresponsive to
creative programs proposed; it is
inoperative. Making a LASSU of
the presidency is not the answer.
We have approached the
problems and issues honestly. We
have offered constructive
programs already in operation at
other universities to help meet the
problems here. We hope to make
the student government
framework more operable by
reorganizing its cumbersome
legislative structure. Our proposals
for experimental dorms, an
Applied Research Institute Fall
Symposium, and a
Student-Fac ulty-Administration
Council offer an opportunity to
close the student schism and
provide the university with a
creative, powerful channel for
student expression through
student government. Although we
cannot elaborate on our proposals
in this limited space we invite
everyone to read our position
papers and see that we are
offering more than the usual spate
of generalizations.
Schneider
When those with conflicting
ideologies are unaware of the
middle ground which separates
them, the magnitude of their
differences seem irreconcilable,
and therefore, rather than
communicating in the spirit of
compromise, they speak only to
entrench themselves in their own
perspective. We need to reduce
this wasteful polarization by
involving more of those in the
middle of the political spectrum
in the affairs of the ASSU. Only
when the individual can identify
with those involved in the
decision-making process can he
relate to the decisions. This
applies not only to the neglected
middle, but also to the racial
minority students, whom
heretofore have had little, if no,
representation in student
government.
Most students are not
apathetic, but because they
cannot identify with student
government, they dismiss it as
being frivolous. The "left" has
played an inordinate role in
student government. And the
"right" in its response has
purported to speak for the silent
majority. We need to
de-emphasize the extremes by
involving more students from the
middle.
We need to involve minority
students in student government so
that not only can they seek to
improve the University by
working unilaterally with the
administration, but they can use
the "system" to their and our

advantage. In this way, the white
community would be more apt to
gain a better understanding of
their situation.
National and world problems
should be of the utmost concern
to us all. And as students, we have
a responsibility to effect social
and political change. But the first
commitment of a student body
officer is to the student and his
university - related interests and
needs. Through a more human
and relevant system of
communication with you, we feel
that we can best help you to meet
your needs while at Stanford.

The crucial task for students
now is maintaining the
momentum toward a powerful
student voice in education and the
affairs of the University. The
ASSU Presidency offers a
potential focal point for
strengthening and coordinating
the role of students in University
affairs. In the past, however, the
job has been too demanding for
one individual—two of the last
three incumbents have resigned.
The expectation of new student
demands and responsibilities
further emphasizes the need for a
stronger Executive Office.
We propose a Council of
Presidents: four individuals,
together responsible for
performing all the duties of the
ASSU Presidency. The Council
will meet daily; chairmanship of
the Council will rotate monthly
among the four. The chairman
will set the daily agenda, and will
exercise a tie-breaking vote.
A key strength of the Council
would be the specialized areas of

Barry Askinas, President of the
Graduate Students Association
and a tutor in Otero, would be
concerned with the problems of
graduate students; he is presently
involved with the problem of
housing.
John Grube, former Assistant
Financial Manager for the ASSU
and a sponsor in Trancos, would
coordinate student activities
within the ASSU and organize the
publication of a student Course
Review.
Joyce Kobayashi, chairman of
the Biafran/Nigerian Relief Drive,
would work with the problems of
international students, such as
increasing interaction with
American students, organizing
courses taught by foreign
students, housing.
Pat Shea, currently a member
of the University Advisory
Committee, would work to
develop and improve
communication among students,
the faculty, the administration

We are all members of the
Student Education Council and
have been actively participating in
the deliberations of the SES
recommendations. We regard
these deliberations as only a
beginning toward essential change
in education at Stanford.
Regarding our position with
respect to the demands of the
SRI-Coalition: we participated in
the April 9 SRI-Coalition meeting
and voted against the tactic of a
sit-in; we voted, however, for the
sit-in with a time limit. We have
since then participated in it to
varying degrees, feeling it most
important that the real issues of
concern not be lost in the
question of this particular tactic,
and that a point of inflexibility or
irreparable polarization not be
reached.
We find it a shame that only
illegitimate action has been
successful in opening up closed
channels of communication and
arousing campus-wide concern in
the issues.
We would work to achieve a
community where change can
occur long before confrontation
politics is the only recourse.
Pat Shea and John Grube will
appear on the ballot as candidates
for President and Vice-President,
respectively. If elected, they,
together with Barry Askinas and
Joyce Kobayashi, will assume the
responsibilities of the ASSU
Presidency.
Spiegel
Student government at
Stanford has failed because it has
put the cart before the horse—it
has made proposals and "urgent
requests" to the administration
without an independent power
base in the student body with
which to back up its requests.
Such a power base would consist
of a large group of students who
aio sufficiently concerned about a
particular problem to give
generously of their time and
ultimately to put themselves on
the line in support of what they
want done. Without this support
behind him, the ASSU president,
whether the competent and
hard-working Denis Hayes, or the
topless dancer who nearly beat
him, will remain an obscure and
somewhat comic figure, while the
really exciting and important
changes in the university will be
instigated by ad hoc groups such
as the SRI Coalition.
John Spiegel and Brad Cornell
are alone among the many ASSU

candidates in recognizing the need
for a student power base as a
prerequisite for effective student
government, and in proposing to
meet this need. We have outlined
how the president could inform,
organize, and mobilize students
around a particular issue through
articles in The Daily,
informational literature similar to
that of the SRI Coalition,
discussions in residences, and
open ASSU meetings. We seek at
once to inform and to be
informed by the student body,
and to develop a participatory
democracy where students make
individual commitments from
which emerges a collective
strength. We endorse the AEL
sit-in not only for the issue behind
it, but also as a confused and
often frustrated attempt to make
this collective strength felt.
Spiegel and Cornell propose to
use student power to bring about
fundamental change in the
university. We seek a radical
revision of Stanford's priorities—a
re-direction of resources to
teaching at the undergraduate
level, to campus housing, and to
educational innovation. Most
immediately, we seek a
re-direction of research away from
the development of weapons of
greater destruction to peaceful
and acutely needed projects. This
re-direction will not be achieved
through persuasion alone. The
pressure of a mobilized group of
concerned students is needed to
overcome the inertia and opposing
interests of Trustees, faculty, and
administration.
By the very nature of his
power base, the ASSU president
must be selective in what he
attempts beyond his role as a
persuasive lobbyist. We will work
for the implementation of the
April Third Coalition demands on
university research policy, and of
the SES proposals on
undergraduate education and
housing. To promise more is
either naive or misleading. To
promise anything without an
attempt to develop a student
power base offers nothing but a
perpetuation of the discredited
past tradition of Stanford student
government.
Wernick
Students have one political
function: to act as a power lobby!
Nobody listens unless you

howl. Capitalistic bourgeois
Stanford has not responded to
rational discussion through their
committees or any other means of
communication.
A new environment is to be
created if Allan and Larry are
elected. Allan Wernick and Larry
Gamble believe that students
should and will run this place, and
they will help the community
reach this goal. (Wernick and
Gamble don't want to run
Stanford—they want you to run
it.)
The sit-in at AEL is an example
of the student activism that Allan
and Larry support for this
university. Two things are very
important:
1. Students are acting on their
own initiative, doing what they
believe to be right, no matter
what the veiled threats from the
administration are . . .
2. Students are enjoying
themselves, and they now have
the chance to discuss the real
issues of our time outside of the
traditional structured classroom
situation . . .
SRI will not be stopped by
forming new committees to study
the problem—Sßl will be stopped
if we stop it by whatever means
necessary.
If Pitzer doesn't build new
housing, we will.
If trustees don't have open
meetings, we'll open them.
If courses we want aren't
taught, we will find someone to
teach them.
You can vote for a
committee-forming, issue-hiding
candidate (or half-assed multiple
candidate) and by doing so KISS
THE ESTABLISHMENT'S ASS.
You can vote for Wernick and
see something change-really
change.
Wernick is better qualified than
any other candidate—he has not,
and will not sit on any
committees, work for an impotent
though biased newspaper. Wernick
runs with no establishment
experience—he refuses to be
bound by assininity. He belongs
to no political organization.
Call him conservative .. . call
him radical . . . call him moderate
and you will be wrong, for he
cannot be limited—he is free, and
he will make you free. Free of the
bureaucratic nonsense other
candidates feed you, Wernick says
"Fuck that Shit." You will get
none of it from Wernick and
Gamble. Only Freedom!

New Priorities
The problems facing the world
are awesome. • In our own
community we can see the effects
of racism, environmental
pollution, destruction of our
national resources, and an
uncontrolled growth of
population. There are no easy
solutions to them, and the old
priorities of national defense are
draining away those very energies
which we need so desperately. We
are indeed burning the candle at
both ends. The results of
proceeding in the present
directions at an ever increasing
pace should be obvious to all
members of the community. And
yet many of the more esteemed
members of our community are
still saying, "But the patient
doesn't look sick, and anyway we
have been treating him. What right
do you have to question our
diagnosis?" It would appear that
the time has come to seek a new
physician and a new set of
priorities.
Student Responsibility
"You face a set of decisions
which are really symbolic of a
major national and international
crisis."
This statement by Dr. Kenneth
Pitzer to the Stanford Board of
Trustees is equally applicable to
every student, faculty, and staff
member on this campus. The
responsibility for our lives, our
future, and our University cannot
be delegated to a wise set of
oligarchs. This is a democracy and
ultimately every individual must
make his own decision. The
students at the AEL have made
their decision. They are described
as "a small percentage of the
Stanford student body." But, in
effect, they are speaking for all
students.
We feel that every student has
a choice to make at this time.
Their alternatives are basically
two. He (or she) can seriously
evaluate the problems we face,
and speak out in an attempt to
find a solution. Or he can
continue to pretend that these
problems do not concern him or
his future. As ASSU co-presidents
we will encourage every individual
to make up his own mind by the
rational process which is
fundamental to a University. But
ignoring the basic rights of a
democracy by remaining silent
and unconcerned is, at this time,
the height of irresponsibility. A
"silent majority" gives up any
claim to the future.
Cory
Eckhard and I envision student
government as a force pushing for
greater university participation in
public affairs. We propose the
establishment of a Department of
Urban and Environmental Studies,
which would take an

interdisciplinary approach to the
solutions of the major problems
confronting urban areas, such as
transportation, pollution and
housing. Under this department
one could not only bring in the
talents and resources of a variety
of departments, but also establish
individual programs whereby
students would be able to receive
academic credit for research and
field work in communities and
urban areas.
The creating of this department
should be only the first of many
steps taken to reorient education
and research at Stanford in order
to increase the relevance of both
the university to society and of
education to the individual. For
example, this department should
be encouraged to draw heavily on
the ample research facilities of
SRI. Urban problems currently
form a significant portion of the
Institute's research activities. By
expanding these efforts SRI could
better serve the vital interests of
the community and the students.
Regarding SRI and the
University, we have been told that
the negotiations process cannot
aid the implementation of these
needed changes. It is disturbing to
hear this verdict rendered on the
eve of a long-awaited
student-faculty report on the
future of SRI.
Tomorrow this report will be
issued to the entire Stanford
community. Two days later the
Academic Senate will meet in
urgent deliberation over the new
proposals. By the end of the week
every student and faculty member
will receive by mail a detailed
ballot concerning CBW, SRI and
related questions pertinent to
research and the university. This
schedule represents the
culmination of months of effort
by concerned students, faculty
and members of the
administration. To dismiss
negotiations as inevitably
non-productive is to frustrate the
efforts of these individuals, to
fragment our support, and
ultimately, to jeopardize the goals
for which we all share a common
concern.
While these issues are of great
interest to the Stanford
community, we hope that their
importance does not obscure
other problems that are relevant
to education at Stanford.
In the past year we have
witnessed an erosion of
governmental responsibility, in
which the open forum of student
government has been replaced by
an elite group which recognizes
the legitimacy of majority student
opinion only when it conforms to
their pre-conceived notions. We
feel strongly that government
should fulfill a representative
function, and to that end we offer
leadership that adheres to
democratic principles.
An additional problem is that
the great diversity of opinion on
campus has not been adequately
reflected by the Daily's editorial
and news coverage. We cannot
expect one journal to represent all
interests and points of view, so we
therefore subsidizing a
variety of other newsletters to
give balanced coverage to such
divergent groups as the BSU, the
I-Center and the YR's. To further
encourage the expression of
varying opinions we believe that
any individual, not only those
belonging to organizations, should
have the right to express his
opinion and address rallies in
White Plaza.

Finally, we recognize the
severe and inexcusable housing
shortage. We will undertake all
necessary steps to obtain more
and better housing for both
graduate and undergraduate
students.
Stanford
31
1. Our first reason for running
is to institute participatory
democracy at the top, with 31
Presidents to rotate DAILY.
2. Secondly, most other
candidates who may consider
themselves major campus
personalities with much to lose or

gain, have failed, or feared to take
concrete stands on the issues.
Being "jokers in the pack"
however, we can take clear and
concrete stands in our Platform,
for whatever constructive value it
may have.
Platform
1. THE ASSU SHOULD NOT
BE IMPOSED INVOLUNTARILY
ON STUDENTS; it must become
voluntary, like the GRADUATE
STUDENT ASSOCIATION. It is
only in this context that it will be
an independent spokesman for
students. The administration need
not retain petty student officers
to administrate petty tasks for
them.
2. Until such a transformation
(1) WE SUPPORT THE HAYES
CONSTITUTION WITHOUT
RESERVATIONS. The unspoken
"reservations" of other candidates
may be dealt with later. Now, the
HAYES CONSTITUTION must
be accepted so that ASSU will not
be strangled by LASSU.
3. To create a greater sense of
community, and provide

recreation, we support
construction of a LOUIS AGAZZI
GLACIER MEMORIAL PARK
ON FRENCHMAN'S HILL WITH
CAMPSITES.
4. 500-1 000 BLACK,
BROWN, AND INDIAN, AND
OTHER MINORITIES,
ENROLLED IN STANFORD as
soon as possible, is not too much
to ask of this university. We must
not lay down our moral burdens
when the present goal of 350 is
reached.
Furthermore: WE SUPPORT
ALL 11 BSU DEMANDS, with
the exception of the first (Which
demands dismissal of Dr. Koff).
Furthermore: WE BELIEVE
THAT THE ASSU SHOULD
ACTIVELY TAKE PART IN
INTENSIVE RECRUITMENT OF
SAID MINORITY STUDENTS.
5. THERE MUST BE 16
HOURS OF DAYLIGHT.
6. SRI MUST BE SEVERED,
FROM THE GOVERNMENT,
NOT FROM STANFORD
CHEMICAL ANDBIOLOGICAL
WARFARE, AND ALL
, DEFENSE CONTRACTS
MILITATE (LITERALLY)
AGAINST THE ACADEMIC
" SPIRIT OF A UNIVERSITY.
Defense, and political research
should be done by the
government itself, where it may
be politically opposed (as in the
ABM crisis).
7. ROTC SHOULD NOT BE
ACCREDITED; HOWEVER THE
ROTC PROGRAM SHOULD BE
ALLOWED TO CONTINUE ON
CAMPUS, AS THE COLLEGE
EDUCATED OFFICERS IT
SUPPLIES ARE ONE OF THE
FEW MODERATING FORCES
ON OUR MILITARY.
8. THE ASSU SHOULD
ESTABLISH A RENT CONTROL
BOARD to thoroughly investigate
the practices of landlords in
surrounding communities, and
protect and warn off-campus
students against abuses.
9. THE ASSU SHOULD
ESTABLISH A COMPULSORY
COURSE REVIEW PROGRAM,
IN WHICH STUDENTS MUST
SUBMIT A PASS-NEUTRAL
FAIL MARK ON EACH
PROFESSOR, before receiving his
own quarter report.
10. WITH OUR ESTIMATED
93 YEARS OF EXPERIENCE,
THE PRUDENCE OF AGE, AND
EXUBERANCE OF YOUTH
WILL BE MIRACULOUSLY
COMBINED.
11. THE STANFORD DAILY
SHOULD BE PUT ON A
SUBSCRIPTION BASIS, and
made financially independent of
the student political apparatus, or
the election of editor should be
| campus wide.
12. The only stand we have on
VIOLENCE is that we have no
stand; but we might SITDOWN on
it.
13. NOR DO WE HAVE A
STAND ON THE SAN
FRANCISCO EARTHQUAKE
although we do not believe that
this puts our platform on shaky
grounds.
Laird
I'm sick and I'm tired of this
whole campaign!
Every one of the candidates,
including myself, has
demonstrated a profound
understanding of politics by
taking a flexible stand on every
issue while using every gimmick
available to prove how well
qualified we are to hold office.
We've spoken of "support" and
"non-support" while others have
acted, and in their action
proclaimed a higher sense of
, purpose and interest in this
University than any of us. In
short, we've compromised our
souls and sold our guts for your
support and your vote.
The sad thing is that I can say
this about not just one, or two, or
most, but of all the candidates.
The funny thing is that the office
we seek has proven always in the
past to be one of such limited
power and served only to bolster
the prestige of the individual who
has gained it. Some of us are
sincere in our desire to change
that, but so have others been and
they have been beaten. Here we
are, candidates who say nothing
after an office which means
nothing. Which of us are you to
support? Perhaps you realize that
the absurd conclusion of this
absurd race is that one of us is
going to stand before the public at
large as representative of
Stanford's student body. Like so
many decisions, you must choose
the least of the list of evils with
little or no evidence to support
your choice.
I could speak now of issues,
but I would simply be repeating in
differertt phrases the statements
and beliefs of the other candidates
and the community in general.
You know how I stand—I'm a
Stanford liberal, but I'm only a
. man.
What more can I say?
"Born into a gathering of
valuers, whose values enslave me, I
attempted to free myself. Freed
from values, without which I am
lost, I searched for meaning. I
imagined that I searched alone: I
was wrong. There has come a
moment of small understanding."
I'm sick and I'm tired of this
whole campaign!

There is a great schism dividing
this unversity community into
two halves. One half believes that

otherwise. There is a second group

expression with an equal
conviction that change is only
necessary when effected through

individual commitments from
which emerges a collective

the development of weapons of
greater destruction to peaceful
and acutely needed projects. This
re-direction will not be achieved
through persuasion alone. The
pressure of a mobilized group of
concerned students is needed to
overcome the inertia and opposing
interests of Trustees, faculty, and

By the very nature of his

must be selective in what he

Stanford has not responded to

2. Students are enjoying

If Pitzer doesn't build new

New Priorities
The problems facing the world
are awesome. • In our own
community we can see the effects
of racism, environmental
pollution, destruction of our
national resources, and an
uncontrolled growth of
population. There are no easy
solutions to them, and the old
priorities of national defense are
draining away those very energies
which we need so desperately. We
are indeed burning the candle at
both ends. The results of
proceeding in the present
directions at an ever increasing
pace should be obvious to all
members of the community. And
yet many of the more esteemed
members of our community are
still saying, "But the patient
doesn't look sick, and anyway we
have been treating him. What right
do you have to question our
diagnosis?" It would appear that
the time has come to seek a new
physician and a new set of
priorities.
Student Responsibility
"You face a set of decisions
which are really symbolic of a
major national and international
crisis."
This statement by Dr. Kenneth
Pitzer to the Stanford Board of
Trustees is equally applicable to
every student, faculty, and staff
member on this campus. The
responsibility for our lives, our
future, and our University cannot
be delegated to a wise set of
oligarchs. This is a democracy and
ultimately every individual must
make his own decision. The
students at the AEL have made
their decision. They are described
as "a small percentage of the
Stanford student body." But, in
effect, they are speaking for all
students.
We feel that every student has
a choice to make at this time.
Their alternatives are basically
two. He (or she) can seriously
evaluate the problems we face,
and speak out in an attempt to
find a solution. Or he can
continue to pretend that these
problems do not concern him or
his future. As ASSU co-presidents
we will encourage every individual
to make up his own mind by the
rational process which is
fundamental to a University. But
ignoring the basic rights of a
democracy by remaining silent
and unconcerned is, at this time,
the height of irresponsibility. A
"silent majority" gives up any
claim to the future.
Cory
Eckhard and I envision student
government as a force pushing for
greater university participation in
public affairs. We propose the
establishment of a Department of
Urban and Environmental Studies,
which would take an

interdisciplinary approach to the
solutions of the major problems
confronting urban areas, such as
transportation, pollution and
housing. Under this department
one could not only bring in the
talents and resources of a variety
of departments, but also establish
individual programs whereby
students would be able to receive
academic credit for research and
field work in communities and
urban areas.
The creating of this department
should be only the first of many
steps taken to reorient education
and research at Stanford in order
to increase the relevance of both
the university to society and of
education to the individual. For
example, this department should
be encouraged to draw heavily on
the ample research facilities of
SRI. Urban problems currently
form a significant portion of the
Institute's research activities. By
expanding these efforts SRI could
better serve the vital interests of
the community and the students.
Regarding SRI and the
University, we have been told that
the negotiations process cannot
aid the implementation of these
needed changes. It is disturbing to
hear this verdict rendered on the
eve of a long-awaited
student-faculty report on the
future of SRI.
Tomorrow this report will be
issued to the entire Stanford
community. Two days later the
Academic Senate will meet in
urgent deliberation over the new
proposals. By the end of the week
every student and faculty member
will receive by mail a detailed
ballot concerning CBW, SRI and
related questions pertinent to
research and the university. This
schedule represents the
culmination of months of effort
by concerned students, faculty
and members of the
administration. To dismiss
negotiations as inevitably
non-productive is to frustrate the
efforts of these individuals, to
fragment our support, and
ultimately, to jeopardize the goals
for which we all share a common
concern.
While these issues are of great
interest to the Stanford
community, we hope that their
importance does not obscure
other problems that are relevant
to education at Stanford.
In the past year we have
witnessed an erosion of
governmental responsibility, in
which the open forum of student
government has been replaced by
an elite group which recognizes
the legitimacy of majority student
opinion only when it conforms to
their pre-conceived notions. We
feel strongly that government
should fulfill a representative
function, and to that end we offer
leadership that adheres to
democratic principles.
An additional problem is that
the great diversity of opinion on
campus has not been adequately
reflected by the Daily's editorial
and news coverage. We cannot
expect one journal to represent all
interests and points of view, so we
therefore subsidizing a
variety of other newsletters to
give balanced coverage to such
divergent groups as the BSU, the
I-Center and the YR's. To further
encourage the expression of
varying opinions we believe that
any individual, not only those
belonging to organizations, should
have the right to express his
opinion and address rallies in
White Plaza.

Finally, we recognize the
severe and inexcusable housing
shortage. We will undertake all
necessary steps to obtain more
and better housing for both
graduate and undergraduate
students.
Stanford
31
1. Our first reason for running
is to institute participatory
democracy at the top, with 31
Presidents to rotate DAILY.
2. Secondly, most other
candidates who may consider
themselves major campus
personalities with much to lose or

gain, have failed, or feared to take
concrete stands on the issues.
Being "jokers in the pack"
however, we can take clear and
concrete stands in our Platform,
for whatever constructive value it
may have.
Platform
1. THE ASSU SHOULD NOT
BE IMPOSED INVOLUNTARILY
ON STUDENTS; it must become
voluntary, like the GRADUATE
STUDENT ASSOCIATION. It is
only in this context that it will be
an independent spokesman for
students. The administration need
not retain petty student officers
to administrate petty tasks for
them.
2. Until such a transformation
(1) WE SUPPORT THE HAYES
CONSTITUTION WITHOUT
RESERVATIONS. The unspoken
"reservations" of other candidates
may be dealt with later. Now, the
HAYES CONSTITUTION must
be accepted so that ASSU will not
be strangled by LASSU.
3. To create a greater sense of
community, and provide

recreation, we support
construction of a LOUIS AGAZZI
GLACIER MEMORIAL PARK
ON FRENCHMAN'S HILL WITH
CAMPSITES.
4. 500-1 000 BLACK,
BROWN, AND INDIAN, AND
OTHER MINORITIES,
ENROLLED IN STANFORD as
soon as possible, is not too much
to ask of this university. We must
not lay down our moral burdens
when the present goal of 350 is
reached.
Furthermore: WE SUPPORT
ALL 11 BSU DEMANDS, with
the exception of the first (Which
demands dismissal of Dr. Koff).
Furthermore: WE BELIEVE
THAT THE ASSU SHOULD
ACTIVELY TAKE PART IN
INTENSIVE RECRUITMENT OF
SAID MINORITY STUDENTS.
5. THERE MUST BE 16
HOURS OF DAYLIGHT.
6. SRI MUST BE SEVERED,
FROM THE GOVERNMENT,
NOT FROM STANFORD
CHEMICAL ANDBIOLOGICAL
WARFARE, AND ALL
, DEFENSE CONTRACTS
MILITATE (LITERALLY)
AGAINST THE ACADEMIC
" SPIRIT OF A UNIVERSITY.
Defense, and political research
should be done by the
government itself, where it may
be politically opposed (as in the
ABM crisis).
7. ROTC SHOULD NOT BE
ACCREDITED; HOWEVER THE
ROTC PROGRAM SHOULD BE
ALLOWED TO CONTINUE ON
CAMPUS, AS THE COLLEGE
EDUCATED OFFICERS IT
SUPPLIES ARE ONE OF THE
FEW MODERATING FORCES
ON OUR MILITARY.
8. THE ASSU SHOULD
ESTABLISH A RENT CONTROL
BOARD to thoroughly investigate
the practices of landlords in
surrounding communities, and
protect and warn off-campus
students against abuses.
9. THE ASSU SHOULD
ESTABLISH A COMPULSORY
COURSE REVIEW PROGRAM,
IN WHICH STUDENTS MUST
SUBMIT A PASS-NEUTRAL
FAIL MARK ON EACH
PROFESSOR, before receiving his
own quarter report.
10. WITH OUR ESTIMATED
93 YEARS OF EXPERIENCE,
THE PRUDENCE OF AGE, AND
EXUBERANCE OF YOUTH
WILL BE MIRACULOUSLY
COMBINED.
11. THE STANFORD DAILY
SHOULD BE PUT ON A
SUBSCRIPTION BASIS, and
made financially independent of
the student political apparatus, or
the election of editor should be
| campus wide.
12. The only stand we have on
VIOLENCE is that we have no
stand; but we might SITDOWN on
it.
13. NOR DO WE HAVE A
STAND ON THE SAN
FRANCISCO EARTHQUAKE
although we do not believe that
this puts our platform on shaky
grounds.
Laird
I'm sick and I'm tired of this
whole campaign!
Every one of the candidates,
including myself, has
demonstrated a profound
understanding of politics by
taking a flexible stand on every
issue while using every gimmick
available to prove how well
qualified we are to hold office.
We've spoken of "support" and
"non-support" while others have
acted, and in their action
proclaimed a higher sense of
, purpose and interest in this
University than any of us. In
short, we've compromised our
souls and sold our guts for your
support and your vote.
The sad thing is that I can say
this about not just one, or two, or
most, but of all the candidates.
The funny thing is that the office
we seek has proven always in the
past to be one of such limited
power and served only to bolster
the prestige of the individual who
has gained it. Some of us are
sincere in our desire to change
that, but so have others been and
they have been beaten. Here we
are, candidates who say nothing
after an office which means
nothing. Which of us are you to
support? Perhaps you realize that
the absurd conclusion of this
absurd race is that one of us is
going to stand before the public at
large as representative of
Stanford's student body. Like so
many decisions, you must choose
the least of the list of evils with
little or no evidence to support
your choice.
I could speak now of issues,
but I would simply be repeating in
differertt phrases the statements
and beliefs of the other candidates
and the community in general.
You know how I stand—I'm a
Stanford liberal, but I'm only a
. man.
What more can I say?
"Born into a gathering of
valuers, whose values enslave me, I
attempted to free myself. Freed
from values, without which I am
lost, I searched for meaning. I
imagined that I searched alone: I
was wrong. There has come a
moment of small understanding."
I'm sick and I'm tired of this
whole campaign!

Mattson
There is a great schism dividing
this unversity community into
two halves. One half believes that
changes in important issues must
be effected quickly through any
means of expression, legitimate or
otherwise. There is a second group
who react to this type of student
expression with an equal
conviction that change is only
necessary when effected through
the normal channels offered to
the members of this University. In
between these polarized sides, a
third group find themselves
sympathizing with the causes of
activist concern, but unable to
bring themselves to openly
support the tactics of pressure
politics. Student government has
done little to alleviate the
desperate situation we now find
ourselves in. There has been a void
of effective action by the student
government on the sensitive and
legitimate concerns of students at
this university. The results of this
inaction are the sit-ins of today
and last Spring.
No other candidates are
honestly speaking to the problem
of polarization of interest on this
campus. No other candidates are
offering imaginative and in-depth
programs that would attempt to
move us towards a reconciliation
of community. This cannot be
accomplished through vague
generalizations of what's wrong
with Stanford; they will not be
solved by barbeques on the Wilbur
Lawn or a Centrix telephone
system. They will not be solved
through enlarging the office of
presidency to four presidents.
Dave Harris and Peter Lyman did
not resign because the office .vas
too exhausting. They resigned
because the framework of student
government as it exists here is
insensitive and unresponsive to
creative programs proposed; it is
inoperative. Making a LASSU of
the presidency is not the answer.
We have approached the
problems and issues honestly. We
have offered constructive
programs already in operation at
other universities to help meet the
problems here. We hope to make
the student government
framework more operable by
reorganizing its cumbersome
legislative structure. Our proposals
for experimental dorms, an
Applied Research Institute Fall
Symposium, and a
Student-Fac ulty-Administration
Council offer an opportunity to
close the student schism and
provide the university with a
creative, powerful channel for
student expression through
student government. Although we
cannot elaborate on our proposals
in this limited space we invite
everyone to read our position
papers and see that we are
offering more than the usual spate
of generalizations.
Schneider
When those with conflicting
ideologies are unaware of the
middle ground which separates
them, the magnitude of their
differences seem irreconcilable,
and therefore, rather than
communicating in the spirit of
compromise, they speak only to
entrench themselves in their own
perspective. We need to reduce
this wasteful polarization by
involving more of those in the
middle of the political spectrum
in the affairs of the ASSU. Only
when the individual can identify
with those involved in the
decision-making process can he
relate to the decisions. This
applies not only to the neglected
middle, but also to the racial
minority students, whom
heretofore have had little, if no,
representation in student
government.
Most students are not
apathetic, but because they
cannot identify with student
government, they dismiss it as
being frivolous. The "left" has
played an inordinate role in
student government. And the
"right" in its response has
purported to speak for the silent
majority. We need to
de-emphasize the extremes by
involving more students from the
middle.
We need to involve minority
students in student government so
that not only can they seek to
improve the University by
working unilaterally with the
administration, but they can use
the "system" to their and our

advantage. In this way, the white
community would be more apt to
gain a better understanding of
their situation.
National and world problems
should be of the utmost concern
to us all. And as students, we have
a responsibility to effect social
and political change. But the first
commitment of a student body
officer is to the student and his
university - related interests and
needs. Through a more human
and relevant system of
communication with you, we feel
that we can best help you to meet
your needs while at Stanford.
Shea
The crucial task for students
now is maintaining the
momentum toward a powerful
student voice in education and the
affairs of the University. The
ASSU Presidency offers a
potential focal point for
strengthening and coordinating
the role of students in University
affairs. In the past, however, the
job has been too demanding for
one individual—two of the last
three incumbents have resigned.
The expectation of new student
demands and responsibilities
further emphasizes the need for a
stronger Executive Office.
We propose a Council of
Presidents: four individuals,
together responsible for
performing all the duties of the
ASSU Presidency. The Council
will meet daily; chairmanship of
the Council will rotate monthly
among the four. The chairman
will set the daily agenda, and will
exercise a tie-breaking vote.
A key strength of the Council
would be the specialized areas of
responsibility of each member.
Barry Askinas, President of the
Graduate Students Association
and a tutor in Otero, would be
concerned with the problems of
graduate students; he is presently
involved with the problem of
housing.
John Grube, former Assistant
Financial Manager for the ASSU
and a sponsor in Trancos, would
coordinate student activities
within the ASSU and organize the
publication of a student Course
Review.
Joyce Kobayashi, chairman of
the Biafran/Nigerian Relief Drive,
would work with the problems of
international students, such as
increasing interaction with
American students, organizing
courses taught by foreign
students, housing.
Pat Shea, currently a member
of the University Advisory
Committee, would work to
develop and improve
communication among students,
the faculty, the administration
and Trustees.
We are all members of the
Student Education Council and
have been actively participating in
the deliberations of the SES
recommendations. We regard
these deliberations as only a
beginning toward essential change
in education at Stanford.
Regarding our position with
respect to the demands of the
SRI-Coalition: we participated in
the April 9 SRI-Coalition meeting
and voted against the tactic of a
sit-in; we voted, however, for the
sit-in with a time limit. We have
since then participated in it to
varying degrees, feeling it most
important that the real issues of
concern not be lost in the
question of this particular tactic,
and that a point of inflexibility or
irreparable polarization not be
reached.
We find it a shame that only
illegitimate action has been
successful in opening up closed
channels of communication and
arousing campus-wide concern in
the issues.
We would work to achieve a
community where change can
occur long before confrontation
politics is the only recourse.
Pat Shea and John Grube will
appear on the ballot as candidates
for President and Vice-President,
respectively. If elected, they,
together with Barry Askinas and
Joyce Kobayashi, will assume the
responsibilities of the ASSU
Presidency.
Spiegel
Student government at
Stanford has failed because it has
put the cart before the horse—it
has made proposals and "urgent
requests" to the administration
without an independent power
base in the student body with
which to back up its requests.
Such a power base would consist
of a large group of students who
aio sufficiently concerned about a
particular problem to give
generously of their time and
ultimately to put themselves on
the line in support of what they
want done. Without this support
behind him, the ASSU president,
whether the competent and
hard-working Denis Hayes, or the
topless dancer who nearly beat
him, will remain an obscure and
somewhat comic figure, while the
really exciting and important
changes in the university will be
instigated by ad hoc groups such
as the SRI Coalition.
John Spiegel and Brad Cornell
are alone among the many ASSU

candidates in recognizing the need
for a student power base as a
prerequisite for effective student
government, and in proposing to
meet this need. We have outlined
how the president could inform,
organize, and mobilize students
around a particular issue through
articles in The Daily,
informational literature similar to
that of the SRI Coalition,
discussions in residences, and
open ASSU meetings. We seek at
once to inform and to be
informed by the student body,
and to develop a participatory
democracy where students make
individual commitments from
which emerges a collective
strength. We endorse the AEL
sit-in not only for the issue behind
it, but also as a confused and
often frustrated attempt to make
this collective strength felt.

be encouraged to draw heavily on
the ample research facilities of
SRI. Urban problems currently
form a significant portion of the
Institute's research activities. By
expanding these efforts SRI could
better serve the vital interests of
the community and the students.
Regarding SRI and the
University, we have been told that
the negotiations process cannot
aid the implementation of these
needed changes. It is disturbing to
hear this verdict rendered on the
eve of a long-awaited
student-faculty report on the
future of SRI.
Tomorrow this report will be
issued to the entire Stanford
community. Two days later the
Academic Senate will meet in
urgent deliberation over the new
proposals. By the end of the week
every student and faculty member
will receive by mail a detailed
ballot concerning CBW, SRI and
related questions pertinent to
research and the university. This
schedule represents the
culmination of months of effort
by concerned students, faculty
and members of the
administration. To dismiss
negotiations as inevitably
non-productive is to frustrate the
efforts of these individuals, to
fragment our support, and
ultimately, to jeopardize the goals
for which we all share a common
concern.
While these issues are of great
interest to the Stanford
community, we hope that their
importance does not obscure
other problems that are relevant
to education at Stanford.
In the past year we have
witnessed an erosion of
governmental responsibility, in
which the open forum of student
government has been replaced by
an elite group which recognizes
the legitimacy of majority student
opinion only when it conforms to
their pre-conceived notions. We
feel strongly that government
should fulfill a representative
function, and to that end we offer
leadership that adheres to
democratic principles.
An additional problem is that
the great diversity of opinion on
campus has not been adequately
reflected by the Daily's editorial
and news coverage. We cannot
expect one journal to represent all
interests and points of view, so we
therefore subsidizing a
variety of other newsletters to
give balanced coverage to such
divergent groups as the BSU, the
I-Center and the YR's. To further
encourage the expression of
varying opinions we believe that
any individual, not only those
belonging to organizations, should
have the right to express his
opinion and address rallies in
White Plaza.

Finally, we recognize the
severe and inexcusable housing
shortage. We will undertake all
necessary steps to obtain more
and better housing for both
graduate and undergraduate
students.
Stanford
31
1. Our first reason for running
is to institute participatory
democracy at the top, with 31
Presidents to rotate DAILY.
2. Secondly, most other
candidates who may consider
themselves major campus
personalities with much to lose or

gain, have failed, or feared to take
concrete stands on the issues.
Being "jokers in the pack"
however, we can take clear and
concrete stands in our Platform,
for whatever constructive value it
may have.
Platform
1. THE ASSU SHOULD NOT
BE IMPOSED INVOLUNTARILY
ON STUDENTS; it must become
voluntary, like the GRADUATE
STUDENT ASSOCIATION. It is
only in this context that it will be
an independent spokesman for
students. The administration need
not retain petty student officers
to administrate petty tasks for
them.
2. Until such a transformation
(1) WE SUPPORT THE HAYES
CONSTITUTION WITHOUT
RESERVATIONS. The unspoken
"reservations" of other candidates
may be dealt with later. Now, the
HAYES CONSTITUTION must
be accepted so that ASSU will not
be strangled by LASSU.
3. To create a greater sense of
community, and provide

recreation, we support
construction of a LOUIS AGAZZI
GLACIER MEMORIAL PARK
ON FRENCHMAN'S HILL WITH
CAMPSITES.
4. 500-1 000 BLACK,
BROWN, AND INDIAN, AND
OTHER MINORITIES,
ENROLLED IN STANFORD as
soon as possible, is not too much
to ask of this university. We must
not lay down our moral burdens
when the present goal of 350 is
reached.
Furthermore: WE SUPPORT
ALL 11 BSU DEMANDS, with
the exception of the first (Which
demands dismissal of Dr. Koff).
Furthermore: WE BELIEVE
THAT THE ASSU SHOULD
ACTIVELY TAKE PART IN
INTENSIVE RECRUITMENT OF
SAID MINORITY STUDENTS.
5. THERE MUST BE 16
HOURS OF DAYLIGHT.
6. SRI MUST BE SEVERED,
FROM THE GOVERNMENT,
NOT FROM STANFORD
CHEMICAL ANDBIOLOGICAL
WARFARE, AND ALL
, DEFENSE CONTRACTS
MILITATE (LITERALLY)
AGAINST THE ACADEMIC
" SPIRIT OF A UNIVERSITY.
Defense, and political research
should be done by the
government itself, where it may
be politically opposed (as in the
ABM crisis).
7. ROTC SHOULD NOT BE
ACCREDITED; HOWEVER THE
ROTC PROGRAM SHOULD BE
ALLOWED TO CONTINUE ON
CAMPUS, AS THE COLLEGE
EDUCATED OFFICERS IT
SUPPLIES ARE ONE OF THE
FEW MODERATING FORCES
ON OUR MILITARY.
8. THE ASSU SHOULD
ESTABLISH A RENT CONTROL
BOARD to thoroughly investigate
the practices of landlords in
surrounding communities, and
protect and warn off-campus
students against abuses.
9. THE ASSU SHOULD
ESTABLISH A COMPULSORY
COURSE REVIEW PROGRAM,
IN WHICH STUDENTS MUST
SUBMIT A PASS-NEUTRAL
FAIL MARK ON EACH
PROFESSOR, before receiving his
own quarter report.
10. WITH OUR ESTIMATED
93 YEARS OF EXPERIENCE,
THE PRUDENCE OF AGE, AND
EXUBERANCE OF YOUTH
WILL BE MIRACULOUSLY
COMBINED.
11. THE STANFORD DAILY
SHOULD BE PUT ON A
SUBSCRIPTION BASIS, and
made financially independent of
the student political apparatus, or
the election of editor should be
| campus wide.
12. The only stand we have on
VIOLENCE is that we have no
stand; but we might SITDOWN on
it.
13. NOR DO WE HAVE A
STAND ON THE SAN
FRANCISCO EARTHQUAKE
although we do not believe that
this puts our platform on shaky
grounds.
Laird
I'm sick and I'm tired of this
whole campaign!
Every one of the candidates,
including myself, has
demonstrated a profound
understanding of politics by
taking a flexible stand on every
issue while using every gimmick
available to prove how well
qualified we are to hold office.
We've spoken of "support" and
"non-support" while others have
acted, and in their action
proclaimed a higher sense of
, purpose and interest in this
University than any of us. In
short, we've compromised our
souls and sold our guts for your
support and your vote.
The sad thing is that I can say
this about not just one, or two, or
most, but of all the candidates.
The funny thing is that the office
we seek has proven always in the
past to be one of such limited
power and served only to bolster
the prestige of the individual who
has gained it. Some of us are
sincere in our desire to change
that, but so have others been and
they have been beaten. Here we
are, candidates who say nothing
after an office which means
nothing. Which of us are you to
support? Perhaps you realize that
the absurd conclusion of this
absurd race is that one of us is
going to stand before the public at
large as representative of
Stanford's student body. Like so
many decisions, you must choose
the least of the list of evils with
little or no evidence to support
your choice.
I could speak now of issues,
but I would simply be repeating in
differertt phrases the statements
and beliefs of the other candidates
and the community in general.
You know how I stand—I'm a
Stanford liberal, but I'm only a
. man.
What more can I say?
"Born into a gathering of
valuers, whose values enslave me, I
attempted to free myself. Freed
from values, without which I am
lost, I searched for meaning. I
imagined that I searched alone: I
was wrong. There has come a
moment of small understanding."
I'm sick and I'm tired of this
whole campaign!

There is a great schism dividing
this unversity community into
two halves. One half believes that
changes in important issues must
be effected quickly through any
means of expression, legitimate or
otherwise. There is a second group
who react to this type of student
expression with an equal
conviction that change is only
necessary when effected through
the normal channels offered to
the members of this University. In
between these polarized sides, a
third group find themselves
sympathizing with the causes of
activist concern, but unable to
bring themselves to openly
support the tactics of pressure
politics. Student government has
done little to alleviate the
desperate situation we now find
ourselves in. There has been a void
of effective action by the student
government on the sensitive and
legitimate concerns of students at
this university. The results of this
inaction are the sit-ins of today
and last Spring.
No other candidates are
honestly speaking to the problem
of polarization of interest on this
campus. No other candidates are
offering imaginative and in-depth
programs that would attempt to
move us towards a reconciliation
of community. This cannot be
accomplished through vague
generalizations of what's wrong
with Stanford; they will not be
solved by barbeques on the Wilbur
Lawn or a Centrix telephone
system. They will not be solved
through enlarging the office of
presidency to four presidents.
Dave Harris and Peter Lyman did
not resign because the office .vas
too exhausting. They resigned
because the framework of student
government as it exists here is
insensitive and unresponsive to
creative programs proposed; it is
inoperative. Making a LASSU of
the presidency is not the answer.
We have approached the
problems and issues honestly. We
have offered constructive
programs already in operation at
other universities to help meet the
problems here. We hope to make
the student government
framework more operable by
reorganizing its cumbersome
legislative structure. Our proposals
for experimental dorms, an
Applied Research Institute Fall
Symposium, and a
Student-Fac ulty-Administration
Council offer an opportunity to
close the student schism and
provide the university with a
creative, powerful channel for
student expression through
student government. Although we
cannot elaborate on our proposals
in this limited space we invite
everyone to read our position
papers and see that we are
offering more than the usual spate
of generalizations.
Schneider
When those with conflicting
ideologies are unaware of the
middle ground which separates
them, the magnitude of their
differences seem irreconcilable,
and therefore, rather than
communicating in the spirit of
compromise, they speak only to
entrench themselves in their own
perspective. We need to reduce
this wasteful polarization by
involving more of those in the
middle of the political spectrum
in the affairs of the ASSU. Only
when the individual can identify
with those involved in the
decision-making process can he
relate to the decisions. This
applies not only to the neglected
middle, but also to the racial
minority students, whom
heretofore have had little, if no,
representation in student
government.
Most students are not
apathetic, but because they
cannot identify with student
government, they dismiss it as
being frivolous. The "left" has
played an inordinate role in
student government. And the
"right" in its response has
purported to speak for the silent
majority. We need to
de-emphasize the extremes by
involving more students from the
middle.
We need to involve minority
students in student government so
that not only can they seek to
improve the University by
working unilaterally with the
administration, but they can use
the "system" to their and our

advantage. In this way, the white
community would be more apt to
gain a better understanding of
their situation.
National and world problems
should be of the utmost concern
to us all. And as students, we have
a responsibility to effect social
and political change. But the first
commitment of a student body
officer is to the student and his
university - related interests and
needs. Through a more human
and relevant system of
communication with you, we feel
that we can best help you to meet
your needs while at Stanford.
Shea
The crucial task for students
now is maintaining the
momentum toward a powerful
student voice in education and the
affairs of the University. The
ASSU Presidency offers a
potential focal point for
strengthening and coordinating
the role of students in University
affairs. In the past, however, the
job has been too demanding for
one individual—two of the last
three incumbents have resigned.
The expectation of new student
demands and responsibilities
further emphasizes the need for a
stronger Executive Office.
We propose a Council of
Presidents: four individuals,
together responsible for
performing all the duties of the
ASSU Presidency. The Council
will meet daily; chairmanship of
the Council will rotate monthly
among the four. The chairman
will set the daily agenda, and will
exercise a tie-breaking vote.
A key strength of the Council
would be the specialized areas of
responsibility of each member.
Barry Askinas, President of the
Graduate Students Association
and a tutor in Otero, would be
concerned with the problems of
graduate students; he is presently
involved with the problem of
housing.
John Grube, former Assistant
Financial Manager for the ASSU
and a sponsor in Trancos, would
coordinate student activities
within the ASSU and organize the
publication of a student Course
Review.
Joyce Kobayashi, chairman of
the Biafran/Nigerian Relief Drive,
would work with the problems of
international students, such as
increasing interaction with
American students, organizing
courses taught by foreign
students, housing.
Pat Shea, currently a member
of the University Advisory
Committee, would work to
develop and improve
communication among students,
the faculty, the administration
and Trustees.
We are all members of the
Student Education Council and
have been actively participating in
the deliberations of the SES
recommendations. We regard
these deliberations as only a
beginning toward essential change
in education at Stanford.
Regarding our position with
respect to the demands of the
SRI-Coalition: we participated in
the April 9 SRI-Coalition meeting
and voted against the tactic of a
sit-in; we voted, however, for the
sit-in with a time limit. We have
since then participated in it to
varying degrees, feeling it most
important that the real issues of
concern not be lost in the
question of this particular tactic,
and that a point of inflexibility or
irreparable polarization not be
reached.
We find it a shame that only
illegitimate action has been
successful in opening up closed
channels of communication and
arousing campus-wide concern in
the issues.
We would work to achieve a
community where change can
occur long before confrontation
politics is the only recourse.
Pat Shea and John Grube will
appear on the ballot as candidates
for President and Vice-President,
respectively. If elected, they,
together with Barry Askinas and
Joyce Kobayashi, will assume the
responsibilities of the ASSU
Presidency.
Spiegel
Student government at
Stanford has failed because it has
put the cart before the horse—it
has made proposals and "urgent
requests" to the administration
without an independent power
base in the student body with
which to back up its requests.
Such a power base would consist
of a large group of students who
aio sufficiently concerned about a
particular problem to give
generously of their time and
ultimately to put themselves on
the line in support of what they
want done. Without this support
behind him, the ASSU president,
whether the competent and
hard-working Denis Hayes, or the
topless dancer who nearly beat
him, will remain an obscure and
somewhat comic figure, while the
really exciting and important
changes in the university will be
instigated by ad hoc groups such
as the SRI Coalition.
John Spiegel and Brad Cornell
are alone among the many ASSU

candidates in recognizing the need
for a student power base as a
prerequisite for effective student
government, and in proposing to
meet this need. We have outlined
how the president could inform,
organize, and mobilize students
around a particular issue through
articles in The Daily,
informational literature similar to
that of the SRI Coalition,
discussions in residences, and
open ASSU meetings. We seek at
once to inform and to be
informed by the student body,
and to develop a participatory
democracy where students make
individual commitments from
which emerges a collective
strength. We endorse the AEL
sit-in not only for the issue behind
it, but also as a confused and
often frustrated attempt to make
this collective strength felt.
Spiegel and Cornell propose to
use student power to bring about
fundamental change in the
university. We seek a radical
revision of Stanford's priorities—a
re-direction of resources to
teaching at the undergraduate
level, to campus housing, and to
educational innovation. Most
immediately, we seek a
re-direction of research away from
the development of weapons of
greater destruction to peaceful
and acutely needed projects. This
re-direction will not be achieved
through persuasion alone. The
pressure of a mobilized group of
concerned students is needed to
overcome the inertia and opposing
interests of Trustees, faculty, and
administration.
By the very nature of his
power base, the ASSU president
must be selective in what he
attempts beyond his role as a
persuasive lobbyist. We will work
for the implementation of the
April Third Coalition demands on
university research policy, and of
the SES proposals on
undergraduate education and
housing. To promise more is
either naive or misleading. To
promise anything without an
attempt to develop a student
power base offers nothing but a
perpetuation of the discredited
past tradition of Stanford student
government.
Wernick
Students have one political
function: to act as a power lobby!
Nobody listens unless you

howl. Capitalistic bourgeois
Stanford has not responded to
rational discussion through their
committees or any other means of
communication.
A new environment is to be
created if Allan and Larry are
elected. Allan Wernick and Larry
Gamble believe that students
should and will run this place, and
they will help the community
reach this goal. (Wernick and
Gamble don't want to run
Stanford—they want you to run
it.)
The sit-in at AEL is an example
of the student activism that Allan
and Larry support for this
university. Two things are very
important:
1. Students are acting on their
own initiative, doing what they
believe to be right, no matter
what the veiled threats from the
administration are . . .
2. Students are enjoying
themselves, and they now have
the chance to discuss the real
issues of our time outside of the
traditional structured classroom
situation . . .
SRI will not be stopped by
forming new committees to study
the problem—Sßl will be stopped
if we stop it by whatever means
necessary.
If Pitzer doesn't build new
housing, we will.
If trustees don't have open
meetings, we'll open them.
If courses we want aren't
taught, we will find someone to
teach them.
You can vote for a
committee-forming, issue-hiding
candidate (or half-assed multiple
candidate) and by doing so KISS
THE ESTABLISHMENT'S ASS.
You can vote for Wernick and
see something change-really
change.
Wernick is better qualified than
any other candidate—he has not,
and will not sit on any
committees, work for an impotent
though biased newspaper. Wernick
runs with no establishment
experience—he refuses to be
bound by assininity. He belongs
to no political organization.
Call him conservative .. . call
him radical . . . call him moderate
and you will be wrong, for he
cannot be limited—he is free, and
he will make you free. Free of the
bureaucratic nonsense other
candidates feed you, Wernick says
"Fuck that Shit." You will get
none of it from Wernick and
Gamble. Only Freedom!
