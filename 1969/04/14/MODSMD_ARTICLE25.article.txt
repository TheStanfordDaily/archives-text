New Priorities
The problems facing the world
are awesome. • In our own
community we can see the effects
of racism, environmental
pollution, destruction of our
national resources, and an
uncontrolled growth of
population. There are no easy
solutions to them, and the old
priorities of national defense are
draining away those very energies
which we need so desperately. We
are indeed burning the candle at
both ends. The results of
proceeding in the present
directions at an ever increasing
pace should be obvious to all
members of the community. And
yet many of the more esteemed
members of our community are
still saying, "But the patient
doesn't look sick, and anyway we
have been treating him. What right
do you have to question our
diagnosis?" It would appear that
the time has come to seek a new
physician and a new set of
priorities.
Student Responsibility
"You face a set of decisions
which are really symbolic of a
major national and international
crisis."
This statement by Dr. Kenneth
Pitzer to the Stanford Board of
Trustees is equally applicable to
every student, faculty, and staff
member on this campus. The
responsibility for our lives, our
future, and our University cannot
be delegated to a wise set of
oligarchs. This is a democracy and
ultimately every individual must
make his own decision. The
students at the AEL have made
their decision. They are described
as "a small percentage of the
Stanford student body." But, in
effect, they are speaking for all
students.
We feel that every student has
a choice to make at this time.
Their alternatives are basically
two. He (or she) can seriously
evaluate the problems we face,
and speak out in an attempt to
find a solution. Or he can
continue to pretend that these
problems do not concern him or
his future. As ASSU co-presidents
we will encourage every individual
to make up his own mind by the
rational process which is
fundamental to a University. But
ignoring the basic rights of a
democracy by remaining silent
and unconcerned is, at this time,
the height of irresponsibility. A
"silent majority" gives up any
claim to the future.
Cory
Eckhard and I envision student
government as a force pushing for
greater university participation in
public affairs. We propose the
establishment of a Department of
Urban and Environmental Studies,
which would take an

interdisciplinary approach to the
solutions of the major problems
confronting urban areas, such as
transportation, pollution and
housing. Under this department
one could not only bring in the
talents and resources of a variety
of departments, but also establish
individual programs whereby
students would be able to receive
academic credit for research and
field work in communities and
urban areas.
The creating of this department
should be only the first of many
steps taken to reorient education
and research at Stanford in order
to increase the relevance of both
the university to society and of
education to the individual. For
example, this department should
be encouraged to draw heavily on
the ample research facilities of
SRI. Urban problems currently
form a significant portion of the
Institute's research activities. By
expanding these efforts SRI could
better serve the vital interests of
the community and the students.
Regarding SRI and the
University, we have been told that
the negotiations process cannot
aid the implementation of these
needed changes. It is disturbing to
hear this verdict rendered on the
eve of a long-awaited
student-faculty report on the
future of SRI.
Tomorrow this report will be
issued to the entire Stanford
community. Two days later the
Academic Senate will meet in
urgent deliberation over the new
proposals. By the end of the week
every student and faculty member
will receive by mail a detailed
ballot concerning CBW, SRI and
related questions pertinent to
research and the university. This
schedule represents the
culmination of months of effort
by concerned students, faculty
and members of the
administration. To dismiss
negotiations as inevitably
non-productive is to frustrate the
efforts of these individuals, to
fragment our support, and
ultimately, to jeopardize the goals
for which we all share a common
concern.
While these issues are of great
interest to the Stanford
community, we hope that their
importance does not obscure
other problems that are relevant
to education at Stanford.
In the past year we have
witnessed an erosion of
governmental responsibility, in
which the open forum of student
government has been replaced by
an elite group which recognizes
the legitimacy of majority student
opinion only when it conforms to
their pre-conceived notions. We
feel strongly that government
should fulfill a representative
function, and to that end we offer
leadership that adheres to
democratic principles.
An additional problem is that
the great diversity of opinion on
campus has not been adequately
reflected by the Daily's editorial
and news coverage. We cannot
expect one journal to represent all
interests and points of view, so we
therefore subsidizing a
variety of other newsletters to
give balanced coverage to such
divergent groups as the BSU, the
I-Center and the YR's. To further
encourage the expression of
varying opinions we believe that
any individual, not only those
belonging to organizations, should
have the right to express his
opinion and address rallies in
White Plaza.

Finally, we recognize the
severe and inexcusable housing
shortage. We will undertake all
necessary steps to obtain more
and better housing for both
graduate and undergraduate
students.
Stanford
31
1. Our first reason for running
is to institute participatory
democracy at the top, with 31
Presidents to rotate DAILY.
2. Secondly, most other
candidates who may consider
themselves major campus
personalities with much to lose or

gain, have failed, or feared to take
concrete stands on the issues.
Being "jokers in the pack"
however, we can take clear and
concrete stands in our Platform,
for whatever constructive value it
may have.
Platform
1. THE ASSU SHOULD NOT
BE IMPOSED INVOLUNTARILY
ON STUDENTS; it must become
voluntary, like the GRADUATE
STUDENT ASSOCIATION. It is
only in this context that it will be
an independent spokesman for
students. The administration need
not retain petty student officers
to administrate petty tasks for
them.
2. Until such a transformation
(1) WE SUPPORT THE HAYES
CONSTITUTION WITHOUT
RESERVATIONS. The unspoken
"reservations" of other candidates
may be dealt with later. Now, the
HAYES CONSTITUTION must
be accepted so that ASSU will not
be strangled by LASSU.
3. To create a greater sense of
community, and provide

recreation, we support
construction of a LOUIS AGAZZI
GLACIER MEMORIAL PARK
ON FRENCHMAN'S HILL WITH
CAMPSITES.
4. 500-1 000 BLACK,
BROWN, AND INDIAN, AND
OTHER MINORITIES,
ENROLLED IN STANFORD as
soon as possible, is not too much
to ask of this university. We must
not lay down our moral burdens
when the present goal of 350 is
reached.
Furthermore: WE SUPPORT
ALL 11 BSU DEMANDS, with
the exception of the first (Which
demands dismissal of Dr. Koff).
Furthermore: WE BELIEVE
THAT THE ASSU SHOULD
ACTIVELY TAKE PART IN
INTENSIVE RECRUITMENT OF
SAID MINORITY STUDENTS.
5. THERE MUST BE 16
HOURS OF DAYLIGHT.
6. SRI MUST BE SEVERED,
FROM THE GOVERNMENT,
NOT FROM STANFORD
