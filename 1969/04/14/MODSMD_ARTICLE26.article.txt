# Scientologist To Talk
## 
### 
Allen Kapuler, one of the
world's most highly trained
Scientologists, will lecture on
"The Purpose of Scientology
Processing," tonight (April 14) at
7:30 pm in Tresidder Union,
Room 270. Mr. Kapuler is a
member of the international staff
of Scientologists who assist L.
Ron Hubbard, the founder of
Scientology, in both research and
supervision of the world wide
expansion of this movement. He
also operates Scientology centers
in Santa Clara, California and
Reno, Nevada. In his lecture, he
will describe the foundations of
the religious philosophy of
Scientology and will give
examples of techniques used in
"processing" or working with

individuals to increase their
awareness and ability in life.
Mr. Kapuler is a "Clear,"
defined as a person who is able to
knowingly and willingly at cause
over the mental factors of his
existence governing his own
survival. Through Scientology
techniques, he has erased the
stimulus-response mechanisms
that cause people to react in an
irrational fashion to their
environment. A Clear, it is
claimed, can determine his own
actions, thoughts and emotions, a
state of liberation that has not
previously been available to man.
If others, such as Buddha,
achieved it in the past, they did
not leave precise instructions for
following their path. It is asserted

that Scientology has worked out a
set of procedures for attaining
such a state of being that works
swiftly and surely and does not
involve drugs, meditation or other
mystical practices. Already 2000
persons have attained the state of
Clear, and Scientology is now
expanding rapidly on an
international scale.
In his talk, Mr. Lapuler will
discuss the aberrations of the
human being, how one can be
released from them and finally
cleared of them by the techniques
of Scientology. An extended
question and answer period will
be included. The event is
sponsored by the Stanford
Scientology Group and everyone
is invited. Admission is free.
