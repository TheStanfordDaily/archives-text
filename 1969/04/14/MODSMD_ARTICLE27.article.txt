# Dancers

With remarkable grace and
expression, seven dancers
presented an offering in dance and
music at yesterday's Memorial
Church Service.
The dancers and the musicians
who accompanied them were all
members of the Stanford
Community, and they presented
their offering at the altar.
The congregation sat in awe as
the girls, who were clad in black
leotards and long black skirts,
portrayed the joys of
understanding, the emptyness of
feeling lost, and the pleasure of
dancing.
They interpreted Dean Napier's
short sermon beautifully. He said,
"Born into a gathering of valuers,
whose values enslave me, I
attempt to free myself. Freed
from values, without which I am
lost, I searched for meaning. I
imagined that I searched alone; I
was wrong."
"There comes a moment of
small understanding. A value is
assumed. (Thus are my children
enslaved. O children, forgive me.)
For a while I shall dance. For a
while we shall dance together."
Planning the program were
Kathy Iverson and Ken
Ziegenfuss. Miss Iverson, Stanford
B.A. '67 is now Assistant
Professor of Physical Education at
the University of Redlands. Mr.
Ziegenfuss, Stanford B.A. '66,
M.A. '68 is the Principal Musical
Assistant of the Stanford Opera
Workshop and is an accompanist
for Modern Dance classes at
Stanford.
