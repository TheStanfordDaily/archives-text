# Windows Broken
## 
### 
Windows were shattered over
the weekend in the bookstore and
in the Stanford Press Building.
Stanford police have not, as yet,
any clues to the identity of the
unknown individuals responsible
for the damage.
A brick was tossed through a
large window of the Stanford
Press Building next to the Daily
offices on Limita Drive. The
incident apparently occured
between 2 and 4 a.m. early
Saturday morning.
Bottles were used to break
three plate glass windows in front
of the bookstore early Sunday
morning between 3 and 4 a.m.
Associate Dean of Students Bill
Wyman commented "There's no
evidence of any connection
between the bookstore incident

and the sit-in at the Applied
Electronics Lab."
"Being that this is a peaceful
demonstration I see no reason
why there would be any
connection."
Stanford Police Chief Thomas
Bell did not exactly agree with
this view. He felt the incidents
wouldn't have occurred if the
sit-in wasn't going on, but stated
that there is no direct link to it.
There is no motive for either
incident. Nothing has been
reported as missing from either
the bookstore or the press
building. However, police were
using the press offices as a
command post for several hours
Wednesday night, the first night
of the sit-in. They have since
vacated the building.
