# Candidates Are Split Over Sit-In Approval
## 
### DAVID DAVENPORT LINDA WINTHROP 
While the current sit-in at AEL has
eclipsed the ASSU presidential
campaign, it has also given the
candidates a clear and important
campus issue on which to speak.
An attempt was made to contact the
13 presidential candidates and obtain
their reactions to the protest at AEL.
Seven candidates responded .favorably
to the sit-in, three opposed it, one was
not willing to commit himself, and two
candidates were not available to
comment.
Those who support the sit-in include
Tim Coburn, Paul Floto, Andrew
Gould, John King, Phil Laird, Bob
Mattson, and Allan Wernick. Opponents

of the protest are Bob Cory, Pat Shea,
and Jim Schnieder.
Tim Coburn prefaced his reaction by
noting that he has "been involved with
the Coalition since the beginning."
Although he "was not sure it was the
only alternative which could have been
used," he now supports the protest.
"Once a decision has been made, you
either back it or oppose it. I back it,"he
concluded.
Floto Has Reservations
Despite some reservation about
execution of the protest, Paul Floto
supports it. He suggested that "it, was a
tactical mistake to have extended it in a
building which is of no value to the
University." He proposed that students
should have left Friday, insisted that
their demands be met in two weeks, : nd
returned if they were not met. "The
trustees will not work under the curront
pressure," he noted.
Jim King, leader of "The Daily
Machine," stated that he is "very
pleased with the sit-in." While
expressing support for the issues, he also
stressed that he is "in favor of peaceful
demonstrations including this one at
AEL. It's being conducted very well."
Andrew Gould advanced the most
radical reply. "I support the sit-in but I
don't think the action is militant
enough. We should take another
building," he continued, "because the
more buildings we have, the more power
we have."

The ticket of Phil Laird and John
Thomas also related support for the
sit-in. Laird proposed that the sit-in be
terminated now with the understanding
that if the trustees did not act within a
few days, the sit-in would reconvene.
Although he voted against the sit-in
proposal, Bob Mattson supports it
because he is willing to comply with the
majority. "I support the sit-in in
purpose," he commented, "and am
particularly disturbed that student
government was ineffective in meeting
student demands on SRI. With the
ineffectiveness of student government
on this issue, the sit-in was inevitable."
Allan Wernick and Lawrence Gamble
could not be reached for direct
comment. However, in their position
statement, they called the AEL sit-in
"an example of the student activism
that we support for the University."
Expressing their opposition to the
sit-in, Bob Cory and Eckhard Schulz
emphasized that the six-month SRI
study will be published Tuesday, and
within another week a University-wide
referendum will be held through the
mail. "To attempt to force a decision
before the entire Stanford community
has had a chance to consider the facts
and express its opinion," they
concluded, "can only frustrate and
jeopardize goals for which we all share a
common concern."
Although he supports "the essence of
the demands," Jim Schnieder takes
exception to three aspects of the
protest: "the tactic of a sit-in, its
continuation after the point had been
made, and the inherent possibility of an
increased number of non-Stanford
students becoming involved."
The final candidate who voiced
objection to the sit-in is Pat Shea. Pat
and his running mate John Grube both
voted for an amendment aimed at
terminating the sit-in after a specific
time. However, after that amendment
was defeated at Wednesday night's
meeting, they both voted against the
sit-in.
Charles Kitsman, while declining to
either support or denounce the sit-in,
,said, "Anything that might promote a
fuller sense of communication between
the parties involved is fine with me. V/e
need a willingness or. both sides not to
become so polarized that they car.'t
discuss it in a reasonable fashion."

student demands on SRI. With the
ineffectiveness of student government
on this issue, the sit-in was inevitable."
Allan Wernick and Lawrence Gamble
could not be reached for direct
comment. However, in their position
statement, they called the AEL sit-in
"an example of the student activism
that we support for the University."
Expressing their opposition to the
sit-in, Bob Cory and Eckhard Schulz
emphasized that the six-month SRI
study will be published Tuesday, and
within another week a University-wide
referendum will be held through the
mail. "To attempt to force a decision
before the entire Stanford community
has had a chance to consider the facts
and express its opinion," they
concluded, "can only frustrate and
jeopardize goals for which we all share a
common concern."
Although he supports "the essence of
the demands," Jim Schnieder takes
exception to three aspects of the
protest: "the tactic of a sit-in, its
continuation after the point had been
made, and the inherent possibility of an
increased number of non-Stanford
students becoming involved."
The final candidate who voiced
objection to the sit-in is Pat Shea. Pat
and his running mate John Grube both
voted for an amendment aimed at
terminating the sit-in after a specific
time. However, after that amendment
was defeated at Wednesday night's
meeting, they both voted against the
sit-in.
Charles Kitsman, while declining to
either support or denounce the sit-in,
,said, "Anything that might promote a
fuller sense of communication between
the parties involved is fine with me. V/e
need a willingness or. both sides not to
become so polarized that they car.'t
discuss it in a reasonable fashion."
While the current sit-in at AEL has
eclipsed the ASSU presidential
campaign, it has also given the
candidates a clear and important
campus issue on which to speak.
An attempt was made to contact the
13 presidential candidates and obtain
their reactions to the protest at AEL.
Seven candidates responded .favorably
to the sit-in, three opposed it, one was
not willing to commit himself, and two
candidates were not available to
comment.
Those who support the sit-in include
Tim Coburn, Paul Floto, Andrew
Gould, John King, Phil Laird, Bob
Mattson, and Allan Wernick. Opponents

of the protest are Bob Cory, Pat Shea,
and Jim Schnieder.
Tim Coburn prefaced his reaction by
noting that he has "been involved with
the Coalition since the beginning."
Although he "was not sure it was the
only alternative which could have been
used," he now supports the protest.
"Once a decision has been made, you
either back it or oppose it. I back it,"he
concluded.
Floto Has Reservations
Despite some reservation about
execution of the protest, Paul Floto
supports it. He suggested that "it, was a
tactical mistake to have extended it in a
building which is of no value to the
University." He proposed that students
should have left Friday, insisted that
their demands be met in two weeks, : nd
returned if they were not met. "The
trustees will not work under the curront
pressure," he noted.
Jim King, leader of "The Daily
Machine," stated that he is "very
pleased with the sit-in." While
expressing support for the issues, he also
stressed that he is "in favor of peaceful
demonstrations including this one at
AEL. It's being conducted very well."
Andrew Gould advanced the most
radical reply. "I support the sit-in but I
don't think the action is militant
enough. We should take another
building," he continued, "because the
more buildings we have, the more power
we have."

The ticket of Phil Laird and John
Thomas also related support for the
sit-in. Laird proposed that the sit-in be
terminated now with the understanding
that if the trustees did not act within a
few days, the sit-in would reconvene.
Although he voted against the sit-in
proposal, Bob Mattson supports it
because he is willing to comply with the
majority. "I support the sit-in in
purpose," he commented, "and am
particularly disturbed that student
government was ineffective in meeting
student demands on SRI. With the
ineffectiveness of student government
on this issue, the sit-in was inevitable."
