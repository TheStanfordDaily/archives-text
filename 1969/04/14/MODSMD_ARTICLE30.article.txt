# Pollution Politics Discussion Set
## 
### 
Tonight at 7:45 in Tresidder
Large Lounge "The Politics of Air
Pollution" will be the subject of a
panel discussion. Taking part will
be Jud Callaghan and Milton
Feldstein, both officials of the
Bay Area Air Pollution Control
District.
The BAAPCD is a tax
supported agency charged with
the responsibility for keeping the
air clean. It was first set up in
1956 when smog was just getting
to be a serious problem. Today,
when in the whole six county area
five pounds of pollutants are
being dumped in the air for every
person living here, the BAAPCD
has been criticized for failing its
job.
Part of the problem is that the
district has no jurisdiction over
cars, which account for about

one-half of the Bay Area's smog.
It is responsible for regulating
open burning and industries.
However, industry, being vital to
the area's economy, is a potent
political force which has at times
been able to escape punishment
for polluting beyond the
guidelines established by the
BAAPCD.
It is significant that there are
only a dozen major polluters in
the Bay Area, accounting for V* of
the smog. These are also among
the largest corporations, such as
Shell and Union Oil, Kaiser, and
FMC.
The district also has problems
with detection and measurement
of pollution, the human eye still
being employed as a measure of
the amount of smoke pouring
from a smokestack.
