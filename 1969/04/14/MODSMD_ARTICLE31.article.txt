# Stanford In Beirut

### BETTY NISHIOKA 
"It is the sole contact that
Stanford has with the Middle
East," emphasized Michel Nabti,
chairman of the American
University of Beirut (A.U.8.)
Exchange Program.
For the last five years, the
ASSU has been sending one
Stanford student to study for an
academic year at the beautiful
campus of the American
University of Beirut, located in
the heart of the capital of
Lebanon.
The Lebanese campus is
situated on a hill along the coast
of the Mediterranean Sea and has
an enrollment of about 3600
students from 65 different
countries, including some 200
American students.
The Stanford-Beirut Exchange
Committee is now in the process
of selecting the Stanford scholar
for the 1969-70 academic year.
Applications are available in the
upstairs office of the International
Center, and completed
applications must be turned in
within two weeks.
Orientation Meeting
There will be an introductory
meeting for all students interested
in the exchange program on
Wednesday night, April 16, at
7:30 in the I-Center. Questions
may be directed to Mr. Nabti at
University extension 2050.
The main qualification for
participation in the Beirut
program is a student's interest in
and willingness to take advantage
of an opportunity for cultural
exchange. Graduate and
undergraduate, male and female
students are all eligible.
Because all instruction at the
A.U.B. is in English, there is no
language requirement. Although
the Beirut University is on the
semester system, the academic
year corresponds to that of
Stanford so that the Stanford
exchange student will leave in
September and return in June.
Credits Transferable
The fact that all credits
between the two universities are
transferable eliminates the

interruption of fulfilling Stanford
academic requirements. Courses at
the Beirut campus are given in a
wide range of instruction—the
arts, sciences, medical sciences,
engineering, and agricultural
sciences.
The Stanford student selected
for the program will live in a
student residence at the A.U.B.
Full tuition, room, and board will
be paid by the ASSU.
The only expense for which
the student may have to provide is
transportation to and from the
campus. In the past, various
organizations in this area
concerned with the Middle East
have appropriated funds for part
of the transportation expenses.
Students in the past have also
been able to take advantage of the
Stanford Overseas Campus charter
flights.
Cosmopolitan Culture
Although there is no language
requirement, the knowledge of
Arabic will definitely be an
advantage for the student going
abroad. Patricia Mihaly, the
Stanford student who is now
studying at Beirut, writes that
communication media and most
of the Lebanese people
demonstrate the "cosmopolitan
ism" of the country by their use
of three languages, Arabic,
French, and English.
In order to get the most out of
the program, the Beirut
Committee recommends that a
student spend his junior year in
Lebanon. Two years at Stanford
will afford a student the
opportunity to well acquaint
himself with Stanford before
departing for the Lebanese
University, and he will be able to
return for his senior year to share
his experiences abroad.
The Lebanese exchange
student who is now attending
Stanford is Hagop Demirjian, a
graduate student in engineering
economic planning. Hagop resides
at Beta Chi and is willing to
discuss his country, the A.U.8., or
any aspect of the American
University of Beirut Exchange
Program with interested students.

University of Beirut Exchange
Program with interested students.
"It is the sole contact that
Stanford has with the Middle
East," emphasized Michel Nabti,
chairman of the American
University of Beirut (A.U.8.)
Exchange Program.
For the last five years, the
ASSU has been sending one
Stanford student to study for an
academic year at the beautiful
campus of the American
University of Beirut, located in
the heart of the capital of
Lebanon.
The Lebanese campus is
situated on a hill along the coast
of the Mediterranean Sea and has
an enrollment of about 3600
students from 65 different
countries, including some 200
American students.
The Stanford-Beirut Exchange
Committee is now in the process
of selecting the Stanford scholar
for the 1969-70 academic year.
Applications are available in the
upstairs office of the International
Center, and completed
applications must be turned in
within two weeks.
Orientation Meeting
There will be an introductory
meeting for all students interested
in the exchange program on
Wednesday night, April 16, at
7:30 in the I-Center. Questions
may be directed to Mr. Nabti at
University extension 2050.
The main qualification for
participation in the Beirut
program is a student's interest in
and willingness to take advantage
of an opportunity for cultural
exchange. Graduate and
undergraduate, male and female
students are all eligible.
Because all instruction at the
A.U.B. is in English, there is no
language requirement. Although
the Beirut University is on the
semester system, the academic
year corresponds to that of
Stanford so that the Stanford
exchange student will leave in
September and return in June.
Credits Transferable
The fact that all credits
between the two universities are
transferable eliminates the

interruption of fulfilling Stanford
academic requirements. Courses at
the Beirut campus are given in a
wide range of instruction—the
arts, sciences, medical sciences,
engineering, and agricultural
sciences.
The Stanford student selected
for the program will live in a
student residence at the A.U.B.
Full tuition, room, and board will
be paid by the ASSU.
The only expense for which
the student may have to provide is
transportation to and from the
campus. In the past, various
organizations in this area
concerned with the Middle East
have appropriated funds for part
of the transportation expenses.
Students in the past have also
been able to take advantage of the
Stanford Overseas Campus charter
flights.
Cosmopolitan Culture
Although there is no language
requirement, the knowledge of
Arabic will definitely be an
advantage for the student going
abroad. Patricia Mihaly, the
Stanford student who is now
studying at Beirut, writes that
communication media and most
of the Lebanese people
demonstrate the "cosmopolitan
ism" of the country by their use
of three languages, Arabic,
French, and English.
In order to get the most out of
the program, the Beirut
Committee recommends that a
student spend his junior year in
Lebanon. Two years at Stanford
will afford a student the
opportunity to well acquaint
himself with Stanford before
departing for the Lebanese
University, and he will be able to
return for his senior year to share
his experiences abroad.
The Lebanese exchange
student who is now attending
Stanford is Hagop Demirjian, a
graduate student in engineering
economic planning. Hagop resides
at Beta Chi and is willing to
discuss his country, the A.U.8., or
any aspect of the American
University of Beirut Exchange
Program with interested students.
