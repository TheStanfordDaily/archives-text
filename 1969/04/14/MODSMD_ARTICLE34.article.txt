# Crew Cleans Up
## 
### 
The rigors of seven months of
training paid off for the Stanford
crew Saturday as the Indian
oarsmen won both the varsity and
JV races in the annual Conn
Findlay Regatta against Oregon
State and USC. The only
disappointment of the day came
when a strong OSU freshman
contingent outpointed the
Stanford frosh and won by one
and one half lengths.
The Indian varsity blasted off
the starting line at 47 strokes per
minute to take a one length lead
over both USC and Oregon State.
They then dropped down to a 32
before going to a 36 and then a 38
(strokes per minute) to hold off
OSU's sprint.
The margin at the finish was
slightly less than a length with the
Trojans three lengths back.
Stanford was clocked in the good
early season time of 6:18.
The JV's had far less trouble.
Starting at a 47, they had open
water on the Beavers and two
lengths on USC after 500 meters.
By the finish, they had pulled to
three lengths on OSU and five on
Southern Cal. Their time was
6:23.
The OSU crews will have a
chance to revenge (as will the
Stanford frosh) next weekend as
the Indians travel to Eugene to
race Oregon, Oregon State,
Washington, and Pacific Lutheran.

The Washington crews will be
up for this race, as the Huskies,
Western Sprints champions in
1968, lost both the varsity and JV
contests to the Tribe last year.
