# Bruins Win, 88-66
## Tribe Runs Strong But Loses 
### 
The track team lost a
heart-breaker at UCLA Saturday,
88-G6. It was the type of meet
where the Indians produced nine
lifetime bests, but in the end, the
Westwood depth was too much to
overcome. The final outcome was
however in question until the
three mile, the next to last event.
The Tribe looked ready for an
upset after Brook Thomas ran
away from the steeplechase field
in NCAA qualifying time of
9:09.8, and the sprint relay team
surprised with a seasonal best of
41.0.
However, the baby-blue clad
Bruins showed their traditional
strength in the field by sweeping
the shot and placing one-two in
the long jump.
Trying to extend this

momentum to the track, Jim
Mosher and Scott Chisan burned a
2:02 first half in the mile for
UCLA. The pace slowed on the
third lap, but then "Big Al"
Sanford exploded in the last 220,
and won going away in an
outstanding 4:04.6 for the
visitors.
Rick Tipton extended his
unbeaten dual meet skein in the
high hurdles with a fine 14.1.
Then after Len. Van Hofwegan
and Wayne Collet swept the 440
for the Bruins, Tipton returned to
action with an unbelievable
wind-aided 9.5 in the 100, good*
for second behind UCLA's Reggie
Robinson.
Pete Fairchild kept the.
pressure on with a gun-to-wire
victory in the 880 while recording

a life-time best of 1:50.9. Then
Randy White and Tom Kominers
shunted the Uclans to third in
the intermediate hurdles with
52.7 and 53.2 clockings.
But despite Tom Colby's and
Lance Martin's one-two in the
javelin, and Steve Davis' life-time
best of 177-7, good for first place
in the discus, UCLA kept the edge
in off the track events.
First Dick Railsback catapulted
to 17 feet in the pole valut, then
Cary Ross, clearing 6-10 for the
fifth week in a row, out jumped
Card Captain Peter Boyce in the
key high jump competition.
With Tom Massey assured of a
second in the triple jump, and
only the 220, three mile, and mile
relay to go, Coach Payton Jordan
needed sixteen out of the
remaining 23 points. But Andy
Young and Robinson quickly put
an end to the Tribe sprinters'
upset designs with two swift 21.0
efforts, this despite Charlie
Francis' seasonal best and Kevin
McNair's life-time best of 21.6.
Then, in a hotly contested
three mile, Dan Preston dashed
Stanford's final hopes with a three
second victory over Greg Brock
who's overall time of 13:54.2 was
a seasonal best.
With the outcome decided, the
Bruins walked away in the mile

relay with the fastest time in the
Pacific-8 this year, 3:10.4.
The t'rosh team swamped
Hartnell College in their meet
Thursday, just missing amassing
100 points. Mark Haight's
life-time high of 54.1 in the
intermediates highlighted the
victory, although Bob Coe in the
mile (4:16.8) and Bob Dews in
the high jump (6-7) continued to
shine.
