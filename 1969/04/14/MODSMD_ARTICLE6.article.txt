# Research Committee To Hold Open Hearing
## 
### 
A public hearing on Stanford's
research policy has been scheduled
today by the Academic Senate's
Committee on Research Policy.
Acting on the request of the Senate's
steering committee, law professor
William Baxter, research committee
chairman, set the hearing for 3:30 p.m.
in room 66 of the Graduate School of
Business.
The hearing will be open to all
members of the community who want
to express their ideas on "what they
think appropriate research guidelines
should be in the future," says Baxter. A
loudspeaker will be set up in the
courtyard between Memorial
Auditorium and the business school for
spectators who cannot find seats in the
hearing room.
The Committee on Research Policy is
responsible for drawing up and
enforcing all university regulations on
research contracts.
The hearing will come one day
before an emergency meeting of the
committee, called at the request of
President Kenneth S. Pitzer. Pitzer has

asked the committee to reconsider the
policy on classified research, in response
to the demands of the April 3 Coalition.
The Coalition, which sparked the
sit-in at the Applied Electronics
Laboratory, favors an end to all research
with direct military applications. The
Coalition has issued a six-page "research
guidelines" which proposes a sweeping
new research policy for Stanford.
The Committee on Research Policy
will decide on Tuesday "whether the
Committee now wishes to reaffirm the
contents" of its existing policy "or
depart from it in specific respects,"
according to a letter from Baxter to
committee members.
A resolution will be offered at the
committee's meeting to prohibit new
classified research contracts, the Daily
learned Sunday. Sponsored by student
committee members Michael Sweeney
and Rod Levine, the resolution reads:
"The University should enter no
contract and accept no grant to carry
out research if there is substantial
possibility that the foreseeable results of
the research will be classified
information."
