## AEL Community Shows Spirit 
### JENNY MATTHEWS 
"F. itr days of sandwiches," someone
murmiiT-'j, shaking his head at some
peanut butter in AEL's temporary
kitchen, Saturday night.
"We're making a big pot of stew," a
girl told him, "so everyone can just dig
in."
"Yeah," commented another girl as
she carefully wiped off the counter and
straightened the furniture, "a big
conglomeration of glorious glop."
"Make sure that everyone gets fed,"
remarked another, "and there's plenty
of coffee."
Bene ■ .\\ the purpose of the sit-in at
AEL—oe'v.id the goal 01' taking over the
building 1o stop it's, objectionable
research ;nd aside from the desire of
the proti s >ng group to get its demands
aired by the Trustees and acted upon,
there has been created an improvised
community of individuals living in a
strange new residence.
Some of them are scared, some of
them are ecstatic, most of them are
tired . . .
But all of them are committed. And
all of them are learning.
Learning About Selves
Aside from learning about Stanford,
SRI, CWB, and U.S. war research, the
demonstrators seem to be learning

about themselves and about each other:
what it's like to organize a living
situation, what it's like to share when
there's not enough to go around, and
what it's like to discir-line personal
desires in an environment where no
disciplinary authority e>.u>ts.
And the students are >;?tting tc< know
one another—getting a chance to "rap"
with one another—leairJns that witiiin a
communal living situation, a persoi. can
both belong to the community i nd "do
his thing" at the same time.
"You can share my blanket with
me," one girl told anoth ir who didn't
have one.
"There's a lady co'v stairs in the
kitchen," anott.sr girl k.ld me, "who
brought a fantastic am- unt of food for
ail of us."
Kitchru Lady
The lady in the kitchen turned out to
be a Palo Alto resident who has a son in
the Peace Corps.
"You kids have to eat," she
emphasized.
"Here, have some bread and cheese,"
she urged to everyone who ventured in
her direction.
"Here's some milk . . . have some
cake . . . hey, I haven't seen your face in
here before; want some food?"
"I iust came back from my dorm,"

the strange face said sadly, munching on
a cookie, "and someone there asked me
what AE T ; stood for."
"Go to your dorm then," a girl
advised. "Let the other kids know
what's goinj, on here. Tell them to come
and look ar< und and maybe rap with
us."
"Here," added another, "give them
some copies of today's Declassified. Let
them know that -ve're even putting out
a daily newspaper."
Press Room
The sit-in's "press room" is in the
basement of AEL. The Declassified's
staff has been working f"riously during
each night of the dem< nstration so that
AEL's "residents" can read a morning
newspaper as t'iey roll up their sleeping
bags.
This newspaper has been an
additional source of information to the
press releases and statements issued by
the "Press Relations f>nd Information"
(PR&I) staff on the second floor of
AEL.
"We have to keep people informed,"
explained one PR&I agent, "so we have
people scheduled to work at this desk
twenty-four hours a day."
At times the Stanford police, the
only official law enforcement agents at
AEL appeared to be a part of the group.

The group of friendly fuzz smiled at the
students, shared their food, rapped with
them, and wandered around asking the
slumbering students in the halls if they
were comfortable.
Activities begin very early in the
morning at AEL. Aside from a group of
girls who help improvise breakfast, a
group of individuals may start sweeping
the floors or picking up litter or simply
hovering over cups of coffee after
spending a chilly night on the roof.
During the first couple days, lanje
numbers of students came; wandering in
and out of the building; perhaps
attending the mass meetings, perhaps
even sleeping at night in the halls.
A lot of them were not aware of the
issues that motivated the sit-in. And a
lot of them did not know and had never
talked to the leaders that formulated
these issues.
Occasionally an air of
discouragement and confusion would
pervade the group.

But at other times an amazing feeling
of solidarity and individual commitment
would appear, almost magically.
Students would break into discussion
groups, talk to each other on their views
of the situation, and find out that the
leaders and organizers were just people
who ha.'; made a moral commitment,
people \v:o feel that taking over AEL
was a posis 5 ve expression of this moral
commitment.
