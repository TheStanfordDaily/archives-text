The ROTC Issue
As Stanford faculty members, we have long been concerned about the propriety of Stanford's relation
ship with the ROTC programs. We applauded the Academic Senate's decision to examine this relationship,
and concur with the Senate action on ROTC.
We feel strongly that Stanford should not relinquish to an external institution the right to determine the
content and goals of Stanford's academic curriculum and select Stanford faculty members. For the last
fifty years, Stanford has relinquished this right only to the Armed Forces.
Suppose a religious denomination offered to establish a seminary as a department at Stanford; provide
its faculty; determine its curriculum; set achievementandards for its students; and provide financial aid
to its students in return for their incurring a contractual obligation to serve the church as ministers.
Such an arrangement would clearly compromise Stanford's academic integrity and independence. How
ever socially desirable it migh be, most Stanford faculty would surely oppose it. Yet, the Armed Forces now
have a special relation of this sort with Stanford. We have seen no arguments demonstrating that the
Armed Forces have a unique right to such a special arrangement. However, we welcome the Armed Forces
to Stanford, on the same footing as churches and other governmental and private agencies, to organize and
run extra-curricular programs for students wishing to participate in them.
Several objections to the Senate's action on ROTC have been raised. Some of these rest on a misunder
standing of the Senate's action; others rest on a failure to recognize that only the faculty has ultimate re
sponsibility in determining academic curriculum, faculty selection procedures, and the status of departments
at Stanford.
OBJECTION:
The Senate's action is tantamount to the abolition of ROTC at Stanford and would "tend to remove
the training of officers from tjne civilizing influences of the University life."
ANSWER:
1. We appreciate the need for civilian influence of the Armed Forces. We believe that a full scholarship
officer procurment program (for example, school-year academic work in regular departments plus
summer training) can and should continue at Stanford within the guidelines recommended by the
Senate. These guidelines are less stringent than those recently established at other major univers
ities (Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Cornell). The Defense Department has already indicated its desire to
negotiate a new on-campus program with these universities.
2. No evidence has been introduced to support the assertion that ROTC cannot continue as a viable
program without academic credit. Students who genuinely wish to participate in such a program
will certainly be willing to do so on an extra-curricular basis. ROTC as an extra-curricular activity
would require no commitment in time and energy from a student than does the football team, the
United Christian Ministry program or the debate team.
OBJECTION:
The Senate action deprives the administration of sufficient flexibility in negotiating a new ROTC pro
gram with the Department of Defense.
ANSWER:
1. The Senate's action does no more than make explicit what is meant by "programs consistent with
academic objectives and standards of the University.'' It calls for conditions widely regarded as
essential for free inquiry:
—that instructors in the University be nominated only by members of its own faculty and be re
sponsible only to organs of the University for the quality and objectivity of their work.
—that instructors themselves, and no extra-university agency, determine the content of their
courses and the standards to be met.
This is no more than other major universities have recently agreed to be the minimal content of "aca
demic standards and objectives." If we disapprove of the Senate's action we shall be telling the
President we would be satisfied with less. The factulty should not fail to assume its prime responsi
bility in this area.
2. The Senate action gives the administration at least as much time to negotiate an extra-curricular
program with the Defense Department as the second alternative on the ballot would allow to negoti
ate an altered program. The transitional period recommended by the Senate does not begin until
September, 1970, nor end until September, 1973. During this time the Senate is always free to
modify its guidelines and to extend the negotiating period.
OBJECTION:
Sixty per-cent of those who voted in the recent student referendum felt that ROTC had "a legitimate
place" at Stanford and that "those aspects of the ROTC program of genuine academic interest"
should receive academic credit.
ANSWER:
1. The Senate affirmed that, as an extra-curricular program, ROTC has "a legitimate place" at Stan
ford, even though forty per-cent of those voting felt that no officer training program should be
permitted at Stanford.
2. The student referendum, though its results were ambigious, is at most advisory. We are traditional
enough to believe that only the faculty should finally determine curriculum.
3. A military officer at Stanford with an extra-curricular ROTC program would still be free to submit
any course he might like to teach for academic credit to the Committee on Undergraduate Educa
tion for approval as an Undergraduate Special course. Thus, those aspects of the ROTC program of
"genuine academic interest" could receive academic credit through established procedures.
OBJECTION:
The trustees are opposed to the abolition of ROTC at Stanford.
ANSWER:
The Senate recommends only the abolition of academic status for ROTC, not the abolition of ROTC as
an on-campus, extra-curricular activity. Again, we believe that it is the responsibility of the faculty,
not the trustees, to determine academic curriculum and faculty status at Stanford.
We urge you to support the Academic Senate action on ROTC.

2. The student referendum, though its results were ambigious, is at most advisory. We are traditional
enough to believe that only the faculty should finally determine curriculum.
3. A military officer at Stanford with an extra-curricular ROTC program would still be free to submit
any course he might like to teach for academic credit to the Committee on Undergraduate Educa
tion for approval as an Undergraduate Special course. Thus, those aspects of the ROTC program of
"genuine academic interest" could receive academic credit through established procedures.
OBJECTION:
The trustees are opposed to the abolition of ROTC at Stanford.
ANSWER:
The Senate recommends only the abolition of academic status for ROTC, not the abolition of ROTC as
an on-campus, extra-curricular activity. Again, we believe that it is the responsibility of the faculty,
not the trustees, to determine academic curriculum and faculty status at Stanford.
We urge you to support the Academic Senate action on ROTC.

The ROTC Issue
As Stanford faculty members, we have long been concerned about the propriety of Stanford's relation
ship with the ROTC programs. We applauded the Academic Senate's decision to examine this relationship,
and concur with the Senate action on ROTC.
We feel strongly that Stanford should not relinquish to an external institution the right to determine the
content and goals of Stanford's academic curriculum and select Stanford faculty members. For the last
fifty years, Stanford has relinquished this right only to the Armed Forces.
Suppose a religious denomination offered to establish a seminary as a department at Stanford; provide
its faculty; determine its curriculum; set achievementandards for its students; and provide financial aid
to its students in return for their incurring a contractual obligation to serve the church as ministers.
Such an arrangement would clearly compromise Stanford's academic integrity and independence. How
ever socially desirable it migh be, most Stanford faculty would surely oppose it. Yet, the Armed Forces now
have a special relation of this sort with Stanford. We have seen no arguments demonstrating that the
Armed Forces have a unique right to such a special arrangement. However, we welcome the Armed Forces
to Stanford, on the same footing as churches and other governmental and private agencies, to organize and
run extra-curricular programs for students wishing to participate in them.
Several objections to the Senate's action on ROTC have been raised. Some of these rest on a misunder
standing of the Senate's action; others rest on a failure to recognize that only the faculty has ultimate re
sponsibility in determining academic curriculum, faculty selection procedures, and the status of departments
at Stanford.
OBJECTION:
The Senate's action is tantamount to the abolition of ROTC at Stanford and would "tend to remove
the training of officers from tjne civilizing influences of the University life."
ANSWER:
1. We appreciate the need for civilian influence of the Armed Forces. We believe that a full scholarship
officer procurment program (for example, school-year academic work in regular departments plus
summer training) can and should continue at Stanford within the guidelines recommended by the
Senate. These guidelines are less stringent than those recently established at other major univers
ities (Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Cornell). The Defense Department has already indicated its desire to
negotiate a new on-campus program with these universities.
2. No evidence has been introduced to support the assertion that ROTC cannot continue as a viable
program without academic credit. Students who genuinely wish to participate in such a program
will certainly be willing to do so on an extra-curricular basis. ROTC as an extra-curricular activity
would require no commitment in time and energy from a student than does the football team, the
United Christian Ministry program or the debate team.
OBJECTION:
The Senate action deprives the administration of sufficient flexibility in negotiating a new ROTC pro
gram with the Department of Defense.
ANSWER:
1. The Senate's action does no more than make explicit what is meant by "programs consistent with
academic objectives and standards of the University.'' It calls for conditions widely regarded as
essential for free inquiry:
—that instructors in the University be nominated only by members of its own faculty and be re
sponsible only to organs of the University for the quality and objectivity of their work.
—that instructors themselves, and no extra-university agency, determine the content of their
courses and the standards to be met.
This is no more than other major universities have recently agreed to be the minimal content of "aca
demic standards and objectives." If we disapprove of the Senate's action we shall be telling the
President we would be satisfied with less. The factulty should not fail to assume its prime responsi
bility in this area.
2. The Senate action gives the administration at least as much time to negotiate an extra-curricular
program with the Defense Department as the second alternative on the ballot would allow to negoti
ate an altered program. The transitional period recommended by the Senate does not begin until
September, 1970, nor end until September, 1973. During this time the Senate is always free to
modify its guidelines and to extend the negotiating period.
OBJECTION:
Sixty per-cent of those who voted in the recent student referendum felt that ROTC had "a legitimate
place" at Stanford and that "those aspects of the ROTC program of genuine academic interest"
should receive academic credit.

essential for free inquiry:
—that instructors in the University be nominated only by members of its own faculty and be re
sponsible only to organs of the University for the quality and objectivity of their work.
—that instructors themselves, and no extra-university agency, determine the content of their
courses and the standards to be met.
This is no more than other major universities have recently agreed to be the minimal content of "aca
demic standards and objectives." If we disapprove of the Senate's action we shall be telling the
President we would be satisfied with less. The factulty should not fail to assume its prime responsi
bility in this area.
2. The Senate action gives the administration at least as much time to negotiate an extra-curricular
program with the Defense Department as the second alternative on the ballot would allow to negoti
ate an altered program. The transitional period recommended by the Senate does not begin until
September, 1970, nor end until September, 1973. During this time the Senate is always free to
modify its guidelines and to extend the negotiating period.
OBJECTION:
Sixty per-cent of those who voted in the recent student referendum felt that ROTC had "a legitimate
place" at Stanford and that "those aspects of the ROTC program of genuine academic interest"
should receive academic credit.
ANSWER:
1. The Senate affirmed that, as an extra-curricular program, ROTC has "a legitimate place" at Stan
ford, even though forty per-cent of those voting felt that no officer training program should be
permitted at Stanford.
2. The student referendum, though its results were ambigious, is at most advisory. We are traditional
enough to believe that only the faculty should finally determine curriculum.
3. A military officer at Stanford with an extra-curricular ROTC program would still be free to submit
any course he might like to teach for academic credit to the Committee on Undergraduate Educa
tion for approval as an Undergraduate Special course. Thus, those aspects of the ROTC program of
"genuine academic interest" could receive academic credit through established procedures.
OBJECTION:
The trustees are opposed to the abolition of ROTC at Stanford.
ANSWER:
The Senate recommends only the abolition of academic status for ROTC, not the abolition of ROTC as
an on-campus, extra-curricular activity. Again, we believe that it is the responsibility of the faculty,
not the trustees, to determine academic curriculum and faculty status at Stanford.
We urge you to support the Academic Senate action on ROTC.

The ROTC Issue
As Stanford faculty members, we have long been concerned about the propriety of Stanford's relation
ship with the ROTC programs. We applauded the Academic Senate's decision to examine this relationship,
and concur with the Senate action on ROTC.
We feel strongly that Stanford should not relinquish to an external institution the right to determine the
content and goals of Stanford's academic curriculum and select Stanford faculty members. For the last
fifty years, Stanford has relinquished this right only to the Armed Forces.
Suppose a religious denomination offered to establish a seminary as a department at Stanford; provide
its faculty; determine its curriculum; set achievementandards for its students; and provide financial aid
to its students in return for their incurring a contractual obligation to serve the church as ministers.
Such an arrangement would clearly compromise Stanford's academic integrity and independence. How
ever socially desirable it migh be, most Stanford faculty would surely oppose it. Yet, the Armed Forces now
have a special relation of this sort with Stanford. We have seen no arguments demonstrating that the
Armed Forces have a unique right to such a special arrangement. However, we welcome the Armed Forces
to Stanford, on the same footing as churches and other governmental and private agencies, to organize and
run extra-curricular programs for students wishing to participate in them.
Several objections to the Senate's action on ROTC have been raised. Some of these rest on a misunder
standing of the Senate's action; others rest on a failure to recognize that only the faculty has ultimate re
sponsibility in determining academic curriculum, faculty selection procedures, and the status of departments
at Stanford.
OBJECTION:
The Senate's action is tantamount to the abolition of ROTC at Stanford and would "tend to remove
the training of officers from tjne civilizing influences of the University life."
ANSWER:
1. We appreciate the need for civilian influence of the Armed Forces. We believe that a full scholarship
officer procurment program (for example, school-year academic work in regular departments plus
summer training) can and should continue at Stanford within the guidelines recommended by the
Senate. These guidelines are less stringent than those recently established at other major univers
ities (Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Cornell). The Defense Department has already indicated its desire to
negotiate a new on-campus program with these universities.
2. No evidence has been introduced to support the assertion that ROTC cannot continue as a viable
program without academic credit. Students who genuinely wish to participate in such a program
will certainly be willing to do so on an extra-curricular basis. ROTC as an extra-curricular activity
would require no commitment in time and energy from a student than does the football team, the
United Christian Ministry program or the debate team.
OBJECTION:
The Senate action deprives the administration of sufficient flexibility in negotiating a new ROTC pro
gram with the Department of Defense.
