# Confidential Letter
## Pitzer: Revamp Board 
### PHILIP TAUBMAN 
In a confidential letter to the
Stanford Board of Trustees, President
Kenneth Pitzer has called for a major
overhaul in trustee operations and
structures.
Though Pitzer refused to release the
text of the letter yesterday, apparently
after intense pressure from trustees to
withhold the contents, unimpeachable t
sources who read the letter summarized
its contents, calling it "a forceful plea
for dramatic changes."
The letter, written on Friday April 4,
five days before the AEL sit-in began,
evidently notes that many on campus
feel that trustee organization is
outdated and in need of immediate and
far reaching alteration.
Pitzer, according to the sources,
explains that the necessary changes in
Board structure cannot easily be made
through Charter revision because that
entails prolonged court action. Pitzer,
therefore, offers the alternative
approach of making by-law changes in
the trustee's by-laws, allowing
immediate shifts.
The letter evidently suggests the
Board make changes comparable to
those made in the Rice University Board
when Pitzer was president there. Such
changes would include greatly

diversifying membership on the board
and establishing a guiding committee of
the board—one that might include
faculty and students—to oversee
operations of the University, with the
full board meeting less frequently and
acting on broader issues than presently.
Such a committee would have
decision making authority.
The Daily learned of Pitzer's letter
yesterday afternoon. The President's
Office refused to release the text, but

contacted by phone in Minneapolis,
Pitzer said he felt release might be
acceptable, assuming trustee permission
were granted.
Early in the evening, the following
note was delivered to The Daily by
Robert W. Beyers, director of the
Stanford News Service:
"President Pitzer has decided not to
release his private letter to the Board of
Trustees outlining the ideas which he
felt could be basis for discussion of
changes in the Board's structures.
"The President has pointed out that
he feels the Study of Education at
Stanford (SES) proposals already offer
quite an adequate basis for discussion of
this matter. With John Gardner, he
senses within the board a firm
commitment to some substantial
changes in its composition and
organization.
"Gardner last week was named to
head a five man trustee committee to
make recommendations concerning the
board's structure, composition, and
function."
Between the time Pitzer was
contacted in Minneapolis and delivery
of the note from Beyers, Pitzer had
evidently been dissuaded from releasing
the text by William Parmer Fuller, the
board president.

Between the time Pitzer was
contacted in Minneapolis and delivery
of the note from Beyers, Pitzer had
evidently been dissuaded from releasing
the text by William Parmer Fuller, the
board president.

In a confidential letter to the
Stanford Board of Trustees, President
Kenneth Pitzer has called for a major
overhaul in trustee operations and
structures.
Though Pitzer refused to release the
text of the letter yesterday, apparently
after intense pressure from trustees to
withhold the contents, unimpeachable t
sources who read the letter summarized
its contents, calling it "a forceful plea
for dramatic changes."
The letter, written on Friday April 4,
five days before the AEL sit-in began,
evidently notes that many on campus
feel that trustee organization is
outdated and in need of immediate and
far reaching alteration.
Pitzer, according to the sources,
explains that the necessary changes in
Board structure cannot easily be made
through Charter revision because that
entails prolonged court action. Pitzer,
therefore, offers the alternative
approach of making by-law changes in
the trustee's by-laws, allowing
immediate shifts.
The letter evidently suggests the
Board make changes comparable to
those made in the Rice University Board
when Pitzer was president there. Such
changes would include greatly

diversifying membership on the board
and establishing a guiding committee of
the board—one that might include
faculty and students—to oversee
operations of the University, with the
full board meeting less frequently and
acting on broader issues than presently.
Such a committee would have
decision making authority.
The Daily learned of Pitzer's letter
yesterday afternoon. The President's
Office refused to release the text, but

contacted by phone in Minneapolis,
Pitzer said he felt release might be
acceptable, assuming trustee permission
were granted.
Early in the evening, the following
note was delivered to The Daily by
Robert W. Beyers, director of the
Stanford News Service:
"President Pitzer has decided not to
release his private letter to the Board of
Trustees outlining the ideas which he
felt could be basis for discussion of
changes in the Board's structures.
"The President has pointed out that
he feels the Study of Education at
Stanford (SES) proposals already offer
quite an adequate basis for discussion of
this matter. With John Gardner, he
senses within the board a firm
commitment to some substantial
changes in its composition and
organization.
"Gardner last week was named to
head a five man trustee committee to
make recommendations concerning the
board's structure, composition, and
function."
Between the time Pitzer was
contacted in Minneapolis and delivery
of the note from Beyers, Pitzer had
evidently been dissuaded from releasing
the text by William Parmer Fuller, the
