# What Now?

After a deed's been done, there comes a
time to step back, to let previous decisions
pass in review, and then make choices
about the future. If necessary such an
occasion would be the time to examine
premises, reassign priorities, or overhaul
strategy.
In the course of the sit-in this process of
reassessment and re-evaluation has been
constantly going on in people's minds in
their conversations. Variations on the
theme of "to stay or not to stay" are no
longer welcome among those sitting-in and
in other circles. Familiarity with the
arguments has made them seem tedious to
many however. It is our hope that all sides
will continue to be open to new
information. In that hope, we try to review
here some arguments for leaving the
building, for staying in the building, and
for escalating tactically.
A large part of the argument forgetting
out is an elaboration of a point-made at the
meeting in Dinkelspiel the night the sit-in
began. It was asserted that sit-ins have a life
of their own, and that the life of sit-ins
tends to obscure the issues which sparked
the action.
This contention has much truth in it.
But left out is understanding the fact that
those who sat-in wanted their moral
concerns manifested in moral action with
which the Trustees would have to reckon.
The hundreds of people who decided to
sit-in did something quite different from
merely passing around a petition and
collecting hundreds of signatures.
Instead they decided: no more prayers
to an unjust king. Because of that decision
the issues are inextricably bound up in the
sit-in's challenge to the normal
decision-making process. That is why we all
have the issues constantly before us, and
that is why the issues raised by the April 3
Movement's demands must be faced and
will be faced.
To those who find the sit-in a
distraction, one can only reply that it is
more than a distraction. It is an effort to
bring to an end patterns of behavior which
have made Stanford a regular accomplice of
the death-dealing American colossus.
Some argue that ending the sit-in would
provide "freedom to work for the
demands." There is a great deal of work
being done on campus and in the
surrounding community in support of the
demands. If someone is more valuable
organizing community support, then that
person should be out organizing.
But there remains a need for continued
occupation of the Applied Electronics
Laboratory. Ending the sit-in would
provide an atmosphere in which it was
easier to create a compromise designed to
placate constituencies instead of reaching a

decision addressed to the issues. Getting
out of the building would provide freedom
for the politics of maneuvering behind
closed doors. This is clearly unacceptable
to those sitting-in. They have called for
open decision-making meetings of the
Trustees.
By staying in the building those
sitting-in remain committed. They are
building a community which is still growing
and is relating well to those on the outside.
The faculty tea on Sunday and the talks
with SRI employees yesterday are evidence
of serious desire of the sit-in community to
reach out to those outside. The energy of
the group is by no means dissipated. There
is no reason to expect the community to
dissolve.
The Trustees' stance has not changed so
far and the faculty's response so far has
been insufficient. This means that the
moral concerns of the sit-in remain the
same. The staying power of those
occupying the building is being tested, but
they are still there and business-as-usual is
not going on at the Electronics Laboratory.
Last night there was a motion which
sought to bind those sitting-in to leaving if
the faculty senate took favorable action on
the demands. The rejection of this
resolution may prove to have been a
tactical error. Rejection of the resolution
can perhaps be understood as reflecting the
feelings of the group that they should first
have a response from the faculty or the
Trustees before them and then act in the
light of its content. There is a sentiment
among some at the sit-in that declaring
beforehand that the occupation was going
to cease would change it from an active
sit-in to a dwindling vigil.
It is difficult to consider tactical
escalation before it happens. As with each
part of the sit-in so far the possibility of
outside police must be thought of. Bringing
up the possibility of police intervention has
been and will be a tactic of some who wish
to frighten and paralyze the sit-in.
Nonetheless, outside police are a
possibility, the consequences of their
appearance on campus should be weighed
carefully.
Taking another building would add
pressure to that which already exists.
Occupation of a new building might occur
because there has been no real response to
the demands so far. But it appears that here
the disadvantages outweigh the benefits.
Our conclusion, then, is that continued
occupation of AEL is important and
necessary, within a limit. Should the
faculty senate take dramatic and acceptable
action today and support Coalition
demands, remaining in the building beyond
tonight will be a rocky road.
Perhaps even an unreasonable road.
