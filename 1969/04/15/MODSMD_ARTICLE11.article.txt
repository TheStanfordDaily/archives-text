# Pitzer Today
## 
### 
In a time of crisis, we are getting to
know Stanford's new president. We like
what we see.
Kenneth Pitzer made an extraordinary
statement to the Trustees on Tuesday. It
was particularly startling when contrasted
to Notre Dame President Theodore
Hesburg's line on student unrest.
To the enthusiastic applause of Richard
Nixon, Hesburg threatened demonstrators
with what amounts to instant expulsion if
they fail to comply with administration
directives. One is tempted to regard this
kind of authoritarianism as shortsighted.
But it is a very easy solution to certain
kinds of problems, if you happen to believe
in your own authority.
Pitzer chose a harder and more realistic
path. He tried to tell the Trustees what is
going on.
"You are being held responsible for the
war in Vietnam, for the draft, for our
failure to find a way to stop the nuclear
arms race, for the oil leak in the Santa
Barbara channel," he said. "Mistakes are
made in any decade, but I share the view
that our recent record is exceptionally
dismal."
He also attempted to tell these
custodians of corporate, technological and
political power what is expected of them:
"You are being asked through your
decisions on SRI to say that our national
priorities are wrong-that we spend too
much on the military, on means to kill
people, and not enough on constructive
things, on helping ordinary people to live."
Pitzer's attitude toward the sit-in, his
statements to the April 3 Coalition, and
even his activities off campus in the last
week portray a man who has thrown off
the burden of guarded executive comment
and begun articulating his personal feelings.
The change in Pitzer's public comments
since he arrived at Stanford last December

is startling and exhilirating. He has
suddenly become one of the most dynamic
and progressive University presidents in the
United States.
Recent examples are impressive. Even
when notifying the Coalition that they
were in violation of University policy while
occupying AEL, Pitzer stated, "While I
understand your deep commitment to
bring change for the better at this
University and in this country . . ."
Yesterday in Minneapolis, while
receiving the Priestly gold medal for work
in chemistry, Pitzer attacked plans for large
underground nuclear tests in earthquake
prone areas and criticized the proposed
supersonic transport (SST).
Pitzer's speech yesterday called for "a
more humanistic set of priorities" in
national research expenditures.
As reported on page 1 of The Daily,
Pitzer has written the Board of Trustees a
letter recommending major changes in their
structure and function. Though the
President, under extreme pressure from
Board members has refused to release the
text of his letter, second hand knowledge
indicates Pitzer basically suggested that the
Board be revamped to emphasize diversity
among members and closer contact to the
University.
He is increasingly taking stronger stands
about trustee backwardness and,
furthermore, his response to the sit-in so
far shows great restraint and intelligence.
Pitzer is under great pressure to end the
AEL occupation by bringing in the police.
It has been done at 9 out of 10 other
demonstrations and the usual response to
student activism is police action. Pitzer
seems committed to avoiding such a
confrontation and instead dealing with the
student concerns. He has apparently seen
beyond the sit-in to the issues.
Kenneth Pitzer is emerging as the leader
Stanford has so lone needed.

University and in this country . . ."
Yesterday in Minneapolis, while
receiving the Priestly gold medal for work
in chemistry, Pitzer attacked plans for large
underground nuclear tests in earthquake
prone areas and criticized the proposed
supersonic transport (SST).
Pitzer's speech yesterday called for "a
more humanistic set of priorities" in
national research expenditures.
As reported on page 1 of The Daily,
Pitzer has written the Board of Trustees a
letter recommending major changes in their
structure and function. Though the
President, under extreme pressure from
Board members has refused to release the
text of his letter, second hand knowledge
indicates Pitzer basically suggested that the
Board be revamped to emphasize diversity
among members and closer contact to the
University.
He is increasingly taking stronger stands
about trustee backwardness and,
furthermore, his response to the sit-in so
far shows great restraint and intelligence.
Pitzer is under great pressure to end the
AEL occupation by bringing in the police.
It has been done at 9 out of 10 other
demonstrations and the usual response to
student activism is police action. Pitzer
seems committed to avoiding such a
confrontation and instead dealing with the
student concerns. He has apparently seen
beyond the sit-in to the issues.
Kenneth Pitzer is emerging as the leader
Stanford has so lone needed.
In a time of crisis, we are getting to
know Stanford's new president. We like
what we see.
Kenneth Pitzer made an extraordinary
statement to the Trustees on Tuesday. It
was particularly startling when contrasted
to Notre Dame President Theodore
Hesburg's line on student unrest.
To the enthusiastic applause of Richard
Nixon, Hesburg threatened demonstrators
with what amounts to instant expulsion if
they fail to comply with administration
directives. One is tempted to regard this
kind of authoritarianism as shortsighted.
But it is a very easy solution to certain
kinds of problems, if you happen to believe
in your own authority.
Pitzer chose a harder and more realistic
path. He tried to tell the Trustees what is
going on.
"You are being held responsible for the
war in Vietnam, for the draft, for our
failure to find a way to stop the nuclear
arms race, for the oil leak in the Santa
Barbara channel," he said. "Mistakes are
made in any decade, but I share the view
that our recent record is exceptionally
dismal."
He also attempted to tell these
custodians of corporate, technological and
political power what is expected of them:
"You are being asked through your
decisions on SRI to say that our national
priorities are wrong-that we spend too
much on the military, on means to kill
people, and not enough on constructive
things, on helping ordinary people to live."
Pitzer's attitude toward the sit-in, his
statements to the April 3 Coalition, and
even his activities off campus in the last
week portray a man who has thrown off
the burden of guarded executive comment
and begun articulating his personal feelings.
The change in Pitzer's public comments
since he arrived at Stanford last December

is startling and exhilirating. He has
suddenly become one of the most dynamic
and progressive University presidents in the
United States.
Recent examples are impressive. Even
when notifying the Coalition that they
were in violation of University policy while
occupying AEL, Pitzer stated, "While I
understand your deep commitment to
bring change for the better at this
University and in this country . . ."
