## Why Is The Sky Brown? 
### Ned Groth 
The Smog this spring is worse
than ever, although, with the
current turmoil over war research,
almost nobody stopped to notice.
We tend to ignore the brown haze,
because it's always there; few
people realize that, in the long
run, pollution is at least as grave a
threat as, say CBW.
Even fewer people realixe that
smog is there because of political
reasons. In fact, the reasons for
pollution are very much the same
as the reasons for war research:
money and power.
Environmental deterioration is
rapidly reaching the critical stage,
even the once-pure Bay Area now
has days that make you think
you're in L.A. San Jose ranks
third among American cities in
the amount of cancer-causing
particles in its air; over the whole
six-county area, five pounds of
pollutants are dumped into the air
each day for every person living in
the region. And it continues to get
worse, as population and the
economy push upwards.
A tax-supported agency, the
Bay Area Air Pollution Control
District, is responsible for keeping

the air clean. By any objective
criteria, they have failed in that
task. When the BAAPCD was set
up in 1956, smog was getting to
be a serious problem; today, it is a
crisis.
The BAAPCD has neither the
structure, the policies, nor the
tools required to do an effective
job of controlling air pollution;
yet district officials work very
hard to create the impression that
they have all the problems under
control. The mere existence of the
regulatory agency makes the
public feel more secure, but in
reality the BAAPCD is one of the
largest single obstacles in the way
of truly effective smog control.
No Say On Cars
Automobiles account for
roughly half of our smog; the
BAAPCD has no jurisdiction over
cars, but is responsible for
regulating industries and open
burning. They have done a fair job
on open rubbish incineration, but
the effectiveness of the BAAPCD
is controlling industrial emissions
is seriously hampered by several
structural and procedural details.
The decision-making arm of

the BAAPCD, its board of
directors, has a political structure
that makes it difficult for the
BAAPCD to take a firm stand
against polluting industries. All of
the directors are local
politicians—county supervisors,
city councilmen, and
mayors—who are constantly
reminded by industry of the
important role played by the
polluting plants in local
economies.
Industries have threatened to
pack up their plants and move
out, taking their tax-bases and
payrolls with them, if stricter
regulations are enacted. It is
significant to note that there are
only a few really bad industrail
polluters in the Bay Area, and
that they are almost all among the
most powerful and largest
corporations in the area. A dozen
major offenders account for
almost 25% of Bay Area smog.

Union Oil, FMC, Kaiser, Leslie
Salt, etc.)
Conflict Of Interest
At least two members of the
Advisory Council have what

would appear to be clear-cut
conflicts of interest. Robert L.
Severns, the current chairman,
served as a top executive at
Owens-Corning Fiberglass, one of
the area's worst polluters, before
he was appointed to the Advisory
Council. *
Elmer Robinson, head of the
Environmental Research Dept. at
SRI, has often been hired as a
consultant by polluting industries;
he carries the viewpoint of those
industries with him to Advisory
Council meetings, where his words
have considerable influence.
Loopholes
The regulations the BAAPCD
uses to "control" pollution would
be farcical, if people's health were
not at stake. The rules are so full
of loopholes and inadequacies
that most major industrial
polluters go virtually unpunished.
For instance, by raising the
height of its smokestacks, an oil
refinery can get away with
dumping huge amounts of sulfur
dioxide into the air. Any
pollution that is the result of an
equipment breakdown is forgiven,
under BAAPCD rules; this
loophole allowed Shell Oil's
Martinex refinery to emit massive
volumes of pollutants on 84 of
111 consecutive days in 1967,
with no punishment.
In addition, in this age of
complicated electronics, the
BAAPCD still uses a very simple
instrum en t — t he human
eyeball—to "measure" emissions
and determine whether a plant is
violating any rules.
Refused Aid
Although apologizing for guilty
industries is their standard fare,
last year BAAPCD sank to a new
low. D. Jud Callaghan, Chief
Adm : nistrative Officer of the
District, announced that the
BAAPCD would turn down
$208,000 in federal aid, rather
than allow the federal government
to impose stricter regulations on
the five Bay Area oil refineries,
which are apparently emitting
more sulfur dioxide than federal
standards allow.
BAAPCD officials blame their
failures—when they admit to
any—on public apathy and
ignorance. In reality, the
BAAPCD has failed in another
assigned task, that of education.
The BAAPCD has not only
failed to inform the public about
what plants are putting out what
pollutants, and in what amounts;
on occasion, it has refused to
divulge such information to
concerned citizens. When pressed
on specific issues, the district's
normal reply has been "that is no
problem," or "we're working on
it."
The essence of the pollution
problem, in the Bay Area and
elsewhere, is not public
indifference; rather, the difficulty
lies in the inordinate amount of
power and influence which guilty
industries have over regulatory
agencies.
The values which determine
how much sewage is in the air are
not the health and comfort of the
people as a whole, but to a large
extent the economic necessities of
the polluting industries. The
BAAPCD, instead of serving the
residents of the Bay Area, spends
our funds to work for the
polluters.

you're in L.A. San Jose ranks
third among American cities in
the amount of cancer-causing
particles in its air; over the whole
six-county area, five pounds of
pollutants are dumped into the air
each day for every person living in
the region. And it continues to get
worse, as population and the
economy push upwards.
A tax-supported agency, the
Bay Area Air Pollution Control
District, is responsible for keeping

the air clean. By any objective
criteria, they have failed in that
task. When the BAAPCD was set
up in 1956, smog was getting to
be a serious problem; today, it is a
crisis.
The BAAPCD has neither the
structure, the policies, nor the
tools required to do an effective
job of controlling air pollution;
yet district officials work very
hard to create the impression that
they have all the problems under
control. The mere existence of the
regulatory agency makes the
public feel more secure, but in
reality the BAAPCD is one of the
largest single obstacles in the way
of truly effective smog control.
No Say On Cars
Automobiles account for
roughly half of our smog; the
BAAPCD has no jurisdiction over
cars, but is responsible for
regulating industries and open
burning. They have done a fair job
on open rubbish incineration, but
the effectiveness of the BAAPCD
is controlling industrial emissions
is seriously hampered by several
structural and procedural details.
The decision-making arm of

the BAAPCD, its board of
directors, has a political structure
that makes it difficult for the
BAAPCD to take a firm stand
against polluting industries. All of
the directors are local
politicians—county supervisors,
city councilmen, and
mayors—who are constantly
reminded by industry of the
important role played by the
polluting plants in local
economies.
Industries have threatened to
pack up their plants and move
out, taking their tax-bases and
payrolls with them, if stricter
regulations are enacted. It is
significant to note that there are
only a few really bad industrail
polluters in the Bay Area, and
that they are almost all among the
most powerful and largest
corporations in the area. A dozen
major offenders account for
almost 25% of Bay Area smog.

Union Oil, FMC, Kaiser, Leslie
Salt, etc.)
Conflict Of Interest
At least two members of the
Advisory Council have what

would appear to be clear-cut
conflicts of interest. Robert L.
Severns, the current chairman,
served as a top executive at
Owens-Corning Fiberglass, one of
the area's worst polluters, before
he was appointed to the Advisory
Council. *
Elmer Robinson, head of the
Environmental Research Dept. at
SRI, has often been hired as a
consultant by polluting industries;
he carries the viewpoint of those
industries with him to Advisory
Council meetings, where his words
have considerable influence.
Loopholes
The regulations the BAAPCD
uses to "control" pollution would
be farcical, if people's health were
not at stake. The rules are so full
of loopholes and inadequacies
that most major industrial
polluters go virtually unpunished.
For instance, by raising the
height of its smokestacks, an oil
refinery can get away with
dumping huge amounts of sulfur
dioxide into the air. Any
pollution that is the result of an
equipment breakdown is forgiven,
under BAAPCD rules; this
loophole allowed Shell Oil's
Martinex refinery to emit massive
volumes of pollutants on 84 of
111 consecutive days in 1967,
with no punishment.
In addition, in this age of
complicated electronics, the
BAAPCD still uses a very simple
instrum en t — t he human
eyeball—to "measure" emissions
and determine whether a plant is
violating any rules.
Refused Aid
Although apologizing for guilty
industries is their standard fare,
last year BAAPCD sank to a new
low. D. Jud Callaghan, Chief
Adm : nistrative Officer of the
District, announced that the
BAAPCD would turn down
$208,000 in federal aid, rather
than allow the federal government
to impose stricter regulations on
the five Bay Area oil refineries,
which are apparently emitting
more sulfur dioxide than federal
standards allow.
BAAPCD officials blame their
failures—when they admit to
any—on public apathy and
ignorance. In reality, the
BAAPCD has failed in another
assigned task, that of education.
The BAAPCD has not only
failed to inform the public about
what plants are putting out what
pollutants, and in what amounts;
on occasion, it has refused to
divulge such information to
concerned citizens. When pressed
on specific issues, the district's
normal reply has been "that is no
problem," or "we're working on
it."
The essence of the pollution
problem, in the Bay Area and
elsewhere, is not public
indifference; rather, the difficulty
lies in the inordinate amount of
power and influence which guilty
industries have over regulatory
agencies.
The values which determine
how much sewage is in the air are
not the health and comfort of the
people as a whole, but to a large
extent the economic necessities of
the polluting industries. The
BAAPCD, instead of serving the
residents of the Bay Area, spends
our funds to work for the
polluters.

The Smog this spring is worse

The BAAPCD has neither the
structure, the policies, nor the
tools required to do an effective
job of controlling air pollution;
yet district officials work very
hard to create the impression that
they have all the problems under
control. The mere existence of the
regulatory agency makes the
public feel more secure, but in
reality the BAAPCD is one of the
largest single obstacles in the way
of truly effective smog control.
No Say On Cars
Automobiles account for
roughly half of our smog; the
BAAPCD has no jurisdiction over
cars, but is responsible for
regulating industries and open
burning. They have done a fair job
on open rubbish incineration, but
the effectiveness of the BAAPCD
is controlling industrial emissions
is seriously hampered by several
structural and procedural details.
The decision-making arm of

the BAAPCD, its board of
directors, has a political structure
that makes it difficult for the
BAAPCD to take a firm stand
against polluting industries. All of
the directors are local
politicians—county supervisors,
city councilmen, and
mayors—who are constantly
reminded by industry of the
important role played by the
polluting plants in local
economies.
Industries have threatened to
pack up their plants and move
out, taking their tax-bases and
payrolls with them, if stricter
regulations are enacted. It is
significant to note that there are
only a few really bad industrail
polluters in the Bay Area, and
that they are almost all among the
most powerful and largest
corporations in the area. A dozen
major offenders account for
almost 25% of Bay Area smog.

Union Oil, FMC, Kaiser, Leslie
Salt, etc.)
Conflict Of Interest
At least two members of the
Advisory Council have what

would appear to be clear-cut
conflicts of interest. Robert L.
Severns, the current chairman,
served as a top executive at
Owens-Corning Fiberglass, one of
the area's worst polluters, before
he was appointed to the Advisory
Council. *
Elmer Robinson, head of the
Environmental Research Dept. at
SRI, has often been hired as a
consultant by polluting industries;
he carries the viewpoint of those
industries with him to Advisory
Council meetings, where his words
have considerable influence.
Loopholes
The regulations the BAAPCD
uses to "control" pollution would
be farcical, if people's health were
not at stake. The rules are so full
of loopholes and inadequacies
that most major industrial
polluters go virtually unpunished.
For instance, by raising the
height of its smokestacks, an oil
refinery can get away with
dumping huge amounts of sulfur
dioxide into the air. Any
pollution that is the result of an
equipment breakdown is forgiven,
under BAAPCD rules; this
loophole allowed Shell Oil's
Martinex refinery to emit massive
volumes of pollutants on 84 of
111 consecutive days in 1967,
with no punishment.
In addition, in this age of
complicated electronics, the
BAAPCD still uses a very simple
instrum en t — t he human
eyeball—to "measure" emissions
and determine whether a plant is
violating any rules.
Refused Aid
Although apologizing for guilty
industries is their standard fare,
last year BAAPCD sank to a new
low. D. Jud Callaghan, Chief
Adm : nistrative Officer of the
District, announced that the
BAAPCD would turn down
$208,000 in federal aid, rather
than allow the federal government
to impose stricter regulations on
the five Bay Area oil refineries,
which are apparently emitting
more sulfur dioxide than federal
standards allow.
BAAPCD officials blame their
failures—when they admit to
any—on public apathy and
ignorance. In reality, the
BAAPCD has failed in another
assigned task, that of education.
The BAAPCD has not only
failed to inform the public about
what plants are putting out what
pollutants, and in what amounts;
on occasion, it has refused to
divulge such information to
concerned citizens. When pressed
on specific issues, the district's
normal reply has been "that is no
problem," or "we're working on
it."
The essence of the pollution
problem, in the Bay Area and
elsewhere, is not public
indifference; rather, the difficulty
lies in the inordinate amount of
power and influence which guilty
industries have over regulatory
agencies.
The values which determine
how much sewage is in the air are
not the health and comfort of the
people as a whole, but to a large
extent the economic necessities of
the polluting industries. The
BAAPCD, instead of serving the
residents of the Bay Area, spends
our funds to work for the
polluters.

The Smog this spring is worse
than ever, although, with the
current turmoil over war research,
almost nobody stopped to notice.
We tend to ignore the brown haze,
because it's always there; few
people realize that, in the long
run, pollution is at least as grave a
threat as, say CBW.
Even fewer people realixe that
smog is there because of political
reasons. In fact, the reasons for
pollution are very much the same
as the reasons for war research:
money and power.
Environmental deterioration is
rapidly reaching the critical stage,
even the once-pure Bay Area now
has days that make you think
you're in L.A. San Jose ranks
third among American cities in
the amount of cancer-causing
particles in its air; over the whole
six-county area, five pounds of
pollutants are dumped into the air
each day for every person living in
the region. And it continues to get
worse, as population and the
economy push upwards.
A tax-supported agency, the
Bay Area Air Pollution Control
District, is responsible for keeping

the air clean. By any objective
