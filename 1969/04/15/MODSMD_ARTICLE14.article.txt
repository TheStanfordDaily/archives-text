# From The Ivory Tower
## Alternatives: Death Or Enslavement 
### Richard Bube 
The present situation in -the
world suggests that there are two
practical courses of action that
my be undertaken as alternatives
in the future. Neither of these
courses of action may be
considered to be particularly
hopeful if evaluated on the basis
of previous history alone.
The first courseof action is to
continue in a buildup of
armaments and instruments of
warfare, with no foreseeable end
in view, in the effort to maintain a
balance of potential terror. The
argument is that if the potential
terror that can perpetrated by our
side is equivalent to or greater
than the potential that can be
perpetrated by the other side, the
net effect will be a deterrent to
the use of that terror.
The record of history indicates
that any time two nations have
continued to build up huge
backlogs of potential terror, at
some time this unstable stalemate
has crumbled, perhaps under the
influence of a third power, and
the instruments of death have
been regretfully put to use. The
choice if the first course of action
requires the hope that this record
will not be repeated.
The second course of action is
to bring to an end any continued
buildup of armaments and
instruments of warfare, all
chemical-biological research and
research aimed at
counter-insurgency, and to restrict
any militarily-directed research to
measures of defense alone.
The non-aggressive defense of
the country is a legitimate activity
of the government and has a

legitimate claim on the scientific
talent of the country. By
emphasizing restriction to purely
defense activities, however, it is
clear that other nations not
following this restriction may
increase their armaments to the
point where their potential for
terror exceeds our own.
The choice of this second
course of action requires the hope
that other nations of the world
will not take advantage of this
possible inequity to enforce their
will upon this country. History
offers little support for this hope
to be fulfilled.
Death Or Enslavement
In view of this dilemma, how is
any choice to be made? Put into
the most dramatic terms, it
appears that we may be called
upon to choose between death
and enslavement. Has not the
rallying cry of our country from
the very beginning been, "Give me
liberty or give me death?"
It is not the fact, however, that
the choice appears to be between
death and enslavement that
provides the major guide for
making such a choice. For the
choice is not only between death
and enslavement, it is between
killing and enslavement, killing on
a scale and with an abandonment
truly unique to our present times.
And this choice is one that
contains its own directive.
It is properly argued that the
Christian has a perspective that his
fellow humanist, who shares these
same concerns, does not have,
namely the conviction that God is
there, that He is in charge of the

world in an ultimate sense, and
that the sufferings of this world
are not the ultimate dimension of
reality.
No Directive
Such a perspective, however, is
in the nature of a personal faith
that sustains the individual or a
group of individuals in the midst
of the most grievous adversity; it
is not a self-evident directive for
action. The directive for action
must derive from an analysis of
the situation, and from the answer
to the question, "Through what
actions of mine can I maintain
that God is acting in the present
situation?"
Faced with this question, the
analysis of the problem is not
only a choice between death or
killing and enslavement—which
activity is more consistent with
the Christian faith in the ultimate
victory of God's purpose?—it is
also a choice between an
alternative which is evil, and one
which is by historical standards
simply foolish. In this context, I
maintain that the Christian is
called upon to choose the foolish
alternative.
The course of action that calls
for the continued buildup of
armaments for increasing levels of
deterrency can, I believe, be
labeled evil. It is evil for at least
three reasons:
1) it commits a large fraction
of human ingenuity, concern, and
effort to the development of
instruments of death and
destruction,
2) it provides no basis for a
resolution of the problems that

appear to make the buildup
necessary, and
3) it diverts into military
hardware a large portion of the
nation's resources that is badly
needed at home and abroad for
the alleviation of human needs,
poverty, sickness, and injustice.
I cannot see that one can
continue on a course of action
committed to the first set of ideas
while consistently maintaining at
the same time that one is trusting
that God will set things right.
Buildup Foolish
The course of action that calls
for the end of a buildup of
armaments and for a restriction of
research to items essential to
defense alone, can, I believe, be
labeled foolish. It is foolish
because it assumes the possibility
of an alleviation of international
grievances deeply rooted in
history and in national objectives,
simply through he refusal of a
powerful nation to seek to
establish its will throughout the
world by force.
But if it is foolish, it is also a
course of action that is
completely open to the will of
God. Here is a real challenge of
faith.
In the final analysis, if a
Christian must choose between
"serving God" through killing,
and serving God even though
enslaved, does he really have a
choice?

hardware a large portion of the
nation's resources that is badly
needed at home and abroad for
the alleviation of human needs,
poverty, sickness, and injustice.
I cannot see that one can
continue on a course of action
committed to the first set of ideas
while consistently maintaining at
the same time that one is trusting
that God will set things right.
Buildup Foolish
The course of action that calls
for the end of a buildup of
armaments and for a restriction of
research to items essential to
defense alone, can, I believe, be
labeled foolish. It is foolish
because it assumes the possibility
of an alleviation of international
grievances deeply rooted in
history and in national objectives,
simply through he refusal of a
powerful nation to seek to
establish its will throughout the
world by force.
But if it is foolish, it is also a
course of action that is
completely open to the will of
God. Here is a real challenge of
faith.
In the final analysis, if a
Christian must choose between
"serving God" through killing,
and serving God even though
enslaved, does he really have a
choice?
(Richard Bube is a professor in
the Department of Materials
Sceince-Ed.)
The present situation in -the
world suggests that there are two
practical courses of action that
my be undertaken as alternatives
in the future. Neither of these
courses of action may be
considered to be particularly
hopeful if evaluated on the basis
of previous history alone.
The first courseof action is to
continue in a buildup of
armaments and instruments of
warfare, with no foreseeable end
in view, in the effort to maintain a
balance of potential terror. The
argument is that if the potential
terror that can perpetrated by our
side is equivalent to or greater
than the potential that can be
perpetrated by the other side, the
net effect will be a deterrent to
the use of that terror.
The record of history indicates
that any time two nations have
continued to build up huge
backlogs of potential terror, at
some time this unstable stalemate
has crumbled, perhaps under the
influence of a third power, and
the instruments of death have
been regretfully put to use. The
choice if the first course of action
requires the hope that this record
will not be repeated.
The second course of action is
to bring to an end any continued
buildup of armaments and
instruments of warfare, all
chemical-biological research and
research aimed at
counter-insurgency, and to restrict
any militarily-directed research to
measures of defense alone.
The non-aggressive defense of
the country is a legitimate activity
of the government and has a

legitimate claim on the scientific
talent of the country. By
emphasizing restriction to purely
defense activities, however, it is
clear that other nations not
following this restriction may
increase their armaments to the
point where their potential for
terror exceeds our own.
The choice of this second
course of action requires the hope
that other nations of the world
will not take advantage of this
possible inequity to enforce their
will upon this country. History
offers little support for this hope
to be fulfilled.
Death Or Enslavement
In view of this dilemma, how is
any choice to be made? Put into
the most dramatic terms, it
appears that we may be called
upon to choose between death
and enslavement. Has not the
rallying cry of our country from
the very beginning been, "Give me
liberty or give me death?"
It is not the fact, however, that
the choice appears to be between
death and enslavement that
provides the major guide for
making such a choice. For the
choice is not only between death
and enslavement, it is between
killing and enslavement, killing on
a scale and with an abandonment
truly unique to our present times.
And this choice is one that
contains its own directive.
It is properly argued that the
Christian has a perspective that his
fellow humanist, who shares these
same concerns, does not have,
namely the conviction that God is
there, that He is in charge of the

world in an ultimate sense, and
that the sufferings of this world
are not the ultimate dimension of
reality.
No Directive
Such a perspective, however, is
in the nature of a personal faith
that sustains the individual or a
group of individuals in the midst
of the most grievous adversity; it
is not a self-evident directive for
action. The directive for action
must derive from an analysis of
the situation, and from the answer
to the question, "Through what
actions of mine can I maintain
that God is acting in the present
situation?"
Faced with this question, the
analysis of the problem is not
only a choice between death or
killing and enslavement—which
activity is more consistent with
the Christian faith in the ultimate
victory of God's purpose?—it is
also a choice between an
alternative which is evil, and one
which is by historical standards
simply foolish. In this context, I
maintain that the Christian is
called upon to choose the foolish
alternative.
The course of action that calls
for the continued buildup of
armaments for increasing levels of
deterrency can, I believe, be
labeled evil. It is evil for at least
three reasons:
1) it commits a large fraction
of human ingenuity, concern, and
effort to the development of
instruments of death and
destruction,
2) it provides no basis for a
resolution of the problems that

appear to make the buildup
necessary, and
3) it diverts into military
hardware a large portion of the
nation's resources that is badly
needed at home and abroad for
the alleviation of human needs,
poverty, sickness, and injustice.

is not a self-evident directive for
action. The directive for action
must derive from an analysis of
the situation, and from the answer
to the question, "Through what
actions of mine can I maintain
that God is acting in the present
situation?"
Faced with this question, the
analysis of the problem is not
only a choice between death or
killing and enslavement—which
activity is more consistent with
the Christian faith in the ultimate
victory of God's purpose?—it is
also a choice between an
alternative which is evil, and one
which is by historical standards
simply foolish. In this context, I
maintain that the Christian is
called upon to choose the foolish
alternative.
The course of action that calls
for the continued buildup of
armaments for increasing levels of
deterrency can, I believe, be
labeled evil. It is evil for at least
three reasons:
1) it commits a large fraction
of human ingenuity, concern, and
effort to the development of
instruments of death and
destruction,
2) it provides no basis for a
resolution of the problems that

appear to make the buildup
necessary, and
3) it diverts into military
hardware a large portion of the
nation's resources that is badly
needed at home and abroad for
the alleviation of human needs,
poverty, sickness, and injustice.
I cannot see that one can
continue on a course of action
committed to the first set of ideas
while consistently maintaining at
the same time that one is trusting
that God will set things right.
Buildup Foolish
The course of action that calls
for the end of a buildup of
armaments and for a restriction of
research to items essential to
defense alone, can, I believe, be
labeled foolish. It is foolish
because it assumes the possibility
of an alleviation of international
grievances deeply rooted in
history and in national objectives,
simply through he refusal of a
powerful nation to seek to
establish its will throughout the
world by force.
But if it is foolish, it is also a
course of action that is
completely open to the will of
God. Here is a real challenge of
faith.
In the final analysis, if a
Christian must choose between
"serving God" through killing,
and serving God even though
enslaved, does he really have a
choice?
(Richard Bube is a professor in
the Department of Materials
Sceince-Ed.)
The present situation in -the
world suggests that there are two
practical courses of action that
my be undertaken as alternatives
in the future. Neither of these
courses of action may be
considered to be particularly
hopeful if evaluated on the basis
of previous history alone.
The first courseof action is to
continue in a buildup of
armaments and instruments of
warfare, with no foreseeable end
in view, in the effort to maintain a
balance of potential terror. The
argument is that if the potential
terror that can perpetrated by our
side is equivalent to or greater
than the potential that can be
perpetrated by the other side, the
net effect will be a deterrent to
the use of that terror.
The record of history indicates
that any time two nations have
continued to build up huge
backlogs of potential terror, at
some time this unstable stalemate
has crumbled, perhaps under the
influence of a third power, and
the instruments of death have
been regretfully put to use. The
choice if the first course of action
requires the hope that this record
will not be repeated.
The second course of action is
to bring to an end any continued
buildup of armaments and
instruments of warfare, all
chemical-biological research and
research aimed at
counter-insurgency, and to restrict
any militarily-directed research to
measures of defense alone.
The non-aggressive defense of
the country is a legitimate activity
of the government and has a

legitimate claim on the scientific
talent of the country. By
emphasizing restriction to purely
defense activities, however, it is
clear that other nations not
following this restriction may
increase their armaments to the
point where their potential for
terror exceeds our own.
The choice of this second
course of action requires the hope
that other nations of the world
will not take advantage of this
possible inequity to enforce their
will upon this country. History
offers little support for this hope
to be fulfilled.
Death Or Enslavement
In view of this dilemma, how is
any choice to be made? Put into
the most dramatic terms, it
appears that we may be called
upon to choose between death
and enslavement. Has not the
rallying cry of our country from
the very beginning been, "Give me
liberty or give me death?"
It is not the fact, however, that
the choice appears to be between
death and enslavement that
provides the major guide for
making such a choice. For the
choice is not only between death
and enslavement, it is between
killing and enslavement, killing on
a scale and with an abandonment
truly unique to our present times.
And this choice is one that
contains its own directive.
It is properly argued that the
Christian has a perspective that his
fellow humanist, who shares these
same concerns, does not have,
namely the conviction that God is
there, that He is in charge of the

world in an ultimate sense, and
that the sufferings of this world
are not the ultimate dimension of
reality.
No Directive
Such a perspective, however, is
in the nature of a personal faith
that sustains the individual or a
group of individuals in the midst
of the most grievous adversity; it
is not a self-evident directive for
action. The directive for action
must derive from an analysis of
the situation, and from the answer
to the question, "Through what
actions of mine can I maintain
that God is acting in the present
