## Against ROTC Credit 
### 
Editor, THE DAILY:
To someone exposed for seven
years, four in ROTC and three on
active duty, some recent
arguments in favor of allowing
academic credit and professorial
stutus have sounded like rumors
from Never-Never-Land. I was a
"regular" (i.e. scholarship)
student in the Navy program at
Harvard, then officer aboard a
carrier in the Mediterranean. I
know I speak for hundreds of my
acquaintance and similar
experience in saying that
1. The quality of courses was
and must remain necessarily quite
low. They were taught by rote,
mainly from manuals used at
every university in the country.
The only challenge they presented
was how to get an A with little
work: this was done by merely
"creating" the multiple-choice
exam along with the
is, arithmetically
culling past exams.
2. Nevertheless, ROTC courses
and weekly drill were a painful
burden to anyone really interested
in his major, and in college. They
were also a waste of time, in no
way preparing one realistically for
military service: everything useful
is learned after ROTC. Turning a
few courses over to the university
is no solution; ROTC must still
teach guns and leadership.
3. As for the "leavening"
effect of college-trained officers, I
felt and now believe this is in
great part a pretence of the
military: what they want is
manpower, "warm bodies."
4. Finally, given the definite
withdrawal of credit form ROTC
by several other major
universities, the Department of
Defense appears ready to do
almost anything to keep ROTC
associated with the university in
any form. If Stanford decided to
keep ROTC within the academic
curriculum, we may find ourselves
to be a bulwark of military
legitimacy in the country.

• ROTC Benefits
Editor, THE DAILY;
On Friday, April 3, in the open
discussion of the Academic
Council on the ROTC (a matter of
interest to the whole Stanford
community), the question was
raised as to whether the ROTC
input into the military really had
a beneficial effect on the
character of the military
establishment of this country.
It is easiest to demonstrate the
ootential of such a close tie
between the civilian and military
sectors of the country by pointing
to the one ROTC graduate who
rose to the position of
Ch ief-of-State—General George
Marshall.
Despite the fact that Marshall
successfully directed the Army
during its largest conflict, World
War 11, he is best known for the
humanitarian aspects of his tenure
as Secretary of State in the
postwar period. His name is
associated with the Marshall Plan,
which was a landmark in a change
from a vindictive to a rebuilding
and reconstructive policy on the
part of the victor toward the
conquered.

Editor, THE DAILY:
We have had protesting
students occupying the Applied
Electronics Laboratory for several
days. Their intent has been to
disrupt the research activity
normally carried out there, and
they have been quite successful.
Many of these students with
whom I have been talking, I find,
are not even aware of the nature
of our program. We have extended
invitations many times over the
past several years to anyone who
is interested to come and discuss
the nature of our program with
us. Only a few, perhaps less than
10, people have accepted this
invitation.
There are means of discussing
issues within the University and
resolving differences of opinion.
They have not been utilized.
I am conpletely opposed to the
tactics employed by the protesting
students and feel that, regardless
of the intensity of their concern,
it is inappropriate to the
University.

• To Stop Martians
Editor, THE DAILY:
There has been much
discussion and question
concerning the propriety and
morality of the sit-in currently
being conducted at the Applied
Electronics Laboratory, and I am
pleased to announce that I have
the answer for this dispute.
Anyone who watched the "War
of the Worlds" two nights ago on
channel 7 knows that it is due to
our CBW research that the
invasion of the Martians was
halted, and the same research
MUST be continued in order to
prevent the recurrence of this
tragic occurrance. I hope that
those conducting the sit-in will
take note of this fact and cease
their irrational activities.

• Ideal Revolution
Editor, THE DAILY:
I support the revolution. I
support a revolution against the
technological and social
immensity of our society and
against the regulation of my life,
its content and potentials. I
support a revolution against the
patterns of thinking which
support it, the superficial
background of morality and
mores.
I dislike this society with its
pettiness and narrow-mindedness.
I dislike men having control over
tremendous sums of money. I
dislike a government of lethargic
saps who won't even help the
ghetto in the nation's capital and,
instead, bombs Vietnamese
villages. I dislike all the social ills
of this country and of this world.
But right now, what I dislike
most of all is the imbecilic
behavior of a group of so-called
intellectuals who think that by
pitching their tents in the AEL for
the cause of a moral code that was
fed into them like so much ticker
tape into a computer they are
going to change a damned thing!
At least I can understand a
government and a society who
defend their position with
practical arguments and personal
experience. What I don't
understand is students who try to
read out the ticker tape to me and
expect to gain my support.
The revolution I support will
be of professionals in the fields of
science and the humanities who
have faced reality and realized
that the only way to change this
society is to gain the education,
self-control, and stamina to get to
positions of authority.
But yet, unlike the revolution
of the impractical moralists over
in the AEL building, this
revolution of the practical
idealists will be successful!

• Civilian Weapons
Editor, THE DAILY:
There is a movement underfoot
(I believe that is the correct word)
to ban classified (i.e., military)
research at Stanford. I would like
to point out one of the dangers
which would follow from the
success of this cause.
Banning military research at
civilian institutions would not, of
course, spell the end of such
research, merely its transfer to
military or para-military (e.g.,
SRI) laboratories.
The evil of such a transfer
should be obvious. In the Soviet
Union all military research is
conducted in essentially military
laboratories. The result has been
the development of perfectly
malignant weaponry, for example
the "dirty H-bomb." By way of
contrast, military research in the
essentially civilian laboratories of
the United States has produced
such comparatively benign
weapons as the "clean H-bomb."
Now it is true that in Nazi
Germany certain odious military
work (e.g., the development of
nerve gases) was done in civilian
enterprises (I.G. Farben), and that
similar work is, or was until
recently, being done in civilian
enterprises in the United States.
And it may be assumed that, in
some cases, the products of
military research in the Soviet
Union and of civilian research in
the United States are superficially

indistinguishable. But there is a
difference.
That difference is suggested by
"A Report from Stanford Faculty
concerned about Ramification of
the Senate Decision Affecting
ROTC" (the Stanford Daily, April
4, 1969). Just as civilian-educated
military men are less destructive
of humane values than
military-educated military men,
so, too, must civilian-invented
military implements differ from
military-invented implements. The
difference, of course, is all the
more real for being metaphysical.
Thus, if the contemplation of
suchcivilian- c on c e iv e d
iinstrumentalities of warfare as
the pacification techniques being
employed in Vietnam, napalm,
anti-personnel fragmentation
bombs, chemical and biological
agents, and so on through the
inventory, gives you a case of the
nervous nellies, obtain relief in
seconds by thinking upon the
really bad stuff that the military
might have come up with. It does
stagger the imagination.
It follows that if we wish to
continue to have the enormous
benefits of civilian-produced
weapons we should have more,
not less, military research at
Stanford, just as by on-campus
military training we have been
able to maintain a benevolent
military establishment and to
avoid (to quote the
above-mentioned "Report") "the
arbitrary use of military forces in
civilian affairs." Richard Such

• Board Election
Editor, THE DAILY:
We urge a positive vote
today—Tuesday, April 15 for Mrs.
Elsie Begle in the critically
important Palo Alto Unified
School District election. Mrs.
Begle is an independent-minded,
thoughtful candidate who
advocates continued innovation in
our schools —a strong
multicultural program, an updated
social studies curriculum, a new
look at what the junior highs
should accomplish, and continued
progress in the basic skills of
language and math.
By her involvement in PTAs
and. School Buidling Committees
over the past five years, Mrs. Begle
has demonstrated the interest and
hard work so necessary for the
School Board. Her husband is
Stanfordsprofessor Edward Begle,
who helped develop the new
math. Mrs. Begle represents Palo
Alto's chance to commit itself to
developing an education relevant
and challenging to today's
generation of students—tomor
row's leaders.
The election is critically
important because her principal
opponent has chosen to ignore the
real educational issues in Palo
Alto. Instead, he has tried to
exploit some residents' fears
about mass bussing, student
activism, sensitivity training, and
drugs—offering general, simplistic
responses (i.e. more rules) to
complex problems. (The
incumbent is also running for
re-election, but she has served on
the Board for 14 years—very
passively during the last several,
and no longer has children in
school, or close communication
with today's youth.
We hope the Stanford
community will vote
overwhelmingly for committment
to education, to relevant
curriculum, to progress. Please
make a special effort today. Vote
for Elsie Begle.

To someone exposed for seven
years, four in ROTC and three on
active duty, some recent
arguments in favor of allowing
academic credit and professorial
stutus have sounded like rumors
from Never-Never-Land. I was a
"regular" (i.e. scholarship)
student in the Navy program at
Harvard, then officer aboard a
carrier in the Mediterranean. I
know I speak for hundreds of my
acquaintance and similar
experience in saying that
1. The quality of courses was
and must remain necessarily quite
low. They were taught by rote,
mainly from manuals used at
every university in the country.
The only challenge they presented
was how to get an A with little
work: this was done by merely
"creating" the multiple-choice
exam along with the
is, arithmetically
culling past exams.
2. Nevertheless, ROTC courses
and weekly drill were a painful
burden to anyone really interested
in his major, and in college. They
were also a waste of time, in no
way preparing one realistically for
military service: everything useful
is learned after ROTC. Turning a
few courses over to the university
is no solution; ROTC must still
teach guns and leadership.
3. As for the "leavening"
effect of college-trained officers, I
felt and now believe this is in
great part a pretence of the
military: what they want is
manpower, "warm bodies."
4. Finally, given the definite
withdrawal of credit form ROTC
by several other major
universities, the Department of
Defense appears ready to do
almost anything to keep ROTC
associated with the university in
any form. If Stanford decided to
keep ROTC within the academic
curriculum, we may find ourselves
to be a bulwark of military
legitimacy in the country.

• ROTC Benefits
Editor, THE DAILY;
On Friday, April 3, in the open
discussion of the Academic
Council on the ROTC (a matter of
interest to the whole Stanford
community), the question was
raised as to whether the ROTC
input into the military really had
a beneficial effect on the
character of the military
establishment of this country.
It is easiest to demonstrate the
ootential of such a close tie
between the civilian and military
sectors of the country by pointing
to the one ROTC graduate who
rose to the position of
Ch ief-of-State—General George
Marshall.
Despite the fact that Marshall
successfully directed the Army
during its largest conflict, World
War 11, he is best known for the
humanitarian aspects of his tenure
as Secretary of State in the
postwar period. His name is
associated with the Marshall Plan,
which was a landmark in a change
from a vindictive to a rebuilding
and reconstructive policy on the
part of the victor toward the
conquered.

Editor, THE DAILY:
We have had protesting
students occupying the Applied
Electronics Laboratory for several
days. Their intent has been to
disrupt the research activity
normally carried out there, and
they have been quite successful.
Many of these students with
whom I have been talking, I find,
are not even aware of the nature
of our program. We have extended
invitations many times over the
past several years to anyone who
is interested to come and discuss
the nature of our program with
us. Only a few, perhaps less than
10, people have accepted this
invitation.
There are means of discussing
issues within the University and
resolving differences of opinion.
They have not been utilized.
I am conpletely opposed to the
tactics employed by the protesting

of the intensity of their concern,
it is inappropriate to the

Editor, THE DAILY:
There has been much
discussion and question
concerning the propriety and
morality of the sit-in currently
being conducted at the Applied

pleased to announce that I have
the answer for this dispute.
Anyone who watched the "War

our CBW research that the
invasion of the Martians was
halted, and the same research
MUST be continued in order to
prevent the recurrence of this

take note of this fact and cease

• Ideal Revolution
Editor, THE DAILY:
I support the revolution. I
support a revolution against the
technological and social
immensity of our society and
against the regulation of my life,
its content and potentials. I
support a revolution against the
patterns of thinking which
support it, the superficial
background of morality and
mores.
I dislike this society with its
pettiness and narrow-mindedness.
I dislike men having control over
tremendous sums of money. I
dislike a government of lethargic
saps who won't even help the
ghetto in the nation's capital and,
instead, bombs Vietnamese
villages. I dislike all the social ills
of this country and of this world.
But right now, what I dislike
most of all is the imbecilic
behavior of a group of so-called
intellectuals who think that by
pitching their tents in the AEL for
the cause of a moral code that was
fed into them like so much ticker
tape into a computer they are
going to change a damned thing!
At least I can understand a
government and a society who
defend their position with
practical arguments and personal
experience. What I don't
understand is students who try to
read out the ticker tape to me and
expect to gain my support.
The revolution I support will
be of professionals in the fields of
science and the humanities who
have faced reality and realized
that the only way to change this
society is to gain the education,
self-control, and stamina to get to
positions of authority.
But yet, unlike the revolution
of the impractical moralists over
in the AEL building, this
revolution of the practical
idealists will be successful!

• Civilian Weapons
Editor, THE DAILY:
There is a movement underfoot
(I believe that is the correct word)
to ban classified (i.e., military)
research at Stanford. I would like
to point out one of the dangers
which would follow from the
success of this cause.
Banning military research at
civilian institutions would not, of
course, spell the end of such
research, merely its transfer to
military or para-military (e.g.,
SRI) laboratories.
The evil of such a transfer
should be obvious. In the Soviet
Union all military research is
conducted in essentially military
laboratories. The result has been
the development of perfectly
malignant weaponry, for example
the "dirty H-bomb." By way of
contrast, military research in the
essentially civilian laboratories of
the United States has produced
such comparatively benign
weapons as the "clean H-bomb."
Now it is true that in Nazi
Germany certain odious military
work (e.g., the development of
nerve gases) was done in civilian
enterprises (I.G. Farben), and that
similar work is, or was until
recently, being done in civilian
enterprises in the United States.
And it may be assumed that, in
some cases, the products of
military research in the Soviet
Union and of civilian research in
the United States are superficially

indistinguishable. But there is a
difference.
That difference is suggested by
"A Report from Stanford Faculty
concerned about Ramification of
the Senate Decision Affecting
ROTC" (the Stanford Daily, April
4, 1969). Just as civilian-educated
military men are less destructive
of humane values than
military-educated military men,
so, too, must civilian-invented
military implements differ from
military-invented implements. The
difference, of course, is all the
more real for being metaphysical.
Thus, if the contemplation of
suchcivilian- c on c e iv e d
iinstrumentalities of warfare as
the pacification techniques being
employed in Vietnam, napalm,
anti-personnel fragmentation
bombs, chemical and biological
agents, and so on through the
inventory, gives you a case of the
nervous nellies, obtain relief in
seconds by thinking upon the
really bad stuff that the military
might have come up with. It does
stagger the imagination.
It follows that if we wish to
continue to have the enormous
benefits of civilian-produced
weapons we should have more,
not less, military research at
Stanford, just as by on-campus
military training we have been
able to maintain a benevolent
military establishment and to
avoid (to quote the
above-mentioned "Report") "the
arbitrary use of military forces in
civilian affairs." Richard Such

• Board Election
Editor, THE DAILY:
We urge a positive vote
today—Tuesday, April 15 for Mrs.
Elsie Begle in the critically
important Palo Alto Unified
School District election. Mrs.
Begle is an independent-minded,
thoughtful candidate who
advocates continued innovation in
our schools —a strong
multicultural program, an updated
social studies curriculum, a new
look at what the junior highs
should accomplish, and continued
progress in the basic skills of
language and math.
By her involvement in PTAs
and. School Buidling Committees
over the past five years, Mrs. Begle
has demonstrated the interest and
hard work so necessary for the
School Board. Her husband is
Stanfordsprofessor Edward Begle,
who helped develop the new
math. Mrs. Begle represents Palo
Alto's chance to commit itself to
developing an education relevant
and challenging to today's
generation of students—tomor
row's leaders.
The election is critically
important because her principal
opponent has chosen to ignore the
real educational issues in Palo
Alto. Instead, he has tried to
exploit some residents' fears
about mass bussing, student
activism, sensitivity training, and
drugs—offering general, simplistic
responses (i.e. more rules) to
complex problems. (The

generation of students—tomor
row's leaders.
The election is critically
important because her principal
opponent has chosen to ignore the
real educational issues in Palo
Alto. Instead, he has tried to
exploit some residents' fears
about mass bussing, student
activism, sensitivity training, and
drugs—offering general, simplistic
responses (i.e. more rules) to
complex problems. (The
incumbent is also running for
re-election, but she has served on
the Board for 14 years—very
passively during the last several,
and no longer has children in
school, or close communication
with today's youth.
We hope the Stanford
community will vote
overwhelmingly for committment
to education, to relevant
curriculum, to progress. Please
make a special effort today. Vote
for Elsie Begle.

To someone exposed for seven
years, four in ROTC and three on
active duty, some recent
arguments in favor of allowing
academic credit and professorial
stutus have sounded like rumors
from Never-Never-Land. I was a
"regular" (i.e. scholarship)
student in the Navy program at
Harvard, then officer aboard a
carrier in the Mediterranean. I
know I speak for hundreds of my
acquaintance and similar
experience in saying that
1. The quality of courses was
and must remain necessarily quite
low. They were taught by rote,
mainly from manuals used at
every university in the country.
The only challenge they presented
was how to get an A with little
work: this was done by merely
"creating" the multiple-choice
exam along with the
is, arithmetically
culling past exams.
2. Nevertheless, ROTC courses
and weekly drill were a painful
burden to anyone really interested
in his major, and in college. They
were also a waste of time, in no
way preparing one realistically for
military service: everything useful
is learned after ROTC. Turning a
few courses over to the university
is no solution; ROTC must still
teach guns and leadership.
3. As for the "leavening"
effect of college-trained officers, I
felt and now believe this is in
great part a pretence of the
military: what they want is
manpower, "warm bodies."
4. Finally, given the definite
withdrawal of credit form ROTC
by several other major
universities, the Department of
Defense appears ready to do
almost anything to keep ROTC
associated with the university in
any form. If Stanford decided to
keep ROTC within the academic
curriculum, we may find ourselves
to be a bulwark of military
legitimacy in the country.

• ROTC Benefits
Editor, THE DAILY;
On Friday, April 3, in the open
discussion of the Academic
Council on the ROTC (a matter of
interest to the whole Stanford
community), the question was
raised as to whether the ROTC
input into the military really had
a beneficial effect on the
character of the military
establishment of this country.
It is easiest to demonstrate the
ootential of such a close tie
between the civilian and military
sectors of the country by pointing
to the one ROTC graduate who
rose to the position of
Ch ief-of-State—General George
Marshall.
Despite the fact that Marshall
successfully directed the Army
during its largest conflict, World
War 11, he is best known for the
humanitarian aspects of his tenure
as Secretary of State in the
postwar period. His name is
associated with the Marshall Plan,
which was a landmark in a change
from a vindictive to a rebuilding
and reconstructive policy on the
part of the victor toward the
conquered.

Editor, THE DAILY:
We have had protesting
students occupying the Applied
Electronics Laboratory for several
days. Their intent has been to
disrupt the research activity
normally carried out there, and
they have been quite successful.
Many of these students with
whom I have been talking, I find,
are not even aware of the nature
of our program. We have extended
invitations many times over the
past several years to anyone who
is interested to come and discuss
the nature of our program with
us. Only a few, perhaps less than
10, people have accepted this
invitation.
There are means of discussing
issues within the University and
resolving differences of opinion.
They have not been utilized.
I am conpletely opposed to the

of the intensity of their concern,
it is inappropriate to the

Editor, THE DAILY:
There has been much
discussion and question
concerning the propriety and
morality of the sit-in currently
being conducted at the Applied

pleased to announce that I have
the answer for this dispute.
Anyone who watched the "War

our CBW research that the
invasion of the Martians was
halted, and the same research
MUST be continued in order to
prevent the recurrence of this

take note of this fact and cease

• Ideal Revolution
Editor, THE DAILY:
I support the revolution. I
support a revolution against the
technological and social
immensity of our society and
against the regulation of my life,
its content and potentials. I
support a revolution against the
patterns of thinking which
support it, the superficial
background of morality and
mores.
I dislike this society with its
pettiness and narrow-mindedness.
I dislike men having control over
tremendous sums of money. I
dislike a government of lethargic
saps who won't even help the
ghetto in the nation's capital and,
instead, bombs Vietnamese
villages. I dislike all the social ills
of this country and of this world.
But right now, what I dislike
most of all is the imbecilic
behavior of a group of so-called
intellectuals who think that by
pitching their tents in the AEL for
the cause of a moral code that was
fed into them like so much ticker
tape into a computer they are
going to change a damned thing!
At least I can understand a
government and a society who
defend their position with
practical arguments and personal
experience. What I don't
understand is students who try to
read out the ticker tape to me and
expect to gain my support.
The revolution I support will
be of professionals in the fields of
science and the humanities who
have faced reality and realized
that the only way to change this
society is to gain the education,
self-control, and stamina to get to
positions of authority.
But yet, unlike the revolution
of the impractical moralists over
in the AEL building, this
revolution of the practical
idealists will be successful!

• Civilian Weapons
Editor, THE DAILY:
There is a movement underfoot
(I believe that is the correct word)
to ban classified (i.e., military)
research at Stanford. I would like
to point out one of the dangers
which would follow from the
success of this cause.
Banning military research at
civilian institutions would not, of
course, spell the end of such
research, merely its transfer to
military or para-military (e.g.,
SRI) laboratories.
The evil of such a transfer
should be obvious. In the Soviet
Union all military research is
conducted in essentially military
laboratories. The result has been
the development of perfectly
malignant weaponry, for example
the "dirty H-bomb." By way of
contrast, military research in the
essentially civilian laboratories of
the United States has produced
such comparatively benign
weapons as the "clean H-bomb."
Now it is true that in Nazi
Germany certain odious military
work (e.g., the development of
nerve gases) was done in civilian
enterprises (I.G. Farben), and that
similar work is, or was until
recently, being done in civilian
enterprises in the United States.
And it may be assumed that, in
some cases, the products of
military research in the Soviet
Union and of civilian research in
the United States are superficially

indistinguishable. But there is a
difference.
That difference is suggested by
"A Report from Stanford Faculty
concerned about Ramification of
the Senate Decision Affecting
ROTC" (the Stanford Daily, April
4, 1969). Just as civilian-educated
military men are less destructive
of humane values than
military-educated military men,
so, too, must civilian-invented
military implements differ from
military-invented implements. The
difference, of course, is all the
more real for being metaphysical.
Thus, if the contemplation of
suchcivilian- c on c e iv e d
iinstrumentalities of warfare as
the pacification techniques being
employed in Vietnam, napalm,
anti-personnel fragmentation
bombs, chemical and biological
agents, and so on through the
inventory, gives you a case of the
nervous nellies, obtain relief in
seconds by thinking upon the
really bad stuff that the military
might have come up with. It does
stagger the imagination.
It follows that if we wish to
continue to have the enormous
benefits of civilian-produced
weapons we should have more,
not less, military research at
Stanford, just as by on-campus
military training we have been
able to maintain a benevolent
military establishment and to
avoid (to quote the
above-mentioned "Report") "the
arbitrary use of military forces in
civilian affairs." Richard Such

language and math.
By her involvement in PTAs
and. School Buidling Committees
over the past five years, Mrs. Begle
has demonstrated the interest and
hard work so necessary for the
School Board. Her husband is
Stanfordsprofessor Edward Begle,
who helped develop the new
math. Mrs. Begle represents Palo
Alto's chance to commit itself to
developing an education relevant
and challenging to today's
generation of students—tomor
row's leaders.
The election is critically
important because her principal
opponent has chosen to ignore the
real educational issues in Palo
Alto. Instead, he has tried to
exploit some residents' fears
about mass bussing, student
activism, sensitivity training, and
drugs—offering general, simplistic
responses (i.e. more rules) to
complex problems. (The
incumbent is also running for
re-election, but she has served on
the Board for 14 years—very
passively during the last several,
and no longer has children in
school, or close communication
with today's youth.
We hope the Stanford
community will vote
overwhelmingly for committment
to education, to relevant
curriculum, to progress. Please
make a special effort today. Vote
for Elsie Begle.

To someone exposed for seven
years, four in ROTC and three on
active duty, some recent
arguments in favor of allowing
academic credit and professorial
stutus have sounded like rumors
from Never-Never-Land. I was a
"regular" (i.e. scholarship)
student in the Navy program at
Harvard, then officer aboard a
carrier in the Mediterranean. I
know I speak for hundreds of my
acquaintance and similar
experience in saying that
1. The quality of courses was
and must remain necessarily quite
low. They were taught by rote,
mainly from manuals used at
every university in the country.
The only challenge they presented
was how to get an A with little
work: this was done by merely
"creating" the multiple-choice
exam along with the
is, arithmetically
culling past exams.
2. Nevertheless, ROTC courses
and weekly drill were a painful
burden to anyone really interested
in his major, and in college. They
were also a waste of time, in no
way preparing one realistically for
military service: everything useful
is learned after ROTC. Turning a
few courses over to the university
is no solution; ROTC must still
teach guns and leadership.
3. As for the "leavening"
effect of college-trained officers, I
felt and now believe this is in
great part a pretence of the
military: what they want is
manpower, "warm bodies."
4. Finally, given the definite
withdrawal of credit form ROTC
by several other major
universities, the Department of
Defense appears ready to do
almost anything to keep ROTC
associated with the university in
any form. If Stanford decided to
keep ROTC within the academic
curriculum, we may find ourselves
to be a bulwark of military
legitimacy in the country.

• ROTC Benefits
Editor, THE DAILY;
On Friday, April 3, in the open
discussion of the Academic
Council on the ROTC (a matter of
interest to the whole Stanford
community), the question was
raised as to whether the ROTC
input into the military really had
a beneficial effect on the
character of the military
establishment of this country.
It is easiest to demonstrate the
ootential of such a close tie
between the civilian and military
sectors of the country by pointing
to the one ROTC graduate who
rose to the position of
Ch ief-of-State—General George
Marshall.
Despite the fact that Marshall
successfully directed the Army
during its largest conflict, World
War 11, he is best known for the
humanitarian aspects of his tenure
as Secretary of State in the
postwar period. His name is
associated with the Marshall Plan,
which was a landmark in a change
from a vindictive to a rebuilding
and reconstructive policy on the
part of the victor toward the
conquered.

Editor, THE DAILY:
We have had protesting
students occupying the Applied

days. Their intent has been to
disrupt the research activity
normally carried out there, and
they have been quite successful.
Many of these students with
whom I have been talking, I find,
are not even aware of the nature
of our program. We have extended
invitations many times over the
past several years to anyone who
is interested to come and discuss
the nature of our program with
us. Only a few, perhaps less than
10, people have accepted this
invitation.
There are means of discussing

They have not been utilized.
I am conpletely opposed to the

it is inappropriate to the

Editor, THE DAILY:
There has been much
discussion and question
concerning the propriety and
morality of the sit-in currently
being conducted at the Applied

pleased to announce that I have
the answer for this dispute.
Anyone who watched the "War

our CBW research that the
invasion of the Martians was
halted, and the same research

• Ideal Revolution
Editor, THE DAILY:
I support the revolution. I
support a revolution against the
technological and social
immensity of our society and
against the regulation of my life,
its content and potentials. I
support a revolution against the
patterns of thinking which
support it, the superficial
background of morality and
mores.
I dislike this society with its
pettiness and narrow-mindedness.
I dislike men having control over
tremendous sums of money. I
dislike a government of lethargic
saps who won't even help the
ghetto in the nation's capital and,
instead, bombs Vietnamese
villages. I dislike all the social ills
of this country and of this world.
But right now, what I dislike
most of all is the imbecilic
behavior of a group of so-called
intellectuals who think that by
pitching their tents in the AEL for
the cause of a moral code that was
fed into them like so much ticker
tape into a computer they are
going to change a damned thing!
At least I can understand a
government and a society who
defend their position with
practical arguments and personal
experience. What I don't
understand is students who try to
read out the ticker tape to me and
expect to gain my support.
The revolution I support will
be of professionals in the fields of
science and the humanities who
have faced reality and realized
that the only way to change this
society is to gain the education,
self-control, and stamina to get to
positions of authority.
But yet, unlike the revolution
of the impractical moralists over
in the AEL building, this
revolution of the practical

• Civilian Weapons
Editor, THE DAILY:
There is a movement underfoot
(I believe that is the correct word)
to ban classified (i.e., military)
research at Stanford. I would like
to point out one of the dangers
which would follow from the
success of this cause.
Banning military research at
civilian institutions would not, of
course, spell the end of such
research, merely its transfer to
military or para-military (e.g.,
SRI) laboratories.
The evil of such a transfer
should be obvious. In the Soviet
Union all military research is
conducted in essentially military
laboratories. The result has been
the development of perfectly
malignant weaponry, for example
the "dirty H-bomb." By way of
contrast, military research in the
essentially civilian laboratories of
the United States has produced
such comparatively benign
weapons as the "clean H-bomb."
Now it is true that in Nazi
Germany certain odious military
work (e.g., the development of
nerve gases) was done in civilian
enterprises (I.G. Farben), and that
similar work is, or was until
recently, being done in civilian
enterprises in the United States.
And it may be assumed that, in
some cases, the products of
military research in the Soviet
Union and of civilian research in
the United States are superficially

indistinguishable. But there is a
difference.
That difference is suggested by
"A Report from Stanford Faculty
concerned about Ramification of
the Senate Decision Affecting
ROTC" (the Stanford Daily, April
4, 1969). Just as civilian-educated
military men are less destructive
of humane values than
military-educated military men,
so, too, must civilian-invented
military implements differ from
military-invented implements. The
difference, of course, is all the
more real for being metaphysical.
Thus, if the contemplation of
suchcivilian- c on c e iv e d
iinstrumentalities of warfare as
the pacification techniques being
employed in Vietnam, napalm,
anti-personnel fragmentation
bombs, chemical and biological
agents, and so on through the
inventory, gives you a case of the
nervous nellies, obtain relief in
seconds by thinking upon the
really bad stuff that the military
might have come up with. It does
stagger the imagination.
It follows that if we wish to
continue to have the enormous
benefits of civilian-produced
weapons we should have more,
not less, military research at
Stanford, just as by on-campus
military training we have been
able to maintain a benevolent
military establishment and to
avoid (to quote the
above-mentioned "Report") "the
arbitrary use of military forces in

We urge a positive vote
today—Tuesday, April 15 for Mrs.
Elsie Begle in the critically
important Palo Alto Unified
School District election. Mrs.
Begle is an independent-minded,
thoughtful candidate who
advocates continued innovation in
our schools —a strong
multicultural program, an updated
social studies curriculum, a new
look at what the junior highs
should accomplish, and continued
progress in the basic skills of
language and math.
By her involvement in PTAs
and. School Buidling Committees
over the past five years, Mrs. Begle
has demonstrated the interest and
hard work so necessary for the
School Board. Her husband is
Stanfordsprofessor Edward Begle,
who helped develop the new
math. Mrs. Begle represents Palo
Alto's chance to commit itself to
developing an education relevant
and challenging to today's
generation of students—tomor
row's leaders.
The election is critically
important because her principal
opponent has chosen to ignore the
real educational issues in Palo
Alto. Instead, he has tried to
exploit some residents' fears
about mass bussing, student
activism, sensitivity training, and
drugs—offering general, simplistic
responses (i.e. more rules) to
complex problems. (The
incumbent is also running for
re-election, but she has served on
the Board for 14 years—very
passively during the last several,
and no longer has children in
school, or close communication
with today's youth.
We hope the Stanford
community will vote
overwhelmingly for committment
to education, to relevant
curriculum, to progress. Please
make a special effort today. Vote
for Elsie Begle.

Editor, THE DAILY:
To someone exposed for seven
years, four in ROTC and three on
active duty, some recent
arguments in favor of allowing
academic credit and professorial
stutus have sounded like rumors
from Never-Never-Land. I was a
"regular" (i.e. scholarship)
student in the Navy program at
Harvard, then officer aboard a
carrier in the Mediterranean. I
know I speak for hundreds of my
acquaintance and similar
experience in saying that
1. The quality of courses was
and must remain necessarily quite
low. They were taught by rote,
mainly from manuals used at
every university in the country.
The only challenge they presented
was how to get an A with little
work: this was done by merely
"creating" the multiple-choice
exam along with the
is, arithmetically
culling past exams.
2. Nevertheless, ROTC courses
and weekly drill were a painful
burden to anyone really interested
in his major, and in college. They
were also a waste of time, in no
way preparing one realistically for
military service: everything useful
is learned after ROTC. Turning a
few courses over to the university
is no solution; ROTC must still
teach guns and leadership.
3. As for the "leavening"
effect of college-trained officers, I
felt and now believe this is in
great part a pretence of the
military: what they want is
manpower, "warm bodies."
4. Finally, given the definite
withdrawal of credit form ROTC
by several other major
universities, the Department of
Defense appears ready to do
almost anything to keep ROTC
associated with the university in
any form. If Stanford decided to
keep ROTC within the academic
curriculum, we may find ourselves
to be a bulwark of military
legitimacy in the country.

• ROTC Benefits
Editor, THE DAILY;
On Friday, April 3, in the open
discussion of the Academic
Council on the ROTC (a matter of
interest to the whole Stanford
community), the question was
raised as to whether the ROTC
input into the military really had
a beneficial effect on the
character of the military
establishment of this country.
It is easiest to demonstrate the
ootential of such a close tie
between the civilian and military
sectors of the country by pointing
to the one ROTC graduate who
rose to the position of
Ch ief-of-State—General George
Marshall.
Despite the fact that Marshall
successfully directed the Army
during its largest conflict, World
War 11, he is best known for the
humanitarian aspects of his tenure
as Secretary of State in the
postwar period. His name is
associated with the Marshall Plan,
which was a landmark in a change
from a vindictive to a rebuilding
and reconstructive policy on the
part of the victor toward the
conquered.

•Director Hits Tactics
Editor, THE DAILY:
We have had protesting
students occupying the Applied
Electronics Laboratory for several
days. Their intent has been to
disrupt the research activity
normally carried out there, and
they have been quite successful.
Many of these students with
whom I have been talking, I find,
are not even aware of the nature
of our program. We have extended
invitations many times over the
past several years to anyone who
is interested to come and discuss
the nature of our program with
us. Only a few, perhaps less than
10, people have accepted this
invitation.
There are means of discussing
issues within the University and
resolving differences of opinion.
They have not been utilized.
I am conpletely opposed to the
tactics employed by the protesting
students and feel that, regardless
of the intensity of their concern,
it is inappropriate to the
University.

• To Stop Martians
Editor, THE DAILY:
There has been much
discussion and question
concerning the propriety and
morality of the sit-in currently
being conducted at the Applied
Electronics Laboratory, and I am
pleased to announce that I have
the answer for this dispute.
Anyone who watched the "War
of the Worlds" two nights ago on
channel 7 knows that it is due to
our CBW research that the
invasion of the Martians was
halted, and the same research
MUST be continued in order to
prevent the recurrence of this
tragic occurrance. I hope that
those conducting the sit-in will
take note of this fact and cease
their irrational activities.

• Ideal Revolution
Editor, THE DAILY:
I support the revolution. I
support a revolution against the
technological and social
immensity of our society and
against the regulation of my life,
its content and potentials. I
support a revolution against the
patterns of thinking which
support it, the superficial
background of morality and
mores.
I dislike this society with its
pettiness and narrow-mindedness.
I dislike men having control over
tremendous sums of money. I
dislike a government of lethargic
saps who won't even help the
ghetto in the nation's capital and,
instead, bombs Vietnamese
villages. I dislike all the social ills
of this country and of this world.
But right now, what I dislike
most of all is the imbecilic
behavior of a group of so-called
intellectuals who think that by
pitching their tents in the AEL for
the cause of a moral code that was
fed into them like so much ticker
tape into a computer they are
going to change a damned thing!
At least I can understand a
government and a society who
defend their position with
practical arguments and personal
experience. What I don't
understand is students who try to
read out the ticker tape to me and
expect to gain my support.
The revolution I support will
be of professionals in the fields of
science and the humanities who
have faced reality and realized
that the only way to change this
society is to gain the education,
self-control, and stamina to get to
positions of authority.
But yet, unlike the revolution
of the impractical moralists over
in the AEL building, this
revolution of the practical
idealists will be successful!

• Civilian Weapons
Editor, THE DAILY:
There is a movement underfoot
(I believe that is the correct word)
to ban classified (i.e., military)
research at Stanford. I would like
to point out one of the dangers
which would follow from the
success of this cause.
Banning military research at
civilian institutions would not, of
course, spell the end of such
research, merely its transfer to
military or para-military (e.g.,
SRI) laboratories.
The evil of such a transfer
should be obvious. In the Soviet
Union all military research is
conducted in essentially military
laboratories. The result has been
the development of perfectly
malignant weaponry, for example
the "dirty H-bomb." By way of
contrast, military research in the
essentially civilian laboratories of
the United States has produced
such comparatively benign
weapons as the "clean H-bomb."
Now it is true that in Nazi
Germany certain odious military
work (e.g., the development of
nerve gases) was done in civilian
enterprises (I.G. Farben), and that
similar work is, or was until
recently, being done in civilian
enterprises in the United States.
And it may be assumed that, in
some cases, the products of
military research in the Soviet
Union and of civilian research in
the United States are superficially

indistinguishable. But there is a
difference.
That difference is suggested by
"A Report from Stanford Faculty
concerned about Ramification of
the Senate Decision Affecting
ROTC" (the Stanford Daily, April
4, 1969). Just as civilian-educated
military men are less destructive
of humane values than
military-educated military men,
so, too, must civilian-invented
military implements differ from
military-invented implements. The
difference, of course, is all the
more real for being metaphysical.
Thus, if the contemplation of
suchcivilian- c on c e iv e d
iinstrumentalities of warfare as
the pacification techniques being
employed in Vietnam, napalm,
anti-personnel fragmentation
bombs, chemical and biological
agents, and so on through the
inventory, gives you a case of the
nervous nellies, obtain relief in
seconds by thinking upon the
really bad stuff that the military
might have come up with. It does
stagger the imagination.
It follows that if we wish to
continue to have the enormous
benefits of civilian-produced
weapons we should have more,
not less, military research at
Stanford, just as by on-campus
military training we have been
able to maintain a benevolent
military establishment and to
avoid (to quote the
above-mentioned "Report") "the
arbitrary use of military forces in
civilian affairs." Richard Such
