## Totalitarian Force At AEL 
### William Boyd 
The spectre of real tyranny is
no longer a myth or a thing out of
the past. It is upon us now. A
small group of students and
non-students in the name of
morality, the American
Revolution, Ho Chi Minh, and the
Third World have seized the
Applied Electronics Laboratory
here at Stanford.
When is the Stanford
community finally going to
awake? A truly totalitarian force
has emerged (witness the fact that
only those members of the
community who agree with the
sitter-inners can vote in their
democratic decisions) and most
everyone has retreated back into
his ivory tower; to do what, I ask
you?
You no longer can hide! The
basic issue at stake is not whether
counter insurgency or
what-have-you is being done; it is
whether or not you as members of
this community are going to
abrogate your most fundamental
right —that of academic inquiry.
The freedom of both the
professor and student is in
jeopardy. Today it is AEL, who
knows what it will bbe tomorrow.
I watch you sit back and let those
students and employees from
AEL try to defend themselves
with little help from the
community.
Yes, I know it's not your
laboratory. But it may be
tomorrow. What are you going to
do then? Will you look to those
students, faculty and employees
at AEL and ask them for help?
Now is the time for all of you as
members of the Stanford
community to begin to act as a
community by standing up for the
legitimate rights of every one, not
just those of a privileged few.
President Pitzer has said that
the sit-in at AEL is in violation of
the University Policy on Campus
Disruptions. I wonder if President
Pitzer thinks that merely stating
University Policy relieves him of
the responsibility to enforce it.
A rule that is not enforced is
meaningless. If President Pitzer
will not enforce the University
regulations, those intent on
disruption here at Stanford realize
that they will not be stopped by

the Administration.
The overwhelming majority of
Stanford students are opposed to
the disruption at AEL. They look
to the University to stop it. If
President Pitzer will not do his

job, then we need a President who
will.
The question of whether the
sit-in is violent or non-violent is
irrelevant. The most fundamental
rights of some members of the

Stanford community are being
violated. This is the real question!

Yes, I know it's not your
laboratory. But it may be
tomorrow. What are you going to
do then? Will you look to those
students, faculty and employees
at AEL and ask them for help?
Now is the time for all of you as
members of the Stanford
community to begin to act as a
community by standing up for the
legitimate rights of every one, not
just those of a privileged few.
President Pitzer has said that
the sit-in at AEL is in violation of
the University Policy on Campus
Disruptions. I wonder if President
Pitzer thinks that merely stating
University Policy relieves him of
the responsibility to enforce it.
A rule that is not enforced is
meaningless. If President Pitzer
will not enforce the University
regulations, those intent on
disruption here at Stanford realize
that they will not be stopped by

the Administration.
The overwhelming majority of
Stanford students are opposed to
the disruption at AEL. They look
to the University to stop it. If
President Pitzer will not do his

job, then we need a President who
will.
The question of whether the
sit-in is violent or non-violent is
irrelevant. The most fundamental
rights of some members of the

Stanford community are being
violated. This is the real question!

history and President of the

The spectre of real tyranny is
no longer a myth or a thing out of
the past. It is upon us now. A
small group of students and
non-students in the name of
morality, the American
Revolution, Ho Chi Minh, and the
Third World have seized the
Applied Electronics Laboratory
here at Stanford.
When is the Stanford
community finally going to
awake? A truly totalitarian force
has emerged (witness the fact that
only those members of the
community who agree with the
sitter-inners can vote in their
democratic decisions) and most
everyone has retreated back into
his ivory tower; to do what, I ask
you?
You no longer can hide! The
basic issue at stake is not whether
counter insurgency or
what-have-you is being done; it is
whether or not you as members of
this community are going to
abrogate your most fundamental
right —that of academic inquiry.
The freedom of both the
professor and student is in
jeopardy. Today it is AEL, who
knows what it will bbe tomorrow.
I watch you sit back and let those
students and employees from
AEL try to defend themselves
with little help from the
community.
Yes, I know it's not your

do then? Will you look to those
