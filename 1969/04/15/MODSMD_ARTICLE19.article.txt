What is it?
Mass communications!
We, of Fourth Stream Expression,
feel sorry for all of you who are
planning to come either Tuesday or
Saturday night in Dink. Why? We didn't
mean for one hour with you to be so
very honest and 'for real'. It is hot and
It hurts . . .
But what is It?
We don't know. You are individuals,
dig.
God, Orgasm, Loneliness, and
Death-elements of thought that make
every day transparent like glass.

God is the Sun.

Autumn Mary, . . . Beauchamp
Circular Woman, of the condemned
Church
To have sold a hand of green to all the
Swimming customers rarely by the way
of her
Colored flower stand . . .

Black man. Black heat. Black pain,
but you feel so much like goodness
all those heartless black babies rushing
in a
circle only to collide with one another
for their
just wait . . .
another day.

There were some small children with
great big eyes looking out a dirty sth
story window at mo and Kilroy. I waved
my hands and threw some snow smiling
and pointing to them and the door
down at the bottom of the stairs. So
they just smiled at the entertainment
and waved back.
An old man with a nasty assed
undershirt looked down at me from the
7th floor, turned and shut the
blind . . .//I gave up trying with a crazy
man and hid behind five trash cans with
my knife out and my leather off. From
where I was laying on the ground I
could see Kilroy's feet and hands and
hear most of the sounds echoing off the
buildings. I was thinking about dying
but I was also trying to figure out what
the fuck Kilroy was thinking about.
Him and 500 mothers. The man had
to be insane.

50 minutes. With us and 'Smoke' . . .
You'll laugh inside and feel pain, too,
in our words to you, in our slide
illustrations, in 'Smoke's professed beats
in you, and then just you. Come.
Happen in the real, real world of ours.
