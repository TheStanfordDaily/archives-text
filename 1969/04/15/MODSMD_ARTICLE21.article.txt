# Committee Explains Research
## 
### DOUGLAS ANDERSON 
A two and a half hour open hearing
of the Research Policy Committee met
yesterday to come to grips with
guidelines for research policy.
Attended by an estimated 80 people
within the tightly-packed conference
room, and an estimated 180 more in the
courtyard outside, the meeting was
called at the emergency request of
Leonard Schiff, chairman of the
Academic Senate.
The hearing dealt with three primary
issues. First, what kind of work in
electronic warfare is being done at
Stanford and what kind and to what
extent has electronic warfare work been
done here in the past?
Second, what were the circumstances
surrounding the name change of an
applied research contract in electronic

warfare?
Third, should research proposals be
decided .on "moral grounds" as well as
the guidelines for acceptance now used?
Professor William Baxter of the law
school, chairman of the research
committee, opened the meeting by
citing briefly the requisites now used in
accepting a research contract. He said,
"Almost three years ago, on June 7,
1966, the Academic Council passed a
resolution adopting certain criteria to be
used in accepting a research contract.
"Since that time we have operated
under a policy that if a sponsor is not
willing to be identified with the project,
it will not be accepted. Stanford has no
secret sponsors." He further said that
the committee was concerned with
accepting, those contracts which had
sufficiently broad enough application to
render them useful to a variety of
purposes. "Where research projects are
seen to have a military connection only,
those contracts are found unacceptable.
Sponsor's Morals
"We have found it essential to take
into account the purpose of the research
and the sponsor's interest in it," Baxter
stated. "We judge on the basis of the
purpose of the research, not the
sponsor's interest in it. We do not make
decisions on the basis of the sponsor's
moral or political values."
Speaking from the audience, Fred
Cohen said, "There is a war going on
now. By accepting Defense Department
contracts you are making a political
decision."
Cohen asked, "Will you accept a
research contract from the National
Liberation Front? Mr. Hewlett (a
Stanford trustee) has said he is opposed
to that."
In response, Mr. Baxter replied, "As
far as I'm concerned, yes. I disagree
with Mr. Hewlett on that. As far as I'm
concerned the identity of the sponsor is
utterly irrelevant."
Committee's position
Michael Sweeney, a student member
of the Committee, objected stating that
a contract from the Viet Cong or NLF
would "clearly not be accepted by the
University." He requested that the
committee members be polled as to
their individual feelings about a moral
criterion for research.

A member of the audience then
questioned Baxter about the descriptive
title given to a past research project.
The title originally read, "Applied
research in electronic war techniques."
Subsequently, it was charged, the title
was changed by Baxter to read,
"Applied research in electromagnetics."
A number of faculty
objected to renaming, stating it was
"managing the facts," "a mistake," "a
breach of confidence," and a "red
herring" among other things.
Noyes Objects
Professor H. Pierre Noyes, a member

of the research committee and the
subcommittee on classified research,
questioned why "the issue of renaming
the project had not come to the
attention of the subcommittee."
Baxter answered that the report was
renamed after he (Baxter) had confered
with the sponsor, to give it a "more
accurate description of the type of
research that was carried on," since
research had civilian as well as military
application."
He admitted that perhaps he had
"slipped" in not passing that
information on to the subcommittee.

Cohen said, "There is a war going on
now. By accepting Defense Department
contracts you are making a political
decision."
Cohen asked, "Will you accept a
research contract from the National
Liberation Front? Mr. Hewlett (a
Stanford trustee) has said he is opposed
to that."
In response, Mr. Baxter replied, "As
far as I'm concerned, yes. I disagree
with Mr. Hewlett on that. As far as I'm
concerned the identity of the sponsor is
utterly irrelevant."
Committee's position
Michael Sweeney, a student member
of the Committee, objected stating that
a contract from the Viet Cong or NLF
would "clearly not be accepted by the
University." He requested that the
committee members be polled as to
their individual feelings about a moral
criterion for research.

A member of the audience then
questioned Baxter about the descriptive
title given to a past research project.
The title originally read, "Applied
research in electronic war techniques."
Subsequently, it was charged, the title
was changed by Baxter to read,
"Applied research in electromagnetics."
A number of faculty
objected to renaming, stating it was
"managing the facts," "a mistake," "a
breach of confidence," and a "red
herring" among other things.
Noyes Objects
Professor H. Pierre Noyes, a member

of the research committee and the
subcommittee on classified research,
questioned why "the issue of renaming
the project had not come to the
attention of the subcommittee."
Baxter answered that the report was
renamed after he (Baxter) had confered
with the sponsor, to give it a "more
accurate description of the type of
research that was carried on," since
research had civilian as well as military
application."
He admitted that perhaps he had
"slipped" in not passing that
information on to the subcommittee.
A two and a half hour open hearing
of the Research Policy Committee met
yesterday to come to grips with
guidelines for research policy.
Attended by an estimated 80 people
within the tightly-packed conference
room, and an estimated 180 more in the
courtyard outside, the meeting was
called at the emergency request of
Leonard Schiff, chairman of the
Academic Senate.
The hearing dealt with three primary
issues. First, what kind of work in
electronic warfare is being done at
Stanford and what kind and to what
extent has electronic warfare work been
done here in the past?
Second, what were the circumstances
surrounding the name change of an
applied research contract in electronic

warfare?
Third, should research proposals be
decided .on "moral grounds" as well as
the guidelines for acceptance now used?
Professor William Baxter of the law
school, chairman of the research
committee, opened the meeting by
citing briefly the requisites now used in
accepting a research contract. He said,
"Almost three years ago, on June 7,
1966, the Academic Council passed a
resolution adopting certain criteria to be
used in accepting a research contract.
"Since that time we have operated
under a policy that if a sponsor is not
willing to be identified with the project,
it will not be accepted. Stanford has no
secret sponsors." He further said that
the committee was concerned with
accepting, those contracts which had
sufficiently broad enough application to
render them useful to a variety of
purposes. "Where research projects are
seen to have a military connection only,
those contracts are found unacceptable.
Sponsor's Morals
"We have found it essential to take
into account the purpose of the research
and the sponsor's interest in it," Baxter
stated. "We judge on the basis of the
purpose of the research, not the
sponsor's interest in it. We do not make
decisions on the basis of the sponsor's
moral or political values."
Speaking from the audience, Fred
Cohen said, "There is a war going on
