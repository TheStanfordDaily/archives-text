It was incorrectly stated in
yesterday's Daily that Pat Shea,
candidate for ASSU president, opposes
the current sit-in at AEL.
Shea stated yesterday afternoon,
"We (candidates for the Council of
Presidents) participated in the April 9
SRI-Coalition meeting and voted for the
tactic of a limited sit-in. We have since
participated in the sit-in, feeling it most
important that the real issues of concern
not be lost in the question of this
particular tactic. The sit-in is providing
the opportunity for people, including
ourselves, to grapple with the many
complex problems facing the University
community today."
Shea has signed the statement of
complicity with the sit-in.
The statement in yesterday's Daily
was apparently submitted by a Shea
supporter and not by Shea himself. The
Daily regrets the misunderstanding.
