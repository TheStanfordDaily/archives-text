# Student Candidates For SCLC
## 
### 
BILL BOYD
Because there are many
qualified candidates running for
this office, I choose to withdraw.
YALE BRAUNSTEIN
Yale, Braunstein, a graduate
student in economics, is currently
Speaker of LASSU and an
ex-officio member of SCLC. He
believes that the need for judicial
reform at Stanford did not end
with the adoption of the Judicial
Charter, and he hopes that you
will vote for him so that he may
continue to improve the judicial
system.
SCLC is now considering a rule
on campus disruptions, the entire
role of overseas campus rules and
judicial councils, and the need for
school judicial councils. Yale is
the one candidate who can
provide an intelligent and
PRACTICAL outlook for the
SCLC.
ROMAN BUHLER
SCLC is very relevant to the
University community this week.
It is for violating SCLC
regulations on campus disruption
that people at the Applied
Electronics Laboratory may be
prosecuted.
Although there should be a
clear distinction in University
regulations between violent and
nonviolent disruption, I do not
believe that the elimination of
sanctions against nonviolent
disruptions would serve a useful
purpose. The very significance of
nonviolent protest is the
committment required by each
participant. His or her willingness
to "Lay it on the line" speaks
eloquantly for that person's own
belief in the cause.
The University also has an
obligation to its own community
to maintain its services and
facilities in operation. This
operation would be extremely
difficult were disruptions to
occur sporadically and without
serious motives.
The real threat to a functioning
university, however, comes from

violent disruption involving the
distructing of property or
personal injury. Regardless of the
goals or reasons for such action, I
believe the offenders should be
ssuspended at the very least and
probably expelled.
If my voice on SCLC would
represent yours. I respectfully ask
for your support.
MICHAEL HUFFINGTON
We are in an environemnt
where norms are continuously
changing. The Stanford student
who enters his freshman year and
exits his senior year with the same
values and ideals is the exception
rather than the rule. The student
body is a conglomeration of
individuals each with his own
goals and concepts of life.
Interactions occur everyday on
campus and in order to
understand these interactions we
must be open-minded. What I am
leading up to is this. There is a
current of change winding its way
through our society. Some of the
change is for the better, some is
not. If we want to direct this
current of change instead of being
swept along blindly by it, then we
had better dive in and try to
understand the actions and views
of others. If elected to the
S.C.L.C. I will try to be
open-minded enough to back such
rides that appear to be just,
advocate the abolition of those
that are unjust and propose new
ones where there is a vacuum.
Change is here to stay; but it must
be done through the system and
not outside of it.
TONY MARAN
What is SCLC—it's a 10
member board equally divided
among faculty and students
ordained to establish rules of
conduct for all members of the
Stanford Community. The
Student Body President and
Vice-President are ex-officio
members with vote. You'll be
electing three of us, and three as
alternates. You should know tha

you cannot recall any elected
member of this Council. Only the
alternates can fill in vacated
positions.
If elected I would take to the
Council these precepts:
1. The rights of an accused
individual must be preserved.
2. The rules for governing the
campus community must be
simple, precise and
unquestionably clear.
3. I oppose violence as a
means of affecting change.
4. Any suggested rule must
have a fair and impartial hearing.
Lastly, I feel that there must be
a better system for appealing a
grade given by an instructor than
the present ones. After all if the
instructor is the only one judging
your appeal, you are then putting
him in the position of questioning
his own judgment. While hopeful
of avoiding the Pandora's Box
Phenomena, I feel that some
system should be set up to permit
a student to appeal above the
instructor; to permit that rare, if
not so rare case of injustice to
seek a better judgment.
NEIL REAY
What constitutes proper
conduct for a university student is
a very touchy issue. The four
'groups most interested in
regulations for conduct are the
administration, the alumni, the
surrounding community, and the
students themselves. At the
present time, the Student
Conduct Legislative Council sets
these regulations, giving students
the most opportunity to show
these other groups we can govern
ourselves. If we do not handle this
charge responsibly, we will lose it
to one of the other interest
groups. I was not an
undergraduate at Stanford, and I
feel that this gives me greater
objectivity, as I am not mentally
committed to any particular
group or issue. I will try to be
most responsive to the standards
of the students themselves, as
expressed in referendums and
actions.

ROMAN BUHLER
SCLC is very relevant to the
University community this week.
It is for violating SCLC
regulations on campus disruption
that people at the Applied
Electronics Laboratory may be
prosecuted.
Although there should be a
clear distinction in University
regulations between violent and
nonviolent disruption, I do not
believe that the elimination of
sanctions against nonviolent
disruptions would serve a useful
purpose. The very significance of
nonviolent protest is the
committment required by each
participant. His or her willingness
to "Lay it on the line" speaks
eloquantly for that person's own
belief in the cause.
The University also has an
obligation to its own community
to maintain its services and
facilities in operation. This
operation would be extremely
difficult were disruptions to
occur sporadically and without
serious motives.
The real threat to a functioning
university, however, comes from

violent disruption involving the
distructing of property or
personal injury. Regardless of the
goals or reasons for such action, I
believe the offenders should be
ssuspended at the very least and
probably expelled.
If my voice on SCLC would
represent yours. I respectfully ask
for your support.
MICHAEL HUFFINGTON
We are in an environemnt
where norms are continuously
changing. The Stanford student
who enters his freshman year and
exits his senior year with the same
values and ideals is the exception
rather than the rule. The student
body is a conglomeration of
individuals each with his own
goals and concepts of life.
Interactions occur everyday on
campus and in order to
understand these interactions we
must be open-minded. What I am
leading up to is this. There is a
current of change winding its way
through our society. Some of the
change is for the better, some is
not. If we want to direct this
current of change instead of being
swept along blindly by it, then we
had better dive in and try to
understand the actions and views
of others. If elected to the
S.C.L.C. I will try to be
open-minded enough to back such
rides that appear to be just,
advocate the abolition of those
that are unjust and propose new
ones where there is a vacuum.
Change is here to stay; but it must
be done through the system and
not outside of it.
TONY MARAN
What is SCLC—it's a 10
member board equally divided
among faculty and students
ordained to establish rules of
conduct for all members of the
Stanford Community. The
Student Body President and
Vice-President are ex-officio
members with vote. You'll be
electing three of us, and three as
alternates. You should know tha

you cannot recall any elected
member of this Council. Only the
alternates can fill in vacated
positions.
If elected I would take to the
Council these precepts:
1. The rights of an accused
individual must be preserved.
2. The rules for governing the
campus community must be
simple, precise and
unquestionably clear.
3. I oppose violence as a
means of affecting change.
4. Any suggested rule must
have a fair and impartial hearing.
Lastly, I feel that there must be
a better system for appealing a
grade given by an instructor than
the present ones. After all if the
instructor is the only one judging
your appeal, you are then putting
him in the position of questioning
his own judgment. While hopeful
of avoiding the Pandora's Box
Phenomena, I feel that some
system should be set up to permit
a student to appeal above the
instructor; to permit that rare, if
not so rare case of injustice to
seek a better judgment.
NEIL REAY
What constitutes proper
conduct for a university student is
a very touchy issue. The four
'groups most interested in
regulations for conduct are the
administration, the alumni, the
surrounding community, and the
students themselves. At the
present time, the Student
Conduct Legislative Council sets
these regulations, giving students
the most opportunity to show
these other groups we can govern
ourselves. If we do not handle this
charge responsibly, we will lose it
to one of the other interest
groups. I was not an
undergraduate at Stanford, and I
feel that this gives me greater
objectivity, as I am not mentally
committed to any particular
group or issue. I will try to be
most responsive to the standards
of the students themselves, as
expressed in referendums and
actions.

nonviolent protest is the
committment required by each
participant. His or her willingness
to "Lay it on the line" speaks
eloquantly for that person's own
belief in the cause.
The University also has an
obligation to its own community
to maintain its services and
facilities in operation. This
operation would be extremely
difficult were disruptions to
occur sporadically and without
serious motives.
The real threat to a functioning
university, however, comes from

violent disruption involving the
distructing of property or
personal injury. Regardless of the
goals or reasons for such action, I
believe the offenders should be
ssuspended at the very least and
probably expelled.
If my voice on SCLC would
represent yours. I respectfully ask
for your support.
MICHAEL HUFFINGTON
We are in an environemnt
where norms are continuously
changing. The Stanford student
who enters his freshman year and
exits his senior year with the same
values and ideals is the exception
rather than the rule. The student
body is a conglomeration of
individuals each with his own
goals and concepts of life.
Interactions occur everyday on
campus and in order to
understand these interactions we
must be open-minded. What I am
leading up to is this. There is a
current of change winding its way
through our society. Some of the
change is for the better, some is
not. If we want to direct this
current of change instead of being
swept along blindly by it, then we
had better dive in and try to
understand the actions and views
of others. If elected to the
S.C.L.C. I will try to be
open-minded enough to back such
rides that appear to be just,
advocate the abolition of those
that are unjust and propose new
ones where there is a vacuum.
Change is here to stay; but it must
be done through the system and
not outside of it.
TONY MARAN
What is SCLC—it's a 10
member board equally divided
among faculty and students
ordained to establish rules of
conduct for all members of the
Stanford Community. The
Student Body President and
Vice-President are ex-officio
members with vote. You'll be
electing three of us, and three as
alternates. You should know tha

you cannot recall any elected
member of this Council. Only the
alternates can fill in vacated
positions.
If elected I would take to the
Council these precepts:
1. The rights of an accused
individual must be preserved.
2. The rules for governing the
campus community must be
simple, precise and
unquestionably clear.
3. I oppose violence as a
means of affecting change.
4. Any suggested rule must
have a fair and impartial hearing.
Lastly, I feel that there must be
a better system for appealing a
grade given by an instructor than
the present ones. After all if the
instructor is the only one judging
your appeal, you are then putting
him in the position of questioning
his own judgment. While hopeful
of avoiding the Pandora's Box
Phenomena, I feel that some
system should be set up to permit
a student to appeal above the
instructor; to permit that rare, if
not so rare case of injustice to
seek a better judgment.
NEIL REAY
What constitutes proper
conduct for a university student is
a very touchy issue. The four
'groups most interested in
regulations for conduct are the
administration, the alumni, the
surrounding community, and the
students themselves. At the
present time, the Student
Conduct Legislative Council sets
these regulations, giving students
the most opportunity to show
these other groups we can govern
ourselves. If we do not handle this
charge responsibly, we will lose it
to one of the other interest
groups. I was not an
undergraduate at Stanford, and I
feel that this gives me greater
objectivity, as I am not mentally
committed to any particular
group or issue. I will try to be
most responsive to the standards
of the students themselves, as
expressed in referendums and
actions.

Because there are many
qualified candidates running for
this office, I choose to withdraw.
YALE BRAUNSTEIN
Yale, Braunstein, a graduate
student in economics, is currently
Speaker of LASSU and an
ex-officio member of SCLC. He
believes that the need for judicial
reform at Stanford did not end
with the adoption of the Judicial
Charter, and he hopes that you
will vote for him so that he may
continue to improve the judicial
system.
SCLC is now considering a rule
on campus disruptions, the entire
role of overseas campus rules and
judicial councils, and the need for
school judicial councils. Yale is
the one candidate who can
provide an intelligent and
PRACTICAL outlook for the
SCLC.
ROMAN BUHLER
SCLC is very relevant to the
University community this week.
It is for violating SCLC
regulations on campus disruption
that people at the Applied
Electronics Laboratory may be
prosecuted.
Although there should be a
clear distinction in University
regulations between violent and
nonviolent disruption, I do not
believe that the elimination of
sanctions against nonviolent
disruptions would serve a useful
purpose. The very significance of
nonviolent protest is the
committment required by each
participant. His or her willingness
to "Lay it on the line" speaks
eloquantly for that person's own
belief in the cause.
