# School Board Vote
## 
### 
Palo Alto Voters will go to the
polls Tuesday for an election
which many consider to be a vote
of confidence in the District's
multicultural program.
The program was initiated after
the death of Martin Luther King
last spring, a black coordinator
was hired, and a Citizens'
Advisory Committee was
established to help the
administration develop such a
program. Opposition developed,
much of it directed toward Sidney
Walton, the program's
coordinator, leading to his
resignation in February. The three
candidates have discussed the
program in the course of the

campaign. Dr. Royce Cole has
been highly critical of the school
board's handling of the program;
Mrs. Begle has expressed
reservations about it and its
former coordinator. The
incumbent, Mrs. Hopper, who,
together with the other members
of the School Coard, supported
the Superintendent's attempts to
work out a program and stood by
the coordinator during the
stormiest school board sessions
Palo Alto has ever known, has said
that she recognizes the difficulties
of getting such a program started
but stands by her original
committment to work toward its
development.
