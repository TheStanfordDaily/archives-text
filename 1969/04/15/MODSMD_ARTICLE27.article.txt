Campus violence is wrong.
Violence hurts people and/or
damages property. In almost all
cases, the perpetration of violence
is criminal. Furthermore, the
resort to violent tactics is
self-defeating. Those who commit
acts of violence should be dealt
with severely; they have no place
on this campus.
Disruption is different and
must be viewed in the context of
the particular situation. However,
disruptive activities provide an
excellent setting for the outbreak
of violence and, at any rate, deny
others the freedom to work and
study. Coercion in a university is
difficult to defend; it is
antithetical to rational discussion
and problem-solving. The
overwhelming majority of

students at Stanford oppose
disruptive and coercive tactics as
unacceptable behavior.
There are rules to deal with
violence and other forms of
coercion. These rules need to be
enforced. The SCLC should
clarify these rules, up-date them
and lend encouragement to their
enforcement.

The Student Conduct
Legislative Council has been
chartered to legislate regulations
regarding student conduct "that
may warrant disciplinary
sanctions." I believe that the
maturity Stanford students like to
ascribe to themselves would
virtually obviate the need for
"disciplinary sanctions" as an
inducement to civil behavior.

However, such a need apparently
remains; for this year has
witnessed numerous assaults upon
the proper liberties of individuals
and organizations within the
Stanford community.
Since the Fundamental
Standard no longer serves as a
practical guide to legitimate
conduct, the SCLC should
expeditiously act to clarify as
precisely as possible the actual
conduct that cannot be tolerated
on a free campus. The
pre-eminent standard of conduct
should be tolerance and respect
for the rights of others.
Violence and physical coercion
must be resolutely proscribed.
The right of every student to
receive the educational services he
has contracted for must in no way
be infringed. Freedom of
expression must be explicitly
protected. Full and active
recognition of the civil rights of
every person must be demanded
of every student.
In general, student conduct
should be as unregulated as is
consonant with reasonable
expectations of personal liberty
and academic harmony.
